FLANAGAN, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (DE 95, 107, 108, 115). The motions have been fully briefed, and the issues raised are ripe for ruling. For reasons noted, plaintiffs' motion is denied and defendants' and intervenor-defendants' motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action concerns the highway construction project designated in the administrative record as State Transportation Improvement Program Project No. B-2500 (\"B-2500 project\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The overall purpose the B-2500 project is to provide a reliable method of road transportation in North Carolina's outer banks through 2060 by replacing and improving a stretch of North Carolina Highway 12 (\"NC-12\") from the southern end of Bodie Island to the village of Rodanthe. The B-2500 project is segmented into phases. Phase I, wherein construction now is ongoing, involves construction of a new bridge to span Oregon Inlet-a short waterway that runs between Bodie and Hatteras Islands and connects the Pamlico Sound in the West with the Atlantic Ocean in the East. Phase I will serve to replace the aging Herbert C. Bonner Bridge (\"Bonner Bridge\"), which served as the only mode of crossing Oregon Inlet since that bridge opened in 1962.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In an earlier action brought prior to initiation of Phase I, intervenor-defendants Defenders of Wildlife and the National Wildlife Refuge Association (collectively, \"conservation groups\"), sued Eugene A. Conti, Jr., then-Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (\"NCDOT\"), and defendant NCDOT challenging a Record of Decision issued in 2010, (\"2010 Phase I ROD\"), which authorized construction of Phase I.\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife v. North Carolina Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179396\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/374/\">\n    762 F.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2014). That action was litigated at the trial level before the undersigned.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132530\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/510/\">\n    971 F.Supp.2d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.C. 2013). This court ruled in favor of the defendants on cross-motions for summary judgment. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. That action came to a close when, on April 11, 2015, the parties filed joint stipulation of dismissal, which action consummated settlement agreement executed by the parties (\"2015 settlement agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Phase II, which has been further subdivided in Phases IIa and IIb, involves building improvements to NC-12 in two areas of the outer banks that defendant NCDOT has designated as \"hot spots\" where natural erosion and overwash regularly damage NC-12 requiring maintenance and road closures. Phase IIa embraces improvements in the area between the southern\n   end of the Pea Island Wildlife Refuge's (\"Refuge\") South Pond and the northern end of the 2.1-mile section of NC-12 in the southern half of the Refuge that is not expected to be threatened by shoreline erosion prior to 2060. This area includes a breach caused by Hurricane Irene in August 2011 that temporarily opened an inlet between Pamlico Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, which inlet now is closed due to natural processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Phase IIb, which is the subject of this litigation, involves improvements to the area between the Emergency Ferry Dock in Rodanthe to approximately 1.8 miles north of the Refuge border. This area includes a breach in Rodanthe, also caused by Hurricane Irene, as well as the Rodanthe \"S Curves Hot Spot\" and two other areas identified in the 2008 Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"2008 FEIS\") as geologically susceptible to breaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 15, 2016, defendants NCDOT and James H. Trogdon, III (\"Trogdon\") (collectively, \"state defendants\") and defendant Federal Highway Administration (\"FHWA\") and John F. Sullivan, III (\"Sullivan\") (collectively, \"federal defendants\"), together with other interested agencies (collectively \"the Agencies\"), issued a Record of Decision (\"2016 Phase IIb ROD\"), which approved plans for Phase IIb. The 2016 Phase IIb ROD approves construction of a bridge that removes a section of NC-12 from the Refuge into the Pamlico Sound (\"jug-handle bridge\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this action February 2, 2017, challenging the 2016 Phase IIb ROD under the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act (\"Section 4(f)\"), the North Carolina Environmental Policy Act, and the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The conservation groups, formerly plaintiffs in the settled Phase I litigation, moved to intervene on March 3, 2017. This court granted that unopposed motion. Plaintiffs then amended their complaint as a matter of right on March 7, 2017, abandoning their claims under North Carolina law. At the same time, plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunction, which motion this court initially stayed, and recently denied without prejudice rather than maintain indefinite stay, as the parties agreed that no ground-disturbing activities were scheduled to commence until March 2018, and further extended in the current schedule to June 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Federal defendants lodged the administrative record July 7, 2017, which consists of the prior administrative record underlying Phase I and additional documents generated since that time. Plaintiffs moved to compel completion of the administrative record, or, in the alternative, to compel production of agreement negotiation materials pertinent to the 2015 settlement agreement so that plaintiffs might assert them as extra-record evidence. This court denied that motion October 20, 2017. Also on October 20, 2017, plaintiffs moved for leave to file a second amended complaint, seeking to add claims arising under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (\"Section 106\"). On October 26, 2017, the court granted plaintiffs' request to withdraw the October 20, 2017, motion to amend the complaint and to assert, instead, a revised motion to amend. On December 5, 2017, the court granted in part the revised motion to amend allowing amendments related to a possible haul route located in the Rodanthe Historic District, but denied the motion as it pertained to claims related to a shipwreck off Pappy Lane in the Phase IIb project area. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on January 10, 2018. Defendants and intervenor-defendants\n   cross-moved for summary judgment on February 21, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Save Our Sound OBX, Inc. (\"Save Our Sound\") is a non-profit corporation existing under the laws of North Carolina with its principal place of business in North Carolina. The individual plaintiffs are members of Save Our Sound. Each individual plaintiff claims non-economic injury arising from, among other things, regular use of the public lands, wetlands, and waters in and around the Refuge and the Rodanthe Historic District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant FHWA is a federal administrative agency within the United States Department of Transportation. Defendant Sullivan is administrator for the FHWA's North Carolina Division Office. FHWA administers various statutes pertaining to highway transportation, including statutes governing highway construction projects eligible for federal funding, projects involving construction over protected wildlife preserves, and environmental review of such projects pursuant to NEPA, Section 4(f), and Section 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant NCDOT is a North Carolina administrative agency with authority over highway construction within North Carolina. Defendant Trogdon is NCDOT's Secretary. NCDOT is the state transportation department with responsibility to submit to the Secretary of Transportation any project requiring the Secretary's approval. For purposes of NEPA, FHWA and NCDOT are joint lead agencies, which designation, under pertinent federal regulations, charges FHWA and NCDOT with responsibility to supervise preparation of any environmental impact statement required under NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Agencies approved construction of the jug-handle bridge without appropriate consideration of environmental consequences under NEPA, feasible alternatives under Section 4(f), and effects on historically significant property under Section 106. Plaintiffs seek judicial review pursuant to the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment January 10, 2018. In support, plaintiffs rely on the administrative record, declarations from each individual plaintiff, and an e-mail transmission written by counsel for state defendants John Batherson. Each defendant cross-moved for summary judgment February 21, 2018. In support of their motions, defendants rely also on the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The undisputed facts may be summarized as follows. NC-12 runs north-to-south along the outer banks of North Carolina and connects Bodie Island in the North with Rodanthe in the South, and continues along the Outer Banks. AR 58326.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The southern end of Bonner Bridge lies in the Refuge, which spans from the northern tip of Hatteras Island to Rodanthe.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132530\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Beginning in the early 1990s, FHWA and NCDOT began to study replacement projects for the aging\n   Bonner Bridge, as well as improvements to sections of NC-12, which is the only North-South roadway along portions of the outer banks. RD 2261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   FHWA and NCDOT formed a \"NEPA/Section 404 Merger Team,\" (\"Merger Team\") consisting of representatives from FHWA, NCDOT, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"USACE\"), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Park Service, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (\"NCDENR\")-Division of Water Quality, the NCDENR-Division of Coastal Management, and the NCDENR-Division of Marine Fisheries. RD 28988. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding executed by the members of the Merger Team, once a member indicates \"concurrence\" at a given point in the overall project, that member of the Merger Team must abide by decision subject to concurrence absent circumstances warranting reevaluation. RD 16644-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In September 2008, the 2008 FEIS issued, which document included a Final Section 4(f) Evaluation, AR 58795, addressed seven alternatives plans for improvements to NC-12, and identified the \"Parallel Bridge Corridor with Phased Approach/Rodanthe Bridge\" as the preferred alternative. AR 58280-81. The 2008 FEIS assessed a proposal termed the Road North/Bridge South alternative that included a bridge in Pamlico Sound near Rodanthe in the current Phase IIb area, although the alignment of that bridge was different than the jug-handle bridge now under review. AR 58277. Also among the alternatives selected for detailed study were proposals involving beach nourishment and beach nourishment combined with a bridge within the existing NC-12 easement. The 2008 FEIS's analysis pertaining to beach nourishment was conducted in light of shoreline erosion projections based on modeling completed in 2004. AR 58277-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In October 2009, a Revised Final Section 4(f) evaluation issued, AR 75239, which added an alternative titled the \"Parallel Bridge Corridor with NC-12 Transportation Management Plan.\" AR 75244. This alternative contemplates a phased approach to the overall B-2500 project with mixing and matching of components borrowed from other alternatives previously identified in the 2008 FEIS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132530\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In Phase I, the Bonner Bridge over Oregon Inlet would be replaced as soon as possible. The content of future phases was left to be determined \"based on actual conditions existing on Hatteras Island at the point in time that additional action becomes necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132530\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Following a May 2010 Environmental Assessment (\"2010 Phase I EA\"), AR 83394, the 2010 Phase I ROD issued in December 2010 approving construction of a replacement bridge over Oregon Inlet in conformity with the alternative identified in the Revised Final Section 4(f) Evaluation and the 2010 Phase I EA. AR 91952.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In August 2011, Hurricane Irene damaged NC-12 in the Rodanthe S Curves and within the Refuge approximately six miles south of Oregon Inlet, creating the Pea Island Inlet. RD 29249. In February 2013, an Environmental Assessment (\"2013 Phase IIa EA\") issued to account for these environmental changes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132530\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Incorporating information developed in the 2013 Phase IIa EA, a Record of Decision (\"Phase IIa ROD\") issued in October 2013 and approved plans to construct an alternative termed \"Bridge within Existing Easement,\" which would involve \"building a bridge in the existing NC 12 easement approximately 2.1 miles in length to replace the existing surface road and the temporary bridge over the Pea Island inlet.\" RD 10753.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As of issuance of the Phase IIa EA, improvements in the area around the Pea Island Inlet were designated \"Phase IIa,\" RD 29247, while improvements near northern Rodanthe were designated \"Phase IIb.\" RD 29248. The foregoing alternative for Phase IIa would have provided a long-term bridge over hot spots on Pea Island through 2060; however, it was not constructed for reasons described in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In December 2013, the Agencies issued an Environmental Assessment pertinent to the Phase IIb area in northern Rodanthe (\"2013 Phase IIb EA\"), which updated previous NEPA documentation. RD 17805. The 2013 Phase IIb EA addresses plans to implement long-term improvements to NC-12 along the S Curves and in areas near Rodanthe damaged by Hurricane Irene. RD 17823. The 2013 Phase IIb EA identified four alternatives consisting of (1) the \"Bridge on New Location [ (also, \"jug-handle bridge\") ]; (2) an \"easement bridge\" within the existing NC-12 easement (\"easement bridge\"); (3) beach nourishment; and (4) beach nourishment combined with a bridge within the existing easement. RD 17829. The latter two options were eliminated from detailed study at a Merger Team meeting held November 14, 2012. RD 17834. Thus, only the former options were assessed in the 2013 Phase IIb EA in detail, and the easement bridge was identified as the preferred alternative. RD 17849.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Neither the jug-handle bridge nor the easement bridge studied in the 2013 Phase IIb EA were entirely new alternatives. The jug-handle bridge assessed in the 2013 Phase IIb EA builds upon and incorporates changes to \"the Bridge South component of the Road North/Bridge South Alternative that was assessed in the 2010 [Phase I] EA.\" RD 11573. In turn, the Road North/Bridge South alternative discussed in the 2010 Phase I EA constitutes a modified and more detailed version of the Road North/Bridge South alternative studied in the 2008 FEIS. AR 83408-08 (\"Several modifications were made to the detailed study alternatives ... since the release of the [2008] FEIS ... These changes are: ... [m]odifications to the conceptual designs ... for the Road North/Bridge South [and other] alternatives.\"). Similarly, the easement bridge assessed in the 2013 Phase IIb EA incorporates \"refinements from the Phased Approach/Rodanthe Bridge Alternative assessed in the 2008 FEIS and 2010 EA.\" RD 11574. In this manner, both alternatives assessed in the 2013 Phase IIb EA incorporate analysis from earlier NEPA documentation and further develop the record pertinent to those alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following release of the 2013 Phase IIb EA, the Merger Team held a series of public meetings to \"obtain public input on long-term improvements to NC 12 ....\" RD 11789. The Merger Team accepted written comments. RD 11790. Following the comment period, NCDOT developed two new possible alignments for the Bridge on New Location Alternative designed to avoid areas of dense submerged aquatic vegetation in the southern half of the project area. RD 16946-47. Each alignment is described in the record as \"nearly identical\" to the alignment studied in the 2013 Phase IIb EA. RD 16947. These two new alignments are depicted below alongside the alignment identified in the 2013 Phase IIb EA and the original \"2010 Bridge South\" alignment identified in the 2008 FEIS:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   RD 23455.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At a February 2014 meeting, National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the proposed new alignment was preferable to the 2013 alignment, but requested more information regarding submerged aquatic vegetation. RD 16947. The proposed new alignments were presented at a March 6, 2014, Merger Team meeting. RD 14273. During that meeting, the Merger Team concurred that the jug-handle bridge and easement bridge would be evaluated further as possible alternatives for Phase IIb. RD 14278.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Also during 2014, defendants FHWA and NCDOT litigated the conservation groups' challenge to the 2010 Phase I ROD and related documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife v. N.C. Dep't. of Transp.\n   </em>\n   , 2:11-cv-35-FL (E.D.N.C.). The conservation groups objected to two key components of the B-2500 project. First, the conservation groups objected to segmentation of the B-2500 project into phases, contending that defendants should have undertaken to plan and analyze environmental effects of the entire B-2500 project prior to any construction activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132530\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/510/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132530\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/510/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Pls.' Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 67-77. Second, the conservation groups objected to defendants' reliance on a \"joint planning exception\" to Section 4(f), which defendants erroneously believed absolved them of their duty to analyze environmental effects of the B-2500 project on the Pea Island Refuge \"as a refuge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. Read as a whole, the conservation groups' complaint in that action discloses that the conservation groups primarily were concerned that the Agencies had failed to plan the B-2500 project, as a whole, in a manner that would minimize environmental effects on the Refuge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 (\"In other words, the Defendants opted to ignore the problem of what to do with NC-12 and segmented the Project in order to move forward with a replacement for Bonner Bridge.\"). That is, the central issue of the conservation groups' prior litigation was not the selected alternative to replace Bonner Bridge in Phase I; rather, it was the subsequent transportation management plan, which at that time did not account for environmental effects on the Refuge \"as a refuge\" that occupied the conservation groups' address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Fourth Circuit rejected the conservation groups' challenge to defendants' decision to plan the B-2500 project in phases.\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179396\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/374/\">\n    762 F.3d at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Fourth Circuit agreed with the conservation groups that no joint planning exception to the strictures of Section 4(f) was available.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179396\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/374/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179396\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/374/\">\n    at 401-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this manner, the conservation groups' litigation efforts may be characterized as successful in that the conservation groups established that the law required defendants to analyze environmental effects on the Refuge under the strict standards of Section 4(f) rather than under the more limited procedural rules of NEPA, thus requiring defendants to give significantly more weight to any environmental effects on the Refuge than the 2010 Phase I ROD contemplated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179396\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/374/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties to that action settled April 30, 2015. (DE 91-1). Under the terms of the 2015 settlement agreement, the conservation groups agreed to take dismissal of\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   , which result allowed defendants to begin construction of a replacement for Bonner Bridge. (DE 96-1 \u00b6 1.h). In exchange, defendants made two main concessions regarding later phases of the B-2500 project. First, defendants agreed to rescind the contract for Phase IIa, which, as noted, contemplated construction of a bridge, permanent through 2060, over the Pea Island Inlet and associated hot spots on Pea Island, and, instead, enter a contract to construct an interim bridge for the Phase IIa area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.a). The 2015 settlement agreement required that any interim solution for Phase IIa be designed to leave open possibility that NC-12 eventually will be moved outside the Refuge completely, with relevant sections relocated to a bridge in Pamlico Sound. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, the 2015 settlement agreement provided that NCDOT must identify the jug-handle bridge \"as its preferred alternative and seek Merger Team Concurrence ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.c). The agreement provided also that \"[n]othing in this Agreement requires or should be interpreted to predetermine the choice of the Phase IIb [jug-handle bridge] as the Selected Alternative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The 2015 settlement agreement further required that NCDENR, Division of Coastal Management \"provide a written statement of its support and preference\" and \"otherwise ... use best efforts to help NCDOT attempt to secure Merger Team concurrence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.e). In the event that the Merger Team reached concurrence and concluded that the jug-handle bridge is the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (\"LEDPA\"), the 2015 settlement agreement required defendants FHWA and NCDOT to \"promptly revise\" the 2013 Phase IIb EA and Section 4(f) Evaluation to identify the Bridge on New Location as the preferred alternative, and to \"[p]ropose to identify the Phase IIb ... Alternative as the 'least overall harm' alternative[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.c.i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On June 17, 2015, the Merger Team identified the 2014B Bridge on New Location as the LEDPA. RD 16982. On May 24, 2016, FHWA and NCDOT issued the 2016 Revised Phase IIb EA, which document provided updates regarding any changed environmental circumstances occurring since issuance of the 2013 Phase IIb EA. RD 28978. The 2016 Revised Phase IIb EA addressed the same alternatives as the 2013 Phase IIb EA, and included also discussion of the two additional alignments for the Bridge on New Location alternative introduced following the 2013 Phase IIb EA comment period. RD 28983-86. On December 15, 2016, FHWA, with the Merger Team's concurrence, issued the 2016 Phase IIb ROD approving the Bridge on New Location 2014B alignment as the selected alternative.

The Agencies offered seven reasons for decision to reject commenters' suggestions that beach nourishment warranted reconsideration, consisting of: (1) nourishment would not adequately protect NC-12 from potential future breaches/inlets; (2) regular nourishment would not ensure that a severe storm would not break down a part of the dune causing overwash to cover NC-12 with sand or damage it; (3) nourishment would not allow natural island processes to occur in the Refuge; (4) a long-term nourishment plan is not likely to be found compatible with Refuge's mission; (5) high erosion may require importation of more sand than is available; (6) emergency nourishment accomplished in 2014 was premised upon\n   nourishment as a temporary solution to an isolated problem, and, thus, analysis pertinent to that project is irrelevant to reasonableness of nourishment as a long term solution; and (7) nourishment is too costly. RD 29205-08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs advance specific challenge to two of the foregoing rationales for rejecting beach nourishment alternatives. First, plaintiffs dispute the Agencies' conclusion that insufficient sand is available to meet the needs of nourishment alternatives on grounds that the emergency beach nourishment project in 2014 revealed a previously unknown source of sand and that updated erosion projections demonstrate that less sand is needed to accomplish beach nourishment through 2060 than originally thought. Second, plaintiffs contend that, when estimating costs of beach nourishment, the Agencies' failure to discount future costs to present value was arbitrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs' challenges fail from the outset because they do not embrace all the reasons that the Agencies' deemed beach nourishment inadequate to meet the needs of the B-2500 project. That is, where one of the stated purposes of the B-2500 project is to provide a transportation solution that minimizes NC-12 closures and associated losses due to shoreline erosion, overwash, and breaches and inlets, RD 28976, where nourishment options leave NC-12 subject to breaching and overwash resulting in road closures, RD 29140, the Agencies did not act arbitrarily in holding nourishment options inadequate relative to the goals of the B-2500 project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Agency action must be upheld under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A) where the agency demonstrates a rational connection between the facts found and choice made.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As a separate and independent basis, the Agencies eliminated beach nourishment options on the ground that where they interfere with natural erosion in the Pea Island, such options are unlikely to be consistent with the purposes of the Refuge.

First, plaintiffs argue that minutes for a December 15, 2011 meeting where beach nourishment was discussed indicate that uncertainties regarding sand sources and shoreline-erosion projections were the main reasons for eliminating nourishment options. (RD 2888). However, this argument is inapposite where the 2016 Phase IIb ROD is the\n   document that embodies the Agencies' decision, and, as such, it is the reasoning set forth in that document that is subject to review under \u00a7 704 of the APA (judicial review available for \"final agency action\"). Where, as described above, the 2016 Phase IIb ROD identifies independently sufficient reasons for elimination of beach nourishment other than uncertainties regarding sand suitability and erosion projections, plaintiffs' contrary argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Second, plaintiffs argue that changes in shoreline erosion projections undermine the Agencies' conclusion that the easement bridge and jug-handle bridge alternatives protect NC-12 from breaches while nourishment options do not. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that \"[g]iven that the projected rate of erosion has been significantly reduced, RD 23478; RD 11576; RD 23459, it stands to reason that the S Curves vulnerability to breaches and inlets has been reduced.\" (DE 120 at 40-41). Although plaintiffs provide support in the administrative record for the proposition that updated shoreline erosion projections predict less erosion, plaintiffs' provide no support for any inference that susceptibility to breaching is a function of erosion rates. Indeed, the Agencies note expressly that storms, not gradual erosion, often cause breaches. RD 29140. Therefore, plaintiffs' arguments that breaches might be less likely under updated erosion projections do not find support in the administrative record. Thus, the Agencies did not act arbitrarily in reaching conclusion that a bridge over or around areas subject to breaching meets the needs of the B-2500 project while nourishment options do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Third, plaintiffs object to the Agencies' conclusion that nourishment would not allow natural island processes to occur and, thus, likely is incompatible with the Refuge's purposes. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the Agencies' apparent preference to promote \"natural processes\" fails to distinguish any alternative where any artificial bridge or road requires an unnatural use of land. However, this argument fails where the record discloses that the Agencies' reference to \"natural processes,\" in this context, means \"natural erosion\" and related processes, which beach nourishment would bring to halt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 58726-27 (discussing environmental benefits of allowing natural processes to occur in 2208 FEIS); RD 29140. Plaintiffs are correct that any artificial structure may be characterized as an \"unnatural\" use of land under a broad definition of that term. However, there is a distinction of workable clarity between building a bridge that allows geological processes to unfold around it and actively importing large quantities of sand to stop all erosion, such that the latter meaningfully may be deemed prohibitive of natural processes where the former need not be so deemed. Accordingly, the Agencies' decision to apply this distinction and eliminate beach nourishment options in an effort to allow natural processes to occur was not arbitrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Relatedly, plaintiffs argue that where the Agencies' decision to eliminate beach nourishment rests on assessment that nourishment options are \"likely\" to be found inconsistent with the purposes of the Refuge, the Agencies failed to take the required \"hard look\" at nourishment options. In context, however, the Agencies assessment that beach nourishment options are \"likely\" to be found inconsistent with the Refuge's purposes simply constitutes acknowledgment that any construction in the Refuge requires a permit from USFWS, and, as part of that permitting process USFWS must make a determination that the B-2500 project would \"fulfill ... the specific purposes for which [the Refuge] was established.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 668dd.

Plaintiffs contend the terms of the 2015 settlement agreement and the Agencies' subsequent conduct indicates that the Agencies abandoned their duty to weigh environmental effects of alternatives under consideration after signing the agreement and, instead, designated the jug-handle bridge as the LEDPA because they were bound by the 2015 settlement agreement to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   These arguments fail, first, because, under Fourth Circuit precedent, the evidence of predetermination \"consists of the environmental analysis itself[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Nat. Audubon Soc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/#p198\">\n    422 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   198 ;\n   <em>\n    Forest Guardians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698784\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/692/\">\n    611 F.3d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing disagreement with Fourth Circuit approach to predetermination claims), and, as noted, the administrative record at issue here supports the 2016 Phase IIb ROD; thus, no inference of predetermination is available. Second, key text of the 2015 settlement agreement is conditional in nature, and therefore, contemplates that the Agencies might both comply with the terms of settlement and still reject the jug-handle bridge. In particular, the text of the 2015 settlement agreement states, \"\n   <em>\n    [i]f\n   </em>\n   the Phase IIb Bridge on New Location Alternative is determined to be the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative (\"LEDPA\") and becomes the Selected Alternative, Plaintiffs covenant not to sue ... as to any claim based on ... the NEPA and Section 4(f) documents issued for the Phase IIb Bridge on New Location Alternative, or any permit, approval or any other decision regarding the Phase IIb Bridge on New Location\n   Alternative.\" (DE 95-1 at \u00b6 2.c (emphasis added) ). Accordingly, the 2015 settlement agreement contemplates that if the jug-handle bridge is not designated as the LEDPA, the conservation groups reserve their rights to challenge the Phase IIb decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698784\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/692/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Third, the facts of\n   <em>\n    National Audubon Society\n   </em>\n   indicate that it is a physical commitment of resources that implicates predetermination concerns. In that case, the Fourth Circuit expressed approval of preliminary activities during preparation of an EIS because none of the activities \"include[d] cutting even a single blade of grass in preparation for construction\" of the project.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/#p198\">\n    422 F.3d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, where, as here, agencies engage in mere planning and preparation in absence of groundbreaking activities, no irreparable and irretrievable commitment of resources has occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/#p198\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Fourth, plaintiffs contend that the structure of Merger Team decision-making procedures demonstrates that the court should view the Agencies' unanimous concurrence that the jug-handle bridge is the LEDPA as a consequence of predetermination. Specifically, plaintiffs note that the Merger Team agreement provides that where the Agencies are unable to reach concurrence on a given point, the matter is decided by majority vote of a subset of the Agencies, consisting of defendant NCDOT, defendant FHWA, NCDENR, and USACE. RD 18093. Plaintiffs contend that where three out of four members of this dispute resolution board are parties to the 2015 settlement agreement any vote against the jug-handle bridge would have been futile, thus, unanimous concurrence that the jug-handle bridge was the LEDPA was essentially preordained. However, plaintiffs' conclusion does not follow from the premises. Rather, an equally plausible interpretation of a Merger Team member's incentives is that, where apprised that its vote cannot affect a decision nor otherwise impede the B-2500 project, such agency may as well vote its conscience, perhaps in hopes that its dissent will persuade this court. Accordingly, absence of any dissent to selection of the jug-handle bridge does not, as plaintiffs contend, establish that any decision was predetermined. Plaintiffs' claims on this basis fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, this court is not at liberty to approve selection of an alternative that does not comply with NEPA and Section 4(f),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coal. for Responsible Reg'l. Dev. v. Brinegar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1122121\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/518/522/#p525\">\n    518 F.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (4th Cir. 1975) (Section 4(f) property \"may not be put to non-park uses unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the non-park use of the land.\"), and no settlement agreement or other contract could supercede the statutory requirement that the Agencies select the true LEDPA. U.S. Const. Art. VI \u00a7 2 ( [T]he Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land ...\"). Therefore, it is unreasonable to read the 2015 settlement agreement as requiring the Agencies to designate the jug-handle bridge as LEDPA even if subsequent environmental analysis precludes that designation, because such a deal would be unenforceable as preempted by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1122121\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/518/522/#p525\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, it is more reasonable to interpret the 2015 settlement agreement as securing assurances from the Agencies that they would pursue in good faith selection of the jug-handle bridge, to the extent the law allows it, by identifying the jug-handle bridge as the preferred alternative and seeking Merger Team concurrence, without prejudice to possibility that the evidence might reveal a different LEDPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 91-1 \u00b6 1.c). That conduct does not constitute unlawful predetermination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs' challenges to the 2016 Phase IIb ROD fail. The Agencies adequately considered impacts of the construction\n   process, effects on the Refuge, and socio-economic effects. Moreover, the Agencies did not eliminate beach nourishment options prematurely, nor was the 2016 Phase IIb ROD unlawfully predetermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For reasons noted, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, (DE 95), is DENIED, and defendants' and intervenor-defendants' motions for summary judgment, (DE 107, 108, 115), are GRANTED. The clerk is DIRECTED to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   SO ORDERED, this the 4th day of June, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    In memorandum opinion setting forth reasons for earlier denial of [defendants'] motion to dismiss, the court previously referred to the B-2500 project as the \"Bonner Bridge replacement project.\" (DE 66). Replacement of Bonner Bridge was one of the main goals for the B-2500 project and, in numerous instances, the parties and the administrative record refer to the entirety of the B-2500 project as the Bonner Bridge replacement project. (\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    , RD 1111). Nonetheless, where the issues presented in this matter relate, primarily, to construction that would follow replacement of Bonner Bridge, the court finds its more appropriate to refer to the \"B-2500 project\" henceforth.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Where the B-2500 project is segmented into phases, the administrative record for Phase IIb adds to the administrative record created for phase I.

Documents included specifically for purposes of environmental review of Phase IIb bear bates stamps beginning with \"RD,\" and the parties cite those documents with reference to \"RD\" bates stamps. For ease of reference, the court follows the parties' citation convention in this regard. Documents bearing \"AR\" bates stamps are housed in CM/ECF at 2:12-mc-00001-FL.

On this basis, plaintiffs conclude that analysis of the jug-handle bridge does not link to any bridge studied in the 2008 FEIS and that the jug-handle bridge was never considered in an EIS, as NEPA requires. However, this argument fails where the text of the 2010 EA links alternatives studies therein to alternatives studied in the 2008 FEIS.
