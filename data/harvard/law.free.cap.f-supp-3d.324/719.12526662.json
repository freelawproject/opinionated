In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered a due process vagueness challenge to the portion of \u00a7 924(e) defining a violent felony as a crime that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" (the \"ACCA residual clause\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under this framework, courts were required \"to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in the ordinary case, and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining that the ACCA residual clause was unconstitutionally vague, the Court specifically described problems generated by four aspects of this inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, the Court observed that the ACCA residual clause \"leaves grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\" because \"assessing 'potential risk' seemingly requires the judge to imagine how the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently plays out\" but the statute provides no guidance on how to determine what the \"ordinary case\" of a given crime includes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As examples, the Court explained that it is unclear whether the ordinary case of witness tampering involves offering a witness a bribe or threatening a witness with violence or whether the ordinary case of attempted burglary involves a would-be burglar\n   being confronted by a police officer, security guard, or homeowner or simply a homeowner \"yelling 'Who's there?' from his window, and the burglar's running away.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court further explained that the statute provided no guidance on how to determine which of various potential alternatives represents the ordinary case: \"A statistical analysis of the state reporter? A survey? Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the Court observed that the ACCA residual clause left \"uncertainty about how much risk it takes\" for this ill-defined \"ordinary case\" of a crime \"to qualify as a violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The indeterminacy of this risk threshold was heightened by the provision's structure, which \"force[d] courts to interpret 'serious potential risk' in light of the four enumerated crimes-burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives,\" which themselves are \"far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, the Court observed that the ACCA residual clause did not limit the inquiry to risks posed by even the stylized ordinary defendant's conduct in the commission of the offense but instead forced courts to consider how the aftermath of the ordinary offense might play out. As the Court explained, \"the inclusion of burglary and extortion among the enumerated offenses preceding the residual clause confirms that the court's task also goes beyond evaluating the chances that the physical acts that make up the crime will injure someone\" because the risk of injury in such cases \"arises because the extortionist might engage in violence after making his demand or because the burglar might confront a resident in the home after breaking and entering.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This lack of a nexus requirement or temporal limitation only heightened the uncertainty involved in evaluating the risks posed by any given offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Lastly, the Court surveyed previous decisions attempting to apply the ACCA residual clause and found that the Supreme Court's \"repeated attempts and repeated failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause confirm its hopeless indeterminacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, in each of the three cases where the Supreme Court had \"concentrated on the level of risk posed by the crime in question,\" the Court had \"found it necessary to resort to a different ad hoc test to guide [its] inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These tests included asking whether the risk posed by the crime in question was \"comparable\" to the risk posed by the closest analog among the enumerated offenses, using a statistical report prepared by the Sentencing Commission to analyze the level of risk posed by the crime in question, and relying on a combination of \"common sense\" and statistical evidence to assess the degree of risk posed by the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the fourth Supreme Court case applying the residual clause, the Court had taken \"an entirely different approach,\" asking whether the crime in question resembled the enumerated offenses \"in kind,\" rather than in \"degree[,] of risk posed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, looking beyond its own cases, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the ACCA residual clause had created \"numerous splits among the lower federal courts\" both about \"whether the residual clause covers this or that crime\" and about \"the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to conduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to consider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Taking these factors together, the Supreme Court concluded that the ACCA residual clause was unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the wake of this decision, the lower federal courts began to split over whether the nearly identical residual clauses in \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 924(c), both of which shared some-but not all-of the features of the ACCA residual clause at issue in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , were also unconstitutionally vague. In\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court resolved this split with respect to \u00a7 16, holding that \u00a7 16(b)\"suffers from the same constitutional defect\" identified in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In particular, the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   Court read\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as relying on two specific features of the ACCA residual clause to find it unconstitutionally vague: \" 'By combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause' violates the guarantees of due process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2558 ). According to the Court, \u00a7 16(b)\"has the same two features ..., combined in the same constitutionally problematic way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1213. First, as with the ACCA residual clause, \u00a7 16(b) calls for an ordinary-case analysis and, because the \"ordinary case\" of a given crime remains an \"inscrutable thing,\" \u00a7 16(b) does not provide a clear way to measure the risk posed by a given crime. Second, as with the ACCA residual clause, \u00a7 16(b) employs an uncertain risk threshold (\"substantial risk\") that, when applied to \"an idealized ordinary case of the crime[,]... ceases to work in a way consistent with due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1215-16 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   Court held that \u00a7 16(b) was unconstitutionally vague, and, armed with these two decisions, Royer now contends that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), which is worded almost identically to \u00a7 16(b), is also unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The government argues that consideration of the Motion to Vacate is barred by a variety of procedural obstacles, and also fails on the merits because \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) should be reinterpreted in accordance with principles of constitutional avoidance rather than struck down. Lastly, it argues that under its interpretation of \u00a7 924(c), Royer's predicate offense remains a crime of violence, and therefore his Motion to Vacate should be dismissed. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Timeliness Under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n      28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (f)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The government first argues that the Motion to Vacate is untimely. In general, for a motion under \u00a7 2255 to be timely, it must be filed within one year of the date that the movant's conviction became final; however, \"courts will consider a [ \u00a7 2255 ] motion timely if (1) [the movant] relies on a right recognized by the Supreme Court after his judgment became final, (2) he files a motion within one year from 'the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,' \" and (3) the right has been made retroactively applicable.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because there is no question that movant's motion was filed more than one year after Royer's conviction became final, the motion is timely only if he is asserting a right that has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. According to the government, the motion is untimely under this provision because it is based on a \"right regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\" that has not yet been recognized by the Supreme Court. This argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit recently explored the question of what it means for\n   a \u00a7 2255 motion to rely on a right recognized by the Supreme Court. There, the movant argued that his sentence, which was imposed pursuant to the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, was unconstitutional because the relevant guideline range had been enhanced by Brown's designation as a career offender under a provision similar to the ACCA residual clause that was invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .

Moreover, the government observes that\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   did not hold that language like that in \u00a7 16(b) and \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) requires a categorical approach rather than a conduct-specific approach and argues that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is distinguishable from \u00a7 16(b) because, as is discussed below, \"the government now contends that the better reading of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is under a conduct-specific\" approach. Gov't Mem. 8.

Unlike Brown's \u00a7 2255 motion, Royer's motion relies on a simple application of the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   to the nearly identical provision in \u00a7 924(c), which the Fourth Circuit has traditionally interpreted in tandem with \u00a7 16(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325250\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/225/\">\n    825 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 n.3 (4th Cir. 2016) (\"We note, however, that the language of \u00a7 16(b) is identical to that in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), and we have previously treated precedent respecting one as controlling analysis of the other.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, when\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   was decided, the Fourth Circuit interpreted\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as a \"narrow\" decision that applied only to the context of the ACCA and not to other residual clauses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/#p301\">\n    868 F.3d at 302-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Royer asserts that the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c), under which he was convicted, is unconstitutionally vague because it includes both an ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk threshold. Accordingly, the Motion to Vacate asserts a right under\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   and is timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Furthermore, contrary to what the government appears to argue, the Motion to Vacate is not rendered untimely merely because the government has a reasonable argument that, as a matter of constitutional avoidance, \u00a7 924(c) should be reinterpreted to dispense with the ordinary-case requirement\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the motion should be denied on the merits.

In such a situation, the\n   <em>\n    Bousley\n   </em>\n   rule serves an important purpose by ensuring\n   that a defendant who is innocent of the lesser charge but guilty of the more serious charge does not receive an unearned windfall, particularly where the statute of limitations may have run out on the more serious charge in the interim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In this case, the\n   <em>\n    Bousley\n   </em>\n   rule does not require Royer to show that he is also innocent of the various charges in the superseding indictment that were dismissed. The \u00a7 924(c) conviction which Royer is currently challenging covers only the relatively narrow conduct of aiding and abetting various co-defendants' using and discharging firearms at the LET camps by helping those co-defendants gain entry to the camps. By contrast, the charges in the superseding indictment which were dismissed and which the government contends are more serious than the \u00a7 924(c) charge involve conspiracies to levy war against the United States, contribute material support to LET and al-Qaeda, and provide support to the Taliban, all of which involve significantly more broad-ranging conduct than the relatively narrow \u00a7 924(c) offense.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, unlike the situations that the Fourth Circuit described in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , the \u00a7 924(c) charge is not a lesser-included offense of the charges that were dismissed and, instead, the dismissed charges involved substantially more conduct than the \u00a7 924(c) charge to which Royer pleaded guilty. Therefore, the \u00a7 924(c) charge and the dismissed charges are not so interrelated as to trigger application of the\n   <em>\n    Bousley\n   </em>\n   rule, which means that Royer has shown that he is actually innocent with respect to the narrow criminal conduct underlying the \u00a7 924(c) conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In addition, it is not at all obvious that the \u00a7 924(c) charge is less serious than the charges that were dismissed, particularly given the other charge to which Royer pleaded guilty. Both the \u00a7 924(c) charge and the \u00a7 844(h) charge carried mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years, which had to run consecutively to each other, and the \u00a7 924(c) charge carried a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. By contrast, the four charges which the government contends were more serious charges each carried a statutory maximum sentence of either fifteen or twenty years imprisonment, and none of the charges carried a statutory mandatory minimum sentence or a requirement that the sentence imposed run consecutively to any other sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2339A, 2339B, 2384 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201705\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, by pleading guilty to violations of \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 844(h), Royer was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, whereas each of the individual charges which the government contends were more serious would have exposed Royer to between zero and twenty years imprisonment. Although the government may be correct that the sentencing guideline range for these convictions would have been in excess of twenty years, the Court would not have been required to impose such lengthy sentences. Therefore, if Royer is actually innocent of the \u00a7 924(c) charge, it would be fundamentally unfair to refuse to vacate his sentence on that charge, even if he is not innocent of the other charges in the superseding indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Even if Royer were not claiming actual innocence, any procedural default would still be excused based on the cause-and-prejudice prong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cause for default is established when \"a constitutional claim is so novel that its legal basis [wa]s not reasonably available to counsel\" at the time of the default.\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

For the reasons discussed in this Memorandum Opinion, the predicate offense underlying Royer's \u00a7 924(c) conviction is not a crime of violence either under the force clause or under the conduct-specific approach to the residual clause that constitutional avoidance principles require the Court to adopt, therefore any procedural default is excused because he has clearly shown prejudice and has met both the actual innocence and the cause-and-prejudice prongs of the test described in\n   <em>\n    Fugit\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Analysis Under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government next argues that Royer's \u00a7 924(c) conviction should not be vacated because the predicate crime-conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States-qualifies as a crime of violence under the force clause, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), the constitutionality of which is not called into question by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   . Under the force clause, any felony offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\" is a \"crime of violence.\" According to the government, Royer's predicate offense falls under this clause because \"[o]ne definition of 'threaten' is 'to give signs or warning of,' or 'to portend,' \" and when two or more people engage in and when two or more people engage in a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, \"that agreement, without more, 'portends' the use of force, because the existence of the conspiracy makes the occurrence of the conspiracy's object far more likely.\" Gov't Mem. 16.

The government's argument that a violation of each statute necessarily involves the \"threatened\" use of force because such a conspiracy \"portends\" the future use of force by making such a use \"more likely\" does not alter this straightforward analysis for three reasons.

The claimed predicate offense here clearly does not have as an element any such \"threatened use\" of force. Second, the government's interpretation of \"threaten\" raises its own constitutional problems. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , one of the predominant features of the ACCA residual clause that gave rise to its unconstitutional indeterminacy was that it did not limit the risk-of-force analysis to the conduct surrounding the elements of the crime but instead required courts to \"imagine\" how a stylized version \"of the crime subsequently plays out.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government's proposed definition of \"threaten\" falls into the same trap, asking the Court to determine whether a violation of the predicate offense necessarily leads to a sequence of events that \"portends\" the use of force at some indeterminate point in the future. As\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   made clear, the Court must reject such an invitation. Third, even if the government's definitions of \"threaten\" and \"portend\" were correct, the inchoate nature of the conspiracy offenses at issue here would still not necessarily \"portend\" the use of force by the defendant. Because no more than an agreement to engage in the relevant conduct and the commission of a single overt act is required to establish a violation of the predicate offense, even if the defendant does not pursue the agreement any further, it is possible for a defendant to commit the predicate offense without in any way \"portending\" the future use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, it is clear that \u00a7 371, the claimed predicate offense, involved in this case does not have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A), and therefore it does not qualify as a crime of violence under the force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Analysis Under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As previously discussed, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), the residual clause, defines as a crime of violence any \"offense that is a felony\" and \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" This language has previously been interpreted by both the Fourth Circuit and other courts to require an \"ordinary-case\" categorical approach, where the relevant question is whether the \"ordinary case\" of the predicate crime committed by the defendant (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the \"ordinary\" bank robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ) \"by its\n   nature\" involves a \"substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In this case, there are, as discussed above, serious constitutional problems with \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) if the ordinary-case approach is used to determine whether the predicate offense qualifies as a crime of violence. Accordingly, this Court's task is not to determine whether \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is better read to incorporate the ordinary-case approach or the conduct-specific approach. Instead, the Court must determine whether it is \"fairly possible\" to construe \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as implementing the conduct-specific approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Turning to the text of the residual clause, this provision defines a \"crime of violence\" as any \"offense that is a felony\" and \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" Based on this definition, the critical word to interpret is \"offense,\" and where the government and movant disagree is about whether the word \"offense\" can fairly be read to refer to the specific criminal act committed by a defendant rather than to the generic crime for which he was convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has already provided at least a preliminary answer to this debate. According to the Court, \"in ordinary speech words such as 'crime,' 'felony,' 'offense,' and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime, say, the crime of fraud or theft in general, and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion, say,\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   fraud that the defendant planned and executed last month.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan v.

This conclusion is especially appropriate considering the significant difference between a statute like \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), which criminalizes specific conduct, and statutes such as the ACCA residual clause and \u00a7 16(b) as incorporated into the INA, which determine the impact of previous convictions (many of which may involve state law) on later, separate proceedings such as federal sentencing proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and removal proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   .

Fourteen years after he pled guilty, and based on his actual conduct, Royer cannot deny his guilt under Section 924(c).\" Gov't Mem. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Having reviewed the record, the Court disagrees. Based on the information in the Statement of Facts, Kwon's, Hasan's, Aatique's, and Khan's \u00a7 371 violation involved the four men traveling to the LET camps in Pakistan and, while there, discharging various firearms in military training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 128;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275632\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/789/\">\n    309 F.Supp.2d at 810-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no suggestion in Royer's Statement of Facts, nor was any evidence introduced at Khan's trial, to indicate that any of these co-conspirators traveled to the front lines or engaged in active fire. Although these co-defendants' actions occurred at the periphery of violent actions undertaken by others, including other co-conspirators and LET members, none of the actions involved either one of these four men actually using force or a substantial risk that any of these four men would use force. Accordingly, the Court finds that Kwon's, Hasan's, Aatique's, and Khan's \u00a7 371 violation does not constitute a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), which means that Royer may not be held liable for aiding and abetting their commission of a \u00a7 924(c) violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Facial Vagueness Challenge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Next, the government argues that Royer may not bring a facial challenge to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) because \"[o]utside of the First Amendment context, a person 'who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.' \" Gov't Mem. 28-29 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Holder v.

As such, the government argues that Royer cannot challenge \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as void for vagueness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Whatever merit the government's argument may have in other contexts,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   foreclose its application here for two reasons. First, in both cases, the Supreme Court did not engage in any discussion of whether Johnson's or Dimaya's specific underlying offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   fell within the\n   \"core\" of the statute but instead allowed Johnson and Dimaya to bring their facial constitutional challenges without any regard to the relationship between their specific offenses and the residual clause in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Supreme Court has at least implicitly rejected the idea that only individuals whose underlying offenses are not at the \"core\" of the residual clause may bring a facial vagueness challenge to the statute. Second, in both cases, the Supreme Court did not interpret the residual clause in question narrowly to allow it to apply constitutionally to a \"core\" group of offenses. Instead, the Court held that the entire residual clause is void for vagueness and, therefore, is wholly unenforceable. This categorical holding suggests that, at least with respect to statutes that share the problematic features of the residual clauses in \u00a7 16(b) and \u00a7 924(e), the appropriate mode of analysis focuses on the vagueness of the statute as a whole rather than on whether any specific offense clearly falls within its ambit. Because the Court must analyze the clause as a whole and Royer was convicted under \u00a7 924(c), he has standing to bring his constitutional challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Lastly, even if the government were correct that Royer would only have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the residual clause if his conduct fell outside of the \"core\" of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), Royer's motion could still proceed. As was discussed above, the specific conduct related to the predicate offense underlying Royer's \u00a7 924(c) conviction did not involve \"a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in committing the offense,\" which means that this actual conduct was not within the\n   \"core\" group of conduct encompassed by the statute and Royer may challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Mootness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Lastly, the government argues, without citation to any authority, that Royer's motion is moot \"because he is out of prison on supervised release, and his supervised release would not change even if Section 924(c)(3) were determined to be unconstitutionally vague.\" Gov't Mem. 29-30. This argument is unpersuasive. First, Royer's release from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons does not itself make him ineligible to bring a motion under \u00a7 2255. A \u00a7 2255 motion is available to any \"prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States\" and the Fourth Circuit has squarely held that a \"prisoner on supervised release is considered to be 'in custody' for purposes of a \u00a7 2255 motion.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pregent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11569863\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/190/279/#p283\">\n    190 F.3d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283 (4th Cir. 1999). Second, although Royer's two terms of supervised release run concurrently with each other, he still has a sufficient stake in the vacatur of his \u00a7 924(c) conviction such that his \u00a7 2255 motion is not moot. Specifically, \"[f]elony convictions carry a myriad of collateral consequences,\" including \"the possibility that a future sentence will be enhanced based on the challenged conviction, the possibility of using the conviction for future impeachment, and societal stigma,\" as well as the imposition of \"a mandatory special assessment which constituted additional punishment that would not have been imposed absent a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , 814 F.3d at 181 n. 1. Accordingly, \"[b]ecause an erroneous conviction and accompanying sentence, even a concurrent sentence, can have significant collateral consequences,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Royer's concurrent term of supervised release on Count 2, which he is not challenging, does not moot his \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   III.

The plain language of this provision requires the Court to determine both whether the Supreme Court case in question \"initially recognized\" a right and also whether the movant \"assert[s]\" this right. The government's argument improperly mixes these two inquiries because the premise refers to the first inquiry and the conclusion to the second. Although the\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    framework is appropriately applied to determine whether a particular case \"newly\" recognizes a given right or merely applies a right that was recognized in an earlier case, it is not the appropriate test for determining whether a given \u00a7 2255 motion is asserting a particular right. To put this in concrete terms, the\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    framework would be used to determine whether\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    recognizes a new right (if the government had argued that it does not).

This case is slightly different from the cases envisioned by the government and the Fourth Circuit, because Royer did not plead guilty to a substantive \u00a7 924(c) offense but instead pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the commission of a \u00a7 924(c) offense that was substantively committed by co-defendants Khan, Kwon, Aatique, and Hasan. Accordingly, to determine whether Royer's conviction for aiding and abetting his co-defendants' \u00a7 924(c) violation can pass muster under the conduct-specific approach, the Court must determine whether his co-defendants engaged in a substantive violation of \u00a7 924(c). Therefore, under the conduct-specific approach, the Court's task is to examine the co-defendants' conduct in committing a violation of \u00a7 371 to determine whether this conduct presented a substantial risk that force would be used against the person or property of another.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Both decisions merely mention the underlying offense in passing.

Similarly, Justice Gorsuch observed in\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    that it is unclear whether \"a conviction for witness tampering ordinarily involve[s] a threat to the kneecaps or just the promise of a bribe\" or whether \"a conviction for kidnapping ordinarily involve[s] throwing someone into a car trunk or a noncustodial parent picking up a child from daycare.\"\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1232\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). As these examples demonstrate, even if the government were correct that a defendant whose predicate offense falls within the \"core\" of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) should not be able to bring a facial challenge to the residual clause, it is not at all obvious whether any particular offense falls within this claimed \"core.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The government also contends that Royer's \"sweeping vagueness challenge makes especially little sense in\" this case because he pleaded guilty \"and thus admitted at his change-of-plea hearing that he understood the charges against him.\" Gov't Mem. 29. This argument is unpersuasive because when movant's claim is properly understood as a facial attack on \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) rather than an attack only on the statute's application to his circumstances, this argument has no force. Moreover, barring Royer's challenge on this basis would conflict with the Supreme Court's recent residual clause jurisprudence, where the Court has granted relief even to individuals who pleaded guilty and did not claim at the time that they did not understand the residual clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Welch v.
