Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Count VIII) and; that the entity Defendants' corporate veils should be pierced and each of the Defendants should be viewed as alter egos of one another (Count IX). Prior to the Plaintiff filing this action, Ky\u00e4ni, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a lawsuit against the Plaintiff in Idaho state court (the \"Idaho Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants move to dismiss or stay this action pursuant to the prior pending action doctrine, for lack of personal jurisdiction, or failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons outlined below, I find that the prior pending action doctrine applies and stay the case pending the resolution of the Idaho Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants sell nutritional products to distributors, who then sell those supplements to others. On June 3, 2008, Defendants entered into a service contract with Qutab (the \"2008 Contract\"). The 2008 Contract required Qutab to assist in the development of and promote Defendants products. It did not contain a covenant not to compete and allowed either party to terminate the contract with or without cause with ninety days' notice to the other party. In February 2017, Qutab began to operate his own website, drqwellness.com and commented about Defendants products, represented himself as formulating them, and invited his Facebook \"friends\" to visit, many of whom were also distributors and customers of Defendants. In May 2017, Defendants requested that Qutab cease his business and stop associating Defendants with drqwellness.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Qutab states that he and Defendants reached a new agreement in August 2017 (the \"August Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the August\n   Agreement Qutab was prohibited from selling certain products but permitted to sell his own products and comment on any products, including Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2017, Defendants agreed to terminate Qutab without cause triggering the requirement for Defendants to make him three payments of $25,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In October 2017, Defendants made one payment of $25,000 (the \"October Payment\") to Qutab. No further payments have been made. Qutab asserts that Defendants failed to comply with their obligations by failing to pay him after terminating him without cause, not permitting Qutab to sell his own line of products, and for wrongly asserting that Qutab breached any contract. Defendants argue that Qutab was terminated with cause and that the October Payment was given merely as a means to attempt to smooth out the parties' relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 26, 2017, Qutab sent a demand letter (the \"Demand Letter\") to Defendants alleging breach of contract and a request for relief. On November 17, 2017, Defendants filed the complaint against Qutab in the Idaho Action and filed an amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") on December 19, 2017. The next day, Defendants' lawyer sent Qutab's lawyer a copy of the complaint but, Qutab was not served with the Amended Complaint until December 28, 2017. That same day, Qutab filed the complaint in this action (the \"Complaint\") in Massachusetts state court and the Defendants were served on January 5, 2018. Defendants then removed the case to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defendants now move to dismiss this action under the prior pending action doctrine, lack of personal jurisdiction, and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court only reached the first inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Prior Pending Action Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The prior pending action doctrine may properly be applied where there is a pending \"prior action, in a court of competent jurisdiction, between the same parties, predicated on the same cause of action and growing out of the same transaction, and in which identical relief is sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Quality One Wireless, LLC v.

It is Qutab's assertion that the Demand Letter, which was sent to Defendants prior to filing the Idaho Action, initiated this suit. Although the Demand Letter alleges breach of contract with a demand and prayer for relief, Qutab does not cite, and this Court has not found, any caselaw to suggest that a demand letter constitutes the commencement of an action for purposes of this doctrine. Qutab filed the Complaint on December, 28, 2017, the same day he was served with notice of the Idaho Action. Therefore, it is clear that the Idaho Action was filed first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. R. Civ. P. 3 (a civil complaint is commenced upon the complaint being submitted to the court).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, the parties are not identical but \"share sufficient congruence of interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Quality One Wireless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340122\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/37/536/#p540\">\n    37 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   541 (citing\n   <em>\n    Whitten Ranch, Inc. v.

Neb. June 18, 2009) (finding \"congruent, if not identical\" interests of an individual and company owned by him satisfied doctrinal requirement) ). The only difference between the parties in the two suits is that in addition to Qutab and Ky\u00e4ni, Inc., the only parties in the Idaho Action, Qutab has included Ky\u00e4ni International, LLC, Ky\u00e4ni Global, LLC, and five individual directors and/or officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Qutab concedes that, \"for purposes of this action\", the Ky\u00e4ni entities \"will be deemed the same corporation\". (Doc. No. 1-1; p. 3, \u00b6 18). Furthermore, all of the Defendants are represented by the same counsel in this action, the same counsel who represents Ky\u00e4ni, Inc., in the Idaho Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quality One Wireless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340122\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/37/536/#p540\">\n    37 F.Supp.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (although the parties were not identical, they shared congruent interests which was \"further evidenced by their sharing of the same counsel\"). Therefore, the two actions involve identical parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The allegations set forth in the Complaint \"arise out of the same transactions\" as the Amended Complaint in the Idaho Action.\n   <em>\n    Quality One Wireless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340122\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/37/536/#p540\">\n    37 F.Supp.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the parties dispute certain facts, and the claims are not identical, they all arise out of the 2008 Contract and the termination of Qutab and Defendants' business relationship. A determination of the disputed facts will involve the same evidence, such as the parties' respective performance and obligations under the 2008 Contract and any purported modifications to said contract, and will be dispositive of the issues in both actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3839739\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/472/239/#p243\">\n    472 F.Supp.2d at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (although \"the underlying theories of liability and damages may be distinct, a substantial portion of the evidence will necessarily\n   overlap.\"). Furthermore, the parties seek damages and a determination of their respective rights and obligations increasing the concern for inconsistent judgments based on contract interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To the extent that Qutab argues that the Chapter 93A cannot be heard in Idaho state court, I disagree. At least one other state court has settled such disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark and Lavey Benefits Solutions v. Educ. Dev. Ctr.,\n   </em>\n   N.H. Super.

Additionally, federal courts outside this district have also litigated these Massachusetts state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Supreme Auto Transport LLC v.
