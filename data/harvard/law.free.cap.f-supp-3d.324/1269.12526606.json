STORY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At its core, this case presents the following question: when a client retains an attorney but later becomes dissatisfied with the quality or cost of the attorney's work, is the client, nevertheless, obligated to pay the attorney's fees and costs?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff Meunier Carlin &amp; Curfman, LLC (\"Meunier\"), a law firm,\n   seeks to recover unpaid costs and fees, as well as other damages associated with the legal services it provided to a former client, Defendant Scidera, Inc. (\"Scidera\"). The case comes before the Court, now, on Meunier's Motion for Summary Judgment [65] and Scidera's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [66]. After reviewing the record, the Court enters the following Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Some time in the fall of 2011, Scidera retained Meunier to manage its patent portfolios and the patent portfolios of its related entities. (Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Pl.'s SOF\"), Dkt. [65-2] \u00b6 4.) To memorialize their relationship, Meunier sent an engagement letter to Scidera, and the two exchanged drafts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Under the terms of the engagement letter, Meunier would bill Scidera for work performed at specified hourly rates. (Ex. E, Pl.'s SOF (\"Engagement Letter\"), Dkt. [65-8] at 5.) Scidera would also reimburse Meunier for costs associated with the representation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Meunier would not, however, bill for travel time unless the attorney was actively working on something else for Scidera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Scidera remained Meunier's client until at least 2015, and during that time Meunier represented Scidera and its related entities in various intellectual property matters. (Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-2] \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.) This included two federal lawsuits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Those suits arose from accusations of patent infringement by a competing company called Mars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) The Parties learned of Mars's allegations in the fall of 2011, and on October 13, 2011, Meunier sent Scidera a memorandum laying out a litigation strategy and estimating its cost to be between $1,182,00 and $2,042,00.17. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14; Ex. G, Pl.'s SOF (\"2011 Memo\"), Dkt. [65-10].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mars filed the first lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia, then Meunier filed the second in California. (Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-2] \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Meunier performed work for Scidera in both matters, taking direction from several Scidera executives, including its CEO, Chris Paxos, CFO, Myron Cybyk, and Scidera's intellectual property manager, Dan Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-23.) Eventually-and despite Scidera's opposition-the California case was transferred to Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During discovery in the Virginia case, the judge ordered Scidera to produce a sizeable number of documents within a short period of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Complying with that order called for additional help, so Meunier began looking for a litigation services company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26; Dep. of Myron Cybyk (\"Scidera Dep.\"), Dkt. [33] at 57-58.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scidera told Meunier that its budget was $20,000, (Def.'s Statement of Additional Material Facts that Present a Genuine Issue for Trial (\"Def.'s Suppl. SOF\"), Dkt. [75-5] \u00b6 4; Scidera Dep., Dkt. [33] at 59-62, 64), but Meunier was unable to find a vendor willing to do the work for that price, (Ex. I, Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-12] ). Meunier, therefore, retained the most affordable option, Document Technologies, LLC (\"DTI\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-1] \u00b6 26.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DTI performed the work and sent\n   its bill to Meunier. Scidera, however, refused to pay for DTI's services. (Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-1] \u00b6 29; Def.'s Suppl. SOF, Dkt. [75-5] \u00b6\u00b6 3-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the Virginia case was ongoing, Meunier sent invoices to Scidera for the work performed and expenses paid. (Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-1] \u00b6 30.) On April 24, 2012, after receiving the invoices, Scidera raised concerns over the growing cost of the litigation and the efficiency with which Meunier was handling it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34; Def.'s Suppl. SOF, Dkt. [75-5] \u00b6 17.) Just over a week later, Meunier responded with a lengthy email explaining the various complexities that had arisen in the case, which Meunier had not anticipated in its initial estimate. (Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-1] \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2012, the Virginia case settled when Mars agreed to purchase the portfolio at issue from Scidera. (Scidera Dep., Dkt. [33] at 54-56; Aff. of Stephen M. Schaetzel (\"Schaetzel Aff.\"), Dkt. [65-4] \u00b6 14.) After that, Scidera paid some of Meunier's invoices, but by October 2013, many were still outstanding. (Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-1] \u00b6 41.) So Meunier sent Scidera a formal demand letter; Scidera, however, did not respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) Yet, Scidera remained Meunier's client and continued to make payments until 2015, when the Parties' relationship ended. (Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def.'s SOF\"), Dkt. [66-2] \u00b6 18.) To date, the outstanding fees amount to $876,871.07.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-1] \u00b6 41.) Meunier filed this action to recover those fees on a breach of contract and open account theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, DTI brought lawsuit against Meunier to collect on its unpaid invoices, which Scidera settled for $95,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Meunier seeks to recover that amount from Scidera as well, along with the costs Meunier incurred defending that lawsuit, under a theory of contribution and indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meunier has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on each of the claims asserted in the Amended Complaint, with the exception of its claim for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit (Count III), which was pled in the alternative. Scidera, too, moves for summary judgment on Meunier's claim for attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

That is because Scidera challenges the admissibility of several documents relied on by Meunier in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment. Specifically, Scidera argues that the invoices and accounting records reflecting Meunier's costs and fees are inadmissible hearsay, as are several emails exchanged between the parties; thus, Scidera argues, the Court should discount them in ruling on Meunier's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The general rule is that inadmissible hearsay cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Macuba v.

Those records are supported by Schaeztel's affidavit. As a principal of the firm, Schaeztel is a \"custodian or [ ]other qualified witness,\" competent to lay the foundation for the business records.

Emails\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court likewise finds that the emails produced by Meunier are properly considered at this stage of the litigation. Scidera takes particular issue with an email sent from Schaetzel about the cost of retaining DTI. While it is true that this email, in its current form, would be inadmissible hearsay, it could easily be \"reduced to admissible evidence at trial or reduced to an admissible form,\" say, by \"hav[ing] the hearsay declarant testify directly to the matter at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The Court sees no reason why Schaetzel would be unable to testify directly about his discussions with DTI and the price estimate that he relayed to Scidera. In fact, Schaetzel has already submitted a sworn statement in this case. Consequently, the Court may consider the email in ruling on Meunier's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Meunier moves for summary judgment on four of its claims: (1) breach of contract; (2) open account; (3) indemnity; and (4) attorney's fees and costs.

Of course, this also requires, as a threshold matter, the existence of a valid contract.

Meunier, in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, argues that the parties entered into an agreement for Meunier to perform legal services on behalf of Scidera and relies on the draft engagement letter sent to Scidera in 2011 for this position. According to Meunier, that letter lays out the material terms of the Parties' agreement: that Meunier would bill Scidera for the work it performed at hourly rates, which Scidera would pay along with additional expenses. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The undisputed evidence shows that Meunier entered into a valid and enforceable contract with Scidera. In the engagement letter, Meunier agreed to provide legal services in exchange for payment at specified, hourly rates. (Engagement Letter, Dkt. [65-8] at 5.) Scidera paid Meunier a retainer and paid its legal fees for years. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [76] \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9, 32.) When Meunier assumed representation of Scidera in the California and Virginia cases, Meunier sent Scidera a memo estimating the costs of litigating those cases-a practice consistent with and required by the terms of the engagement letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2011 Memo, Dkt. [65-10]; Engagement Letter, Dkt. [65-8] at 4.) It is also undisputed that Scidera paid for some of Meunier's services in the California and Virginia cases and that Scidera directed many of the actions Meunier took. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [76] \u00b6\u00b6 10, 16-23, 32.) By 2012, both of the cases were resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) And Scidera remained Meunier's client until at least 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Mutual assent is, therefore, apparent from the face of the engagement letter and Scidera's payment of fees under its terms, along with Scidera's active role in the California and Virginia cases and continued relationship with Meunier thereafter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner Broad.

But in doing so, Scidera inappropriately relies on subjective, after-the-fact assessments of the Parties dealings and Meunier's handling of the litigation matters. For example, Scidera argues that although it expected to pay for Meunier's services, it did not specifically agree to give Meunier the unfettered ability to rack up legal fees that Scidera was required to pay \"no matter how inadequately, ineffectively, and inefficiently [Meunier] performed.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s MSJ (\"Def.'s Resp.\"), Dkt. [75] at 6.) Scidera goes on to say that Scidera \"performed work that was never budgeted or authorized, and which in any event was not performed adequately effectively, and efficiently.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Thus, Scidera concludes, the Parties must not have reached a \"meeting of the minds\" on essential terms such as price and the scope of work to be performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A contract, however, is not invalidated merely because the parties start to disagree about the interpretation of contract language.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox Broad.

Yet that is precisely what Scidera seeks to do here. As described above, the Parties' conduct makes clear that an agreement was reached for Meunier to perform legal services on behalf of Scidera. Although Scidera may-and, indeed, does-take issue with some of the fees that Meunier charged, that does not render the agreement invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weinberg, Wheeler, Hudgins, Gunn &amp; Dial, LLC v.

This presumption remains with the attorney until the presumption is rebutted by expert legal testimony; otherwise, the grant of a summary judgment in favor of\n   the attorney is proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Schluter v.

In\n   <em>\n    Schluter\n   </em>\n   , for example, the defendant testified that three meetings appearing in the invoices did not take place and, in fact, for two of them, he was out of town. Id. at 546. The defendant also testified that he was billed for time by someone whom he never authorized to work on the matter, and so summary judgment was improper as to those charges. Id. But unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Schulter\n   </em>\n   , Scidera has not presented any evidence, whatsoever, challenging the correctness of Meunier's invoices. Scidera, instead, attempts to cast doubt on the invoices by claiming that they lack sufficient detail and that a number of entries appear to be duplicative or inaccurate. These arguments, however, are not evidence. Scidera has not provided any testimony or documentation showing that the work in question was never performed or was accomplished in less time than Meunier billed. Scidera has also not alleged that Meunier's work was wholly without value or undeserving of payment. Nor could it given that Scidera clearly benefitted from Meunier's efforts, which not only contributed to the resolution of the Virginia case, but also helped Scidera obtain a substantial cash settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At the same time, the engagement letter is clear that Meunier would not bill Scidera for travel time. (Engagement Letter, Dkt. [65-8] at 5.) Yet, in at least one instance cited by Scidera, it appears that Meunier billed for someone's time to travel to and from Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp., Dkt. [75] at 7 n.1 (citing Ex. N, Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-17] at 194-95).) Because the contract does not authorize Meunier to charge Scidera for travel time, Meunier is not entitled to recover any such charges at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is important to emphasize, however, that neither these unauthorized entries nor Scidera's displeasure with some of the other work means, as Scidera suggests, that a valid agreement does not exist. There is no evidence that the Parties ever agreed that acceptance of Meunier's work would be conditioned upon Scidera's satisfaction\n   with its cost and quality. Indeed, although couched as an argument on mutual assent, it seems that what Scidera is actually attempting to say is that certain inadequacies and flaws in Meunier's work and billing amount to a breach of contract. Even so construed, the evidence falls well short of this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The undisputed evidence shows that, on one occasion, Scidera expressed concern over the efficiency of Meunier's work in light of growing costs approaching the initial estimate. (Ex. J, Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-13];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [65-10] at 2-3.) Other than that, the record is devoid of any complaints by Scidera as to the appropriateness of Meunier's fees during the approximately four years that the two maintained a professional relationship. If Scidera was unsatisfied with Meunier's work on the Virginia case it could have terminated the agreement or instructed Meunier to discontinue its work. Instead, Scidera acquiesced and continued to work with Meunier until the case was resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that, based on the undisputed evidence, the Parties had a valid and enforceable contract for Meunier to provide legal services at the rates set forth in the engagement letter. Scidera has failed to show, through any competent evidence, that those services were unnecessary to the resolution of the Virginia case or that the hours expended by Meunier were unreasonable or the rates charged excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

Scidera is, thus, contractually obligated to pay Meunier's fees for that work, with the exception of time billed for travel, which was specifically excluded from the agreement. Having failed to present any justifiable reason for failing to pay the amount owed, Scidera's refusal to do so amounts to a breach of contract. Accordingly, Meunier's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to its breach of contract claim, except for any invoiced time for travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Meunier argues it is entitled to summary judgment on its open account claim because Scidera, in filing its Answer, failed to comply with the technical pleading requirements set out in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-10-112.

Admittedly, Scidera's Answer does neither. But, Scidera argues, it did not have to. According to Scidera, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-10-112's heightened pleading requirements do not apply in this case because they directly conflict with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"When a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, ... the court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule, and can refuse to do so only if\" it is unconstitutional or found to modify, enlarge, or abridge any substantive rights under the Rules Enabling Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Hanna v.

Hence, Meunier was Scidera's agent, and thus had authority to bind Scidera. According to Meunier, this \"authority may be considered plenary unless limited by [Scidera] and that limitation [was] communicated to [DTI].\" (Pl.'s Reply, Dkt. [77] at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lytle v. King's Constr.

Ga. July 30, 2015) ). The Court disagrees. Although Meunier accurately cites the law in Georgia, this particular legal doctrine is inapplicable to the case at hand. To the Court's knowledge, that law has only been applied in lawsuits brought by third-parties. That is to say, the rule is that absent knowledge of express restrictions on an attorney's authority, a third party may deal with the attorney as if dealing with the client, and if the client fails to perform, the\n   <em>\n    third-party\n   </em>\n   may sue him directly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lytle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012856450\">\n    2015 WL 12856450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Brumbelow v.

This case, by contrast, was brought by an agent (Meunier) to recover for an action taken on behalf of its principal (Scidera). As a result, the requirement that any limitation on Meunier's authority must have been communicated to DTI is inapplicable. Instead, the decisive question is whether Scidera told\n   <em>\n    Meunier\n   </em>\n   that its authority was limited in some way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Concerning the retention of DTI, there is a genuine question as to whether that happened. Specifically, Scidera acknowledges that the court in the Virginia case ordered Scidera to produce a large amount of documents, which necessitated the hiring of a litigation services company. (Scidera Dep., Dkt. [33] at 57-58.) Scidera has also offered testimony that it told Meunier its budget was $20,000-in other words, that Meunier was only authorized to retain a litigation services company at a cost of $20,000 or less. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-62, 64; Cybyk Decl., Dkt. [75-2] \u00b6 10; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s SOF, Dkt. [76] \u00b6 27). It is undisputed, however, that DTI demanded a price of $43,515; yet Meunier retained DTI anyway. (Ex. 10, Cybyk Dep., Dkt. [33-11].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thus, there is a question of fact as to whether Meunier was acting within its authority\n   when it hired DTI.
