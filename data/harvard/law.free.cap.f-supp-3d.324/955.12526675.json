INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently pending before the court are motions by both parties. The first is the motion of Defendant Facebook, Inc. (\"Defendant\" or \"Facebook\") to dismiss ( Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 4 ) the complaint of Plaintiff Nicholas Georgalis (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Georgalis\") (Compl., ECF No. 1 ). Plaintiff opposed the motion and moved for final judgment (Opp'n Mot. Dismiss/Mot. Final Judgment, ECF No. 8 ). Defendant filed a reply in support of the motion to dismiss, (Reply Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 9 ), and Plaintiff filed a sur-reply (Sur-reply Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 10 ). Defendant opposed Plaintiff's Motion for Final Judgment (Opp'n Mot. Final Judgment, ECF No. 11 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint, and a motion for leave to further amend the complaint (Mots. Leave to Amend, ECF Nos. 12 and 13, respectively). Defendant filed a combined opposition to Plaintiff's motions for leave to amend (Opp'n Mots. Leave to Amend, ECF No. 14 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is granted. Plaintiff's Motions for Leave to Amend and for Final Judgment are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on February 1, 2018, alleging that he is a Facebook user and Defendant is an Interactive Computer Service Provider (\"ICSP\") (Compl. at 3.) According to the Complaint, Defendant allegedly deleted comments posted by Plaintiff on Facebook and his \"likes\" of other's Facebook posts and, therefore, is liable for abrogating his rights to free speech and other \"inalienable right[s]\" in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Plaintiff also claims that 47 U.S.C.\u00a7 230(c)(2)(A), which shields ICSPs from liability for restricting material that the ICSP considers to be, among other things, obscene, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable (whether or not such material is constitutionally\n   protected), is unconstitutional (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Plaintiff characterizes his suit as undertaken \"in a court of law and not a court of equity\" and proclaims himself a \"sovereign precursor\" and the \"prosecutor/plaintiff\" in this action (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff also describes this action as a criminal matter (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 1-2, 8). Plaintiff claims that Defendant is a publicly held corporation doing business in every state in the United States and, therefore, is subject to the jurisdiction of this court (Compl. at 2). In his prayer for relief, Plaintiff seeks (among other remedies) $1 billion in punitive damages, a declaration that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A) is unconstitutional, and an order that Defendant cease and desist its restriction on speech and restore all deleted comments (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss is brought pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6). Plaintiff's motions to amend the Complaint are brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Citing\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   , the court in\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ruled that plaintiff's allegations regarding Facebook's contacts with Ohio were insufficient to establish general jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203873761\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, Plaintiff similarly alleges that Facebook reaches every state and has millions of users in Ohio, but does not allege that Defendant has any traditional indicia of conducting business in the State of Ohio that are sufficient to support general jurisdiction. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   , Facebook's ubiquitous presence and numerous Ohio users, alone, do not constitute sufficient contacts with the State of Ohio to support the court's exercise of general jurisdiction. See also\n   <em>\n    Ralls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271248\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/1237/\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The court further notes that personal jurisdiction over Facebook may not exist simply because a user avails himself of Facebook's services in a state other than the states in which Facebook is incorporated\n   and has its principal place of business.\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In opposing Defendant's motion, Plaintiff cites no authority to the contrary. Plaintiff has not carried his burden to establish this court's general jurisdiction over Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nor does Plaintiff allege specific suit-related conduct with reasonable particularity that supports an exercise of specific jurisdiction over Defendant. Plaintiff argues (but has not pleaded) that Defendant sells advertising services and those services direct certain (local) advertising to Ohio users, but that argument is insufficient to establish specific jurisdiction even if it were alleged in the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 7-8.) Plaintiff's claim is that by deleting content from his Facebook account, Defendant stole his property and violated his constitutional rights. Those claims are unrelated to and do not arise from Defendant's claimed sale of targeted marketing to Ohio residents and, therefore, do not support the court's exercise of specific jurisdiction over Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Means\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355710\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/643/#p649\">\n    836 F.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's broad allegation that Defendant deleted content posted by a Facebook user who happens to reside in Ohio also fails to establish with reasonable particularity any specific conduct (or deleted content) by Defendant that would support an exercise of specific jurisdiction in Ohio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203873761\">\n    2017 WL 3873761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (the complaint does not establish specific facts such as specific conduct by defendant or specific trade secrets that would support an exercise of specific jurisdiction in this trade secret case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For all of these reasons, Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden to establish that this court has general or specific jurisdiction over Defendant, and the due process component of personal jurisdiction over Defendant in Ohio is not satisfied. The court, therefore, need not determine whether Defendant is subject to jurisdiction under Ohio's long-arm statute. Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendant, the court need not address Defendant's Rule 12(b)(6) motion, or Plaintiff's request that the court declare that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is unconstitutional on the grounds that judicial enforcement of that law by dismissing a First Amendment suit against Facebook for deleting user posts violates the First Amendment's prohibition against laws restricting freedom of speech, press, and religion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Motions for Final Judgment and to Amend the Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because the Court has determined that it lacks jurisdiction over Defendant, Plaintiff's motion for Final Judgement in his favor (ECF No. 10 ) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's motions to amend his complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, even where Rule 15 requires leave of court in order to amend a pleading, leave is generally freely given when justice so requires. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2). A motion for leave to amend, however, may be denied on futility grounds if the amended complaint could not withstand a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Midkiff v. Adams Cty.

But based upon the content of the motions, Plaintiff's proposed amendments relate to the merits of his claims against Defendant-not to the issue of personal jurisdiction-and allowing\n   Plaintiff to amend the complaint would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's motions to amend (ECF Nos. 12 and 13) are denied on the grounds of futility because the amended Complaint would not survive Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is granted.
