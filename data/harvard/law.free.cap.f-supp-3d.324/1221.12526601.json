The City revised the ordinance on November 7, 2017. The revised ordinance\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   prohibits standing, sitting or staying on any portion of a median located within a street or highway open for use by vehicular traffic if the posted speed limit for such street or highway is forty miles per hour or greater.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs contend the revised ordinance violates their free speech rights and those of third parties under the First Amendment. They also claim the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to give fair warning of what is prohibited,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   invalidly deprives them of liberty and, as applied, denies plaintiffs who panhandle the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth\n   Amendment. Plaintiffs seek both a declaration that the ordinance on its face and as applied to them and third parties violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and an injunction to keep the ordinance from being enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment, which should be granted if the \"movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P.56(a). Having considered the motions and supporting documentation, the court concludes plaintiffs' motion should be denied and defendants' motion should be granted as to plaintiffs' void for vagueness claims and their equal protection claims. Material questions of fact on several issues preclude the entry of summary judgment in either plaintiffs' or defendants' favor on the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are various individuals who reside in Oklahoma City, a minority political party in Oklahoma and an independent news outlet based in Oklahoma City. They allege they have long engaged in diverse expressive activities on public medians in the metropolitan area ranging from political campaigning and panhandling to news reporting. Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit initially challenging an ordinance the Oklahoma City Council enacted in 2015. Plaintiff contended the ordinance \"criminalize[d] 'standing, sitting, or staying' on 'any portion of a median' within city limits virtually 'for any purpose' other than to cross it.\" First Amended Complaint, Doc. # 15, \u00b6 1. The City revised the ordinance in 2017, but plaintiffs maintain the revised version is still unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The revised ordinance provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00a7 32-458.-Standing, sitting, or staying on streets, highways, or certain medians.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (11) Based on findings (a)(1) through (a)(10) above, the City Council wishes to enact this section to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   i. Limit as much as possible the number of individuals sitting, standing or staying in streets or highways that are open for use by motor vehicles; and to further\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ii.

This Ordinance is not intended to impermissibly limit an individual's right to exercise free speech. Rather it seeks to impose a regulation that is narrowly tailored to protect pedestrians and drivers alike by imposing a specific place and manner restrictions for certain places where substantial threats of grievous bodily injury or death exist due to vehicular traffic traveling at high speeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (c) Except as permitted by Subsection (e) of this section, no individual shall stand, sit, or stay for any purpose in any portion of a street or highway open for use by vehicular traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (d) Except as permitted by Subsection (e) of this section, no individual shall stand,\n   sit, or stay for any purpose on any portion of a median located within a street or highway open for use by vehicular traffic if the posted speed limit for such street or highway is 40 mph or greater; provided, if no speed limit is posted for such street or highway, then for the purpose of applying the restrictions imposed by this subsection, the speed limit of such street or highway shall be presumed to be 25 miles per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (e) Subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) Individuals using a crosswalk or safety zone to cross from one side of the street or highway to another;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Government law enforcement officers, other government employees, or government contractors or their employees or subcontractors who are present in the street or highway or on the median for the purpose of acting within the scope of governmental authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) Individuals conducting legally authorized construction or maintenance work, or other legally authorized work, in or on the street, highway, or median; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) Individuals responding to any emergency situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (f) Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed $100.00.

Many underlie legal decisions the court will have to make, which include determining the type of fora where the First Amendment expression was occurring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fact disputes also exist with respect to plaintiffs' claim that the median ban deprives them of the \" 'liberty' protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

According to plaintiffs it is unclear what constitutes an emergency under the exception-whether it would \"appl[y] to a candidate campaigning in an unexpectedly close election, an activist protesting an unforeseen event, a panhandler soliciting to pay for unexpected medical expenses, a reporter covering a breaking news event, or a jogger responding to an unanticipated text, call, cramp, or untied shoelace.\" Doc. #106, p. 49. However, a straightforward reading of the ordinance-specifically what is prohibited-in conjunction with the exemption for emergencies demonstrates its purpose and the scope of the exemption. The City is banning people from using certain medians for any purpose other than crossing, unless something out of the ordinary happens, an urgent event that requires them to react. \"Emergency\" commonly means \"[a] serious situation or occurrence that happens unexpectedly and demands immediate action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   American Heritage Dictionary 583 (5th ed. 2011). The statute is not vague because it fails to provide specific examples of emergencies because the term has a well-known, accepted definition.

See Doc. # 114, p. 9. However, they do not quote the entire definition or note that those definitions do not apply \"where the context clearly indicates a different meaning.\" Okla. City Mun. Code ch.32, art. I, \u00a7 32-1 (2018). The code defines \"emergency\" as \"an unforeseeable occurrence of temporary duration causing or resulting in an abnormal increase in traffic volume, cessation or stoppage of traffic movement, or creation of conditions hazardous to normal traffic movement, including fire, storm, accident, riot, or spontaneous assembly of large numbers of pedestrians in such a manner as to impede the flow of traffic.\" \u00a7 32-1(22). The definition pertains to emergencies that impede or affect the flow of traffic. It would not cover emergency situations involving pedestrians on medians, an example of which would be a person injured in an automobile accident who sit or stays on the median until the ambulance arrives. Therefore, it is apparent that the code's definition does not apply to the term \"emergency\" when it is used in Ordinance 25,777.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In their response to defendants' motion for summary judgment plaintiffs also essentially assert that the ordinance lacks sufficient standards to enable officers to determine if individuals fall within one of the ordinance's other exemptions-if they are merely using the median to cross the street or highway or are legally authorized to work there. Neither exemption confers unfettered discretion. The distinction between sitting or staying on a median versus merely remaining there long enough to cross a street or highway should be readily apparent to both the ordinary citizen and patrolling officer. And those persons authorized to conduct work on city medians should have and carry with them proper identification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Judgment on these claims will be entered when the action is concluded with respect to all claim and parties.

They assert the ordinance would not affect him because the roads on the marathon route are closed during the race. Plaintiffs disagree for two reasons. First, they contend some of the streets on the route remain partly open to traffic. Second, they assert that even if the adjacent street is not open for use by vehicles, the ordinance, as written, does not exempt someone from the median ban if the speed on the street is 40 mph or greater unless one of the exemptions in section (e) applies. Therefore, they contend plaintiff Schindler could violate the ban while running the marathon. Plaintiffs have misread section (d), which states that \"no individual shall stand ... on any portion of a median located within a street or highway\n    <em>\n     open for use\n    </em>\n    by vehicular traffic....\" Doc. # 98-27, p. 4 (emphasis added). While the court is skeptical that the ordinance would be applied to plaintiff Schindler during the race, plaintiffs are technically correct that the ordinance might apply because not all streets are entirely closed. For that reason, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on his First Amendment claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
