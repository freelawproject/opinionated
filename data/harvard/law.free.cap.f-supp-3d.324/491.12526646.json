This Opinion addresses two separate but partially overlapping motions: Defendant National Express, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim and Defendants Michael Berardi (\"Mr. Berardi\") and Cheryl Berardi (\"Mrs. Berardi\") (collectively the \"Berardi Defendants\")'s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, Improper Venue, and Failure to State a Claim. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant both motions. The Court will dismiss the claims against Defendants without prejudice and with leave to amend. The Court will dismiss Mrs. Berardi as a party defendant for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The following facts come from Plaintiffs' April 29, 2016 Second Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 25, 2005,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C948%2C527\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,948,527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '527 patent\") entitled \"Pressure-Actuated Linearly Retractable and Extendible Hose\" was issued to Gary Dean Ragner and Robert Daniel deRochemont, Jr. On June 23, 2009,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C549%2C448\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,549,448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '448 patent\") entitled \"Linearly Retractable Pressure Hose\" was issued to Ragner. Ragner Technology is the owner and assignee of all rights to the '527 and '448 patents, subject only to exclusive licenses granted to Tristar Products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In May 2011, Ragner Technology was introduced to Greg Janson, who appeared to be interested in investing in Ragner Technology or bringing Ragner Technology to the attention of potential investors. Janson was hired as a broker to recruit investors for Ragner Technology's patented products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Janson informed Defendants that Ragner Technology was seeking to meet with investors. Janson scheduled a meeting between Ragner Technology and Defendants for August 23, 2011. On August 23, 2011, Ragner, deRochemont, and Margaret Combs, CEO of Ragner Technology, arrived in Jupiter, Florida for the scheduled meeting. At that time, they learned they were at the home of the Berardi Defendants. Also at the meeting was Edward Kelly, CEO of Defendant National Express. Janson and Vince Simonelli, a business broker, were also present at the meeting. The Berardi Defendants were introduced as Kelly's producers for his television commercials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the start of the meeting, Ragner Technology made clear it was seeking investors and not licensing opportunities. Prior to disclosing any confidential information, Combs informed the Berardi Defendants and Kelly that non-disclosure agreements had not been prepared because they had been unaware of whom they were meeting with. Nonetheless, Combs insisted on a non-disclosure agreement before commencing the meeting. The Berardi Defendants and Kelly verbally agreed to terms of confidentiality and non-disclosure for the meeting. They also agreed to execute written non-disclosure agreements to be sent by Combs following the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the oral agreement, Ragner Technology \"disclosed information relating to\n   Ragner Technology, the scope of its patents, product specifications, and target market of the Microhose product.\" They further disclosed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   specific engineering diagrams, ideas, materials of manufacture, including but not limited to, prior iterations of prototype hoses and prototype hoses constructed of more than one layer, more than one material, at least one fabric layer, various materials of manufacture including but not limited to, vinyl, nylon, rubber, polyester, and/or polypropylene, at least one layer with cord reinforcement including a hose wherein the biasing was performed by elastic material such as polymers made of thermoplastic polyurethane to provide retracting force, manufacture know-how, concepts, etc. related to its prototypes of the Microhose product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ragner Technology also demonstrated one of the patented prototypes of the Microhose product. Mr. Berardi was able to use one of the patented prototypes and saw it expand and retract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the meeting, National Express articulated its interest in licensing the patented technology and an intent for the product to be manufactured in Taiwan. Ragner Technology reiterated its request was solely for investors, but also conveyed its hesitancy to use a foreign manufacturer. After reassuring Ragner Technology of the capabilities of its foreign manufacturing contact, Kelly requested permission to contact the foreign manufacturer to address its ability to manufacture the product using the patented technology, subject to the terms of the non-disclosure agreement. Ragner Technology agreed to that limited disclosure. Kelly indicated he would contact the manufacturer as discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The morning following the meeting, August 24, 2011, Combs prepared the non-disclosure agreements, all dated August 23, 2011. The non-disclosure agreements were never executed by Defendants. Ragner Technology was similarly never contacted regarding Kelly's communications with the manufacturer in Taiwan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A little over two months later, on November 4, 2011, Mr. Berardi filed a patent application entitled \"Expandable and contractible hose,\" which Plaintiffs allege \"claim[ed] novel features of the prototypes of the Microhose product demonstrated by Ragner Technology at the August 23, 2011 meeting.\" Mr. Berardi obtained\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C291%2C941\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,291,941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '941 patent\"), entitled \"Expandable and contractible hose,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C291%2C942\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,291,942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '942 patent\") entitled \"Expandable hose assembly,\" and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C479%2C776\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,479,776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '776 patent\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Blue Gentian, LLC is the owner of all the rights in the '941, '942, and '776 patents. Mr. Berardi is a managing member of Blue Gentian. Blue Gentian, in turn, granted National Express the exclusive right under the '941, '942, and '776 patents to market and sell the expandable hose product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on May 30, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which was set before the Honorable William\n   P. Dimitrouleas, U.S.D.J. On June 11, 2015, the Southern District of Florida granted Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and granted leave to file an amended complaint. This Order was followed by a First Amended Complaint on June 25, 2015. This matter was then transferred, sua sponte, from the Southern District of Florida to the District of New Jersey on October 28, 2015. This case was originally assigned to the Honorable Kevin McNulty, U.S.D.J. before being reassigned to the undersigned on December 2, 2016 because of the pendency of related matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' April 29, 2016 Second Amended Complaint brings three counts against Defendants: conspiracy to monopolize (in the alternative, attempt to monopolize) (Count I); common law fraud (Count II); and breach of contract (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court's Opinion proceeds as follows. The Court first addresses the arguments made that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Berardi Defendants and that venue is improper in the District of New Jersey. The Court then addresses the different jurisdictions' laws it is required to apply in considering these motions, of which there are several. The Court then addresses Count I of the Second Amended Complaint, asserting conspiracy to monopolize and, alternatively, attempt to monopolize. This requires consideration, first, of whether Plaintiffs have antitrust standing and, second, whether Defendants are immune from antitrust liability. The antitrust immunity issue requires consideration of whether there was fraud on the PTO and, if so, the merits of whether Plaintiffs have a monopolization claim. As the Court finds it must dismiss Count I, the Court chooses not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims for common law fraud and breach of contract. Lastly, the Court considers Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Personal Jurisdiction and Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its February 7, 2018 Opinion, this Court extensively considered whether it had personal jurisdiction over the Berardi Defendants. The Court determined it had personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi but lacked personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Berardi. The Court asked for supplemental briefing on the personal jurisdiction issue, which the Court timely received on March 9, 2018. The Court summarizes its February 7, 2018 personal jurisdiction analysis here, incorporating the input of the parties from the supplemental briefing before reaching its ultimate decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As this case was transferred from the Southern District of Florida, the Court began by considering any decisions made by that court with regard to personal jurisdiction. In its order transferring this case to the District of New Jersey, the Southern District of Florida did not specifically address whether this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants. Its order found transfer \"would serve the interest of justice ... as the claims in this action may be affected by, and are intricately related to, several pending actions in the District of New Jersey.\" The court acknowledged that, while Plaintiffs and National Express consented to transfer (and National Express to jurisdiction in the District of New Jersey), the Berardi Defendants contended that the District of New Jersey did not have personal jurisdiction over them. The court concluded: \"Plaintiffs acknowledge that Michael Berardi and Cheryl Berardi may attempt to challenge personal jurisdiction in the District of New Jersey. Nonetheless, Plaintiffs are willing to face that potentiality and request that the Court transfer the action to the District of New Jersey pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Noting that \"[a]n action can be brought only where the court has personal jurisdiction\n   over defendants\" and that \"a court does not have authority to transfer a case to a court that lacks personal jurisdiction,\"\n   <em>\n    Hunt v. Global Incentive &amp; Meeting Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-4921,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203740808\">\n    2010 WL 3740808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D.N.J. Sept. 20, 2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    Sunbelt Corp. v. Noble Denton &amp; Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507003\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/5/28/#p31\">\n    5 F.3d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31-33 (3d Cir. 1993) ), the Court found the Southern District of Florida necessarily and implicitly concluded that the District of New Jersey had personal jurisdiction over all Defendants in determining it was appropriate to transfer the case to the District of New Jersey. Thus, this Court concluded that the law of the case was that this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Noting that \"[a] district court may reconsider a previous decision that has become law of the case ... where the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice,\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Frankling Res., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 07-848, 07-1309,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202021787\">\n    2007 WL 2021787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.N.J. July 9, 2007), the Court visited the issue of personal jurisdiction solely to determine whether the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After concluding that the Berardi Defendants did not waive their argument that this Court does not have personal jurisdiction, the Court considered whether the Berardi Defendants \"have certain minimum contacts\" with New Jersey \"such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    90 L.Ed. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1945) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Milliken v. Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141572\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/311/457/#p463\">\n    311 U.S. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141572\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/311/457/#p463\">\n    61 S.Ct. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141572\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/311/457/#p463\">\n    85 L.Ed. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1940) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court determined that nearly all of the allegations asserted in Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint regarding Mr. Berardi's contacts with the forum state relate to his contacts in his capacity as Managing Member of Blue Gentian and as an officer of Berardi Productions. Similarly, Mrs. Berardi's contacts with the forum state relate solely to her contacts in her capacity as an officer of Berardi Productions. Accordingly, this Court turned to whether it was proper for the Court to consider the Berardi Defendants' contacts with the forum state while acting on behalf of either Blue Gentian or Berardi Productions. The Court determined that, if the Second Amended Complaint sufficiently alleged the Berardi Defendants could be subject to individual liability, it was proper to consider actions taken by the Berardi Defendants in their corporate capacities in its personal jurisdiction analysis to the extent those actions were done within New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint alleges Mr. Berardi, \"as the sole managing member of Blue Gentian,\" \"direct[ed] Blue Gentian, LLC to restrain competition in part in the State of New Jersey by suing competitors claiming infringement and threatening their customers.\" The complaint specifically pinpoints two 2013 law suits filed in the District of New Jersey: dockets 13-481 and 13-7099. As to both Berardi Defendants, the Second Amended Complaint states the Berardi Defendants direct Berardi Productions to produce anticompetitive commercials \"which air in the State of New Jersey.\" It further states the Berardi Defendants \"write, produce, direct, and edit\" the anticompetitive advertisements that air in New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At this point, the parties' supplemental briefing becomes relevant. The Court's February 7, 2018 Opinion found the Second Amended Complaint sufficiently supported personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi based on his contacts through Blue Gentian. The Court based this decision on the 13-481 action and the 13-7099 action, of which Blue Gentian and National Express are both Plaintiffs. The Court found\n   the filing of these actions constituted the minimum contacts necessary for this Court to assert personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi, finding Mr. Berardi took specific action and directed the filing of these lawsuits in his capacity as managing member. The Court found that in using the federal court system in New Jersey to allegedly conspire or attempt to monopolize a market with fraudulently obtained patents, Mr. Berardi purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the State of New Jersey. Mr. Berardi was invoking the benefits and protections of the District of New Jersey, located in the forum state. If such use was fraudulent or constituted a conspiracy or attempt to monopolize, Mr. Berardi could reasonably expect to be haled into court in the state in which he filed the lawsuits. The Court also found exercising personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi comported with fair play and substantial justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its supplemental briefing, Defendants informed the Court that the 13-481 action was originally filed in the Southern District of Florida before it was transferred to the District of New Jersey on Defendant Telebrands Corp.'s Motion to Transfer. The Court thus will not base a finding of personal jurisdiction on the filing of the 13-481 action. However, the Court finds the filing of the 13-7099 action supports a finding of personal jurisdiction. Defendants' supplemental briefing provides as follows on this issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The 13-7099 action was filed by Blue Gentian and National Express in the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C479%2C776\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,479,776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '776 patent\"), and to add a retail defendant to infringement allegations already pending in the 13-1758 action. The 13-7099 action was filed as, and was identified as, related to the 13-1758 action that was pending in the district. The 13-1758 action alleged Tristar's infringement of the '941, '942, and '213 patents-the '776 patent is a continuation-in-part of those patents.... Because many of the same issues from the 13-7099 action were already pending in the 13-1758 action, 13-7099 action needed to be filed in the district where the 13-1758 action was pending. The 13-1758 action, however, was not directed to New Jersey by Blue Gentian and Mr. Berardi, but rather by Defendants Tristar Products, Inc....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Blue Gentian filed the lawsuit that became the 13-1758 action in the Southern District of Florida on October 23, 2012.... On March 19, 2013, however, Judge Seitz granted Tristar's Motion and transferred the action to New Jersey, where it was reassigned to District Judge Hochberg and Magistrate Judge Shwartz as the 13-1758 action....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-35\">\n   The 13-1758 action had been transferred to New Jersey based on Tristar's motion, and was pending for just over six (6) months when the 13-7099 action was filed. Because the issues under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) had been litigated and ruled upon with respect to the 13-1758 action, and because the 13-7099 action had the same issues for a court to address, it was not a decision by Blue Gentian and Mr. Berardi that directed the 13-7099 action to New Jersey, but plaintiffs abiding by the Florida court's prior ruling. Having already ruled on the issue relating to where the infringement issues should be heard, it would have been improper for Blue Gentian to then file a new action with substantially the same claims in the Southern District of Florida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court confirms the following. On November 21, 2013, Blue Gentian and National Express filed a complaint in the District of New Jersey, bringing claims for direct patent infringement and indirect patent infringement against Tristar Products. This was docketed as the 13-7099 matter. In the Complaint's Local Civil Rule 11.2 Certification,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the 13-7099 Complaint stated:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201337\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The Second Amended Complaint states the Berardi Defendants own Berardi Productions, a video production company. Berardi Productions has an exclusive agreement to produce television and online advertisements for National Express's Xhose product.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The Second Amended Complaint further alleges that, on August 3, 2012, the Patent Office issued an Office Action with regard to the applications for what eventually issued as the '941 and '942 patents. The Second Amended Complaint pleads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    The Office Actions demonstrate[d] that the patent examiner (1) rejected a subset of pending claims as anticipated by the '527 patent, (2) rejected various subsets of pending claims as obvious in light of the '527 patent, and (3) rejected various subsets of pending claims as obvious in light of a combination of the '527 patent and other references.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    In Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Reply, Plaintiffs request the Court ignore Defendants' supplemental briefing, arguing that it \"amounts to re-argument of the issues already briefed and decided\" and \"is improper in the absence of a Motion for Reconsideration.\" The Court notes that the supplemental briefing contains arguments that might have been more appropriate for a motion for reconsideration, considering that the Court determined in its February 7, 2018 Opinion the personal jurisdiction issue and was merely asking for briefing on how to proceed. However, given that the arguments do not change this Court's analysis, and given the unique question this Court presented the parties with for supplemental briefing, the Court finds it proper to address Defendants' concerns here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Plaintiffs also ask for the opportunity to oppose Defendants' supplemental briefing if the Court chooses to consider it. Given that the Court is not persuaded by Defendants' briefing, the Court denies that request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Local Civil Rule 11.2 requires, in pertinent part, as follows: \"The initial pleading ... in any case in this Court ... shall be accompanied by a certification ... as to whether the matter in controversy is the subject of any other action pending in any court ... and, if so, the certification ... shall identify each such action ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    Plaintiffs, by their undersigned counsel, hereby certify pursuant to L.Civ.R. 11.2 that the matters in controversy are not the subject of any other action pending in any court or of any pending arbitration or administrative proceeding, with the exception of the following:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     Telebrands Corp. v.

Plaintiffs' perception that the same transfer analysis and action would occur if the 13-7099 action were filed in the Southern District of Florida is both understandable and logical. Nonetheless, the Court does not find it shields Mr. Berardi from personal jurisdiction in New Jersey. The Court sees no indication from Defendants' briefing that is was required or instructed, either by this Court or the Southern District of Florida, to file the 13-7099 action in the District of New Jersey. Even understanding that Blue Gentian interpreted its prior interactions with the Southern District of Florida and the District of New Jersey to indicate that the 13-7099 action \"needed to be filed\" in New Jersey or \"it would have been improper for Blue Gentian to ... file a new action with substantially the same claims [as the 13-1758 action] in the Southern District of Florida,\" the Court still finds Mr. Berardi, through Blue Gentian, invoked the benefits and protections of the District of New Jersey and thus purposefully\n    availed himself of the privilege of conducting business in New Jersey. The Court thus finds Mr. Berardi is subject to personal jurisdiction in this state.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    As to Mrs. Berardi, all parties agreed the claims against her should be severed and dismissed. As this Court explained in its February 7, 2018 Opinion, Berardi Productions' advertisements are insufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts necessary for this Court to assert personal jurisdiction over her. As the content disseminated through Berardi Productions is the only contact Mrs. Berardi is alleged to have with the forum state, the Court found it could not assert personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Berardi. The Court found the Southern District of Florida's implicit conclusion that this Court has personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Berardi clearly erroneous. The Court further found asserting personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Berardi simply to comply with the law of the case would result in manifest injustice. It is fundamentally unfair to require a defendant to litigate a matter in a district in which the defendant lacks sufficient contacts. Further, the Court found that upon \"conclud[ing] that the prior decision was 'clearly erroneous,' \" this Court is \"oblig[ated] to decline jurisdiction.\"\n    <em>\n     Christianson v.

Finally, the Court cannot identify a substantial potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages at this stage of the litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     VI.

The court found as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    Here, in the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege generally that Defendant Mr. Berardi failed to disclose to the PTO \"proper identification of inventorship and key prior art\" when it was known that the \"claimed features were from the prototypes presented by Ragner Technology.\" However, as plainly indicated on the face of the '941, '942, and '776 patents issued to Defendant Mr. Berardi, Plaintiff Ragner's '527 and '448 patents were considered during the prosecution of Defendant Mr. Berardi's patents. As such, Plaintiffs cannot establish that had the PTO been aware of Ragner's patents, Defendant Mr. Berardi's patents would not have issued.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    Further, Plaintiffs do not identify with particularity what other \"key prior art\" Defendant Mr. Berardi omitted. Although Plaintiffs allege that Plaintiff Ragner disclosed to Defendants \"specific engineering diagrams, ideas ... manufacture knowhow, concepts related to its prototypes of Microhose product,\" Plaintiffs do not identify what those concepts were or which, if any, were withheld from the PTO. Likewise, Plaintiffs have not presented particularized allegations that but for omission of these unidentified ideas, the PTO would not have granted the patents to Defendant Mr. Berardi.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    (citations omitted). The Court finds the Second Amended Complaint cured those defects highlighted by the Southern District of Florida.

False Representation of a Material Fact\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The Court finds Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a false representation of a material fact. Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint alleges Mr. Berardi failed to disclose the proper identification of inventorship and key prior art. Plaintiffs highlight the following specific misrepresentations in the Second Amended Complaint:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    \u2022 \"Mr. Berardi filed an Oath and Declaration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on November 4, 2011 representing that he was the inventor of the expandable and retractable hose that is the subject of the '941 patent, despite knowing that Mr. Ragner was the inventor of the subject of the '941 patent.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n    \u2022 \"Mr. Berardi filed an Oath and Declaration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on June 6, 2012 representing that he was the inventor of the expandable and retractable hose that is the subject of the '942 patent, despite knowing that Mr. Ragner was the inventor of the subject of the '942 patent.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    \u2022 \"On August 15, 2012, Mr. Berardi, during an in-person conference, 'presented a video showing how Mr. Berardi initially manufactured the hose' without informing the examiner that he obtained such information from Mr. Ragner regarding creation of the hose under terms of non-disclosure.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    \u2022 \"Mr. Berardi further 'pointed [to] differences between the [pending claims] and the Ragner et al. reference, mainly the fact that the inner and outer layers of the Ragner et al. hose are bonded together and that the outer layer is plastic material, wherein the [pending claims'] outer layer is formed of a fabric material.' \" (alterations in original).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    \u2022 \"Mr. Berardi failed to inform the patent examiner that Mr. Ragner explained, under terms of non-disclosure, that the outer cover of the '527 invention could include a fabric cover, and that the inner and outer layer need not be bonded.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The Court finds these allegations sufficient to show a false representation of a material fact. It is also obvious to the Court that such false representations were with regard to a material fact, i.e., the proper identification of inventorship and prior art, which is clearly a predominant concern in approving a patent.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc. v.

Assuming Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the content of the August 23, 2011 meeting and\n    the above allegations to be true, as this Court must in considering a motion to dismiss, the Court finds sufficient circumstantial evidence of intent, as Defendants, from their attendance at the August 23, 2011 meeting, could not claim ignorance of the disclosures made by Plaintiffs at the August 23, 2011 meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Reliance and Injury\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The Court similarly finds Plaintiffs have made a plausible showing of both reliance by the Patent Office and that the injury would not have otherwise occurred but for Defendants' fraudulent actions. Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint alleges \"[t]he USPTO relied on Defendant Mr. Berardi's material false statements and omission as a principal reason for allowing Defendant Mr. Berardi's patent claims to issue.\" It further alleges that, \"[b]ut for these material misrepresentations regarding the scope of the invention disclosed in the '527 patent... the '941 and '942 patents would not have issued.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Specifically, Plaintiffs focus on the Office Action initially rejecting the claims based on consideration of the '527 patent. Plaintiffs indicate that, after this initial rejection, Defendants made their alleged fraudulent representations, which resulted in the issuance of the patents to Mr. Berardi.

Defendants were all present at the August 23, 2011 meeting-National Express by way of Kelly. All Defendants failed to execute written non-disclosure agreements, despite all agreeing to execute such agreements at the August 23, 2011 meeting. Mr. Berardi allegedly obtained the '941, '942, and '776 patents and then Blue Gentian, of which Mr. Berardi is a managing member, granted National Express the exclusive license to market and sell the '941, '942, and '776 patents. The Court finds this sufficient, non-conclusory, circumstantial evidence of an agreement between Defendants.

Indeed, various New Jersey cases between Telebrands, Inc. and Blue Gentian, LLC over the fraudulently obtained patents have settled, which evinces an additional restraint on competition, as, upon information and belief, Telebrands, Inc. currently occupies over 70% of the relevant expandable and contractible hose marketshare. Defendant National Express and Blue Gentian, LLC have used the fraudulently obtained '941, '942, and '776 patents to fraudulently obtain international patents to further restrain competition internationally in part by suing Plaintiff Tristar Products and other competitors claiming infringement and threatening their customers in various international jurisdictions.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n    .... In addition, by purporting to license the fraudulently obtained patents to Telebrands, Inc., Defendants have committed another anticompetitive act which, due to Telebrands, Inc. substantial position in the marketplace, carries a dangerous probability that Defendants will succeed in their attempt to achieve \"monopoly power.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Plaintiffs argue in their opposition brief that the Second Amended Complaint pleads that, \"with the settlement announced by Defendants, Defendants control in excess of 70% of the marketplace, with additional lawsuits pending to control the remaining market share. Indeed, according to Defendants, Telebrands claimed to occupy 90% of the marketplace, perhaps securing a monopoly when added to Defendants' own market share.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    In its reading of the Second Amended Complaint, the Court finds no indication that Defendants control seventy percent of the marketplace. The Court fails to see how pleading Telebrands' marketshare as seventy percent is equivalent with pleading that Defendants' marketshare is seventy percent. That a settlement exists in a related patent infringement suit says very\n    little, if anything, about Defendants' market power and resulting ability to injure competition. Even with the allegation that these cases with Telebrands have settled, this alone does not tell us the effect such settlements had on Defendants' marketshare.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    This failure to sufficiently plead marketshare is significant, but not necessarily fatal to the claim.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n    In a determination of dangerous probability-and remembering that we are only considering \"the face of the complaint\"-factors such as significant market share coupled with anticompetitive practices, barriers to entry, the strength of competition, the probable development of the industry, and the elasticity of consumer demand may be considered.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    <em>\n     Broadcom Corp. v.
