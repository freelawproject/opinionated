Defendants Mallet and her son Sebastien Kamyab timely removed the action to this court on August 2, 2018 based on diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in controversy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) &amp; (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Novatek, owned by three stockholders equally, is in the business of manufacturing and selling specialty filters for commercial and industrial uses. Mallet is Novatek's former treasurer and chief financial officer, a former director, and one of its three shareholders. Kamyab is a former sales representative on an independent contractor basis for Airganics, a Novatek subsidiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the verified complaint, Mallet misappropriated significant company funds for personal use. Mallet also allegedly paid extravagant expenses of and commissions to her son in connection with his work for Airganics. The complaint alleges counts against Mallet for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and mismanagement, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and injunctive relief. It also avers counts against Mallet and Kamyab for conversion, civil conspiracy, and an accounting. Novatek seeks damages in the amount of corporate funds Mallet improperly spent for personal use and paid to Kamyab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Novatek moved for a special, preliminary and/or permanent injunction in the state court to require Mallet to place in escrow the net proceeds of the anticipated sale of her home in Chester County, Pennsylvania, in order to ensure that those proceeds are reachable to pay any judgment entered in favor of Novatek. The motion stated that the closing could be as soon as August 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After notice and a status conference with counsel for all parties, this court on August 10, 2018, pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, entered the temporary restraining order requested by Novatek in order to maintain the status quo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 20, 2018, the court held an evidentiary hearing on Novatek's motion for a preliminary injunction and on August 23, it extended the temporary restraining order until September 7, 2018, to allow time to decide the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts established at the evidentiary hearing on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction are as follows. Novatek is an S-corporation founded in 1997 which, as stated above, is involved in the manufacture and sale of air filters for commercial and industrial uses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The company is owned equally by Mallet, Brian Harkins, and Mark Rissmiller. Harkins is its president and chief executive officer. In that role, he is responsible for the sales, marketing, and research and development for the company. Rissmiller is the vice president and secretary. He handles purchasing, operations, and manufacturing as well as research and development. Mallet, as treasurer and chief financial officer, oversaw Novatek's finances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early 2018, Harkins and Rissmiller met with accountants to review the company's 2017 earnings and tax statements. During this review, they discovered that Novatek's earnings were significantly lower than anticipated despite record sales in the preceding year. Thereafter Novatek, with the agreement of all three shareholders, retained O'Dell Valuation Consulting LLC to conduct a valuation of the company. The resulting valuation was significantly lower than Harkins and Rissmiller expected. These disappointing results prompted Harkins and Rissmiller to undertake a review of two Novatek corporate American Express credit card accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The review revealed that Mallet had charged numerous personal expenses to the corporate credit cards, including travel to France and Argentina, flood insurance for her personal real estate in Florida, personal home renovations, charitable donations, clothing and shoes, a high-end espresso machine, and college tuition for Kamyab, her son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rissmiller calculated that Mallet's unauthorized spending as currently known totals at least $600,000 over a several year period and expects this amount to rise after further investigation. The investigation also showed that Mallet had charged to Novatek first-class airfare, luxury hotels, and meals for Kamyab in connection with his work with Airganics. In addition, Mallet provided Kamyab with a twenty-percent sales commission for his work while other sales representatives for Novatek received only a ten-percent commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing, it appeared that the essence of Novatek's complaint is Mallet's breach of an oral agreement among the shareholders. All three shareholders testified that there was an unwritten agreement among them that they could charge personal expenses to Novatek. Rissmiller admitted that he charged to corporate\n   credit cards several dinners and trips with his wife, gas and maintenance for his family's cars, and home repairs, among other things. Harkins likewise used company funds to pay for personal expenses such as his son's college tuition, gas for his family's cars, and travel including a plane ticket from St. Louis to Philadelphia for his son's girlfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rissmiller and Harkins explained that the agreement included an understanding that each shareholder's personal spending from corporate funds was to be reasonable, although no specific dollar limit was ever discussed, and that the spending was to be roughly equal among the three shareholders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mallet did not dispute this understanding. Harkins and Rissmiller determined that Mallet's spending was improper because it became excessive and grossly disproportional to their own respective personal spending. Rissmiller estimated that Mallet's expenditures were ten times greater than the other two shareholders. However, Harkins and Rissmiller have not performed an accounting of their own spending and did not present evidence of the specific amount they have spent in comparison to Mallet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of Novatek held a meeting at which Mallet, Harkins, and Rissmiller were present along with counsel for Novatek in this action. The Board voted to terminate Mallet as Novatek's treasurer and chief financial officer. The Board also voted to terminate Susan Lane, Mallet's long-time personal friend who had been employed by Novatek as a financial assistant since November 2017. At a shareholders' meeting that same day, Mallet was removed as a director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Harkins and Rissmiller explained that they voted to remove Mallet due to her excessive personal spending as well as her alleged shredding of corporate documents and her refusal to provide financial information such as passwords and usernames for certain corporate accounts. Although Mallet admitted that she spent corporate funds for personal expenses, she denied that her charges were excessive or unauthorized by Harkins and Rissmiller. She denied that she shredded corporate documents or refused to provide financial information when requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Within days after she was terminated and before this lawsuit was filed, Mallet listed her home in Chester County for sale for $420,000, a price recommended by her real estate agent. Mallet purchased the property in 1994, several years before Novatek was formed, and there was no evidence that she used corporate funds to buy it. On June 25, 2018, a few days after it was listed, Mallet contracted to sell the property for $412,000. The closing was initially scheduled for August 16, 2018 but was postponed to August 23, 2018 at Mallet's request. Mallet expects to net approximately $140,000 from the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to her Chester County home, Mallet owns a home in St. Petersburg, Florida which she purchased in 2009. This property would likely be protected from a judgment lien under the Florida homestead exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   She has retirement accounts that likely would not be subject to garnishment and a checking account containing\n   around $2,500. Other than her Chester County home, the only significant asset Mallet would have to satisfy any potential judgment entered against her in this action is her one-third share of Novatek stock. The parties dispute its value. The evidence presented was inconclusive as to whether it would be sufficient to satisfy any judgment entered against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After her termination from Novatek, Mallet relocated to Florida where she is now a citizen. Except for her son, her family lives there, including her parents and a sibling, and she is currently looking for employment in that area. While Mallet is a dual citizen of France and the United States, she has resided in the United States since 1977. We accept her testimony that she has no intention of moving back to France where she has no close relatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For a preliminary injunction to be granted the following prerequisites must be established as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Reilly v.

As noted above, Mallet bought her house in 1994, some three years before Novatek was established. Corporate funds were not used to make the purchase. The purchase and ownership of the house is clearly collateral to the merits of the action. In essence, as noted above, this is an action for damages for breach of contract unrelated to Mallet's home. It is not a case where there is a lien or where ownership or control of specific property such as a bank account, a piece of real estate, or a work of art is at issue.
