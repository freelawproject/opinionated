INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dissatisfied with Defendant Clark Nexsen, Inc.'s (\"Clark Nexsen\" or \"Defendant\") services related to the construction of a $10 million tennis and education facility in Southeast Washington, D.C., Plaintiff Washington Tennis &amp; Education Foundation, Inc. (\"WTEF\" or \"Plaintiff\") brought this lawsuit against Clark Nexsen, asserting two claims: (1) breach of the parties' contract, known as the \"Architect Agreement,\" and (2) breach of Clark Nexsen's common law duty of professional care. WTEF also sought to add as co-plaintiff Washington Tennis &amp; Education Foundation East, Inc. (\"WTEF East\"), a related but separate entity to whom Plaintiff assigned \"all of [its] right, title and interest\" in the Architect Agreement in order to obtain certain federal tax credits. In response to Plaintiff's two-count Complaint,\n   Defendant counterclaimed for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This court initially granted Clark Nexsen's Motion for Summary Judgment and denied WTEF's Motion to Add WTEF East as a co-plaintiff. The court concluded that, by virtue of WTEF's assignment of \"all of [its] right, title, and interest\" in the Architect Agreement to WTEF East, WTEF lacked standing to sue Defendant for claims arising from the Agreement. The court therefore dismissed Plaintiff's claims against Defendant and rejected WTEF's bid to add WTEF East to the suit to cure the standing defect of its original claims. The matter proceeded solely on Defendant's counterclaim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff now moves for reconsideration of the dismissal of its claims or, in the alternative, for certification of an interlocutory appeal. WTEF asserts that the court incorrectly concluded that it assigned its breach of contract and professional negligence claims to WTEF East and further erred by prohibiting WTEF East from joining the suit. Upon reconsideration, the court finds no error in its conclusion that WTEF lacks standing to bring a breach of contract claim against Defendant by virtue of assigning its rights and interests in the Architect Agreement to WTEF East. The court likewise upholds its ruling dismissing Plaintiff's tort claim, but does so on a different ground: the professional malpractice claim, whether advanced by WTEF or WTEF East, is barred by the statute of limitations. In view of that ruling, the court affirms its decision to disallow WTEF East from joining this action because adding WTEF East would be futile. The court also rejects WTEF's request to certify this matter for interlocutory review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, the court denies Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration, or in the Alternative, for Certification of an Interlocutory Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court incorporates the relevant facts laid out in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, dated September 13, 2017, and recites here only the information necessary to resolve the Motion for Reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. &amp; Order, ECF No. 58 [hereinafter Sept. 13 Order].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In brief, Plaintiff WTEF, a nonprofit organization, and Defendant Clark Nexsen, an architecture and engineering firm,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered into what the parties refer to as the \"Architect Agreement\" on October 6, 2010. Pursuant to that contract, Clark Nexsen agreed to provide architectural design and construction oversight services for Plaintiff's new indoor tennis facility, known as the East Capitol Campus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 46 [hereinafter Def.'s Summ. J. Mot.], Ex. N, ECF No. 47 [hereinafter Architect Agreement]. The Architect Agreement outlined the scope of Clark Nexsen's design responsibilities, setting out the following sequential phases of design: the Schematic Design Phase, the Design Development Phase, and the Construction Document Phase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Architect Agreement, Art. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 3.2-3.4. According to the Agreement, each new phase of design began \"based on Owner's [i.e., WTEF's] approval\" of the prior phase of design.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 3.2.5, 3.3.1, 3.4.1. The Agreement further set forth the scope of Clark Nexsen's bidding phase and construction phase responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 3.5-3.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2011, Plaintiff formed a new nonprofit entity, WTEF East, as a wholly-controlled subsidiary of WTEF. Sept. 13 Order at 3. The express purpose of WTEF East's formation was to take advantage of certain tax credits to finance the East Capitol Campus project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   WTEF transferred all property rights in the East Capitol Campus to WTEF East to secure the tax benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. This restructuring also caused WTEF, with the consent of Clark Nexsen, to assign \"all of [its] right, title, and interest\" in the Architect Agreement to WTEF East.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., Ex. O, ECF No. 46-18 [hereinafter Assignment Agreement]. The assignment became effective on December 30, 2011,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   , as did the Sublease Agreement by which WTEF East subleased the East Capitol Campus facility to WTEF,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 52 [hereinafter Def.'s Summ. J. Reply], Ex. AG, ECF No. 52-2, at 18 (Sublease Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 1, 2012, the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (\"DCRA\") issued a building permit to WTEF East, and construction of the East Capitol Campus began shortly thereafter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Summ. J. Mot. at 34;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Z, ECF No. 46-29. Clark Nexsen then issued a Certificate of Substantial Completion on November 13, 2012, certifying that the work performed under the Architect Agreement was sufficiently complete so as to allow occupancy or use of the facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., Ex. AA, ECF No. 46-30. WTEF began conducting its programming in the East Capitol Campus facility in January 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dealings between the parties went awry not long after, caused by a host of perceived design and construction defects. By letter dated July 14, 2014, Richard L. Aguglia, President of WTEF East, submitted a request for mediation to Clark Nexsen pursuant to section 8.2 of the Architect Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., Ex. V, ECF No. 46-25 [hereinafter Mediation Demand]. When mediation proved unsuccessful, WTEF, and WTEF alone, filed this action on November 10, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1, Compl., ECF No. 1-3, \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff advances two theories of liability in its Complaint. In Count I, WTEF alleges that Defendant breached the Architect Agreement through errors and defects in its design of the East Capitol Campus and its oversight of the construction process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. In Count II, WTEF alleges that Defendant committed professional malpractice by failing to perform its work with the skill and care ordinarily provided by architects in this locality and by violating industry standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. In its Complaint, WTEF identifies eleven \"problems\" with the East Capitol Campus facility \"for which Clark Nexsen bears sole responsibility, or shares responsibility with [the general contractor, HITT],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, and for which \"WTEF calculates the cost of remediating\" to be in excess of $750,000,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In summary, as alleged by Plaintiff, the defects are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Gutters and Downspouts\n   </em>\n   : The roof drainage on the East Capitol Campus is inadequate due to Clark Nexsen's design errors. The gutters regularly overflow when it rains, causing water to flood into the facility, and one of the downspouts is not tied into the underground storm drainage system. The gutters and downspouts show extraordinarily rapid deterioration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    HVAC System\n   </em>\n   : Clark Nexsen's subcontractor designed the HVAC system for the East Capitol Campus and predicted the monthly utility\n   bills WTEF would incur. Neither the subcontractor nor Clark Nexsen, however, advised WTEF that the predicted utility costs could be achieved only with a mechanical building management system. WTEF has incurred utility bills that exceed those predicted as a result. Major components of the HVAC system are failing and show extraordinarily rapid deterioration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Improper Storefront Location\n   </em>\n   : The \"storefront wall\" near the front end of the facility was not built according to the Clark Nexsen-issued design documents, and does not align with the exterior wall of the facility. Adrian Lazaro, a Clark Nexsen architect, learned of the improper location of the storefront wall and yet issued a Certificate of Substantial Completion without giving notice to WTEF.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    Condensate Line\n   </em>\n   : The condensate line exiting from the facility's mechanical room drains onto an exterior sidewalk, creating a slip-and-fall hazard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    Exterior Wall Detail\n   </em>\n   : The Clark Nexsen-issued design documents erroneously specified the type of block to be used in the exterior walls of the facility, necessitating the issuance of a change order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (f)\n   <em>\n    Exterior Columns\n   </em>\n   : Despite repeated painting, WTEF has experienced recurring improper venting and peeling paint at the base of the exterior columns at the front of the facility, indicating a design error by Clark Nexsen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (g)\n   <em>\n    Buckling Interior Floors\n   </em>\n   : The vinyl tile flooring buckles in a straight line across the hallway near Room 128 due to Clark Nexsen's failure to specify expansion joints in the floor to match expansion joints in the underlying slab.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (h)\n   <em>\n    Indoor Tennis Court Light Fixture Guards\n   </em>\n   : Clark Nexsen's original design for indoor tennis court light fixtures called for exposed light bulbs. Plaintiff incurred $8,000 in costs to install guards to ensure the safety of players below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (i)\n   <em>\n    Pilaster Adjustments\n   </em>\n   : Clark Nexsen's original design for the pilaster had incorrect dimensions, requiring additional steel reinforcement at a cost of $2,295.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (j)\n   <em>\n    Added Column Footing\n   </em>\n   : Clark Nexsen's original design for the support columns was deficient, leading to a cost of $1,400 for additional structural support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (k)\n   <em>\n    Storm Pipe from Tennis Court Drains\n   </em>\n   : Clark Nexsen's original design erroneously called for the tennis court drains to be piped into the front bioretention drain. The drains instead should have been connected to the sewer. The cost of reconnecting the drain to the proper outlet was $4,900.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9. Defendant responded by denying responsibility for any of these claimed flaws. Receipt of Original Case File, ECF No. 5, Super. Ct. Docs., ECF No. 5-1, at 7-46, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Defendant also counterclaimed for breach of contract, seeking payment for unpaid invoices and interest in the amount of $47,514.71, plus additional interest accrued since the counterclaim's filing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By Memorandum Opinion and Order dated September 13, 2017 (\"Order\"), the court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant on the ground that WTEF lacked standing to assert its breach of contract and malpractice claims, because it had assigned \"all of [its] right, title, and interest\" in the Architect Agreement to its\n   subsidiary, WTEF East.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Sept. 13 Order. The court also rejected WTEF's effort to bring WTEF East into the case as a co-plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14. What remains of the case, then, is Defendant's counterclaim to recover fees not paid under the Architect Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff now seeks reconsideration of the court's Order, or alternatively, certification of the standing question for interlocutory review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Recons., ECF No. 62 [hereinafter Pl.'s Mot.], Br. in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 62-1 [hereinafter Pl.'s Br.]. For the reasons stated below, the court denies Plaintiff's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   WTEF seeks reconsideration under three Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: 54(b), 59(e), and 60(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 2-3. Only Rule 54(b) applies, however. Rules 59(e) and 60(b) come into play only after an order of final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cobell v.

First, Plaintiff asserts that the court incorrectly concluded that Plaintiff assigned its professional malpractice claim to WTEF East. Second, Plaintiff insists that the court erred in holding that it lacked standing to assert a claim for breach of contract because the court misstated the \"shareholder standing rule\"; mischaracterized WTEF as a \"stranger\" to the Architect Agreement; and failed to recognize WTEF as an intended third-party beneficiary of the Architect Agreement. Finally, Plaintiff asserts that the court wrongly\n   determined that WTEF East could not join the suit under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15, 21, or 24. The court takes each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    1.

The court made a mistake by treating the breach of contract and malpractice claims co-extensively for purposes of assessing standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 13 Order at 6 (ruling that \"only WTEF East has standing to enforce the Agreement or to sue Defendant for breach of any common law duty arising therefrom\").

The court corrects that error now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   WTEF asserts that its assignment of \"all of [its] right, title, and interest\" in the Architect Agreement did not extinguish the duty of care that Clark Nexsen owed to WTEF\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   . Pl.'s Br. at 3-5; Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Recons., ECF No. 66 [hereinafter Pl.'s Reply], at 2-4. According to WTEF, \"[n]othing in the Assignment Agreement purported to assign or release Clark Nexsen from any tort liability to WTEF.\" Pl.'s Reply at 3. Unexpectedly, Clark Nexsen agrees. In its view, \"[w]hile tort claims are generally assignable, no tort had been committed at the time of the [Assignment Agreement] on December 30, 2011,\" so \"no\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   [tort] claim could be assigned\" to WTEF East as of December 30, 2011.

Stated differently, Clark Nexsen agrees that the Assignment Agreement did not, as a matter of law, divest WTEF of any inchoate tort claim rooted in an independent duty that Clark Nexsen owed to WTEF (as opposed to WTEF East). Because there is no dispute as to whether WTEF retained the right to assert a tort claim against Clark Nexsen notwithstanding the Assignment Agreement, the court, in the interest of justice, reverses its decision that WTEF lacked standing to sue Defendant for professional malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   WTEF's standing to assert a tort claim does not, however, end the court's analysis. In its motion for summary judgment, Clark Nexsen also moved for judgment on the ground that Plaintiff's claims-tort and contract-are time-barred. The court did not reach that issue because of its standing determination. The court now addresses the limitations defense as to the tort claim, and agrees with Defendant that the statute of limitations\n   bars WTEF's professional malpractice claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    WTEF's tort claim is barred by the statute of limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties agree that a three-year statute of limitations applies to this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    D.C.

First, WTEF maintains that \"the critical date for the statute of limitations is July 14, 2014,\" which is \"the date on which WTEF requested mediation with Clark Nexsen by certified letter under Section 8.2 of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. &amp; Mot. in Limine, ECF No. 50 [hereinafter Pl.'s Summ. J. Opp'n], at 8. Put another way, WTEF argues that, because it made a\n   <em>\n    mediation demand\n   </em>\n   within three years, its\n   <em>\n    filing of this action\n   </em>\n   is timely. Second, WTEF argues that the \"discovery rule\" applies and the rule's operation delayed the accrual date until January 2013, when WTEF first moved into the facility and began to learn about Clark Nexsen's breaches, thereby rendering its suit filed in November 2015 timely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. Both arguments are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    i. Plaintiff's mediation demand did not toll the statute of limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   WTEF's first argument is based on a complete misreading of the Architect Agreement. According to WTEF, section 8.2.1 provides that \"[a]ny claim, dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject to mediation as a condition precedent to binding dispute resolution selected in this Agreement within the period specified by applicable law.\" Pl.'s Summ. J. Opp'n at 8-9. But that is not what section 8.2.1 says. Rather section 8.2.1 of the contract provides: \"Any claim, dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject to mediation as a condition precedent to binding dispute resolution.\" Architect Agreement, Art. 8,\n   \u00a7 8.2.1. Full stop. Period. That clause does not, as WTEF claims, go on to require that the mediation demand be made \"within the period specified by applicable law.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The additional text that Plaintiff quotes is contained not in section 8.2.1, but in section 8.1.1, a clause that pertains to the bringing of \"claims and causes of action.\" That section provides that the parties \"shall commence\n   <em>\n    all claims and causes of action\n   </em>\n   ... in accordance with the method of binding dispute resolution selected in this Agreement within the period specified by applicable law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.1.1 (emphasis added). Critically, the \"binding dispute resolution\" selected by the parties in the Architect Agreement is \"[l]itigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.2.4. Thus, the entire premise of WTEF's argument that the date of mediation is what counts for statute of limitations purposes is flat wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A charitable reading of WTEF's argument would be that its filing of the mediation demand equitably tolled the limitations period for its claims. But that assertion would be wrong, too. WTEF cites no authority whatsoever for that proposition, and the most analogous case that this court has found is to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shailendra Kumar, P.A. v. Dhanda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708743\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/426/185/\">\n    426 Md. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708743\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/426/185/\">\n    43 A.3d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1042-43 (2012) (rejecting equitable tolling during \"the pendency of mandatory, non-binding arbitration\"). Moreover, the Architect Agreement cannot be read to permit equitable tolling. While Article 8 requires mediation as a condition precedent to filing suit, it clearly provides that a request for mediation \"may be made concurrently with the filing of a complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Architect Agreement, Art. 8, \u00a7 8.2.2. In such circumstances, the Agreement provides that the filed action \"shall be stayed for 60 days from the date of filing, unless stayed for a longer period by agreement of the parties or court order.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708743\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/426/185/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Architect Agreement therefore expressly contemplates the filing of a protective action during the pendency of mediation precisely to avoid issues with the statute of limitations. Plaintiff's counsel conceded as much during oral argument on the motion for reconsideration, admitting that the \"better course in hindsight\" would have been for Plaintiff to submit the mediation demand and concurrently file suit. Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 70, at 20. Accordingly, because the Architect Agreement itself cannot be read to equitably toll the limitations period during the pendency of mediation, the court rejects Plaintiff's attempt to rely on July 14, 2014, as the operative date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    ii. The discovery rule is inapplicable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court proceeds to ask: When did the statute of limitations began to run in this matter?

Sensing that the general rule would not help its cause, Plaintiff urges application of the discovery rule, which the D.C.

Court of Appeals has twice addressed whether the discovery rule applies in negligence actions in the context of a construction dispute. In\n   <em>\n    Ehrenhaft\n   </em>\n   , the court applied the discovery rule in a residential homeowner's action involving a claim of professional negligence and breach of contract by an architect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7936047\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/483/1192/#p1201\">\n    483 A.2d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the court declined to apply the discovery rule in\n   <em>\n    Capitol Place\n   </em>\n   , reasoning that the plaintiff was a sophisticated national organization who partnered with a commercial developer and had knowledge of the construction defects well before demanding arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860644\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/673/194/#p199\">\n    673 A.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Any deficiencies in Clark Nexsen's designs were discoverable and correctable as early as October 2011, when Clark Nexsen's construction documents were submitted to the DCRA for a building permit, or, at the latest, March 1, 2012, when the building permit was issued and construction based on Clark Nexsen's designs was underway.

WTEF therefore cannot reasonably rely on the latency of the design defects to advocate for the discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The third factor-balancing Plaintiff's interest against prejudice to Defendant-likewise weighs against Plaintiff. In light of the court's conclusion that a number of the \"problems\" in the East Capitol Campus's design were discoverable by Plaintiff well within the period provided by the statute of limitations, applying the discovery rule to Plaintiff's benefit would \"frustrate the policies underlying the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ehrenhaft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7936047\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/483/1192/#p1201\">\n    483 A.2d at 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the court \"applaud[s] [WTEF's] efforts to avoid litigation through informal attempts at resolving disputes, there is a point where a party must decide to either bring a recalcitrant party before the court or forgo that option.\"\n   <em>\n    Capitol Place\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860644\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/673/194/#p199\">\n    673 A.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Having considered the foregoing factors and concluded that Plaintiff is a sophisticated party who benefitted from the hired expertise of others and was on notice of any design deficiencies in Clark Nexsen's construction documents well within the statute of limitations period, the court holds that the discovery rule is inapplicable to WTEF's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Plaintiff's claim is untimely\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Without the benefit of the discovery rule, Plaintiff's tort claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Clark Nexsen identifies March 1, 2012-the date when the DCRA issued a building permit to WTEF East-as the critical date for statute of limitations purposes, because by that date Clark Nexsen's design services were completed and WTEF would have been on notice as to any design defects. Plaintiff, on the other hand, points to November 13, 2012, as the date its cause of action accrued because that is the date Clark Nexsen issued the Certificate of Substantial Completion. Defendant has the better of the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff's tort claim alleges, in the main, that Clark Nexsen failed to perform its\n   <em>\n    design\n   </em>\n   services according to an architect's professional standard of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9(a), (b), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k).

Additionally, WTEF engaged a permit expeditor, who reviewed the set of Clark Nexsen-issued design drawings, submitted them to the DCRA on WTEF's behalf, and then \"walked\" these drawings through the DCRA in order to obtain the permit and begin construction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rossides Dep. at 68:10-69:15; 82:12-83:1; 104:8-104:18.

To that end, WTEF asserts that the court: (1) misstated and misapplied the \"shareholder standing rule\" to WTEF, a nonprofit organization; (2) incorrectly cast WTEF as a \"stranger\" to the Architect Agreement; and (3) failed to recognize WTEF as an intended third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 5-11. These arguments, however, do little more than rehash WTEF's previous arguments.

WTEF's purported \"legal interest in the real property,\" derived\n   from the sublease, creates no separate rights in favor of WTEF with regard to the design and construction of the East Capitol Campus. All of the contractual rights under the Architect Agreement flowed to WTEF East after the assignment, and so WTEF's claimed injury is completely derivative of the obligations Clark Nexsen owed to WTEF East. As a result, the exception to the shareholder standing rule does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Next, Plaintiff asserts that it is not a \"stranger\" to the Architect Agreement because under the Assignment Agreement it remained jointly and severally liable with WTEF East for payments to Clark Nexsen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 8 (\"WTEF thus retained financial responsibilities and burdens associated with the contract.\"). WTEF makes too much of the court's reference to it as a \"stranger\" to the Architect Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 13 Order at 8-9. The court used that term as the D.C.

WTEF therefore cannot sue to enforce the Architect Agreement's terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff again attempts to recast itself as a third-party beneficiary to the Assignment Agreement. It is not. Section 10.5 of the Architect Agreement expressly provides that \"[n]othing contained in this Agreement shall create a contractual relationship with or a cause of action in favor of a third party against either the Owner [i.e., Plaintiff] or Architect.\" Architect Agreement, Art. 10, \u00a7 10.5. WTEF offers no response to the plain text of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, in making these arguments, WTEF fails to demonstrate: \"(1) an intervening change in the law; (2) the discovery of new evidence not previously available; or (3) a clear error,\" as to the court's ruling on its breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. Exec. Office for U.S. Attorneys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215821\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/11/7/#p8\">\n    11 F.Supp.3d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (D.D.C. 2014). Accordingly, Plaintiff offers no reason for the court to revisit its decision holding that Plaintiff lacked standing to assert its breach-of-contract claim. The court therefore affirms its dismissal of Count I for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    3. The Addition of WTEF East Is Improper\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court turns to Plaintiff's request that the court reconsider its decision to reject adding WTEF East as a co-plaintiff to this suit under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15, 21, and 24. As before, none of these Rules allow WTEF East to join the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Taking the Rules in reverse order, WTEF offers no valid reason for the court to reconsider its decision that WTEF East could not intervene under Rule 24 because WTEF East, \"the person seeking to intervene,\" did not make a motion to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 13 Order at 13-14 (quoting 7C Charles Alan Wright, et al., Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 1914 (3d ed. 2015) ). Although Plaintiff complains that the court's approach \"elevates form over substance,\" Pl.'s Br. at 12, it cites no case for the proposition that a\n   <em>\n    party\n   </em>\n   can move on behalf of a putative intervenor to enter the case. What WTEF calls \"elevating form over substance\" is simply following what\n   the text of Rule 24 requires. Moreover, the court rejects Plaintiff's first-time request to construe its original Motion for Leave to Amend as a motion for intervention\n   <em>\n    by WTEF East\n   </em>\n   . Now,\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   would be elevating form over substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The court will, however, reconsider its refusal to add WTEF East as a party under Rules 15 and 21. The court originally concluded that WTEF could not join WTEF East under those rules because, absent standing to assert its claims, the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to add a party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 13 Order at 11-13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lans v.

But that rationale must fall away, as the court has recognized WTEF's standing to bring its negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Yet even with standing, WTEF cannot now add WTEF East because doing so would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Naartex Consulting Corp. v.

Authority, ECF No. 56. WTEF, however, misunderstands the procedural flaw inherent in its claims. Relation back would operate to treat WTEF East's claims as having been filed on the same day as WTEF's-November 10, 2015. But, as the court already has held, WTEF's filing on that date was untimely.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   IV.A.1.

In the current posture, WTEF posits, it can appeal the court's dismissal of its breach of contract and tort claims only after the court conducts a trial on the merits of Clark Nexsen's counterclaim.

Burwell\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-1967,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013699275\">\n    2015 WL 13699275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.D.C. Oct. 19, 2015). Here, waiting for the resolution of an interlocutory appeal would not do so. Once calendared, trial on Defendant's counterclaim can be accomplished in less than a week. At that point, both this court's Order and the results of the trial could be appealed. The court therefore concludes that granting an interlocutory appeal would more likely impede-rather than materially advance-the progress of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    C. WTEF's Jury Demand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court's acknowledgment that WTEF has standing to assert its tort claim directly affects one outstanding procedural matter-whether WTEF made a valid jury demand with respect to Clark Nexsen's counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. in Limine to Bar Evidence Supporting WTEF's Counter-Allegations of Breach of Contract, ECF No. 61 [hereinafter Def.'s Mot. in Limine]; Br. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. in Limine, ECF No. 61-1, at 9. Clark Nexsen argues that \"WTEF waived its request for trial by jury [as to the counterclaim] because WTEF lacked standing to file its Complaint, through which WTEF demanded a jury trial.\" Def.'s Reply in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. in Limine, ECF No. 65, at 13. The premise of Clark Nexsen's argument is, of course, no longer valid, as the court now concludes that WTEF did have standing to bring its malpractice claim. Accordingly, because WTEF had standing as to one claim at the time it \"request[ed] a trial by jury of all issues triable of right,\" i.e., when it filed its Complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, Pl.'s Jury Demand, ECF No. 1-3, WTEF preserved its right to a jury on Defendant's counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9 Charles Alan Wright, et al., Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ., \u00a7 2318 (3d ed. 2018) (\"If a general demand for jury is made without specifying any issues, it will be regarded as a demand for jury trial on all the issues in the case.\").\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosen v.

Vt. 1989) (holding that plaintiff's demand for trial by jury on \"each and every count of the complaint\" did not reach defendant's counterclaim). Clark Nexsen's counterclaim therefore will be tried before a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court denies Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration, or, in the Alternative, for Certification of an Interlocutory Appeal. As before, the court maintains jurisdiction over Defendant's pending counterclaim. This matter will proceed before a jury on that counterclaim alone.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    As before, the court refers to one defendant, Clark Nexsen, throughout the opinion.

That narrow principle, of course, has no application here.

WTEF responds that the economic loss doctrine does not preclude its tort claim and that WTEF can still recover economic damages stemming from Clark Nexsen's breach of its professional duty of care because it enjoyed a \"special relationship\" with Clark Nexsen pursuant to which Clark Nexsen \"undertook obligations that would 'implicate [WTEF's] economic expectancies.' \"\n    <em>\n     Whitt v.
