Plaintiffs allege that since 2008, defendants' operation of wastewater disposal wells (\"injection wells\") drilled into the Arbuckle formation has caused thousands of man-made earthquakes throughout large swaths of Oklahoma, and as a result, many Oklahomans have been forced to purchase earthquake insurance to provide financial protection against damage to their homes and property. In addition, plaintiffs allege that the man-made earthquakes caused by defendants' injection wells have caused the cost of earthquake insurance to soar. Plaintiffs allege that the substantial increase in earthquake activity in Oklahoma has caused earthquake insurance companies to hike their premiums by as much as 260 percent from 2014 to 2017. In this action, plaintiffs, for themselves and others similarly situated, seek to recoup the cost of obtaining and maintaining insurance coverage since 2009 under tort theories of public and private nuisance, ultrahazardous activities and negligence. Specifically, plaintiffs seek the \"value of premiums paid to obtain earthquake insurance coverage\" and the \"excess amount required to maintain earthquake insurance coverage after 2009.\" Class Action Petition (\"complaint\"), doc. no. 1-2, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 98, 101 and 105. Plaintiffs additionally seek punitive damages, attorneys' fees, expenses, costs and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' action was originally commenced in the District Court of Payne County, State of Oklahoma. Defendant, Devon Energy Production, L.P., removed the action to this court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). All named defendants, who according to plaintiffs, are \"some of the largest operators of wastewater injection wells in the Arbuckle formation,\" complaint, doc. no. 1-2, \u00b6 3, have now moved, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint, on various grounds. In addition, defendant, Midstates Petroleum Company LLC, seeks to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint against it, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., because of its bankruptcy case. It has also moved to strike all pre-effective date allegations from plaintiffs' complaint due to the bankruptcy case. Further, defendant, Chesapeake Operating L.L.C., seeks to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) based upon the lack of standing by plaintiffs and the lack of ripeness of their claims. Plaintiffs oppose dismissal on all grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisdictional Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. and defendant, Midstates Petroleum Company, LLC, filed a voluntary petition for relief in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on April 30, 2016. The bankruptcy court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order confirming the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization for both of the Midstates debtors on September 28, 2016. The effective date of confirmation of the plan was October 21, 2016. According to defendant, all claims prior to October 21, 2016 were discharged by the bankruptcy court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its motion, defendant argues that plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because the bankruptcy court retained exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising out of or related to the Chapter 11 proceedings\n   and the plan of reorganization, including any cases, controversies, suits or disputes with respect to discharges, releases and injunctions provided for in the plan. Defendant maintains that plaintiffs' claims implicate the discharge and injunction provisions of the confirmation order and plan. Even if the court were to determine that it has subject matter jurisdiction, defendant argues that plaintiffs cannot assert pre-effective date claims that were discharged as part of the bankruptcy proceedings and those claims should be dismissed. Defendant further argues that all allegations of pre-effective date events should be stricken from the complaint with respect to defendant as plaintiffs are barred from relying on those allegations to support any post-effective date claims, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs, in response, state that defendant believes their claims are based on unidentified earthquakes beginning in 2008 but their \"claims are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   based on the occurrence of any given or specific earthquake(s) at all.\" Doc. no. 75, at 37 (emphasis in original). They maintain that their claims are based on the concurrent conduct of defendants in injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation - conduct that each defendant continues to engage in to the present day. To that extent, plaintiffs contend that they have alleged that defendant has engaged in post-confirmation conduct for which there is no discharge under the bankruptcy code. Therefore, because the complaint alleges continuing injection activities on the part of defendant, which would include post-confirmation conduct supporting liability for their claims, plaintiffs contend that dismissal is not warranted. According to plaintiffs, the only question will be defendant's share of the harm caused by the concurrent activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition, plaintiffs contend that the allegations in the complaint should not be stricken because even if no liability can stem from pre-effective date injection activities, the allegations do have evidentiary value and are not irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant, in reply, asserts that plaintiffs do not contest that their claims arising out of pre-effective date conduct are barred by the bankruptcy court's order discharging all claims accruing before the pre-effective date of October 21, 2016. Defendant contends that plaintiffs' pre-effective date events have no place in this case, as an evidentiary matter or otherwise, in light of the effect of the discharge and injunction provisions of the bankruptcy court's order. Defendant argues that the authority cited by plaintiffs does not support reliance on allegations as to pre-effective date events. Further, defendant maintains that plaintiffs' allegations do not sufficiently identify post-confirmation activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To the extent plaintiffs seek any relief from defendant based upon injection well activities which occurred prior to October 21, 2016, the court agrees with defendant that plaintiffs cannot recover from defendant, given the bankruptcy discharge. Therefore, the court finds that plaintiffs' claims based upon conduct by defendant prior to October 21, 2016 are subject to dismissal without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. However, plaintiffs' claims based upon conduct after October 21, 2016 are not subject to dismissal. The court rejects defendant's argument that plaintiffs' allegations, viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, are too vague to support liability post-effective date. The court also concludes that the bankruptcy court does not have jurisdiction over claims based upon conduct after October 21, 2016. The court therefore grants defendant's dismissal motion under Rule 12(b)(1) in part and denies the Rule 12(b)(1) motion in part. Because plaintiffs' claims against defendant for conduct prior to October 21, 2016 are being\n   dismissed, the court finds that defendant's motion to strike pre-effective date allegations (doc. no. 67) should be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Standing and Ripeness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant, Chesapeake Operating, L.L.C., contends that plaintiffs do not have Article III standing to bring their claims because they have not suffered an injury-in-fact. According to Chesapeake, the payment of insurance premiums is not a legally cognizable injury. However, even if it were, defendant argues that the alleged injury-in-fact is not, for purposes of standing, fairly traceable to the challenged action. Defendant points out that plaintiffs opted to purchase earthquake insurance and therefore created the alleged injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, defendant asserts that plaintiffs' claims are not ripe for consideration because plaintiffs made the conscious decision to purchase insurance to cover damage to property which may never occur. Defendant maintains that a case is not ripe for judicial resolution if it involves an uncertain or contingent future event that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all. Because damage to plaintiffs' property is not certain to occur, defendant argues that the case involves an uncertain or contingent future event. Defendant posits that plaintiffs' claims \"may be adjudicated if and when they ripen into mature claims.\" Doc. no. 71, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that defendant's arguments are built on two faulty assumptions: plaintiffs are seeking to recover based on physical harm or damage to property and that any damage must be specifically shown to have been caused by defendant. Plaintiffs contend that they do not seek recovery for any physical harm or damage to property. They are alleging that injection of wastewater by defendant and others contributes to Oklahoma seismic activity and this activity has forced them to purchase earthquake insurance or to pay higher premiums for that insurance. Plaintiffs contend that they do not have to show that the damage they have suffered has been specifically caused by defendant's direct activity vis-\u00e0-vis their property. Plaintiffs maintain that they have sufficiently alleged a current, ripe and justiciable injury-in-fact sufficient to overcome dismissal based upon standing and ripeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In reply, defendant contends that it recognizes that plaintiffs are not seeking relief based on actual damage but relief for the payment of insurance premiums. Defendant, however, maintains that plaintiffs' claims are not ripe because they have not suffered any actual damage. Payment of insurance premiums, defendant points out, was voluntary. It also points out that insurance by its very nature involves damage that has not yet occurred. Further, defendant contends that plaintiffs have not shown that plaintiffs' alleged injury-in-fact is attributable to defendant's specific actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs, as the parties seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, bear the burden of establishing standing.\n   <em>\n    Cressman v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054562\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/1139/#p1144\">\n    719 F.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1144 (10th Cir. 2013).

The court finds that these allegations are sufficient to demonstrate an actual concrete and particularized injury-in-fact. The court can reasonably infer from the allegations that if plaintiffs had not used their money to purchase earthquake insurance, they would have used the money to purchase other things. Whether plaintiffs can recover their insurance premiums under the tort theories of liability alleged in the complaint is a separate question. By alleging an economic injury consisting of payment of insurance premiums, which may or may not be recoverable under the theories of liability asserted, plaintiffs have satisfied the injury-in-fact requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , 15 James WM.

With respect to the former, defendant, as discussed, contends that this case involves uncertain or contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated or may not incur at all. Defendant contends that plaintiffs have bought insurance to cover damage to property that may never occur.

Plaintiffs' alleged injury does not depend on uncertain, contingent future events. Plaintiffs are claiming that they are damaged by paying the premiums they have been paying for earthquake insurance.

App. 4th Cir. 1995). In\n   <em>\n    Claudet\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff sued her physician for failure to timely diagnose her breast cancer. Plaintiff's theory of liability, which was accepted by the jury, was that the physician should have diagnosed her cancer while it was in Stage I rather than when it was in Stage II. If plaintiff had been treated while her cancer was in Stage I, her chance of survival would have been 75 percent. Her chance of survival, when treated in Stage II, was lower - 42 percent. The jury awarded general damages of $600,000 based upon a 33% decrease in plaintiff's chance of survival. In addition to the general damages, the jury also awarded the plaintiff $180,000 in future wages and $30,000 in future costs of insurance premiums. However, the issue of the recovery of future outlays for insurance premiums was not specifically before the appellate court. Therefore, the court did not\n   determine whether insurance premiums were recoverable. The court is not persuaded that the\n   <em>\n    Claudet\n   </em>\n   case or the law review article supports plaintiffs' argument for the recovery of insurance premiums in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Additionally, the court notes that although the Oklahoma Supreme Court adopted the loss of a chance doctrine in\n   <em>\n    McKellips v.

Like plaintiffs in this case, the\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs similarly relied upon the cited constitutional and statutory provisions to support their requested remedy. Judge Miles-LaGrange, however, found that neither the constitutional provision nor the statutory provisions supported a conclusion that medical monitoring remedy was available under Oklahoma law. The court concludes that the same is true with respect to plaintiffs' request for recovery of insurance premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In interpreting the constitutional remedy guarantee in Article 2, Section 6, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has held that Section 6 is intended \"to guarantee that the judiciary would be open and available for the resolution of disputes, but not to guarantee that any particular set of events would result in court-awarded relief.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Anadarko v.

Hence, the court concludes that Section 6 does not support a conclusion that plaintiffs are entitled to the remedy of recovery of insurance premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   With respect to the statutory provisions, Section 3 and Section 61 of Title 23, the Oklahoma courts have determined that these provisions declare or codify common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    WRG Constr. Co. v. Hoebel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11955830\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/600/334/#p336\">\n    600 P.2d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (Okla. 1979) ;\n   <em>\n    Commercial Fin.

Civ. App. 2006). Recovery of insurance premiums, including increased insurance premiums, has not been recognized under Oklahoma common law. The court therefore concludes that the statutory provisions do not support a finding that plaintiffs are entitled to recoup their insurance premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The crux of the matter is that plaintiffs seek to recover the cost, or increased cost, of insuring against a risk, or heightened risk, of earthquake damage which has not yet occurred. In determining the circumstances in which a claimed loss may be shifted to an alleged tortfeasor, tort law in general, and Oklahoma tort law in particular, focuses (among other things) on: (i) the severity of the risk of loss, (ii) the nature of the activity causing the specific loss complained of by the plaintiff, and (iii) whether the loss asserted by the plaintiff - here, premiums or increased premiums paid for earthquake insurance - is sufficiently distinct from the general vicissitudes of life that (even if caused by the alleged tortfeasor, a matter not addressed in this order) the loss may be laid at the feet of the alleged tortfeasor. The vicissitudes of life unavoidably present risks of harm which, equally unavoidably, vary in terms of severity and actual impact on any particular individual. As a prerequisite to the existence of a viable cause of action (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the right to use the machinery of the state to compel payment of recompense for the asserted loss), the law generally awaits the\n   <em>\n    materialization\n   </em>\n   of that risk in the form of some tangible harm, which generally must consist of personal injury or property damage. This limitation simply recognizes the fact that life abounds with events and phenomena by which a generalized risk faced by one person is increased in some way by the activities of another. The law waits for something more concrete to happen - for the risk to materialize. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has made it clear that these fundamental precepts are not modified by the constitutional and statutory provisions relied upon by the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, the risk of earthquake damage, though present like most any other kind of risk, has not\n   <em>\n    materialized\n   </em>\n   : plaintiffs have suffered no damage to their homes or their persons. The court concludes that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would not allow recovery of earthquake insurance premiums or an increase in earthquake insurance premiums when plaintiffs have not sustained earthquake damage to their property or to their person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court notes that in their complaint, plaintiffs assert that they have been \"forced\" to purchase earthquake insurance or to pay higher rates for such coverage. Complaint, doc. no. 1-2, \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, 67, 93. In their briefing, they argue that their payments are being made under \"duress.\" Response, doc. no. 75, p. 25. To the extent plaintiffs seek to recover their insurance premiums based upon a theory of economic duress, the court finds that plaintiffs are not entitled to that relief. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has previously held that economic duress is not an independent tort under Oklahoma law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cimarron Pipeline Const., Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins.
