The '135 and '151 Patents generally describe a method of transparently creating a virtual private network (\"VPN\") between a client computer and a target computer, while the '504 and '211 Patents disclose a secure domain name service. On November 6, 2012, a jury found that Apple's accused VPN on Demand and FaceTime features infringed the asserted patents and that the asserted patents were not invalid (\"2012 jury verdict\"). Docket No. 790.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Apple appealed the 2012 verdict to the Federal Circuit on multiple grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VirnetX, Inc. v.

Docket No. 425 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855. Because of the consolidation and repeated references to the prior jury's verdict in front of the jury, the Court granted a new trial and unconsolidated the cases. Docket No. 500 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855. The Court conducted another jury trial September 26 to 30, 2016 on infringement for\n   FaceTime and damages for both FaceTime and VPN on Demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, VirnetX asserted that FaceTime met the \"anonymity\" requirement of the \"secure communication link\" limitation by allowing participants to communicate behind third-party network address translators (\"NATs\"). Docket No. 1036 (\"Trial Tr. 9/30/16 PM\") at 37:17-40:41. VirnetX's technical expert, Dr. Mark Jones, testified that NATs hide the private IP addresses of the persons or devices participating in a FaceTime call and therefore prevent eavesdroppers on the public internet from being able to correlate specific persons or devices behind the NAT routers participating in the call. Docket No. 1030 (\"Trial Tr. 9/27/16 AM\") at 48:10-51:18. VirnetX further asserted that it was entitled to a reasonable royalty of $1.20 per unit, for a total of $302,427,950, for the infringement of its patents by FaceTime and VPN on Demand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial Tr. 9/30/16 PM at 50:16-20. VirnetX's damages expert, Roy Weinstein, testified that, based on his analysis of comparable licenses, a reasonable royalty for Apple to pay for use of the asserted patents would be between $1.20 and $1.67 per unit. Docket No. 1032 (\"Trial Tr. 9/28/16 PM\") at 7:15-11:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Apple denied that FaceTime met the \"anonymity\" requirement of the \"secure communication link\" limitation. Trial Tr. 9/30/16 PM at 53:8-15. Apple's technical expert, Dr. Matthew Blaze, testified that FaceTime is not anonymous because eavesdroppers are able to obtain the public IP addresses of the devices participating in a FaceTime call. Docket No. 1035 (\"Trial Tr. 9/30/16 AM\") at 20:20-21:1, 114:17-21. Dr. Blaze further testified that the private IP addresses hidden by the NATs do not provide any meaningful anonymity. Trial Tr. 9/30/16 AM at 68:10-69:8. Apple also asserted that, based on an analysis of the comparable licenses by its damages expert, Christopher Bakewell, VirnetX was entitled to a royalty rate of no more than $0.10 per unit, for a total of $25,202,329, for the infringement of VPN on Demand and FaceTime. Docket No. 1033 (\"Trial Tr. 9/29/16 AM\") 63:11-16, 115:2-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 30, 2016, the jury returned a unanimous verdict. The jury found that FaceTime infringed the '211 and '504 patents and awarded $302,427,950 in damages for the collective infringement by the VPN on Demand and FaceTime features in the accused Apple products. Docket No. 1025.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. APPLE'S OMNIBUS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW UNDER RULE 50(b) AND FOR A NEW TRIAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Apple moves for judgment as a matter of law, or, alternatively, for a new trial, on non-infringement and damages. Docket No 1062 at 1. During the September 2016 trial, Apple filed two Rule 50(a) motions before the case was submitted to the jury. Docket No. 1018; Docket No. 1019. In light of Apple's Rule 50(b) motions, Apple's Rule 50(a) motions (Docket Nos. 1018 and 1019) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED-AS-MOOT\n   </strong>\n   . The Court therefore turns to Apple's Rule 50(b) Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and for a New Trial (Docket No. 1062).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicable Law Regarding Rule 50\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Judgment as a matter of law is only appropriate when \"a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a). \"The grant or\n   denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is a procedural issue not unique to patent law, reviewed under the law of the regional circuit in which the appeal from the district court would usually lie.\"\n   <em>\n    Finisar Corp. v.

As stated with respect to Apple's motion for judgment as a matter of law of non-infringement,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 I.C.1, VirnetX presented substantial evidence to support the jury's finding of infringement, and Apple has not shown that the infringement\n   finding was against the great weight of the evidence.

Refusing to give requested jury instructions requires a new trial where \"(1) the requested instruction is substantially correct; (2) the requested issue is not substantially covered in the charge; and (3) the instruction concerns an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant's ability to effectively present a given defense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, instructing the jury that the hiding of IP addresses as shown in the TARP embodiment is a \"key part of the novel solution to the specific problem identified in the prior art,\" as Apple requested, could have potentially misled the jury into believing that TARP was a requirement of the claims. Further, Apple has not shown that the Court erred in including an instruction on practicing the prior art. Apple presented testimony that NATs were in the prior art in relation to its non-infringement arguments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 9/30/16 AM at 67:15-17; 67:22-25; 159:9-19; 185:24-186:2, and Apple has not argued that the Court's instruction misstated the law.

VirnetX states that Apple presented this argument in its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX further contends that it was not improper for Mr. Weinstein to rely on Dr. Jones's analysis and that Mr. Weinstein's opinion was based on other information as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. VirnetX also argues that it did not violate the entire market value rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. VirnetX states that the jury never heard the price of an Apple device and that Apple's arguments about the jurors' knowledge of its prices are pure conjecture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32. VirnetX further argues that any reference to prices would have been a proper response to Apple's improper royalty stacking arguments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   VirnetX also argues that the Court properly excluded evidence of the PTAB proceedings. VirnetX states that the Federal Circuit has already affirmed the exclusion of evidence from the PTAB proceedings in this case and that this Court rejected the same argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34. VirnetX argues that its description of the invention and its criticism of Apple's infringement cannot make these proceedings relevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. VirnetX contends that the PTAB proceedings have no effect on the presumed validity of its patents until the final exhaustion of VirnetX's appellate rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing 35 U.S.C. Section 318(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   VirnetX next contends that the jury instructions on damages were proper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. VirnetX states that, contrary to Apple's arguments, the Court did provide guidance to the jury about the entire market value rule by instructing the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [I]n determining a reasonable royalty, you must not rely on the overall price of Apple's accused products at issue in this case. Damages for patent infringement must be apportioned to reflect the value the invention contributes to the accused products or features and must not include value from the accused products or features that is not attributable to the patent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36 (quoting Docket No. 1021 at 4). VirnetX argues that this instruction provided the jury the necessary guidance to properly determine the royalty rate and that Apple's proposed instruction would only have made the jury more likely to improperly apply the entire market value rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   VirnetX also argues that the Court's instruction on the hypothetical negotiation was accurate and that Apple's proposed instruction was legally incorrect and misleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. VirnetX states that the Court's instruction has been used by numerous courts in this district and that it accurately captures the concept of the hypothetical negotiation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. VirnetX contends that the difference between what an infringer \"should expect\" to pay and what an infringer \"would be willing\" to pay would only be different in the case of a willful infringer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX further states that even if the difference between those two phrases could cause confusion, the charge as a whole correctly instructed the jury on the concept.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. VirnetX also contends that Apple's proposed instruction is legally inaccurate because the willingness of a patent owner to receive a certain royalty does not define the result of the hypothetical negotiation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX further argues that the willingness of the infringer to pay a certain sum is relevant if it presented in the context of what the infringer would pay while still maintaining a reasonable expectation of profit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. VirnetX also contends that because Apple shielded the jury from its profit margins, Apple's proposed instruction did not explain the concept in proper context.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, VirnetX states that the jury's damages award was proper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX notes that two different juries presented with nearly identical damages evidence awarded substantially similar awards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX refers to its previous arguments regarding the substantial evidence that supported the jury's verdict and argues that Apple is simply re-urging arguments the jury rejected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX states that Apple's belief that the jury should have reached a different conclusion does not justify a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court finds that Apple is not entitled to a new trial on damages. As stated above in the Court's analysis of Apple's motion for judgment as a matter of law on damages, VirnetX presented substantial evidence to support the jury's damages award, and Apple has not shown that the award was against the great weight of the evidence or that there was any other deficiency present in the trial that would warrant a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 I.C.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Apple's argument that Mr. Weinstein's testimony should be excluded is substantially the same as its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   argument, which the Court rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 362 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855. Apple has not presented any reason the Court should reconsider that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Next, Apple's contention that Mr. Weinstein provided improper reasonableness checks is unpersuasive. Mr. Weinstein's reliance on Dr. Jones's analysis was not improper, as damages experts frequently rely on technical experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apple Inc. v. Motorola, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4126204\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/1286/#p1321\">\n    757 F.3d 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\"Consistent with Rule 703, patent damages experts often rely on technical expertise outside of their field when evaluating design around options or valuing the importance of the specific, infringing features in a complex device.\"). Mr. Weinstein's opinion was also based on facts other than Dr. Jones's analysis, and those facts were identified in his expert report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 9/28/16 PM 28:23-30:1; Docket No. 338-2 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855 at \u00b6\u00b6 221-26. Further, the Court fails to see how VirnetX could have invited the jury to use the price of Apple's devices as a reasonableness check when it is undisputed that the price of Apple's devices was never presented to the jury and when the Court specifically instructed the jury not to consider the full price of Apple's devices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1021 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Apple's argument that a new trial is warranted because evidence of the PTAB proceedings was excluded is also unpersuasive. VirnetX's appeals of those proceedings are ongoing and none of the asserted claims has been cancelled. Further, because the issue of willfulness was tried to the bench, the PTAB proceedings have little, if any, relevance to the issues presented to the jury, and VirnetX's discussion of the advantages over the prior art of its patents-which are still presumed valid-did not make the PTAB proceedings relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Apple's next argument, that the jury should have been instructed on the entire market value rule and that the instruction on the hypothetical negotiation was incorrect, similarly fails. Though the prices of Apple's devices were never presented to the jury, the Court instructed the jury, out of an abundance of caution, not to rely on the full price of any Apple product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1021 at 4. The Court presumes that the jury followed this instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Francis v. Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202354\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/307/\">\n    471 U.S. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202354\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/307/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202354\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/307/\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Further instructions on the precise contours of the entire market value rule may have led the jury to mistakenly believe that it could apply the rule despite the fact that the record did not support the rule's applicability. Further, the Court's instructions on the hypothetical\n   negotiation do not warrant a new trial. The instruction as a whole properly conveyed to the jury that the reasonable royalty should reflect the fair market value of the technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, the jury's verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence. The majority of Apple's arguments on this point were presented in its motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the Court has rejected above.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 I.C.2. Apple's only new argument, that VirnetX attempted to inflame the jury by using the term \"non-infringing alternative\" and by stating that its licenses were public, is unpersuasive. The jury was presented with substantial evidence to support its award, and the Court instructed the jury on how to properly determine damages. The Court will not second-guess the jury's decision merely because Apple claims that the jury's decision was based on passion rather than reasoned deliberation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, Apple's motion for a new trial on damages is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Apple's motion for judgment as a matter of law of non-infringement, motion for judgment as a matter of law on damages, motion for a new trial on infringement, and motion for a new trial on damages (Docket No. 1062) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    II. VIRNETX'S REQUEST FOR A FINDING OF WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The parties presented the issue of willfulness through briefing and oral argument (Docket No. 1042). VirnetX filed a Post-Trial Brief Regarding Willfulness (Docket No. 1047), and in response, Apple filed an Opposition to VirnetX's Post-Trial Brief Regarding Willfulness (Docket No. 1055). On November 22, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing on willfulness and various post-trial motions. Docket No. 1075. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Apple willfully infringed VirnetX's patents by making, selling and offering for sale accused products containing the infringing VPN on Demand and FaceTime features.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   VirnetX filed its Complaint against Apple on August 11, 2010, alleging patent infringement. Docket No. 1. On November 6, 2012, a jury found that the accused VPN on Demand and FaceTime features infringed the asserted patents and that the asserted patents were not invalid. Docket No. 790. After the jury rendered its verdict, Apple continued to sell products containing the accused features for a period of time before redesigning the accused features. PX1007; Docket Nos. 463, 475 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Beginning in July 2011, Apple and other entities began filing post-grant proceedings challenging the validity of the asserted patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"Patent Office\"). Docket No. 1055-C; Docket No. 980-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 36, 43, 45, 55, 60, 67, 73. Before the 2012 jury trial began, the Patent Office had rejected all asserted claims as invalid in an\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   reexamination on multiple grounds and prior-art references. Docket No. 585.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Approximately five months after the jury returned its verdict, Apple announced that it would remove the infringing \"Always\" mode from VPN on Demand. PX1007. After it announced the change, however, Apple received negative feedback from its customers. PX1012.03. As a result, Apple decided not to remove the infringing \"Always\" mode. PX1126. Six months later, Apple released a new version of VPN on Demand. Docket Nos. 463, 475 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855. In sum, Apple continued to sell products with the infringing VPN on\n   Demand feature for 10 months after the 2012 jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Apple also redesigned its FaceTime feature to route all calls through relay servers approximately five months after the 2012 jury verdict. Docket No. 47 (\"Hr'g Tr.\") in Case No. 6:13-cv-211 at 48:25-49:4. During the 2012 trial, Apple's corporate representative estimated that it would cost Apple only $3.6 million to route its FaceTime calls via relay servers. Docket No. 613 (\"Trial Tr. 11/2/12 AM\") at 68:3-17. However, Apple ultimately paid $50 million to route FaceTime calls through relay servers for just 21 months. Hr'g Tr. at 24:4-6, 48:25-49:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The parties dispute whether Apple willfully infringed VirnetX's patents through its VPN on Demand and FaceTime features between the date of the 2012 jury verdict and the date that each feature was redesigned. For the VPN on Demand feature, the parties agree that the relevant period is November 6, 2012 to September 17, 2013, which is approximately 10 months. Docket No. 1075 at 31:21-32:11, 47:15-24. For the FaceTime feature, the parties agree that the relevant period is November 6, 2012 to April 5, 2013, which is approximately five months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

VirnetX contends that Apple's post-verdict behavior was reckless because the evidence indicates that Apple abandoned its VPN On\n   Demand redesign-not based on an appellate position-but in response to customer complaints. Id. at 5-6. According to VirnetX, there is in fact no record evidence that Apple's continued use of the adjudged infringing version of VPN On Demand was based on Apple's appellate position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   With respect to FaceTime, VirnetX argues that Apple's conduct was especially egregious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX explains that during the 2012 trial, Apple's corporate representative inaccurately described the cost of implementing a non-infringing version of FaceTime, which was corrected in post-trial briefing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to VirnetX, Apple implemented that non-infringing relay version of FaceTime on April 5, 2013 but abandoned the version in mid-September 2013 because of the cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

Docket No. 1055 at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Fresenius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755538\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/1330/#p1347\">\n    721 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1340 ). In\n   <em>\n    Fresenius\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit held that the cancellation of patent claims through Patent Office proceedings extinguishes any pending cause of action on those claims, even if there has already been a jury verdict upholding validity on the same claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755538\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/1330/#p1347\">\n    721 F.3d at 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Fresenius\n   </em>\n   , however, the post-grant proceedings on VirnetX's patents have not resulted in cancellation of the asserted claims, as appeals of those proceedings are still ongoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755538\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/1330/#p1347\">\n    721 F.3d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, though Apple claims that the PTAB's final written decisions \"confirm\" Apple's belief in the invalidity of the asserted patents, these decisions were issued long after Apple's decision to continue infringing despite an adverse jury verdict. The later result of a Patent Office proceeding does not bear on Apple's subjective willfulness or recklessness at the time of its infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Apple asserts that the proposition that post-verdict infringement generally constitutes willful infringement was determined to be improper in\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   and other cases because willful infringement must be evaluated based on a totality of the circumstances. Docket No. 1055 at 8 n.2. The Court disagrees that\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases refute the position that post-verdict infringement generally constitutes willful infringement. It is unclear how\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   , which functionally eliminated the objective prong of\n   <em>\n    Seagate\n   </em>\n   and lessened the requirements for a finding of willfulness, would have the effect of narrowing the range of cases where a finding of willfulness may be appropriate. Further, the general presumption\n   that post-verdict infringement is willful is consistent with a totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry, as the presumption requires courts to consider the specific circumstances of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246133\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/783/891/#p899\">\n    783 F.Supp.2d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Following a jury verdict and entry of judgment of infringement and no invalidity, a defendant's continued infringement will be willful absent very unusual circumstances.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, VirnetX has not waived the issue of willfulness in this case. Although it was not included in the complaint, willfulness was addressed in Judge Davis's order (Docket No. 48 in Case No. 6:13-cv-211) and included on the verdict form for the consolidated trial (Docket No. 425 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855 at 5). Additionally, an allegation of willfulness with respect to post-trial infringing activity could not have been included in the original complaint because, at the time of filing, VirnetX could not have anticipated the verdict, Apple's post-verdict conduct, or the willful nature of that conduct. Because the issue here is focused on post-verdict continuing sales of an infringing feature, the Court finds that willfulness is not waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SynQor, Inc. v.

VirnetX further argues there was undisputed evidence that FaceTime was designed to support connection through NAT routers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, VirnetX contends that Apple's changing positions regarding what constituted \"anonymity\" reflect that Apple did not have a good-faith belief that FaceTime was non-infringing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   VirnetX further argues that the amount of the jury verdict supports the conclusion that the case was not close.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX states that the verdict matched exactly the royalty rate of $1.20 per unit that VirnetX requested and indicates an \"unmistakable rejection\" of the $0.10 per unit royalty rate proposed by Apple.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   VirnetX also contends that the PTAB proceedings in this case are irrelevant to the enhancement analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX argues that the PTAB decisions are irrelevant because they did not issue until after the willfulness period ended and cannot support a finding that Apple had a good-faith belief in invalidity at the time of the willful infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX further argues that the PTAB proceedings are not relevant because of the differences between PTAB proceedings and district court litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. VirnetX contends that district court claim-construction standards are more tailored to evaluating a\n   party's actual belief in invalidity than the PTAB's standards because, VirnetX argues, district courts seek to capture the scope of the actual invention while the PTAB looks to the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX argues that because the PTAB construed the claims to include a broader scope than what Apple agreed was the correct scope in the district court proceedings, the PTAB proceedings should have little relevance to Apple's good-faith belief in the invalidity of the patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   VirnetX next argues that enhancement is warranted because Apple repeatedly attempted to delay resolution of the case and to increase VirnetX's litigation costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. VirnetX contends that Apple sought to stay the case three times, forced VirnetX to file five motions to compel, sought summary judgment on multiple grounds, all of which were denied, twice moved for a mistrial, sought post-verdict relief on nearly every conceivable ground, and attempted to inject issues about its own counsel's and jury consultant's conflicts of interest mid-trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. VirnetX also points to Apple's attempts to invalidate VirnetX's patents at the Patent Office as another example of Apple's delaying- and cost-raising tactics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX states that Apple has petitioned for 18 reexaminations or\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   reviews (\"IPRs\"), paid a third party to file seven additional petitions after its time bar had expired, and has filed, caused to be filed, or moved to join 54 post-grant proceedings against VirnetX at the Patent Office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. VirnetX argues that Apple's conduct is an abuse of the post-grant review system and was primarily an attempt to drive up VirnetX's litigation expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   VirnetX argues that Apple further added to the length and overall cost of the case by filing a motion to stay after the second trial, even though all the issues presented in its motion occurred before the trial and even though validity was no longer an issue in the case because the Federal Circuit had affirmed the first jury's finding of no invalidity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX contends that Apple similarly gambled on the outcome of the second trial by discussing the prior verdict and appeal during that trial, then filing a motion for new trial based on VirnetX's discussion of the prior trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. VirnetX also argues that Apple increased costs by litigating issues that were no longer in dispute, such as infringement of the \"indication\" claim term, which Apple's own expert admitted was practiced by FaceTime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   VirnetX also contends that Apple has not litigated this case in good faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. In support of this argument, VirnetX points to the testimony of an Apple employee during the 2012 trial who, the Court found, made gross misrepresentations to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX states that Apple witnesses in the second trial made similar misrepresentations to the jury and that Apple then sought to exclude these misrepresentations in the retrial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, VirnetX argues that Apple and its counsel created two serious and potentially disqualifying conflicts of interest by the lateral hiring of an appellate attorney and the hiring of a jury consultant, both of whom had previously worked on this case for VirnetX.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. VirnetX contends that Apple then used these potential conflicts to disrupt and attempt to derail the trial by repeatedly requesting advisory opinions while refusing discovery on these issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Next, VirnetX argues that enhancement is warranted because Apple has infringed its patents for years without taking any real remedial action to stop infringing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. As to VPN on Demand, VirnetX states that the original version has been an adjudicated, infringing feature since November 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX argues that Apple's\n   redesign of the feature resulted in no meaningful change to the infringement analysis, as Apple merely moved the infringing feature from one mode of VPN on Demand to another and added components its own witnesses admitted had no utility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As to FaceTime, VirnetX argues that Apple's redesign was based on rejected claim-construction positions and that the changes are irrelevant for purposes of infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. VirnetX contends that Apple's only actual attempt at a remedial measure was its \"relay\" redesign, which, VirnetX states, Apple abandoned because of its prohibitive cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. VirnetX argues that Apple's redesigns were only attempts to give the appearance of non-infringement, which led to increased litigation over slightly different versions of infringing features.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Finally, VirnetX argues that Apple's size and wealth favor enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VirnetX states that Apple is the richest publicly traded company in the world and argues that substantial enhancement is necessary to ensure Apple does not continue to willfully infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In response, Apple contends that VirnetX should not be awarded enhanced damages because VirnetX has not proven egregious infringement behavior and because the\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factors weigh against enhancement. Docket No. 1066 at 3, 6. Apple contends that its behavior was not egregious because it believed that the patents-in-suit were invalid-a belief, it argues, that has been confirmed by the PTAB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Apple also argues that it had a good-faith belief in its infringement positions related to both FaceTime and VPN on Demand. Apple points to the Federal Circuit's remand as evidence of the reasonableness of its non-infringement arguments for FaceTime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to VPN on Demand, Apple states that its efforts to pursue a redesign while appealing the infringement verdict show that it did not act egregiously.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Apple argues that each of the\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factors confirms that enhancement is not warranted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Apple argues that the first factor weighs against enhancement because there is no evidence in the record that Apple copied the asserted patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Apple states that its engineers designed and implemented the accused features well before Apple learned of VirnetX's patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Apple next argues that it investigated the scope of VirnetX's patents and formed a good-faith belief that the patents were invalid and not infringed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apple points to the PTAB's final written decisions finding each asserted claim invalid and to the Federal Circuit's remand as evidence of the reasonableness of these beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   As to the third\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor, which concerns conduct during litigation, Apple argues that it litigated fairly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apple contends that VirnetX's arguments regarding Apple's conduct during the 2012 trial were rejected by Judge Davis when he denied VirnetX's motion for attorneys' fees following trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (citing Docket No. 732). In Apple's view, the fact that the Federal Circuit agreed with Apple and remanded the case for retrial on both damages and infringement of FaceTime weighs strongly against enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Apple also contends there was nothing abusive about its use of post-grant proceedings at the Patent Office and argues that its filing of motions to stay, for summary judgment, and requests for mistrial was not improper, noting that VirnetX never moved for Rule 11 sanctions at any point in the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Apple further argues that its prompt handling of the potential conflicts of interest that arose during the September 2016 trial demonstrate that Apple and\n   its counsel handled the case responsibly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   According to Apple, VirnetX's conduct is also relevant to the enhancement analysis. Apple argues that VirnetX has engaged in dilatory and cost-increasing behavior in the litigation and related Patent Office proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Apple argues that, because VirnetX filed more than 75 petitions for extension at the PTAB, filed rejected interlocutory appeals of those proceedings, sought production of over 860,000 documents and more than 50 depositions in pretrial, and made improper arguments at the consolidated trial, VirnetX is the party that engaged in improper behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apple maintains that it acted properly during a hard-fought case and argues that this factor weighs against enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Regarding the fourth\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor, the size and financial condition of the defendant, Apple argues that its success is due in large part to its culture of innovation and that the verdict should not be increased because of that success.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Apple contends that the fifth\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor, which concerns the closeness of the case, should weigh against enhancement because Apple presented reasonable and justified defenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For non-infringement, Apple argues that it had a strong defense for why FaceTime is not anonymous, repeating its arguments related to its motion for judgment as a matter of law of non-infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. As to VPN on Demand, Apple argues that, although the Federal Circuit found the jury's verdict of infringement to be supported by substantial evidence, Apple's defense was reasonable and justifiable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. As to invalidity, Apple again notes that it has challenged the validity of the asserted patents at the Patent Office since before the first trial and that the PTAB has issued final written decisions of unpatentability for every asserted claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Apple argues that these proceedings are relevant because they were pending during the willfulness period and therefore show that Apple had a good-faith belief in its invalidity positions during the relevant timeframe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, Apple disputes VirnetX's assertion that anything can be gleaned about the strength of the case from the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Regarding the sixth\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor, the duration of the misconduct, Apple argues that it promptly redesigned its product and that this factor weighs against enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Apple contends that the amount of time it took to redesign each product, 11 months for VPN on Demand and five months for FaceTime, was no more than was necessary to implement its redesigns, which required collaboration among its engineers, management, and legal team to design and implement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apple contends that these facts also support a finding that the seventh\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor, related to remedial action, weighs against enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Apple argues that the eighth\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against enhancement because VirnetX presented no evidence that Apple had a motivation to harm VirnetX.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Apple likewise argues that VirnetX presented no evidence that Apple attempted to conceal any alleged misconduct and that this ninth factor should therefore weigh against enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   After carefully considering the\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factors in light of Apple's overall conduct, the Court finds that enhancement is appropriate in this case. Apple's continued infringement after the 2012 verdict cannot be credibly justified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SynQor, Inc. v.

Factor 2, related to investigation and good-faith belief of no liability, weighs in favor of enhancement. Apple contends that its good-faith belief in its infringement positions and its post-grant challenges to the patents' validity mitigate against an award of enhanced damages, but after the jury's verdict finding the claims infringed and valid, its reliance on these beliefs was no longer reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mondis Tech.

Apple repeatedly sought either to stay the litigation pending post-grant proceedings or to inject evidence of the proceedings into the trial, even after receiving adverse rulings from the Court and even after few, if any, relevant facts had changed since its last request, and despite the fact that invalidity was no longer in the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Nos. 32, 499, and 515 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Enhancement is appropriate here to address Apple's willful infringement and conduct. Having found three factors favoring enhancement, one factor slightly favoring enhancement, and five factors being neutral, and having considered Apple's post-verdict infringement, the Court is satisfied that a 50 percent enhancement of the damages for this timeframe is appropriate. Trebling damages for the agreed willfulness period would result in an enhancement of $165,085,459 for a total damages award of $467,513,409. However, given the totality of the circumstances and in light of the size of the award VirnetX is otherwise due, enhancing damages to the maximum extent allowable under \u00a7 284 is not warranted, although some lesser but meaningful enhancement is appropriate in light of Apple's willful infringement. Accordingly, the royalty rate applied to the 68,785,608 units sold during the willfulness period will be increased 50 percent, from $1.20 to $1.80. VirnetX is hereby awarded enhanced damages in the amount of $41,271,364.80 against Apple and shall have and recover from Apple the total sum of $343,699,314.80 in pre-interest damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As stated above in the context of the\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factors, Apple repeatedly sought either to stay the litigation pending its post-grant proceedings or to inject evidence of those proceedings into the trial, even after receiving adverse rulings from the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 32, 499, and 518 in Case No. 6:12-cv-855.

As to the jury consultant who worked for VirnetX during the first trial and was hired by Apple for the third trial, Apple states that before it hired him, Apple received a statement that he had no conflicts on the case. Docket No. 1066-3. However, Apple's failure to ensure that its consultant actually had no conflicts unnecessarily complicated the trial. Further, Apple asked the Court for several advisory opinions regarding either a potential mistrial or disqualification of counsel because of the conflict, all the while refusing to give VirnetX even basic discovery on the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 9/26/16 AM at 24:18-22; Trial Tr. 9/29/16 PM at 83:1-104:5. Likewise, Apple sought multiple advisory opinions on the potential conflict created by VirnetX's appellate counsel joining Apple's counsel's firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 994; Docket No. 1004; Trial Tr. 9/29/16 PM at 83:1-104:5. While the Court finds nothing improper about VirnetX's former appellate counsel joining Apple's counsel's firm, Apple's haste in seeking advisory opinions, combined with its delay in providing VirnetX with the relevant facts, demonstrates a level of gamesmanship regarding conflicts it created that the Court finds weighs in favor of a finding of an exceptional case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds the case to be exceptional as to the third trial. However, the Court notes that Judge Davis declined to award attorneys' fees after the first trial and that a new trial was granted after the second trial in part because of VirnetX's own repeated references to the first jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 732 at 44; Docket No. 893 at 1.
