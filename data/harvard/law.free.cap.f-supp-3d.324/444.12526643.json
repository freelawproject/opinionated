Respondents are directed to provide Petitioner such a bond hearing within 14 days of this Opinion and Order.

The Petition is denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following summary of the pertinent facts of this case is drawn from the Petition unless otherwise indicated. Brissett is a citizen of Jamaica and has been a lawful permanent resident (\"LPR\") of the United States since 2010. (Petition \u00b6 1.) Brissett has strong family ties in the United States: he has been married to a United States citizen for 19 years, he has one daughter who is a United States citizen, and he has two sons who, like him, are LPRs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 28, 2017, Brissett and his wife traveled to Jamaica for a friend's wedding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) When they returned on October 31, 2017, Brissett was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport after presenting a valid Jamaican passport and United States Lawful Permanent Resident Card. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 1, 2017, the DHS issued a Notice to Appear, charging Brissett with three counts of inadmissibility based on an April 2016 state drug-related felony conviction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 29; Docket Entry No. 13-2.) Brissett had spent no time in prison for the narcotics offense; he was sentenced to 18 months of probation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 41) Brissett has been detained at the Bergen County Jail since the Government instituted removal proceedings against him on November 1, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Four \"master calendar hearings\" have been held in Brissett's case since his initial detention, but he has not received a bond hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 14, \"Zabbia Decl.\") Brissett's first master calendar hearing took place on December 27, 2017. (Zabbia Decl. \u00b6 13.) At this hearing, the Immigration Judge adjourned the case to January 30, 2018, for a master calendar hearing on \"pleadings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 11, 2018, Brissett propounded a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"). (Zabbia Decl. \u00b6 14.) At the January 30, 2018, hearing, Brissett denied DHS' charges of removability and moved to terminate the removal proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. Section 1240.12(c). (Petition \u00b6\u00b6 5 n.1, 8; Docket Entry No. 16-2.) The Immigration Judge adjourned the case to a third master calendar hearing on February 27, 2018, for \"applications for relief from removal.\" (Zabbia Decl. \u00b6 15.) Brissett appeared at the February 27, 2018, hearing, but DHS \"indicated that it had been unable to brief the ...\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I) CIMT charge\" because it had sent Brissett's administrative file to USCIS to respond to Brissett's FOIA request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18.) As a result, the Immigration Judge adjourned the case to a fourth master calendar hearing on March 29, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) On March 29, 2018, Brissett applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to INA Section 240A. (Docket Entry No. 16-7.) The March 29, 2018, hearing was rescheduled to March 30, 2018, and again rescheduled to June 5, 2018, because the Immigration Judge was not available to hear Brissett's case on March 30, 2018. (Zabbia Decl. \u00b6 21.) Brissett then successfully moved to expedite the June 5, 2018, hearing to May 10, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23.) On May 10, 2018, the Immigration Judge adjourned the case to August 23, 2018, for a merits hearing on Brissett's application for cancellation of removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Brissett's counsel asserts that \"Mr. Brissett's hearing may very likely continue after [the August 23, 2018] hearing date\" due to \"the crowded dockets at the Varick Street Immigration\n   Court.\" (Docket Entry No. 17 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Section 2241 of Title 28 of the United States Code\"authorizes a district court to grant a writ of habeas corpus whenever a petitioner is 'in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wang v.

From these sources, recent decisions in this District have drawn five factors for consideration in determining whether an alien's detention is \"unreasonable or unjustified\" in violation of the Due Process Clause: \"(1) the length of time the alien has been detained; (2) whether the alien is responsible for the delay; (3) whether the alien has asserted defenses to removal; (4) whether the alien's civil immigration detention exceeds the time the alien spent in prison for the crime that rendered him removable; and (5) whether the facility for the civil immigration detention is meaningfully different from a penal institution for criminal detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203579108\">\n    2018 WL 3579108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sajous\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357266\">\n    2018 WL 2357266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Having reviewed the facts pertaining to Brissett's detention in light of these factors, the Court concludes that Brissett's detention has been unreasonably prolonged and that he therefore is entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness to the community. First, Brissett has been detained since November 1, 2017-over nine months. While\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   held that Section 1225 does not contain an implicit six-month time limit on alien detention,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p833\">\n    138 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court has also noted that \"Congress previously doubted the constitutionality of detention for more than six months.\"\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p693\">\n    533 U.S. at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p693\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, \"detention that has lasted longer than six months is more likely to be unreasonable, and thus contrary to due process, than detention of less than six months.\"\n   <em>\n    Sajous\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357266\">\n    2018 WL 2357266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \"the likely duration of continued detention is pertinent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357266\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The length of Brissett's detention-currently over nine months-weighs in favor of finding that his detention is unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   His detention is also likely to continue, given the series of delays he has already experienced in the processing of his immigration proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, Brissett is not responsible for the delay in his proceedings. To the\n   contrary, Brissett has sought to expedite hearings. To the extent that his actions have caused any delay, it has only been as a result of Brissett's efforts to obtain relief from removal. But \"pursuit of relief from removal does not, in itself, undermine a claim that detention is unreasonably prolonged.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203579108\">\n    2018 WL 3579108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. In Brissett's case, either DHS' failure to timely brief its charge of inadmissibility or the backlogs at the Immigration Court has been at the root of each delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, Brissett has asserted several defenses to removal. The \"purpose behind the detention is premised upon the alien's deportability.\"\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p532\">\n    538 U.S. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p532\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring). Detention becomes attenuated from its purpose, then, when the alien asserts defenses to his or her deportability.\n   <em>\n    Sajous\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357266\">\n    2018 WL 2357266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. On January 30, 2018, Brissett moved to terminate the removal proceedings brought against him, arguing that he was incorrectly classified as an arriving alien because he is an LPR. (Docket Entry No. 16-2.) In March 2018, he applied for cancellation of his removal proceedings, arguing that he satisfies the cancellation requirements set forth in 8 U.S.C. Section 1229b(a). (Docket Entry No. 16-7.) While the Court does not (and need not) express an opinion as to the merits of Petitioner's defenses, the Court notes that there is no contention that they are frivolous ones.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203579108\">\n    2018 WL 3579108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. The fact that Brissett has asserted multiple defenses to his deportability further weighs in favor of finding his detention unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Fourth, Brissett's civil immigration detention exceeds the time he spent in prison for the crime that allegedly renders him removable. Indeed, Brissett was sentenced to probation and served no prison time for the crime that DHS maintains renders Brissett removable. Therefore, Brissett's civil immigration detention, which has lasted over nine months, far exceeds the time he spent in prison for the crime that allegedly renders him removable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fifth, the facility where Brissett is detained is not \"meaningfully different from a penal institution for criminal detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Sajous\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357266\">\n    2018 WL 2357266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. In fact, there is no difference at all: Brissett is detained at the Bergen County Jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Each of the five factors discussed provides substantial support for the Court's determination that Brissett's continued detention without a bond hearing is unreasonable and unconstitutional. Therefore, the Court concludes that Petitioner is entitled to an individualized bond hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether he is a flight risk or poses a danger to the community such that continued detention is warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural Requirements for Bond Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Petitioner asserts that, at his bond hearing, the Government should bear the burden of proof.

The Second Circuit has held that the Government's position is\n   substantially justified if it \"had a reasonable basis in both law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122211\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/154/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). The Court concludes that Respondents' position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact for two reasons. First, based on the plain language of 8 U.S.C. Section 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), it was reasonable for Respondents to conclude that Petitioner's April 2016 drug conviction was a violation of a state law \"relating to a controlled substance,\" which, in turn, rendered Petitioner \"not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted\" to the United States and, thus, rendered him properly detained under 8 U.S.C. Section 1225(b)(2)(A). Second, although the Court was ultimately unpersuaded by Respondents' arguments, the Court concludes that they were reasonable. Respondents' position that Petitioner was not entitled to a bond hearing was reasonable (i) in light of the absence of precedent from the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit, and (ii) in light of Respondents' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Demore v. Kim\n   </em>\n   , which holds that \"the Government may constitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary for their removal proceedings.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p532\">\n    538 U.S. at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p532\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, where the issues presented in Brissett's Petition are \"far from settled law,\" \"there is no doubt that the Government is entitled- if not obligated-to put forth a good faith effort to defend the constitutionality of federal laws, especially those that have never been found unconstitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Vacchio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014882\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/404/663/#p674\">\n    404 F.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because the Court concludes that Respondents' position in this case was substantially justified, Petitioner's request for an award of costs and attorneys' fees is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Petition is granted to the extent that the Court finds that Petitioner is entitled to an individualized bond hearing in which the Government bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that Petitioner poses a risk of flight or a danger to the community.
