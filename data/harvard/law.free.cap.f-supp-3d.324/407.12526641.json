WOODS, United States District Judge\n   On February 15, 2016, Kanye West tweeted that his new album-\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   -\"will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale ... You can only get it on Tidal.\" Six weeks later, the album was on Apple, and was for sale on sites other than Tidal, the online streaming service operated by defendant Aspiro AB (\"Aspiro\"). The plaintiff, Mr. Baker-Rhett, on behalf of himself and a putative class, claims that statements by Aspiro and Mr. West were deceptive-and that they fraudulently induced him to pay for Tidal's services in order to obtain access to its purportedly exclusive content. Mr. West's allegedly false Tweet provides adequate support for the plaintiff's common law fraudulent inducement claims. However, because Mr. Baker-Rhett viewed the allegedly false representations and subscribed to Tidal outside of New York, he does not satisfy the territoriality requirement for the claims he asserts under Sections 349 and 350 of New York's General Business law. For those, and the other reasons set forth below, the defendants' motions to dismiss are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Aspiro Struggles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Aspiro launched Tidal-a high fidelity music streaming site-in 2014. Second Am. Compl. (ECF No. 59) \u00b6 20. Shortly thereafter, Aspiro was acquired by rap impresario Sean Carter-known to the world as Jay-Z-and a holding company controlled by him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Mr. Carter announced to the world that Tidal would be \"the streaming home\" for artists like himself and other bold faced names in the music industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Tidal was marketed as the first \"artist-owned\" streaming service, and a number of musicians, including defendant Kanye West, were offered 3% stakes in the company \"in exchange for creating Tidal exclusive content to drive consumers to the subscription only streaming site.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The artist-owners of Tidal leveraged their massive presence on social media to promote Tidal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. For example, in February 2015, Mr. West tweeted his millions of Twitter followers: \"Please to all my friends fans and music lovers. Sign up to Tidal now.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Despite the sizzle created by the marketing efforts of Tidal's owner-artists, the service itself soon fizzled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Indeed, Tidal's \"inability to generate revenue led many in the music industry to believe the media platform faced almost imminent doom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tidal admitted in early 2015 that the company had insufficient funds to last for another year; and conceded that it would \"have to achieve an extreme and\n   unprecedented growth in number of subscribers simply to survive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Pablo to the Rescue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the midst of Tidal's struggles, Mr. West announced that his next album-\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   -would be released exclusively on the streaming platform. According to the complaint, Mr. West is a \"musical paragon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. There is no doubting Mr. West's success as a musician; among his other accomplishments, he has twenty-one Grammy awards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He has a robust following on social media. With over 26 million followers, \"his Twitter feed is regularly at the center of a maelstrom of discussion and scrutiny by both the media and public at large.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. \"Despite Mr. West's wild success and popularity, and his personal claim as the most influential person in the world, he has been plagued with an extraordinary amount of debt....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. It was against this backdrop of financial struggle, by both Tidal and Mr. West himself, that Mr. West announced the release of his album on Tidal in early 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"It quickly became one of the most anticipated albums of 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Tidal marketed that the album was available exclusively on Tidal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the first of the series of two Tweets that form the principal basis for Plaintiff's claims here, on February 14, 2016, the official Tidal Twitter account issued the following Tweet: \"We're bringing @KanyeWests's #TLOP to fans around the globe. It's streaming exclusively on TIDAL.com.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, February 15, 2016, Mr. West tweeted from his Twitter account: \"My album will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale ... You can only get it on Tidal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. The complaint alleges that Mr. West wrote his Tweet \"both as an artist and owner of Tidal,\" and that he, \"as a part owner of Tidal, is an agent of the company and therefore capable of making statements on its behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The press reported on Mr. West's Tweet in stories with headlines like \"Kanye West says his new album will be a permanent Tidal exclusive,\" \"Kanye West Says 'The Life of Pablo' 'Will Never Be For Sale' \" and \"Kanye West: You can only get The Life of Pablo on TIDAL.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. \"Customers flocked to Tidal at a frenzied pace after Mr. West declared it would be the exclusive source of his album, and as a result, Tidal's subscription numbers skyrocketed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Indeed, within the first ten days of the release of\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   , Tidal's subscription numbers tripled from 1 million to 3 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Mr. West boasted to his Twitter followers about their impact on the increase in Tidal's subscription base.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   was available exclusively on Tidal for about a month and a half before Mr. West announced that it would be available for free streaming on both Apple Music and Spotify-somewhat less than Mr. West's tweeted \"never never never.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. The complaint alleges that the defendants always knew that\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   would not be available exclusively on Tidal forever.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. \"As such, Mr. West and Aspiro deceived customers into believing that\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   would only be available through the streaming service, when in fact it [sic] knew that statement to be false.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. The complaint claims that the defendants benefited from their alleged fraud as a result of Aspiro's increased subscriber base and subscription revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mr. Baker-Rhett Loses $9.99\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The named plaintiff, Mr. Baker-Rhett, lives in California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. He is a fan of Mr. West's music.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. Immediately after Mr. West's February 15, 2016 Tweet, Mr. Baker-Rhett signed up for Tidal's\n   streaming service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. As \"a result of viewing Tidal's\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Mr. West's announcements and representations that\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   would only ever be available on Tidal,\" Mr. Baker-Rhett believed it was the only music platform on which the album would ever be available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53 (emphasis added). He began to stream\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   that same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The first month of Mr. Baker-Rhett's subscription to Tidal was free.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. But before he learned that the album would be available on streaming sites other than Tidal, he was charged $9.99 for his second month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. After learning that the album would be available on Spotify, for which he already had a paid subscription, Mr. Baker-Rhett cancelled his subscription to Tidal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55. The cancellation was effective before he was charged for a second time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Mr. Baker-Rhett asserts that had he known that Mr. West's album would eventually be made available to stream on platforms other than Tidal, he would never have signed up for the service at all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. As a result of the defendants' allegedly deceptive Tweets, Mr. Baker-Rhett was out $9.99.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He launched this lawsuit to get it back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action in the Northern District of California against Mr. West, who resides in California, and S. Carter Enterprises, LLC. ECF No. 1. The factual predicate of the original complaint was very similar to that pleaded in the governing complaint in effect now. Significantly, however, the original complaint asserted claims arising under California state law-particularly California's false advertising law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017500\">\n    Cal.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and California common law of fraudulent inducement and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 64-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff amended his complaint on May 9, 2016, replacing defendant S. Carter Enterprises, LLC, with Aspiro, but continuing to assert claims under California law. ECF No. 5. After Aspiro filed a motion to transfer venue of the litigation to the Southern District of New York, the parties entered into a stipulation to transfer the case to this district. ECF No. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Some months after the case was transferred to this district, Aspiro filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint, arguing, among other things, that New York substantive law should apply to the plaintiff's claims, and that, as a result, the claims governed by California law should be dismissed. ECF No. 49. The motion relied heavily on the effect of the choice of law provision contained in the \"Terms and Conditions\" to which Mr. Baker-Rhett and other Tidal subscribers agreed in order to sign up for the service. That provision read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. If there is any dispute between you and Supplier about or involving the Service, by using the Service, you expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State of New York, County of New York.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ECF No. 52-2 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Aspiro's memorandum of law in support of its motion analyzed the application of this governing law provision under California law. First Aspiro Mem. of Law (ECF No. 50) (\"First Aspiro Mem.\"), at 8. In the first step of the analysis, Aspiro asserted that the claims contained in the complaint fell within the scope of the contractual governing law provision when analyzed under California law. Aspiro wrote that \"California courts take a liberal approach to governing law provisions in agreements.\n   <em>\n    Unlike in New York\n   </em>\n   , California courts do\n   not require contracting parties to explicitly state that the governing law provision will apply to claims tangential to the agreement, as well as those pertaining to the contract itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Aspiro argued that, as a result of the governing law clause \"any claims relating to the service, including his relationship with the service provider, would be governed by New York state laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Aspiro claimed that \"[t]his choice of law provision further encompasses 'any dispute between you and [Aspiro] about or involving the Service.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court highlights the fact that Aspiro's argument was expressly tethered to California law, and stated that the result would be different if analyzed under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the second step of its analysis of the governing law clause applying California law, Aspiro argued that New York bore a substantial relationship to the plaintiff's claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As part of its argument, Aspiro asserted that \"While Aspiro itself and all aspects of the sign-up process for Tidal are managed outside the United States, the individuals that approve the sending of Tweets from Tidal's Twitter account, including the Tweet referenced in paragraph 30 of the Complaint, are based in New York.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Tibon Decl. (ECF No. 51) \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The plaintiff decided not to oppose Aspiro's motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. Instead, the plaintiff entered into a stipulation to dismiss the California claims and amend the complaint. Stipulation Regarding Dismissal and Proposed Second Am. Class Action Compl. (ECF No. 58) (\"Stipulation of Dismissal\"). In the Stipulation of Dismissal, the plaintiff wrote that \"After reviewing the arguments and authorities in Aspiro's dismissal papers, Plaintiff has concluded that, in the interests of justice and efficiency, his claims should properly be asserted under New York law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. West tweeted that his album would \"never, never, never\" be available on Apple Music. Yet\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   was released on Apple Music just a month and a half later. How, then, was the statement true? Mr. West argues that the\n   <em>\n    Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   was \"updated and remixed numerous times, with different vocals, lyrics, and arrangements,\" and that only those \" 'newly updated, remixed and remastered version[s]' of\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   have been made available for purchase or streaming on platforms other than Tidal.\" West Memorandum of Law (ECF No. 100) (\"West Mem.\"), at 11-12 (citing Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 37 n.32). As a result, Mr. West claims that his Tweet was not false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. West's argument is tenuous, and certainly does not pass muster in the context of a motion to dismiss, when the Court is required to draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party. After all, Mr. West tweeted that \"\n   <em>\n    My album\n   </em>\n   will never never never be on Apple. And\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   will never be for sale\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 30 (emphasis added). He did not commit that a particular version, or mix, or master of his album would not be on Apple-his commitment was that the \"album,\" \"it,\" would not be. And the album was made available on Apple Music shortly after the Tweet. Regardless of whether or not Mr. West's argument will persuade a jury at a later stage in the case, the Court has little difficulty concluding that the complaint plausibly pleads that Mr. West's statement that his album would never never never be available on Apple Music or for sale was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The plaintiff's claim against Aspiro on the basis of Mr. West's Tweet is also supported by the facts pleaded in the complaint. The complaint alleges that Mr. West is an agent of the Aspiro and is therefore capable of making statements on its behalf.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12285543\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/153/443/12285543/#p389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Like Aspiro, the Court accepts the allegation that Mr. West was Aspiro's agent for purposes of this motion. Aspiro Reply Mem. of Law (ECF No. 106), at 6 n.2. Unlike Aspiro, the Court concludes that the complaint adequately pleads that Mr. West's statements were within the scope of his agency relationship. The complaint alleges that Mr. West received his ownership interest \"in exchange for creating Tidal exclusive content to drive consumers to the subscription only streaming platform.\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 23. Mr. West also committed his social media presence to promoting Tidal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The specific Tweet issued by Mr. West is described as a \"reaffirmation\" of Tidal's exclusivity statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. These allegations, together with the complaint's description of the business relationship between Mr. West and Tidal, are sufficient to nudge this claim across the line from conceivable to plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The complaint adequately pleads scienter against both defendants with respect to Mr. West's Tweet. Although Rule 9(b) provides that \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally,\" Fed. R. Civ.

The complaint describes in detail the dire financial condition of both Aspiro and Mr. West at the time of the release of his album. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 29. It describes the tangible benefits of an increase in Tidal's subscriber base for both defendants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 34, 41-44, 48. Most significantly, the complaint asserts that at the time that Mr. West tweeted that the album would \"never never never\" be available on Apple or for sale, both defendants knew that it soon would.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. And a mere six weeks later, it was.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. These allegations constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Aspiro's Tweet and Silence Alone Do Not Support Fraudulent Inducement Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The plaintiff's fraudulent inducement claim against Aspiro on the basis of the content of its February 14, 2015 Tweet alone is not pleaded adequately. At the outset, the plaintiff does not sufficiently plead reliance on that Tweet alone. According to the complaint, Mr. Baker-Rhett subscribed to Tidal \"[i]mmediately after viewing Mr. West's February 15, 2016 announcement....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Mr. Baker-Rhett's decision to sign up for Tidal was \"a result of viewing Tidal's\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Mr. West's announcements and representations that\n   <em>\n    The Life of Pablo\n   </em>\n   would only ever be available on Tidal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53 (emphasis added). All of the press stories touting the exclusivity of Tidal's platform focused on the content of Mr. West's Tweet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. As pleaded, the facts support the contention that Mr. Baker-Rhett relied on Mr. West's statement, but not on Tidal's alone. The lack of a plausible allegation that the plaintiff relied on Aspiro's Tweet alone may be explained by the fact that Tidal's Tweet did not contain an express commitment that the album would be available exclusively on Tidal in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After all, on its face, Tidal's Tweet was true. Tidal wrote the following: \"We're bringing @KanyeWests's #TLOP to fans around the globe. It's streaming exclusively on TIDAL.com.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. A short English primer may be warranted: \"It's\" is a contraction of \"it is.\" Tidal's statement describes the world as it was at the time it was issued. The words of Tidal's Tweet on their own cannot reasonably be construed to contain a commitment that the album \"will be\" or \"would be\" streaming exclusively on Tidal in the future. There is no allegation that Tidal's statement was false when made-the album was streaming exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016, and would remain there exclusively for another six weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Aspiro presented substantial arguments to support its position that Aspiro's Tweet cannot form the basis for a claim of misrepresentation because the facts asserted in it were true at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aspiro Mem. of Law (ECF No. 98), at 12-13; Aspiro Reply Mem. of Law (ECF No. 106), at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gosmile, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999978\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/81/77/\">\n    915 N.Y.S.2d at 524-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To state a claim for fraudulent inducement, there must be a knowing misrepresentation of material present fact....\");\n   <em>\n    Perella Weinberg Partners LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12285543\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/153/443/12285543/#p389\">\n    58 N.Y.S.3d at 389-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To fulfill the element of misrepresentation of material fact, the party advancing the claim must allege a misrepresentation of present fact\n   rather than of future intent.\");\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Jimenez v.

The plaintiff did not respond. Instead, the plaintiff pivoted, and argued that his fraudulent inducement claims against Aspiro are based not on an affirmative fraudulent misrepresentation by the company in the February 14 Tweet, but on its concealment from the market that the album would not be available forever exclusively on Tidal.

The quoted language in Aspiro's argument is found in the second sentence of the provision, which relates to choice of venue.

The choice of law provision contained in the first sentence of the provision is narrower-New York law is stated to govern the \"Agreement,\"\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    all disputes related to the services.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Because the plaintiff's argument founders on this point, the Court does not need to consider whether Aspiro's position was, indeed, inconsistent. It may not have been: Aspiro clearly noted in its memorandum to dismiss the first amended complaint that the analysis that it was presenting was based on an application of California law, and that New York law commanded a different result. The plaintiff may have expected that accepting Aspiro's argument and entering the Stipulation of Dismissal would open the door to a nationwide class action lawsuit applying New York statutory law, but the seed of this motion was planted at the time of Aspiro's first motion to dismiss, even if it was not yet seen.
