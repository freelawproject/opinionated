ASPEN, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Tina Y. Bruce filed a complaint against her former employer Defendant Levy Premium Foodservices Limited Partnership (\"Levy\") on October 18, 2016. (Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Bruce claims Levy violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by discriminating against her based on her gender and retaliating against her for reporting the sexual harassment of a coworker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-68.) Presently before us is Levy's motion for summary judgment. (Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Mot.\") (Dkt. No. 34).) We hereby grant Levy's motion for summary judgment as to Count I, which Bruce concedes should be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. (Dkt. No. 39) at 3-4.) For the following reasons, we deny Levy's motion for summary judgment as to Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial date remains set for April 16, 2019. (Dkt. No. 54.) In preparation for trial, the parties shall file pretrial materials by the deadlines set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the facts described herein come from the parties' statements of fact and are undisputed. Levy \"provides food and beverage services to the suites at the Bridgestone Arena\" in Nashville, Tennessee. (Statement of Material Uncontested Facts (\"SOF\") (Dkt. No. 35) \u00b6 1.) Levy hired Bruce on February 1, 2005 to work seasonally as a suite attendant during events at Bridgestone Arena. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-18.) These events included Nashville Predators hockey games, concerts, and other events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) During events, Bruce coordinated food and beverage service for assigned suites, including setting up and restocking food and beverage during events, and cleaning up the suites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Levy paid Bruce $10.00 an hour in addition to gratuities she received from her suite patrons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) In her 2014 performance evaluation dated January 28, 2015, Tim Halterman, General Manager of the Suites, indicated Bruce's performance was \"outstanding\" or \"very good\" in ten out of fourteen categories under review. (SOF \u00b6 22; Pl.'s Statement of Additional Uncontested Facts (\"PSAF\") (Dkt. No. 40) \u00b6\u00b6 22-23 (citing Jan. 2015 Review (Dkt. No. 41-8).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relevant events to this case began in November 2014, when Jacob Caffey, also a suite attendant, returned to work for Levy at Bridgestone after an extended medical leave of absence. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.) Shortly after Caffey returned, sometime in November or December 2014, Bruce alleges Caffey began harassing another suite attendant, Kayla Costley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bruce initially heard of the harassment from Costley's mother, who is Bruce's friend, and later personally witnessed Caffey make repeated sexual statements and gestures towards Costley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39; PSAF \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Based on these observations, Bruce told Caffey to leave Costley alone, which led to conflict between Bruce and Caffey. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 40-41; PSAF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) At some point, the timing of which is disputed, Bruce complained about Caffey's harassment of Costley to Halterman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Resp. to SOF (Dkt. No. 42) \u00b6\u00b6 22, 42;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dkt. No. 34-9 (February 20, 2018 email from Bruce to Halterman discussing conversation about Caffey).) After Bruce's complaint, Levy terminated Caffey on February 25, 2015. (SOF \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the months after Bruce's complaints and Caffey's termination, Bruce claims Halterman's demeanor changed towards her. (SOF \u00b6 55.) Specifically, Bruce claims Halterman assigned suites to suite attendants in a manner that was disadvantageous to her, which Bruce complained about to Halterman and Kim Dallaire, Senior Office Manager, and to Levy in an anonymous letter from a \"concerned co-worker.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55, 58-60, 65; April 2015 Letter (Dkt. No. 34-12) (alleging Halterman's favoritism towards certain employees).) Paula Meyer, Levy's Regional Human Resources Manager, investigated the complaints in Bruce's \"concerned co-worker\" letter and determined the allegations against Halterman were \"meritless.\" (SOF \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the same period, Levy received a number of complaints about Bruce. On February 28, 2015, Levy received a complaint from a Levy employee that Bruce and a fellow attendant, Cassie Coleman, made racist comments\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   about suite customers during a Charlie Wilson concert a few days earlier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.) While investigating this allegation, on March 1, 2015, Meyer and Crystal Parfitt, Director of Operations for Levy at Bridgestone, received three additional statements from Levy team members\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   complaining about Bruce's workplace conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 74.) The coworker statements reported that Bruce had spoken to suite runners in \"a rude and unprofessional manner,\" accused a coworker of smoking marijuana, made false accusations, and bragged she would call the corporate office to get coworkers in trouble.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 75-77.) Based on the Charlie Wilson concert complaint, on March 19, 2015, Meyer, Parfitt, and Dallaire met with Bruce and issued her a written warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73, 78.) In addition, between February 24 and April 17, 2015, Halterman gave Bruce three verbal warnings for clocking in early or late.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Resp. to PSAF (Dkt. No. 47) \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 9, 2015, Emily Roebuck reported to Dallaire that she found a recording\n   device in the Bridgestone pantry inside Bruce's purse; Dallaire reported the issue to Parfitt and Meyer. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.) After receiving Roebuck's April 9, 2015 complaint, Levy received additional statements about Bruce's \"bullying\" and \"threatening\" workplace behavior from coworkers Coleman and Shawna Jones; Bruce denies she ever harassed or bullied Jones. (Resp. to SOF \u00b6\u00b6 87-93, 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meyer and Parfitt began investigating Roebuck's complaint about Bruce's recording activities, including taking statements from Bruce, Roebuck, and Costley, whom Roebuck claims witnessed her discovering the recording device in Bruce's purse. (SOF \u00b6 85.) Roebuck alleged Bruce had been recording Levy employees in the pantry when Bruce was not present and without the consent of anyone who was present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Bruce admits she recorded others in the workplace, but denies doing so outside her presence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97; Bruce Decl. (Dkt. No. 41-18) \u00b6 7 (\"If I was recording, I always had the recorder on my person and in my apron. If I wasn't using it, it would be turned off in my purse ....\").) On April 25, 2015, Levy suspended Bruce while the company investigated the recording device allegations. (SOF \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the days before her termination, on April 20, 2015, Bruce began contacting Rich Johns, Levy's Regional Director of Operations based in Atlanta, Georgia, by email and phone. (PSAF \u00b6\u00b6 62-68.) In emails sent on April 20 and April 24, 2015, Bruce sent Johns emails stating she was experiencing retaliation from her coworkers for speaking up about sexual harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.) On April 21, 2015, Bruce spoke on the phone with Johns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) While the parties dispute some specific details of their conversation, they agree that Bruce and Johns discussed reporting sexual harassment, and that she told Johns \"she was recording conversations in the workplace\" to \"prove [her] innocence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66, 68.) Levy submits, however, that there is no evidence the \"decisionmakers,\" presumably those deciding whether to suspend and terminate Bruce, were aware of Bruce's contact with Johns. (Resp. to PSAF \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 5, 2015, Parfitt, Dallaire, and Meyer told Bruce she was terminated from Levy. (SOF \u00b6 101.) While the parties agree Meyer and Parfitt were involved in the decision to terminate Bruce, the parties dispute Halterman's role in her termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Resp. to. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 98, 100-101.) They also dispute the cause of Bruce's termination: Levy maintains Bruce was terminated because of her bullying behavior and Bruce's recording in the workplace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) Bruce, however, claims Levy terminated Bruce out of retaliation for reporting Caffey's sexual harassment of Costley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bruce filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on September 21, 2015, and Bruce received a Dismissal and Notice of Rights letter from the EEOC on July 29, 2016. (SOF \u00b6 103; Compl. \u00b6 8.) Bruce filed the instant suit against Levy\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   on October 18, 2016 alleging sexual harassment (Count\n   I) and retaliation (Count II) under Title VII. (SOF \u00b6 103; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-68.) On January 22, 2018, Levy filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting Bruce did not assert she was personally sexually harassed and that Bruce was not terminated out of \"retaliatory animus.\" (Mem. in Support of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 36) at 2.) In her response, Bruce concedes that her harassment claim should be dismissed, but argues her retaliation claim should survive summary judgment because Levy's stated explanations for her termination-reported bullying of coworkers and recording at work-are pretextual reasons for her termination.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-68.) Title VII prohibits retaliation by employers against an employee that has resisted discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).

Levy offers two reasons for Bruce's termination: Bruce's alleged bullying behavior of other Levy employees and her use of a recording device in the workplace, which Levy argues violates both Tennessee law\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   Levy company policy. (Mot. at 8-9.) While Bruce does not challenge the facial legitimacy of Levy's proposed reasons for her termination, we have our doubts about whether Levy's stated reason involving Bruce's alleged hostile behavior in the workplace is truly non-discriminatory. Specifically, several behaviors Levy describes as bullying and hostile could be interpreted as perpetuating gender stereotypes about women, specifically that Bruce was forward and assertive with her coworkers.

(PSAF \u00b6\u00b6 24, 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third, Levy's proffered reason for firing Bruce for hostile and bullying behavior is inconsistent with her recent positive performance evaluations.\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

Halterman even wrote in the review, \"Tina is a great asset to our team and has been for many years.\" (Jan. 2015 Review at 2.) Taking into account the evidence of temporal proximity between Bruce's complaints and her termination, the increased scrutiny she received post-reporting, and her recent positive performance reviews, we find a reasonable jury could find Levy's proffered explanations were not the actual motivation for her discharge. We accordingly find a material issue of fact as to pretext, and deny Levy's motion for summary judgment as to Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Levy raises several arguments in relation to pretext, none of which change our conclusion that Bruce has established a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext. Levy argues extensively that Bruce cannot overcome Levy's suggested reasons for her termination because it had an \"honest belief\" in the stated reasons for terminating Bruce. (Mem. at 14-16.) Essentially, Levy argues that Bruce cannot create an issue of fact related to pretext under the honest belief rule because Levy \"conducted a thorough investigation,\" which \"is entitled to deference.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tingle v.

(Mem. at 15; Reply (Dkt. No. 46) at 2, n.4.)

Furthermore, there is a general issue of material fact as to whether Halterman was involved in the decisionmaking process that resulted in Bruce's termination. Levy suggests Meyer and Parfitt alone \"made the decision to terminate Ms. Bruce's employment,\" which Bruce denies. (Resp. to SOF \u00b6\u00b6 98, 100.) While Halterman's name is not on the Bruce's notice of termination letter (Dkt. No. 41-15), Halterman signed Levy's notice of Bruce's suspension on April 25, 2015 after the recorder was allegedly found in Bruce's purse (Dkt. No. 41-15). (Resp. to SOF \u00b6 100.) This suspension began the investigation period that ultimately resulted in Bruce's termination only ten days later. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 94, 101.) In his deposition, Halterman also testified he is \"sure\" he talked with Parfitt about the circumstances surrounding Bruce's suspension and does not recall if he took part in the investigation after the suspension. (Halterman Dep. (Dkt. No. 41-25) at 53-54, 57.) As Halterman was Bruce's manager at the time of her termination and had been involved in review of Bruce's performance in the months before her termination, it is\n   probable that Halterman had some role in the decision to terminate Bruce. (PSAF \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, 27-29 (establishing Halterman's involvement in Bruce's internal performance reviews and his issuance of multiple disciplinary reports in February, March, and April 2015).)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053606\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/753/#p767\">\n    782 F.3d at 785-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the comments of an employee's supervisor who had been involved in prior meetings about his performance to be probative evidence of pretext).

(Resp. to PSAF \u00b6\u00b6 34-39.) Levy argues Bruce may not have been disciplined because Bruce \"could have had approval from management in advance,\" although Halterman testified he could not recall any specific instances in 2013 or 2014 where he approved Bruce arriving early or late.

(SOF \u00b6 100; Mem. at 15.) Bruce admits that Halterman did not sign the notice of termination, but argues Halterman had a \"role\" in her termination and was part of the investigation before her termination: Halterman issued three verbal warnings \"leading up to her termination\" for arriving early or late to her shift, and Halterman signed her notice of suspension dated April 25, 2015 after Bruce's recording device was discovered.

(\"Compass\") as a Defendant in her complaint. However, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss Compass after exchanging documents revealing Levy was Bruce's employer during the relevant period.

No. 31.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Levy requests that \"in the event the Court dismisses Ms. Bruce's claims against Levy with prejudice, Ms. Bruce should not be permitted to revive any claims against Compass, as Compass was an improper party to this lawsuit in the first place.\" (Mem. at 2 n.1.) In October 2017, before Levy filed the pending motion for summary judgment, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss Compass without prejudice, which we granted. (Dkt. Nos. 30-31.) With the entry of summary judgment on Count I for Levy, Levy now requests we turn Compass' dismissal into a dismissal with prejudice. Levy cites no caselaw in support of its request. (Mem. at 2 n.1.) Should Compass wish to obtain a dismissal with prejudice, it could have negotiated that term with Bruce before filing the joint motion to dismiss, or remained in the case until the summary judgment stage. However, we have neither considered the merits of Bruce's claims against Compass nor evaluated whether Compass employed Bruce, and deny Levy's request. Compass shall remain dismissed from this case without prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    For the purposes of our analysis, we only consider Bruce's termination as the relevant adverse employment action. Bruce argues that other actions taken by Halterman and Parfitt were made in retaliation for Bruce's complaints about Caffey, including the reassignment of Bruce's higher-tipping suites to other suite attendants and reprimands for clocking in early or late to shifts. (Resp. at 2.) While these actions may be relevant to establishing pretext, Bruce admits the only adverse employment action at issue in her retaliation claim is her ultimate termination.
