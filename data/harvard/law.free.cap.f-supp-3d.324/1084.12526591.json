Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kellogg is a \"multi-billion dollar food company that manufactures, markets, and sells a wide variety of cereals and bars, among other foods.\" ECF No. 62, Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") \u00b6 108. Plaintiff alleges that Kellogg has \"positioned itself in the market as a purportedly 'healthy' brand of processed food, by using various labeling statements to suggest its foods, especially its cereals and bars, are healthy choices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff \"has been a frequent cereal eater for many years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 249. Over the past several years, Plaintiff has purchased Kellogg's breakfast cereals and cereal bars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 250-51. During that time period, Plaintiff allegedly \"tried to choose healthy options, and has been willing to pay more for cereals he believes are healthy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 249.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case concerns statements on the packaging for breakfast cereals and cereal bars sold by Kellogg that indicate that Kellogg's products are healthy when excess added sugar allegedly causes those products to be unhealthy. Plaintiff alleges that eight of Kellogg's product lines are sold with misleading packaging.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 120-23. Four of those product lines are relevant to the instant order: (1) Kellogg's Raisin Bran; (2) Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats; (3) Kellogg's Smart Start-Original Antioxidants; and (4) Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bars.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 129 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In general, Kellogg's products are alleged to contain 9 to 16 grams of total sugar per serving and are 18% to 40% added sugar by calorie.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC App. 1. Plaintiff alleges that the consumption of added sugar can have significant health impacts on individuals. Specifically, Plaintiff states that people in the United States\n   consume excess added sugar, that people can become addicted to added sugar, and that excess added sugar consumption has been empirically linked to metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, obesity, inflammation, high cholesterol, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and some cancers. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 9-107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that the American Heart Association (\"AHA\") has found that a person is \"safe\" to consume up to 5% of his or her daily calories in added sugar, which amounts to approximately 25 grams of added sugar on a 2000 calorie diet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. On the other hand, the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has concluded that the Daily Recommended Value (\"DRV\") of added sugars is 10% of a person's daily calories, or approximately 50 grams of added sugar. Based on these values, Plaintiff alleges that Kellogg's products are unhealthy because they contain a higher percentage of added sugar (18%-40% of total calories per serving) than the daily \"safe\" percentage of added sugar recommended by the AHA or the DRV recommended by the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the packaging for Kellogg's products displays multiple statements touting the health and wellness benefits of consuming Kellogg's products that are misleading (the \"challenged statements\" or \"challenged health statements\"). Specifically, Plaintiff challenges Kellogg's use of statements that contain the terms \"healthy,\" \"nutritious,\" or \"wholesome.\" SAC \u00b6 186-89. Plaintiff alleges that these statements assert that Kellogg's products are healthy when they are in fact not healthy because of the presence of added sugar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 189. Further, Plaintiff alleges that a number of statements, such as \"lightly sweetened,\" imply that Kellogg's products are lower in sugar, when they actually are composed of 18% to 40% added sugar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 215-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Some of the products at issue allegedly display multiple challenged health statements. For example, Plaintiff states that the packaging for Raisin Bran displays \"HEART HEALTHY,\" \"Start with a healthy Spoonful,\" and \"Invest in your health invest in yourself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128. On the other hand, other products only have a single challenged statement. For example, on the packaging for Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bars, Plaintiff only challenges the statement \"wholesome goodness.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 130 Exhs. 19-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 29, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint. ECF No. 1. On October 31, 2016, Kellogg filed a motion to dismiss. ECF No. 22. In lieu of filing a response, on November 14, 2016, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\").

First, with regards to numerosity, Plaintiff has provided evidence that \"the unit and dollar sales\" of the Kellogg products at issue in the instant case \"suggest at least thousands of Class Members\" bought these products during the class period.

Cal. July 17, 2013) (\"[T]he numerosity requirement is usually satisfied where the class comprises 40 or more members.\").

First, Kellogg asserts that \"Kellogg consumers were not uniformly exposed to the challenged statements over the class period for Raisin Bran, Nutri-Grain, and Smart Start.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, Kellogg argues that \"there is no indication that every consumer-let alone most consumers-saw or relied upon\" either (1) the \"lightly sweetened\" statement displayed \"on the front of each package of Frosted Mini-Wheats and Smart Start\"; or (2) the \"wholesome goodness\" statement displayed on the back panel of some Nutri-Grain boxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16 &amp; n.5.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   , the Court clearly did not disapprove of how the plaintiff narrowly defined the class to include only those California consumers who purchased products labeled with \"one or more\" of the challenged statements at issue in that case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Instead, the Court merely determined that the plaintiff's proposed damages model was rendered unworkable by the fact that some of the products at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   did not display the challenged statements for some stretches of time during the class period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. As discussed below, Kellogg raises this issue with regards to Plaintiff's proposed hedonic regression damages model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that, contrary to Kellogg's view, Plaintiff properly defined the subclasses narrowly in order to avoid the individualized issues that would have otherwise arisen from the variations in the packaging for Raisin Bran, Nutri-Grain, and Smart Start during the class period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    b. \"Lightly Sweetened\" and \"Wholesome Goodness\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Kellogg points out that although \"each package of Frosted Mini-Wheats and Smart Start\" sold during the class period displayed a \"lightly sweetened\" statement \"as part of the phrase 'lightly sweetened whole grain cereal' or 'lightly sweetened, toasted multi-grain flakes,' \" that statement only \"appear[ed] in miniscule font\" and was \"not featured or highlighted-whether measured by size, unique font, placement, coloring, or any other metric.\" Opp. at 15. Similarly, Kellogg further states that \"the phrase 'wholesome goodness' appeared only on the back panel of some Nutri-Grain boxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 n.5. Kellogg asserts that this is significant for class certification purposes because \"[c]ourts have ... h[e]ld that class certification is inappropriate if some class members may not have\n   <em>\n    seen\n   </em>\n   the allegedly misleading statement, even if it appeared on each package.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. In other words, the crux of Kellogg's argument is that because the \"lightly sweetened\" and \"wholesome goodness\" statements were not sufficiently prominently displayed on the packaging for Frosted Mini-Wheats, Smart Start, and Nutri-Grain, class certification is inappropriate for those statements and/or products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   However, the only case that Kellogg cites to reinforce its argument-this Court's order denying class certification in\n   <em>\n    Philips v.

The key predominance issue in\n   <em>\n    Philips\n   </em>\n   was not about whether certain allegedly misleading statements were sufficiently prominently displayed on product\n   <em>\n    packaging.\n   </em>\n   Instead, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Philips\n   </em>\n   alleged that Ford fraudulently concealed a power steering defect in certain vehicles, and this Court concluded that the plaintiffs could not satisfy the predominance requirement because \"an unknown number of class members saw warnings regarding [the alleged power steering defect] in the owner's manual\" for the vehicles, and therefore \"the Court would be forced to conduct individual inquiries to discover which class members read the owner's manual and which did not.\"\n   <em>\n    Philips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207428810\">\n    2016 WL 7428810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *23.

Although this statement does appear in relatively small font \"as part of the phrase 'lightly sweetened whole grain cereal' or 'lightly sweetened, toasted multi-grain flakes,' \" Opp. at 15, it is displayed in the\n   <em>\n    center\n   </em>\n   of the\n   <em>\n    front\n   </em>\n   panel of the packaging for Frosted Mini-Wheats and Smart Start, and is not located in the middle of a block of text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 160-5 &amp; 160-6. As a result, the Court cannot conclude that an inference of class-wide exposure to the \"lightly sweetened\" statement is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because class-wide exposure to the \"wholesome goodness\" phrase on Nutri-Grain packaging cannot be inferred, in order to resolve Kellogg's liability for that phrase, the Court would have to engage in individualized inquiries to discover which members of the Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bar Subclass actually saw \"wholesome goodness\" and which did not. Additionally, the \"wholesome goodness\" phrase is the only statement on the packaging for Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bars that Plaintiff challenges as misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 130 Exhs. 19-22. As a result, Plaintiff fails to meet Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement for his proposed Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bar Subclass. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's motion for class certification as to the proposed Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bar Subclass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Individualized Health Effects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Kellogg's second argument against predominance is that \"the alleged falsity of the challenged statements\" \"differs for each consumer\" because \"the health impact of consuming [the] added sugar\" in the Kellogg products at issue in the instant case varies person-by-person, depending on, inter alia, a person's \"age, gender, metabolism, general eating habits, activity level, genetic factors, and other health conditions.\" Opp. at 16-17. Kellogg asserts that \"the challenged statements are false\" or misleading to a particular person only if \"the amount of added sugar [in the products at issue] causes\n   <em>\n    physical harm\n   </em>\n   \" to that specific person \"in the form of increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and other ailments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (emphasis added). Therefore, Kellogg states that \"if consumption of Kellogg'[s] ... cereal has no negative impact on a specific person's health, then the challenged statements (such as 'wholesome goodness' or 'heart health') are not false as to that person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Kellogg's argument is not well-taken. As mentioned above, under the FAL, CLRA, and the \"fraudulent\" prong of the UCL, the issue of whether a particular statement on a product's packaging or labeling is false, deceptive, or materially misleading is evaluated according to an objective \"reasonable consumer\" standard.\n   <em>\n    Lavie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301020\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/105/496/#p506\">\n    105 Cal.

Thus, contrary to Kellogg's view, the actual physical \"impact\" of the products at issue on any \"specific [class member's] health\" has no bearing on whether\n   the challenged health statements are false, deceptive, or materially misleading under the FAL, CLRA, or the \"fraudulent\" prong of the UCL. Opp. at 16. Instead, the falsity or deceptiveness of the challenged health statements on the products at issue will be determined based solely on whether the health statements are likely to deceive or mislead a hypothetical\n   <em>\n    reasonable consumer\n   </em>\n   in light of the amount of added sugar that Kellogg puts into those products.

ECF No. 181 at 21-22. Specifically, Plaintiff points out that under Gaskin's proposed methodology, the sample of survey respondents will include only consumers who have recently purchased the Kellogg products at issue, and will therefore \"presumably reflect a [representative] cross-section of first-time\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   repeat purchasers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gaskin Decl. \u00b6 36 (\"Respondents must indicate that they have purchased either Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats, Kellogg's Smart Start, or Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bars in the past three months to qualify for the survey.\"). In turn, this will \"ensur[e]\" that \"the class-wide measure[s]\" for the market price premia generated by Gaskin's conjoint analysis will accurately \"reflect[ ] both demographics\"-that is, first-time and repeat purchasers alike.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court is inclined to agree with Plaintiff that Gaskin's proposed conjoint analysis adequately accounts for the behavior of repeat purchasers by including both first-time and repeat purchasers in the pool of survey respondents (and by\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   actively seeking to bias the pool towards either of these demographics). Further, and in any event, even if Kellogg's repeat-purchaser criticism were valid, it would only go to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of Gaskin's proposed conjoint analysis. The practical effect of any failure to account for repeat purchasers would be an overestimation of the market price premia attributable to the challenged health statements at issue in the instant case. \"Yet just because the conjoint survey may result in overestimating the value consumers placed on\" the challenged health statements \"does not necessarily render the survey excludable.\"\n   <em>\n    Fitzhenry-Russell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203126385\">\n    2018 WL 3126385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6.

Kellogg explains that a conjoint survey suffers from focalism bias if it \"telegraph[s] to respondents that they are only being tested about a [particular] attribute\" or set of attributes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Kellogg further explains that focalism bias leads to \"demand effects,\" \"whereby survey respondents use cues provided by the survey procedure and questions to figure out the purpose of the survey and what they perceive to be the 'correct' answers to the questions they are asked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, Kellogg asserts that Gaskin's proposed conjoint survey \"telegraphs to respondents that the survey is testing the weight attributable to certain health and nutrition statements\" because \"[a]lmost all of the 'distractor' statements used in the survey related to the ingredients, nutritional benefits, or health properties of the challenged products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Kellogg insists that Gaskin \"could easily have avoided this problem\" by using distractor statements that \"have nothing to do with [the product's] ingredients, [ ] nutritional qualities, or [ ] purported health benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Kellogg's focalism bias argument. As Plaintiff correctly explains, the fact that the distractor claims are similar to the challenged health statements-in that the distractor claims are \"also health and wellness claims likely to be important to consumers in choosing products\"-makes it\n   <em>\n    harder\n   </em>\n   , not easier, for survey respondents to figure out which specific health statements are being tested by the survey. ECF No. 181 at 23. In other words, if \"only the challenged claims but not [the] distractor claims related to health and wellness\"-as recommended by Kellogg-\"this would create far more focalism bias[ ] by focusing respondents on the specific claims of interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gaskin's entire purpose for including these \"distractor claims\" was to \"obscure which [statements] are of primary interest in the surveys.\" Gaskin Decl. \u00b6 24. The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Gaskin's proposed distractor claims are better-suited for this task than Kellogg's recommended distractor claims. Further, and in any event, like all of Kellogg's other survey methodology concerns, Kellogg's focalism bias objection goes to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of Gaskin's proposed conjoint analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

Hedonic Regression\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As discussed above, Plaintiff also offers a regression model to measure class-wide damages for Plaintiff's affirmative misrepresentation theory of liability. Specifically, one of Plaintiff's other damages experts, Colin Weir, proposes a \"hedonic regression\" damages model to measure the price premia attributable to the challenged health statements in the instant case. ECF No. 143-1 (\"Weir Decl.\") \u00b6 29. \"Regression analysis\" is an \"econometric technique\" that \"identifies and quantifies the relationship between two or more variables.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. According to Weir, \"hedonic regression is an application of standard regression techniques\" that can be used to \"measure the value of various product attributes\"-or in other words, the relationship between a particular product attribute and that product's price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. As such, \"[h]edonic regression is based on the concept that each product attribute has a different and measurable impact on aggregate consumer utility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Weir further notes that \"hedonic regression is now widely used by economists\" and \"has a long history of use for determining damages in class action litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Weir states that \"[h]edonic regression is an ideal technique for calculating the price difference between the value of the Kellogg Cereals with and without the\" challenged health statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Weir proposes a hedonic regression that estimates the price premia attributable to the challenged health statements while controlling for many other product attributes that might have affected price, including brand, promotions, and nutrient content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Further, Weir stresses that hedonic regression is an \"iterative\" process that requires \"multiple regressions\" to \"help determine\" all the factors that may have affected price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Weir proposes to run his hedonic regression using a \"dataset [that] includes\" both the challenged Kellogg products and a set of comparable breakfast products from 16 other \"major brands\"- including Kellogg's \"three primary competitors, General Mills, Post[,] and Quaker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Like with the proposed conjoint analysis discussed above, Kellogg advances two sets of arguments against Weir's proposed hedonic regression damages model: one asserting that it fails to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   , and another asserting that it is inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 24- 28. However, because the Court concluded above that Gaskin's conjoint analysis-which, like Weir's hedonic regression, corresponds with Plaintiff's affirmative misrepresentation theory of liability-satisfies\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   and is admissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has already established that one of his proposed damages models can validly support his affirmative representation theory of liability on a class-wide basis. Further, in its motion to exclude Weir's expert testimony, Kellogg raises the same sets of arguments against Weir's proposed hedonic regression model, and in fact discusses them in greater detail. ECF No. 169. Thus, the Court finds that it need not address Kellogg's\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   arguments against Weir's proposed hedonic regression damages model in this class certification order. Instead, the Court will defer ruling on those arguments until the hearing on Kellogg's motion to exclude Weir's expert testimony, which is currently set for November 8, 2018, at 1:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Advantage Realized Model\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Aside from his affirmative misrepresentation theory of liability, Plaintiff also asserts, inter alia, a deceptive omission theory of liability against Kellogg. Plaintiff's deceptive omission theory is that Kellogg deceptively \"hides\" and \"omits ... information regarding the products' high sugar content\" in violation of the FAL,\n   CLRA, and the UCL's \"fraudulent\" prong. SAC \u00b6 209. In other words, Plaintiff \"alleges that Kellogg was under a duty to disclose material information about the negative health implications of the added sugar in its products,\" and that \"by failing to do so, [Kellogg] distorted the market demand for its product.\" Mot. at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff states in his motion for class certification that he can provide a damages model that is \"consistent with [Plaintiff's] deceptive omission theory of liability,\" and points to an \"advantage realized model\" proposed by Gaskin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. In turn, Gaskin states that his proposed advantage realized damages model utilizes \"market research surveys and analyses\" to \"test the effect of the omitted information regarding the dangers of added sugar consumption\" on consumption of, or demand for, the challenged products. Gaskin Decl. \u00b6 8(b). Under Gaskin's proposed methodology for testing the effect of the omitted sugar warnings on demand for Raisin Bran, survey respondents will be randomly assigned to one of two groups-the \"Test Group\" or the \"Control Group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Respondents in the Test Group will be shown a page that displays a message-\"[s]uppose you see the following statements on the boxes of Raisin Bran that you can buy when you shop in the near future\"-and subsequently lists five of the challenged health statements at issue in the instant case, including \"HEART HEALTHY,\" \"Start with a HEALTHY SPOONFUL,\" and \"INVEST IN YOUR HEALTH, INVEST IN YOURSELF.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. In contrast, respondents in the Control Group will be shown the same page with one additional item: a warning statement that reads \"WARNING: DUE TO ITS HIGH ADDED SUGAR CONTENT, CONSUMPTION OF RAISIN BRAN MAY LEAD YOU TO EXCEED THE USDA'S RECOMMENDED DAILY ADDED SUGAR MAXIMUM, WHICH CAN CAUSE TYPE 2 DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, FATTY LIVER DISEASE, AND TOOTH DECAY.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both Test Group and Control Group respondents will then be prompted to answer four questions that are designed to gauge how much Raisin Bran they intend to consume in the near future. The first question \"present[s] respondents with three different bowl sizes and ask[s] respondents which bowl, if any, most closely matches in size and depth the bowl they will use when they eat Raisin Bran in the near future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. Thereafter, the second question presents respondents with \"photos of the bowl they chose in\" the first question \"filled to varying amounts of Raisin Bran,\" and asks respondents to choose the \"serving size\" that \"most closely matches the amount of cereal you plan to pour in the bowl when you eat Raisin Bran in the near future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. Then, the third question asks respondents to indicate \"how often they plan to eat bowls of Raisin Bran like the [bowl] they chose in\" the second question \"in the near future,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70, and the final question asks respondents \"how many bowls they plan to eat, either per week or month in the near future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Gaskin then proposes to calculate the difference in consumption between the Test and Control Groups and to use that difference as a measure of the market advantage that Kellogg gained by omitting information about the risks of added sugar consumption from Raisin Bran packaging.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 77. Further, Gaskin notes that he has already \"conducted\" an advantage realized \"survey for Kellogg's Raisin Bran as a proof of concept.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. The results of that survey \"showed that those in the Test Group would have consumed 315.53 servings of Raisin Bran per year ... and those in the Control Group would have consumed 259.22 servings of Raisin Bran per year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. In other words, the results of Gaskins' preliminary advantage realized survey suggest that Kellogg\n   would have sold 17.8% less Raisin Bran if Kellogg had disclosed \"information regarding the dangers of sugar consumption\" on its Raisin Bran packaging instead of omitting that information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff states that this \"aggregate difference\" can then be \"applied to the aggregate sales to determine classwide damages.\" Mot. at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Kellogg asserts that Gaskin's proposed advantage realized model fails to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   because it can only measure the effect that a warning statement would have had on consumer demand for the challenged products, and that effect is unrelated to any class-wide remedy that might be available under Plaintiff's deceptive omission theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 28. For the reasons stated below, the Court agrees with Kellogg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Under California law, there are two types of disgorgement remedies: \"restitutionary disgorgement, which\n   <em>\n    focuses on the plaintiff's loss\n   </em>\n   , and nonrestitutionary disgorgement, which focuses on the defendant's unjust enrichment.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tobacco Cases II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052696\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/240/779/#p800\">\n    240 Cal.

However, the Court also finds that Plaintiff has established Rule 23(b)(3) predominance as to the remainder of Plaintiff's proposed subclasses and theories of liability. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's motion for class certification only as to Plaintiff's proposed Nutri-Grain Soft-Baked Breakfast Bar Subclass and Plaintiff's deceptive omission theory of liability. Moreover, because the Court denies class certification as to Plaintiff's deceptive omission theory of liability, the Court DENIES as moot Kellogg's motion to exclude Gaskin's expert testimony to the extent that it concerns Gaskin's proposed advantage realized damages model.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gaskin Daubert Mot. at 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court finds none of Kellogg's arguments to be persuasive, and discusses each of them in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   First, Kellogg argues that Plaintiff is an inadequate class representative because, although Plaintiff stated at his deposition that a Safeway store in Del Rey Oaks, California, was his \"go-to\" grocery store, the electronic record for his Safeway discount card does not reflect any purchases of the products at issue in the instant case. Opp. at 34-35. Kellogg asserts that this amounts to \"strong evidence that Plaintiff never made the purchases he claims to have made,\" and therefore calls Plaintiff's credibility into question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   However, Plaintiff's SAC alleges only that Plaintiff \"believes\" that he purchased Kellogg products from locations including, but not limited to, that particular Safeway store. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 252, 255, 257, 263. Further, it appears from Plaintiff's deposition that by confirming Kellogg's counsel's query about whether the Safeway was \"sort of [Plaintiff's] go-to shop,\" Plaintiff meant only that Safeway \"was closest to where [Plaintiff] was living.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 21 (citing ECF No. 195-7 at 88-89). Additionally, Plaintiff testified that out of all the grocery stores Plaintiff identified in his complaint, Safeway was the most expensive.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (citing ECF No. 195-7 at 281-82). Relatedly, Plaintiff has submitted a declaration explaining that, while Safeway was where he \"most frequently made quick purchases\" due to its proximity to his house, Plaintiff \"usually purchased cereal\" on \"more regular grocery shopping trips\" to cheaper stores, like \"Target, Wal-Mart, or especially Grocery Outlet,\" which he \"believe[s] ... is why records of [his] purchase history from Safeway do not show many cereal purchases.\" ECF No. 194-2 \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In light of these portions of the record regarding Plaintiff's cereal purchases, the Court cannot conclude that the absence of Kellogg products from Plaintiff's Safeway purchase records creates a concern about Plaintiff's credibility that is \" 'so sharp as to jeopardize the interests of absent class members.' \"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

However, as the Court explained above, none of Plaintiff's claims require Plaintiff to prove that he or any other class member was physically harmed as a result of Kellogg's alleged misconduct. Instead, Plaintiff \"is seeking to recover for the\n   <em>\n    economic\n   </em>\n   injury caused by Kellogg representing that its ... foods are healthy.\" Reply at 4. Thus, Plaintiff's claims will be evaluated according to an objective \"reasonable consumer\" standard.
