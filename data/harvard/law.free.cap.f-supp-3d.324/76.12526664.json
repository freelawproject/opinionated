The employers ask this Court to dismiss the suit under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim, arguing that the Davis-Bacon Act forecloses any cause of action-whether under the Act itself, the Fair Labor Standards Act, or state labor laws-outside the Act's administrative scheme. Because the Davis-Bacon Act is not so expansive, the Court will deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Relevant Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Davis-Bacon Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Davis-Bacon Act sets requirements for certain contracts with the federal government or the District of Columbia relating to construction on public buildings or public works. As relevant here, the \"advertised specifications\" for covered contracts must \"contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics,\" and those minimum wages \"shall be based on the wages the Secretary of Labor determines to be prevailing\" for each class of worker in a given market.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b). The eventual contract itself must then contain three stipulations: (1) that the contractor will pay covered workers at least the prevailing rates as recited in the advertised specifications, any contrary agreement between the contractor and his workers notwithstanding; (2) that the contractor will publicly post the wage scale at work; and, most important here, (3) that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   there may be withheld from the contractor so much of accrued payments as the contracting officer considers necessary to pay to laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the difference between the rates of wages required by the contract to be paid laborers and mechanics on the work and the rates of wages received by the laborers and mechanics and not refunded to the contractor or subcontractors or their agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3142(c). Under this contractual provision, a government contracting officer can ensure that workers are paid at the Department of Labor's prevailing rates-and if the workers are underpaid, the contracting officer can withhold payment to the contractor and use the withheld funds to make up the difference. If the withheld funds are insufficient, \"the laborers and\n   mechanics have the same right to bring a civil action and intervene against the contractor and the contractor's sureties as is conferred by law on persons furnishing labor or materials.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3144(a)(2). The contracting officer may also terminate a contract if he learns that any covered worker has been underpaid.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3143. Most courts to have examined the issue have held that the Davis-Bacon Act does not create a private right of action before a plaintiff has navigated the administrative scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   note 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Fair Labor Standards Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Fair Labor Standards Act provides,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"no employer shall employ any of his [covered] employees ... for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). An employee's \"regular rate\" is \"deemed to include all remuneration for employment paid to, or on behalf of, the employee, but shall not be deemed to include\" various items such as gifts, vacation and sick pay, various insurance payments, and certain other exempted items.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 207(e). The FLSA imposes liability on employers who violate \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207\"in the amount of [the employee's] unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 216(b). And it explicitly authorizes a private right of action for aggrieved employees: \"An action to recover the liability prescribed in the preceding sentences may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3. District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act Revision Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to the federal FLSA, the District of Columbia has enacted its own minimum wage law: the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act. The DCMWA largely mirrors the FLSA, but is more generous in its remedies for covered employees. Subject to certain exemptions, the DCMWA forbids any employer from \"employ[ing] any employee for a workweek that is longer than 40 hours, unless the employee receives compensation for employment in excess of 40 hours at a rate not less than 1 \u00bd times the regular rate at which the employee is employed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1003\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 32-1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Penalties are steep: \"[A]ny employer who pays any employee less than the wage to which that employee is entitled under this subchapter shall be liable to that employee in the amount of the unpaid wages, statutory penalties, and an additional amount as liquidated damages equal to treble the amount of unpaid wages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1003\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32-1012(b)(1).

District of Columbia Wage Payment and Collection Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Another District of Columbia law, the District of Columbia Wage Payment and Collection Law, requires employers to pay employees \"all wages earned\" on regular paydays,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1302\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 32-1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and defines \"wages\" as \"all monetary compensation after lawful deductions, owed by an employer, whether the amount owed is determined on a time, task, piece, commission, or other basis of calculation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32-1301(3). \"Wages\" are specifically defined to include \"[o]ther remuneration promised or owed ...

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Garcia alleges three counts under three laws: (1) failure to pay overtime wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA); (2) failure to pay overtime wages under the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act Revision Act (DCMWA); and (3) failure to pay \"all wages due, including prevailing wages and fringe benefits,\" under the District of Columbia Wage Payment and Collection Law (DCWPCL). Compl. at 17-19. But the employers urge that a\n   <em>\n    fourth\n   </em>\n   law, the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA), requires dismissal of Garcia's claims. The employers' argument proceeds in two steps:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , the DBA does not authorize a private right of action (at least not before a plaintiff has navigated the administrative scheme); and,\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , \"a worker cannot bypass the DBA by seeking unpaid and overtime wages under another federal law or state laws.\" Dkt. 17 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court is not the first to confront the interaction between the DBA and other federal or state wage and hour laws, and there is a division of authority among the circuits. The D.C. Circuit has yet to settle the issue, so it is this Court's duty to independently analyze the relevant statutes and render a decision based on the best reading of the statutory text. Based on a review of the relevant statutes, the Court concludes that the DBA does not foreclose causes of action under the FLSA or state (or, as in this case, District) law, at least where a plaintiff does not challenge the Department of Labor's classification or wage-setting decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Fourth Circuit recently confronted this issue. In\n   <em>\n    Amaya v. Power Design, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit concluded that \"Congress intended the FLSA to apply broadly notwithstanding any overlap with other labor statutes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351207\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/440/#p445\">\n    833 F.3d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445 (4th Cir. 2016).

It also noted that none of the FLSA's listed exemptions exempted the plaintiffs, and that the FLSA's text specifically states that \"[n]o provision of this chapter or of any order thereunder shall excuse noncompliance with any Federal or State law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this chapter or a maximum work week lower than the maximum workweek established under this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20218\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Fourth Circuit thus allowed the FLSA claims to go forward. And in calculating the wages for those FLSA claims, the\n   <em>\n    Amaya\n   </em>\n   court interpreted \"regular rate\" under the FLSA to refer to the prevailing rate under the DBA.\n   <em>\n    Amaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351207\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/440/#p445\">\n    833 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   447 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds the\n   <em>\n    Amaya\n   </em>\n   decision convincing. There is a difference between the lack of a private right of action and a congressional intent to foreclose other, extant rights of action. Even assuming-as Garcia concedes here, Dkt. 20 at 1-that the DBA lacks a private right of action of its own, it does not follow that Congress intended to shut down all other avenues of relief.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wigod v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741891\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/547/#p582\">\n    673 F.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (7th Cir. 2012) (\"When the federal court's jurisdiction over state-law claims is based on diversity of citizenship, ... the absence of a private right of action in a federal statute actually weighs\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   preemption.\").
