The defendant, New England Regional Council of Carpenters (the\n   \"Carpenters\"), has entered into collective bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\") with non-party construction companies and construction managers (collectively, the \"employers\"). The agreements contain restrictive subcontracting clauses (sometimes known as \"hot cargo\" clauses, but which I call the \"CBA clauses\") that prohibit signatories from subcontracting work to any employer that has not acceded to a Carpenters' CBA. The plaintiffs-construction trade unions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   contractors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and trade associations\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, the \"Ironworkers\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -allege that the Carpenters have used the CBA clauses to expand the scope of their work by preventing the Ironworkers from bidding on and performing work that traditionally was assigned to the Ironworkers.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following the Second Circuit's determination that the CBA clauses are not entitled to the non-statutory exemption, the Carpenters' motion for summary judgment presents two further matters for decision. First, what is the proper standard for analysis of the Ironworkers' claims? The Ironworkers insist that the CBA clauses constitute \"group boycott[s]\" that should be deemed \"\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violations of the antitrust laws.\" Mem. Opp'n Mot. Summ. J., Doc. No. 100, at 40. The Carpenters, conversely, argue that the CBA clauses are \"exclusive dealing requirements\" that should be \"analyzed under the rule of reason.\" Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Doc. No. 86, at 32-33. I agree that the CBA clauses-which at worst substitute one group of unionized workers for another-are not \"manifestly anticompetitive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bus. Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp. Elecs.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   condemnation is inappropriate, and I analyze the clauses under the rule of reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, do the CBA clauses function as \"unreasonable\" restraints under the rule of reason? The multi-part, burden-shifting rule of reason requires that the \"plaintiff bear[ ] the initial burden of showing that the challenged action has had an\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market.\"\n   <em>\n    Capital Imaging Assocs., P.C. v.

Furthermore, Deak's report admits that \"[u]nion carpenter hourly wages ... are recognized as being lower than the hourly rates for union ironworkers,\" Deak Rep., Doc.

Because the Carpenters are headquartered in Boston and maintain separate CBAs for work in the \"Eastern Massachusetts Jurisdictional Area,\" to conflate their (perhaps dominant) market share in the Boston area with their market share in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and western Massachusetts likely overstates the Carpenters' power in the relevant geographic market.

Thus, an agreement among several general contractors, or between labor unions, might impose a \"horizontal\" restraint; but an agreement between a labor union, which supplies labor, and a general contractor, which purchases it, could not.

That the unions are not for-profit businesses is irrelevant; for purposes of the various entities' location in the market, the unions \"supply\" labor and the general contractors \"purchase\" it.
