Russell, Senior Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Element Transportation, LLC's (\"Element Transportation\") Motion to Dismiss, [R. 32], and Defendant Paschall Truck Lines, Inc.'s (\"PTL\") Motion to Dismiss, [R. 55]. Plaintiffs Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes (hereinafter \"Plaintiffs\") responded to both motions. [R. 59; R. 76.] Element Transportation and PTL both replied. [R. 70; R. 78.] Fully briefed, this matter is now ripe for adjudication. For the reasons stated herein, Element Transportation's Motion to Dismiss, [R. 32], is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and PTL's Motion to Dismiss, [R. 55], is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The factual allegations as set out in the First Amended Complaint, [R. 19 (First Amended Complaint) ], and taken as true are as follows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v.

This case arises out of Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes's previous employment as truck drivers for PTL. [R. 19 at 12.] Plaintiffs allege that Carter worked for the defendants as a commercial truck driver from \"in or around October of 2015 to in or around December of 2015,\" and Hayes worked for the defendants from \"in or around March of 2016 to in or around June of 2016.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Upon PTL hiring Carter and Hayes, they were required to attend an orientation, which lasted several days. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.] After completing orientation, Plaintiffs state that PTL required each of them to sign an Independent Contractor Service Agreement (\"ICS Agreement\") with PTL and an Individual Program Lease Agreement, (\"Lease Agreement\"), with ECN.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In or around September of 2016, Element Transportation purchased \"certain leasehold assets\" from ECN, including the leases of the Plaintiffs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.] Plaintiffs contend this makes Element Transportation a successor in interest to ECN. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In short, ECN leased tractor trailers to Plaintiffs who then subleased the tractor trailers and their driving services to PTL. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.] Plaintiffs claim that this arrangement was represented to them as a \"Lease-Purchase Program.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.] Plaintiffs allege that the \"extensive restrictions\" placed on them through both agreements allowed ECN and PTL such control over Plaintiffs that ECN and PTL functioned as Plaintiffs' joint employers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.] Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that as a condition of their employment for PTL, PTL required Plaintiffs to lease tractors from ECN, and, under the lease agreement with ECN, Plaintiffs could only drive for PTL. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.] If they did not drive for PTL, the Plaintiffs claim that they would default on their Lease Agreements,\n   \"subjecting Plaintiffs to an acceleration clause whereby Plaintiffs would be required to pay the entire balance of the lease immediately.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Lease Agreement states that \"Lessee shall use the Vehicle(s) only for providing transportation services for the Carrier identified herein ....\" [R. 32-2 at 3 (Lease Agreement).] On the page labeled \"Schedule AB,\" PTL is documented as being the \"Carrier.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.] Furthermore, the Lease Agreement reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of one or more of the following shall constitute an Event of Default: (a) Lessee shall cease using the Vehicle(s) for providing transportations services for the Carrier identified herein; (b) Lessee fails to pay when due any lease payments or any other payment under this Agreement; (c) Lessee fails to perform any other term or condition of this Agreement and such failure remains unremedied for more than ten (10) days after Lessor has requested Lessee to perform ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [R. 32-2 at 6 (Lease Agreement).] Upon the event of default, ECN could\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   at its option and without demand or notice to Lessee, do any one or more of following: (a) pay all amounts required to be paid or perform or cause to be performed all obligations required to be performed by Lessee hereunder and charge Lessee as additional rent the amount paid or the reasonable value of all services performed therefore; (b) take immediate possession of the Vehicles in accordance with the provisions of Section 14; (c) declare the entire balance of lease payments for the remainder of the Lease Term and the End of Term value as set forth in Schedule AB immediately due and payable by acceleration and recover such amount as liquidated damages, the reasonableness of such damages being acknowledged by Lessee; or (d) terminate the Agreement and Lessee's rights hereunder and require Lessee at its sole cost to promptly return the Vehicle(s) to Lessor at such locations as Lessor may designate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiffs allege that this clause in the Lease Agreement subjected them to \"more than $100,000 in liability\" if they defaulted on the Lease Agreement. [R. 19 at 13.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the ICS Agreement with PTL, Plaintiffs concede that they were purported to be independent contractors, but they make allegations that suggest otherwise. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.] Plaintiffs allege that the reality of their relationship with ICS contradicted several of the provisions of the ICS Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] For instance, \u00a7 2.13 of the ICS Agreement states that Plaintiffs could have used the leased equipment for other purposes when not in service to PTL if, within twenty-four hours of that use, Plaintiffs notified PTL, cover any PTL logos, and confirm appropriate insurance coverage was in place. [R. 59-2 at 4, \u00b6 2.13 (ICS Agreement).] However, Plaintiffs allege they were not permitted to \"use the commercial vehicles leased to them for any carrier other than Defendant PTL\" and \"[d]uring orientation, Defendant PTL instructed Plaintiffs that their employment and lease agreements would be terminated if they accepted work from any carrier other than Defendant PTL.\" [R. 19 at 14.] Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that the defendants' \"pay structure and wage deduction practices and policies regularly caused Named Plaintiffs' wages to drop below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked during a workweek.\" [R. 19 at 16.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs provide an example\n   in which Hayes performed significant work during the week but was issued a pay stub on May 18, 2016 that provided no wages and lowered him further into debt due to the defendants' deductions for business expenses. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.] Also, the ICS Agreement allowed PTL to deduct an \"early termination\" fee of $5000.00 in liquidated damages if Plaintiffs ceased \"providing services when required by PTL on a continuing basis within nine (9) months after the Effective date ....\" [R. 59-2 at 8 (ICS Agreement).]\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Overall, Plaintiffs contend that the defendants designed a \"scheme\" involving both agreements in order to \"force continued labor of Plaintiffs by using threats of serious financial harm through explicit threats to impose, enforce, and collect significant debts.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 19, 2017, Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes, on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated, filed the First Amended Complaint against PTL, ECN (as successor to EFC), and Element Transportation, LLC (as successor to ECN). [R. 19.] On February 14, 2018, Element filed a Motion to Dismiss, [R. 32], and on April 3, 2018, PTL filed a Motion to Dismiss, [R. 55]. Both motions to dismiss are currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

Element Transportation Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Element Transportation moves the Court to dismiss all of the claims contained in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint on three grounds: First, it argues that the First Amended Complaint fails to \"plausibly establish that Element Transportation is liable as a successor to ECN for any of Plaintiffs' claims.\" [R. 32-1 at 2.] Second, it asserts that Plaintiffs' allegations are \"insufficient to plausibly establish that ECN is liable as a successor to EFC.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Last, it contends that any claim Plaintiffs may attempt to state against EFC would fail.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In regards to Plaintiffs' first argument, the Court does not agree that \"discovery is\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   \" in order to properly determine whether a party is a successor in interest. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (emphasis added).] Although Plaintiffs cite to plentiful case law in which a successorship liability analysis was performed at the summary judgment stage of litigation, [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12], this does not confirm that the analysis cannot be performed at the motion to dismiss stage. In fact, as Element Transportation acknowledges in its Reply, [R. 70 at 2 (Element Transportation Reply) ], several courts within the Sixth Circuit have done just that.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comer v.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-12.] Second, PTL contends that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that PTL violated the Forced Labor Statute, i.e., Count III of the First Amended Complaint, because (1) Plaintiffs did not plead facts demonstrating that \"PTL caused Plaintiffs to believe facts that, if true, would demonstrate PTL caused Plaintiffs to believe they would suffer 'serious harm' if they did not continue to work for PTL\" and (2) Plaintiffs failed to allege that PTL had the required intent.

Said provision further states that Named Plaintiffs and Class Plaintiffs would be responsible for the entirety of the loss in the event that Named Plaintiffs and Class Plaintiffs failed to immediately report the occurrence or the equipment was operated with an unauthorized person present.

In its Motion to Dismiss, PTL argues that Plaintiffs (1) failed to sufficiently plead that PTL caused Plaintiffs to believe they would suffer \"serious harm\" if they ceased working for PTL and (2) Plaintiffs did not plead sufficient facts to satisfy the intent requirement of the statute. [R. 55-1 at 12-17.] Plaintiffs disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court must address two arguments made by PTL that affect the Courts consideration of the aforementioned issues. First, PTL argues that any allegations that that PTL violated the federal forced labor statute based on the terms of the lease agreement with ECN must fail because \"Plaintiffs have included no allegations that PTL is a third-party beneficiary of the equipment lease or that PTL had any involvement in the drafting, performance, or enforcement of the equipment lease.\" [R. 55-1 at 13 n.3.] However, the Court finds that Plaintiffs alleged such a collaboration between the defendants when they stated that PTL required Plaintiffs to sign both an ICS Agreement and a Lease Agreement with ECN at orientation in order to participate in the \"Lease-Purchase Program\" and contended \"[o]n information and belief, Defendant PTL and Defendant ECN entered into joint agreements to administer the Lease-Purchase Program that Plaintiffs participated in, including the deduction of lease and maintenance payments from Plaintiffs' settlement sheets and the division of such payments between Defendant\n   PTL, Defendant ECN and Defendant John Does 1-20.\" [R. 19 at 13.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Secondly, PTL broadly argues that \"[n]othing in the Complaint suggests Plaintiffs are the type of people the statute was designed to protect.\" [R. 78 at 8.] Granted, the typical facts in a case filed under the federal forced labor statute involves the exploitation of non-english speaking immigrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muchira v.

PTL argues that Plaintiffs failed to plead that they suffered or were threatened with a sufficiently \"serious harm\" as required under the statute. [R. 55-1 at 13-16; R. 78 at 6-9.] First, PTL contends that \"the majority of cases require more than bare financial harm to conclude that the harm is 'serious.' \" [R. 55-1 at 14.] PTL fails to cite to a single case requiring that a plaintiff must allege more than a financial harm in order to successfully plead the \"serious harm\" element of the claim. Instead, PTL cites to cases where plaintiffs successfully pleaded \"serious harm\" due to circumstances that involved more than solely financial harm. [R. 55-1 at 14; R. 78 at 7-8.] As Plaintiffs point out in response, [R. 76 at 17-18], just because other plaintiffs successfully pleaded \"serious harm\" in circumstances that involved more than financial harm does not mean that Plaintiffs claims involving only financial harm should be dismissed. Had PTL cited cases in which plaintiffs suffered a similar amount of financial harm yet the court found it not to be sufficiently serious, the outcome of the Court's analysis may have been different. However, as it is, PTL's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Secondly, PTL argues that the amount of financial harm at stake in this case \"does not meet the statutory threshold of 'serious.' \" [R. 55-1 at 15.] Plaintiffs plead that the amount of money in question could be over $100,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   [R. 19 at\n   13; R. 76 at 18.] This amount falls neatly in the spectrum of financial harm generated by the cases cited by PTL: below the $250,000.00 potential suit of\n   <em>\n    Antonatos v.
