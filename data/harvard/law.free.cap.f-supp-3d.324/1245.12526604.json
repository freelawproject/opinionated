DALTON JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is another farewell tour in this long-running trademark dispute. Specifically, Plaintiff Commodores Entertainment Company's (\"\n   <strong>\n    CEC\n   </strong>\n   \") Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 411 (\"\n   <strong>\n    SJ Motion\n   </strong>\n   \") ) and Defendants Thomas McClary (\"\n   <strong>\n    McClary\n   </strong>\n   \") and Fifth Avenue Entertainment, LLC's (\"\n   <strong>\n    Fifth Avenue\n   </strong>\n   \") response (Doc. 417). On review, the SJ Motion is due to be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This action requires no opening act: so the Court repeats only the procedural history necessary to resolve the SJ Motion. CEC initiated this action alleging that McClary and Fifth Avenue infringed CEC's trademarks related to the band \"The Commodores\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Marks\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 1.) McClary and Fifth Avenue then separately answered the complaint and filed counterclaims against CEC. (Docs. 59, 79.) McClary and Fifth Avenue also filed a third-party complaint against several individuals and two entities they claimed were distinct from CEC-\"Commodores Entertainment Corp.\" and \"Commodore Entertainment Corp.\" (collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Commodore Corp\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 55.) After whittling down the Third-Party Defendants, three remain-David Fish, William King, and Walter Orange (collectively with CEC, \"\n   <strong>\n    Movants\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 197 (striking Commodore Corp and rejecting the theory that they were in fact separate from CEC).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court then bifurcated this action into two phases: \"Phase I\" focused on ownership of the Marks and Phase II covers liability and damages. (Doc. 310.) Having concluded that CEC owns the Marks, Phase I has been resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commodores Entm't Corp. v. McClary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266694\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1114/#p1132\">\n    879 F.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132-33 (11th Cir. 2018),\n   <em>\n    cert. docketed\n   </em>\n   (affirming the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law on the issue of CEC's ownership in the Marks). With this, the Court directed the parties to submit a joint notice identifying the remaining claims for Phase II. (Doc. 403 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Joint Notice\n   </strong>\n   \").) The Court then set the matter for a Preliminary Pretrial Conference (\"\n   <strong>\n    PPTC\n   </strong>\n   \") and allowed the parties to move for summary judgment on claims the parties believed were capable of resolution as a matter of law. (Doc. 406.) CEC then filed the SJ Motion (Doc. 411) and McClary and Fifth Avenue responded (Doc. 417). At the PPTC, the Court heard argument on the SJ Motion and the claims raised in the Joint Notice and made several rulings from the bench. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 422.) This Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The remaining claims for resolution in Phase II arise from four pleadings: (1) CEC's Complaint (Doc. 1); (2) McClary's First Amended Verified Counterclaim against CEC (Doc. 79); (3) Fifth Avenue's Counterclaim against CEC (Doc. 59); and (4) McClary and Fifth Avenue's Third-Party Complaint (Doc. 55). Given the overlapping nature of these claims, the Court has grouped them where appropriate. The Court begins with CEC's affirmative claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. CEC's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In CEC's eight-count Complaint, it seeks damages and attorney fees under several theories of liability, including: (1) trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 1\n   </strong>\n   \"); false designation of origin under \u00a7 1125(a) (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 2\n   </strong>\n   \"); trademark dilution under \u00a7 1125(c) (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 3\n   </strong>\n   \"); passing off under \u00a7 1125(a) (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 4\n   </strong>\n   \"); false advertising under \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(B) (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 5\n   </strong>\n   \"); common law trademark infringement and unfair competition (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 7\n   </strong>\n   \"); and violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 8\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 68-115, 120-136.) The elements of Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 mirror those of Count 1, so the Court first considers Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to Count 1, the Court found that CEC was entitled to summary judgment, as \u00a7 1114(1) requires a showing that: \"(1) its marks [were] used in commerce by the defendant without the [plaintiff's] consent and (2) the unauthorized use was likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake or to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    Optimum Techs., Inc. v. Henkel Consumer Adhesives, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704080\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/1231/#p1241\">\n    496 F.3d 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1241 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp. v. Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1866536\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/710/1480/#p1491\">\n    710 F.2d 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1491 (11th Cir. 1983) ). At the PPTC, the parties agreed that CEC's Marks were used in commerce without CEC's consent. As for the second element-likelihood of confusion-the Court concluded that its previous finding related to the issuance of the permanent injunction conclusively establishes\n   that a likelihood of confusion existed between \"The Commodores\" and McClary's band. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 56, p. 7; Doc. 364.) So the SJ Motion is due to be granted as to Count 1 of the Complaint. From there, the Court found that Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were duplicative and deemed them abandoned. The Court will thus dismiss these claims and deny the SJ Motion as moot as to those Counts of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the remaining Count 8, CEC explained at the PPTC that it intended to pursue its claim under Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    FDUTPA\n   </strong>\n   \"). FDUTPA declares unlawful \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" committed \"in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). A FDUTPA claim has three elements: (1) a deceptive act or unfair practice; (2) causation; and (3) actual damages.\n   <em>\n    Dolphin LLC v. WCI Cmtys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566956\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/1243/#p1250\">\n    715 F.3d 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1250 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    Rollins, Inc. v. Butland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8325766\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/951/860/#p869\">\n    951 So. 2d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 869 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006) ). CEC claims that infringing its Marks also violates FDUTPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 132-133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Now that such infringement has been established, CEC claims that it is necessarily entitled to summary judgment on Count 8 because the same legal standards applied to Lanham Act claims also apply to FDUTPA claims. (Doc. 411, pp. 11-12.) True, trademark infringement is an unfair and deceptive trade practice that constitutes a violation of FDUTPA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. GSM Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642172\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/555/1331/\">\n    555 F.Supp.2d 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. 2008). But there are still two elements CEC must prove to prevail on this claim: causation and actual damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dolphin LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566956\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/1243/#p1250\">\n    715 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As CEC briefed only the first element, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 411, pp. 11- 12.) So the SJ Motion is due to be denied as to Count 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Counterclaims and Third-Party Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Next, the Court turns to McClary's twelve counterclaims (Doc. 79), Fifth Avenue's three counterclaims (Doc. 59), and McClary and Fifth Avenue's fifteen-count Third-Party Complaint (Doc. 55). Such claims fall into two categories: (1) claims either abandoned or resolved in Phase I; and (2) claims Movants include in the SJ Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Abandoned Counterclaims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Falling squarely with the first category are all three of Fifth Avenue's counterclaims, which allege theories of liability for: (1) defamation/business disparagement; (2) interference with present economic opportunities; and (3) interference with prospective economic opportunities. (Doc. 59, \u00b6\u00b6 62-98.) Because the parties failed to raise these counterclaims in the Joint Notice, Fifth Avenue abandoned them. Thus, they are due to be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   McClary also did not raise all his counterclaims in the Joint Notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 403, pp. 2-4.) He has thus abandoned the following six counterclaims: (1) trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) unfair competition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (3) passing off under \u00a7 1125(a) ; (4) trademark dilution by tarnishment under \u00a7 1125(c)(2)(C) ; (5) common law trademark infringement; and (6) declaratory\n   judgment concerning McClary's ownership of the Marks (\"\n   <strong>\n    Counterclaim 7\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 79, \u00b6\u00b6 67-126, 141-157.) Thus, these Counterclaims will be dismissed accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Abandoned Third-Party Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   McClary and Fifth Avenue assert several claims against Third-Party Defendants Commodore Corp, William King (\"\n   <strong>\n    Mr. King\n   </strong>\n   \"), David Fish (\"\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Fish\n   </strong>\n   \"), and Walter Orange (\"\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Orange\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 55.) McClary and Fifth Avenue, however, did not preserve the following ten third-party claims in the Joint Notice: (1) trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) unfair competition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (3) passing off under \u00a7 1125(a) ; (4) trademark dilution by tarnishment under \u00a7 1125(c)(2)(C) ; (5) common law trademark infringement; (6) cancellation of the Marks (\"\n   <strong>\n    Third-Party Claim 6\n   </strong>\n   \"); (7) commercial misappropriation; (8) declaratory relief concerning McClary's ownership of the Marks (\"\n   <strong>\n    Third-Party Claim 8\n   </strong>\n   \"); (9) FDUTPA; (10) request for an accounting.

Claims addressed in the SJ Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   What remains are those counterclaims and third-party claims for which CEC contends it is entitled to summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 411, pp. 12-22.) Specifically, CEC moves for summary judgment on McClary's Counterclaims for: (1) commercial misappropriation (\"\n   <strong>\n    Commercial Misappropriation Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n   \"); and (2) violation of FDUTPA (\"\n   <strong>\n    FDUTPA Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.) CEC also moves for summary judgment on three sets of identical counterclaims and third-party claims: (1) defamation/business disparagement (\"\n   <strong>\n    Defamation Claims\n   </strong>\n   \"); (2) interference with present and prospective economic opportunities; and (3) interference with prospective economic opportunities (collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Interference Claims\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-20.) Finally, CEC moves for summary judgment on two third-party claims asserted against only Mr. King and Mr. Orange: (1) breach of duty of loyalty and utmost good faith; and (2) breach of fiduciary duty (collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Breach Claims\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22.) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to McClary and Fifth Avenue, the Court finds that CEC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these counterclaims and third-party claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Commercial Misappropriation Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In Counterclaim 6, McClary asserts a claim for commercial misappropriation under Florida Statute \u00a7 540.08(1). Section 540.08(1) prohibits a person from \"publish[ing], print[ing], display[ing] or otherwise publicly [using] for purposes of trade or for any commercial or advertising purpose the name, portrait, photograph, or other likeness of any natural purpose without\" that person's \"express written or oral consent.\" According to McClary, CEC violated Florida law by using McClary's picture on social media sites like Facebook to\n   promote The Commodores. (Doc. 79, \u00b6\u00b6 136-138.) CEC refutes these allegations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 411, p. 13.) For his part, McClary relies on copies of \"The Commodores\" Facebook page that he maintains CEC operates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 417-5, pp. 2-11.) But the Facebook page does not establish that CEC created, maintained, or controlled the social medial page. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) At the PPTC, CEC's counsel argued that the Facebook page referenced by McClary is not affiliated with CEC. In support, CEC pointed to an \"unsworn\" declaration of Mr. King, current member of The Commodores and CEC's president, submitted pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 411-1.) In it, Mr. King stated that CEC does not have a Facebook page. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) McClary submitted no rebuttal evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, Mr. King's declaration contains the language spelled out in \u00a7 1746(2). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 411-1, p. 2.) The Court will accept Mr. King's declaration and treat it as an affidavit for summary judgment purposes.\n   <em>\n    Four Parcels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11724351\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/941/1428/#p1438\">\n    941 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1444 n.36. Accepting Mr. King's declaration, the Court finds that CEC has carried its burden on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Four Parcels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11724351\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/941/1428/#p1438\">\n    941 F.2d at 1438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that to satisfy its burden the movant may point to affirmative evidence). So the SJ Motion is due to be granted as to McClary's Commercial Misappropriation Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    b. FDUTPA Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In Counterclaim 8, McClary asserts that CEC violated FDUTPA by infringing his trademark. (Doc. 79, \u00b6 160.) As noted above, FDUTPA requires three elements: (1) a deceptive act or unfair practice; (2) causation; and (3) actual damages.\n   <em>\n    Dolphin LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566956\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/1243/#p1250\">\n    715 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having established that McClary maintained no ownership rights in the Marks, he cannot establish that CEC infringed his trademark and thus cannot establish a violation of FDUTPA based on trademark infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crystal Entm't &amp; Filmworks, Inc. v. Jurado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647546\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1313/#p1323\">\n    643 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1323 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that the plaintiff's FDUTPA claim failed where he had no enforceable rights in the trademark at issue \"because the legal standards [a court applies] to [a FDUTPA] claim are the same as those ... applied under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act\"). So McClary's FDUTPA Counterclaim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Defamation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   McClary and Fifth Avenue also bring a counterclaim and third-party claim for defamation/business disparagement against Movants based on Mr. Fish's allegedly false communications with non-parties representing that McClary was enjoined from any use of CEC's Marks. (Doc. 79, \u00b6 170; Doc. 55, \u00b6 170.) Florida law requires a defamation plaintiff to show: \"(1) publication; (2) falsity; (3) the actor acted with knowledge or reckless disregard as to the falsity on a matter concerning a public\n   official, or at least negligently on a matter concerning a private person; (4) actual damages; and (5) the statement is defamatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Jews For Jesus, Inc. v.

But if the plaintiff is a public figure, he must also demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence \"actual malice\" by the person publishing the statement.\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    376 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279-80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    84 S.Ct. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    11 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964). \"[A] public figure plaintiff must establish that the disseminator of the information either knew the alleged defamatory statements were false or published them with reckless disregard despite awareness of their probable falsity.\"\n   <em>\n    Mile Marker, Inc. v. Petersen Publ'g, L.L.C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449400\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/811/841/#p845\">\n    811 So.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (Fla. 4th DCA 2002) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the PPTC, McClary and Fifth Avenue focus on Mr. Fish's communications to non-parties. They insist that because McClary is permitted to make fair use of CEC's marks, Mr. Fish's emails representing that McClary could not make\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   use of the Marks was false and misrepresented the Court's preliminary injunction. According to McClary and Fifth Avenue, Mr. Fish demonstrated reckless disregard for the truth because he did not know what fair use meant and made no effort to ascertain its meaning, despite an obligation to do so. But a review of Mr. Fish's emails belies their claims. All they reveal is that: (1) Mr. Fish directed one recipient to the Court's Order concerning the preliminary injunction; and (2) Mr. Fish requested contact information concerning a promotor because he had become aware that a band was marketing itself as The Commodores. (Doc. 417-4, pp. 7, 11.) With this context, Mr. Fish's communications were not false, nor did they misrepresent the Court's preliminary injunction. Hence the Defamation Claims fail, so the Court will grant the SJ Motion as to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Interference Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   McClary and Fifth Avenue next assert counterclaims and third-party claims for present and prospective interference with economic opportunities. (Doc. 55, \u00b6\u00b6 178-207; Doc. 79, \u00b6\u00b6 179-227.) The interference with\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   economic opportunities claim rests on Mr. Fish's alleged misrepresentations and threats of legal action to the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center (\"\n   <strong>\n    Center\n   </strong>\n   \"), with whom McClary and Fifth Avenue had an existing performance contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 55, \u00b6\u00b6 182-188.) Specifically, McClary and Fifth Avenue allege that the Center had a \"standard policy\" to \"automatically book the act for the following year to come back.\" (Doc. 55, \u00b6 187). But following McClary's show, under which he performed as \"The Commodores featuring Thomas McClary,\" the Center's Director, James Burke, said he \"couldn't honor the policy to immediately re-book.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 188). Beyond this, McClary alleges that following the entry of the Court's preliminary injunction, CEC sent \"blast e-mails\" throughout the industry threatening promoters and agents with litigation in booking McClary under the offending band name. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 79, \u00b6\u00b6 192-196.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Similarly, the interference with\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   economic opportunities claim arises from Mr. Fish's alleged communications with booking agents and talent buyers in the industry which stated that McClary had no right to use \"The Commodores\" Marks and threatened legal action for booking McClary's band. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 206-213.) McClary and Fifth Avenue allege that such conduct interfered with prospective\n   economic relationships to appear at the Tampa Bay Black Heritage Festival (\"\n   <strong>\n    Festival\n   </strong>\n   \") and with prospective relationships with an Italian promoter, Luigi Sidero, and a U.S. promoter, Carlos Keyes (\"\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Keyes\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 55, \u00b6\u00b6 197-200; Doc. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 206, 216-218.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The elements of tortious interference with a present or prospective business relationship are: \"(1) the existence of a business relationship that affords the plaintiff existing or prospective legal rights; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the business relationship; (3) the defendant's intentional and unjustified interference with the relationship; and (4) damage to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Sales &amp; Servs., Inc. v.

In its briefing, CEC further contends that its communications with venues and promotors were privileged as a competitor and owner of the Marks. (Doc. 411, p. 20) McClary retorts that the \"unsworn\" declaration of John Hessenthaler, a British music promoter, stating \"[b]ecause of interference from David Fish writing threatening letter to venues [McClary's] show in Croydon was cancelled. This reduced the contract to (5) shows at $70,834\" establishes a genuine issue of material fact as to CEC's interference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 417-4, \u00b6 7.) The Court disagrees with McClary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Not all interference is actionable. Indeed \"[t]here can be no claim [for tortious interference with a business relationship] where the action complained of is undertaken to safeguard or promote one's financial or economic interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Genet Co. v.

To establish this \"competition privilege,\" a defendant must show that: (1) the plaintiff's business relationship concerned a matter involved in the competition between the plaintiff and defendant; (2) it did not employ improper means; (3) it did not intend to create or continue an illegal restraint of competition; and (4) its purpose was at least in part to advance its interest in competing with the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Austral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486754\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/262/1152/#p1154\">\n    262 F.3d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As it stands, because CEC rightfully owns the Marks, its truthful communications with venues and promoters were justified by the competition privilege. McClary's evidence does not alter this conclusion. Hence the SJ Motion is due to be granted on the Interference Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Breach Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In Counts 13 and 14 of the Third-Party Complaint, McClary and Fifth Avenue allege that Mr. King and Mr. Orange breached the duty of loyalty and utmost good faith and their fiduciary duties by denouncing McClary's rights as a shareholder in CEC and failing to follow corporate formalities. (Doc. 55, \u00b6\u00b6 208-249.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CEC argues that McClary's shares in CEC were cancelled when he left The Commodores. (Doc. 411, p. 21.) In support, CEC draws the Court's attention to Mr. King's statements acknowledging McClary's resignation and cancellation of his shares. (Doc. 411-1, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11.) CEC also submits McClary's cancelled stock certificate. (Doc. 411-2.) To counter this evidence, McClary quibbles with the authenticity of the stock certificate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 417, pp. 24-25.) Absent evidence, McClary has not established a genuine issue of material fact as to his status as a CEC shareholder.

Soundview Comm'ns, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 1:04-cv-524-JEC,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%206038743\">\n     2005 WL 6038743\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 15, 2005). For summary judgment purposes, an unsworn declaration may be given the same force and effect as an affidavit if it is signed, dated, and includes language in substantially the following form: \"I declare (or certify, verify, state) under penalty of perjury ... that the foregoing true and correct.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Four Parcels\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11724351\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/941/1428/#p1438\">\n     941 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1444 n.36 (noting that for summary judgment purposes, a court may consider a declaration executed in accordance with \u00a7 1746 as an affidavit).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    McClary submitted an unsigned Hessenthaler Declaration. (Doc. 417-4, p. 4.) A single page then follows the Hessenthaler Declaration that appears to be a duplicate final page of the Hessenthaler Declaration with a signature. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5.) Despite the confusion, the Court will accept this declaration and treat it as an affidavit under \u00a7 1746(2) for summary judgment purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    In the Joint Notice, the parties raised McClary's counterclaim for an accounting (\"\n    <strong>\n     Counterclaim 12\n    </strong>\n    \"). (Doc. 403, p. 4; Doc. 79, \u00b6\u00b6 228-243.) CEC, however, did not move for summary judgment on this claim (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 411), but McClary's counsel did present argument on it at the PPTC. Because the Court finds that McClary is not a CEC shareholder, Counterclaim 12 fails as a matter of law and is due to be dismissed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
