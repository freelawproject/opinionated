Douglas Lamborn, and Lamborn for Congress. Plaintiffs ask the Court to issue a mandatory preliminary injunction requiring defendant Wayne W. Williams, the Secretary of State for the State of Colorado, to certify Congressman Lamborn for the ballot in the Republican primary election to the U.S. House of Representatives in the Fifth Congressional District. Docket No. 2 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Douglas Lamborn is a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives for the Fifth Congressional District. He is also the incumbent, having been first elected in 2006. Docket No. 1 at 6. Lamborn for Congress is the authorized campaign committee for Congressman Lamborn and is registered as a federal political committee with the Federal Elections Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Ryan Mark Tipple is a registered Colorado voter, affiliated with the Republican Party. Mr. Tipple collected nominating signatures on behalf of Congressman Lamborn for the primary election in 2018 and wants to collect signatures for nominating petitions in Colorado in the future.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. He currently resides in the State of California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Signatures that Mr. Tipple collected on behalf of Congressman Lamborn in 2018 were declared invalid by the Colorado Supreme Court on April 23, 2018 because Mr. Tipple was not a resident of the State of Colorado at the time he collected the signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Melissa Renee and Jeremy Wayde Goodall are registered Colorado voters, affiliated with the Republican Party, who reside in the Fifth Congressional District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. They signed a nominating petition for Congressman Lamborn circulated by Mr. Tipple, which was declared invalid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They are also petition circulators. Plaintiffs Shauna Leigh and Jeffery Phillip Arrington and Karla Jo Kroeker are registered Colorado voters, affiliated with the Republican Party, who reside in the Fifth Congressional District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They signed a nominating petition for Congressman Lamborn circulated by Mr. Tipple, which was declared invalid. The Arringtons and Ms. Kroeker are not petition circulators. As a result of the invalidation of the petitions circulated by Mr. Tipple, the signatures of the Goodalls, the Arringtons, and Ms. Kroeker will not be counted in the primary election.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Colorado law provides two means by which a major party candidate can gain access to the primary ballot for public office: by collecting signatures on nominating petitions or by a certification of designation of the political party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives who seek to be placed on the primary ballot through the nominating petition process must collect 1,000 signatures from eligible electors residing in the congressional district and who are affiliated with the same political party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-4-801\">\n    Colo.

There are 200,000 registered Republicans in the Fifth Congressional District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Congressman Lamborn decided to run for reelection and, on December 23, 2017, he submitted information to the Secretary of State's Office in order for the Secretary to prepare a petition format that Congressman Lamborn could use to gain access to the primary ballot through the petition process. Exhibit 5 to April 30, 2018 Preliminary Injunction hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Secretary approved Congressman Lamborn's petition format on January 3, 2018, noting, among other things, that \"petition circulators must be Colorado residents.\" Exhibit 6. Candidates for the Fifth Congressional District could collect signatures between January 16, 2018 and March 20, 2018,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-4-801\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , a total of 63 days. Congressman Lamborn used 13 circulators to collect signatures for his nominating petitions. On March 6, 2018, he turned in his nominating petitions to the Secretary of State. Docket No. 1 at 14. On March 29, 2018, the Secretary of State found that 1,269 signatures of the 1,783 signatures submitted were valid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-4-801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because this number was more than the 1,000 signatures needed, the Secretary determined that Congressman Lamborn had obtained a sufficient number of signatures to be placed on the ballot for the June 26, 2018 primary election and issued a Statement of Sufficiency. Exhibit 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Secretary uses the following procedures in reviewing signature petitions. Once a candidate submits his or her petitions to the Secretary for review, the Secretary of State's Office takes the petitions to a division of the Department of Personnel Administration in Pueblo. The petitions are electronically scanned. First, the reviewers check the circulator's affidavit for facial validity, including whether the circulator filled it out properly, signed it, and had it properly notarized. The reviewers then run the circulator's information through the state voter registration database to determine whether that person meets the qualifications to be a circulator, such as being over 18 years old, being affiliated with the proper political party, and being a resident of Colorado. Any problems regarding these issues are subject to a cure period wherein the candidate may attempt to correct the defects, the goal being to give every registered elector the opportunity to have his or her signature counted. Second, the reviewers check the information on each signature line to make sure that such information matches the information in the voter registration database for that person. This process determines whether the person was eligible to sign the petition. The second step also includes a signature verification procedure that Colorado is implementing for the first time this year, wherein the signature on the petition is compared, through the Secretary's electronic voter registration database, to the most recent signature for that voter. These signatures may include the signature of a voter on the back of a previously submitted mail-in ballot. If, in the opinion of the trained reviewers, the signatures match, the Secretary accepts the otherwise valid signature. If not, that signature is subjected to an additional level of review whereby at least two bipartisan\n   reviewers compare that petition signature to any other signatures of that person in the voter registration database. If those reviewers determine that the petition signature does not match, the Secretary provides a list of the nonmatching signatures to the candidate so that the candidate can attempt to cure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 3, 2018, five voters from the Fifth Congressional District filed a petition in the District Court for the City and County of Denver pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201-1-113\">\n    Colo.

The petitioners claimed that seven of Congressman Lamborn's circulators did not live within the State of Colorado in violation of the residency requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-4-905\">\n    Colo.

On April 10, 2018, the state district court, after an evidentiary hearing, found that one circulator was not a Colorado resident and therefore invalidated the 58 signatures that he collected. In regard to Mr. Tipple, the court found that Mr. Tipple had every intention of becoming a Colorado resident, but just had not done so at the time he collected signatures in the state.\n   <em>\n    Kuhn v.

The district court found that Mr. Tipple was a Colorado resident and therefore rejected petitioners' challenge as to Mr. Tipple. Petitioners then appealed directly to the Colorado Supreme Court. The state supreme court reversed, holding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201-1-113\">\n    Colo. Rev.

The Colorado Supreme Court invalidated the 269 signatures collected by Mr. Tipple, causing Congressman Lamborn to have collected fewer than the 1,000 signatures needed to qualify him. As a result, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the \"Secretary may not certify Representative Lamborn to the 2018 primary ballot for CD5.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 489. Moreover, although Congressman Lamborn attempted to raise the constitutionality of the residency requirement on appeal, the Supreme Court noted that, in a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201-1-113\">\n    Colo.

Specifically, defendant contends that plaintiffs could have brought their claims years ago or, at the latest, when the petitioners in the state-court action filed their lawsuit on April 3, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10485\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/1028/#p1031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant also asserts that plaintiffs' delay has resulted in prejudice to both the Secretary and the public at large. First, the Secretary argues that it has had to \"scramble\" to defend against plaintiffs' lawsuit with only a few days left before the ballot certification deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Second, the Secretary claims that the lawsuit could disrupt the orderly administration of the election and cause the Secretary to miss deadlines, such as the ballot certification deadline on May 2, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Finally, at the evidentiary hearing on April 30, 2018, defendant expressed broader concerns about judicial intervention at this stage of the electoral process. In particular, defendant noted that the granting of a preliminary injunction could (1) result in the application of different standards to different candidates, (2) encourage future eleventh-hour challenges to ballot access requirements, and (3) cause voter confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they were justified in bringing their constitutional claim on April 25, 2018 because the Colorado Supreme Court's April 23, 2018 decision in\n   <em>\n    Kuhn v. Williams\n   </em>\n   unexpectedly altered the status quo on two fronts: first, by interpreting \u00a7 1-1-113 to allow evidentiary challenges to the residency of a petition circulator after the Secretary has issued a statement of sufficiency as to that circulator's residency and signatures; and second, by holding that residency for purposes of \u00a7 1-4-905(1) must be determined according to objective factors. Plaintiffs contend that, until the Colorado Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kuhn\n   </em>\n   , they could not reasonably have known of the possibility that the signatures gathered by Mr. Tipple and deemed sufficient by the Secretary of State would be invalidated due to noncompliance with \u00a7 1-4-905(1)'s residency requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite the Court's concerns about the diligence of Congressman Lamborn and his campaign, the Secretary's laches defense fails as to the second prong-prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ute Indian Tribe of Uintah and Ouray Reservation v.

However, there has been no suggestion that defendant would have altered his litigation strategy had plaintiffs filed their complaint three weeks earlier, after the\n   <em>\n    Kuhn\n   </em>\n   petition was filed. The Secretary has not argued that he needed more time to develop his laches defense. And while the Secretary argues that he could not properly prepare for the preliminary injunction hearing, since there has been no time for discovery or for developing expert testimony, the Secretary did not explain what type of discovery he would have sought, how such discovery could have influenced the standard of review applicable to plaintiffs' constitutional claims, or how such discovery would have otherwise altered his constitutional argument. Thus, the Secretary does not show how a claim filed three weeks earlier would have obviated any prejudice he suffers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant next suggests that plaintiffs' delay could cause the Secretary to miss important deadlines with regard to the election process. That is not apparent to the Court. This order is being entered before the Secretary's deadline for certifying candidates to the 2018 Republican primary election ballot. The Secretary has already issued a statement of sufficiency regarding Congressman Lamborn. The Secretary has not identified any logistical impediment to his ability to certify Congressman Lamborn to the 2018 Republican Party primary ballot by the May 2 deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, defendant contends that the issuance of a preliminary injunction may have \"unpredictable collateral consequences\" for Colorado's electoral process. The Court is sympathetic to defendant's concern. As the Fourth Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , \"[b]allots and elections do not magically materialize. They require planning, preparation, and studious attention to detail if the fairness and integrity of the electoral process is to be observed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4123621\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/471/219/#p227\">\n    471 F.

As with defendant's other prejudice arguments, however, defendant has failed to explain how such concerns are implicated in this case. Although defendant referred at oral argument to two pending state court cases that apparently involve the circulator residency requirement, defendant has offered no explanation as to what effect an adverse ruling in this case would have on the litigants in those proceedings. Additionally,\n   defendant asserts that a preliminary injunction in this case could result in voter confusion. But in his opposition to the motion to intervene, defendant argued that, \"[w]hile it is true that provisionally placing Rep.

Docket No. 27 at 13. The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. Defendant does not identify any authority for the proposition that ease of ballot access is sufficient, by itself, to mitigate the burdens imposed by a restriction on the available pool of circulators. Moreover, such an argument construes plaintiffs' claim too narrowly. As the Fourth Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Virginia v.

Wood, an associate professor of law, political science, and public policy at the University of Southern California. Docket No. 35-1 at 1. Professor Wood's declaration opines that, \"[a]t least in theory, preventing out-of-state circulators can help to protect the integrity of the election and prevent fraud, simply because in-state circulators will feel the effects of votes cast by the candidate if elected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also states that, \"all else equal, the expected cost of committing fraud is lower for out of state residents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Professor Wood cites no evidence for her opinions, and courts have found that the frequency of fraud by in-state and out-of-state circulators is the same.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Yes on Term Limits, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742326\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1023/#p1027\">\n    550 F.3d at 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that record did \"not support the district court's conclusion that non-resident circulators as a class engage in fraudulent activity to a greater degree than resident circulators\"). Accordingly, the Court does not find Professor Wood's opinions persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, the Secretary's concerns about circulator fraud are largely obviated by Colorado's new process for verifying signatures on candidate petitions. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-4-908\">\n    Colo. Rev.

In addition, he stated that the residency requirement facilitates the state's and candidates' access to circulators in the event there is a deficiency in a candidate's petition. However, neither of these arguments relates to the issue of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Secretary also argues that the residency requirement ensures that the state can subpoena a circulator and compel him to \"travel to and attend a hearing\" within a short time frame in the event that there is a contest over a petition's sufficiency. Docket No. 27 at 17. Courts have routinely found that requiring circulators to sign affidavits or enter into agreements in which they \"provide their relevant contact information and agree to return in the event of a protest\" is a more narrowly tailored means of ensuring a state's ability to locate circulators than is a residency requirement.\n   <em>\n    Yes on Term Limits, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742326\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1023/#p1027\">\n    550 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1030 ;\n   <em>\n    Chandler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9419946\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/1236/#p1241\">\n    292 F.3d at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that less restrictive approach would be to \"require..., as a prerequisite to circulating an initiative, referendum, or recall petition in the City, the prospective circulator agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Arvada Municipal Court\"). Colorado has already implemented this requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-111\">\n    Colo.

To the extent residency is used as an easy way to ascertain a circulator's compliance with the other requirements in \u00a7 1-4-905(1), the Court is unable to perceive why \u00a7 1-40-111(2)(a) does not adequately achieve this same interest. The residency requirement itself is not a narrowly tailored means to accomplish the goal of locating circulators or gaining their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In summary, the Secretary fails to demonstrate that the residency requirement is narrowly tailored to protecting the integrity of the petition process. Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiffs have made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

In response, the Secretary argues that Congressman Lamborn and the plaintiffs who voted for him may still mount a write-in campaign. Docket No. 27 at 19. Given that no major political party candidate has ever successfully won a primary based on write-in votes, the Court finds that this factor weighs heavily in favor of plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As to whether plaintiffs have shown that the threatened injury to them outweighs the injury caused by the injunction and whether the injunction would be adverse to the public interest, the Secretary claims that \"the entire election administration process used by the Secretary to validate submitted signatures will be called into question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-111\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court discerns no such possible deleterious effect on the Secretary's signature verification system, which appears to be working efficiently and effectively. The Secretary also claims that \"[o]ther disqualified candidates may similarly seek court orders to place them on the primary ballot,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-111\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-111\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but the Secretary has not identified any other candidates who, like Congressman Lamborn, would have qualified for the primary ballot but for the residency requirement. Finally, the Secretary argues generally that changing the election rules midstream could shake the confidence in the integrity of our electoral system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-111\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the Secretary appropriately has concerns about the integrity of the election system, which he is charged with administering and which constitutes a compelling interest of the State, that concern is lessened here. First, there is no dispute that the contested signatures were the signatures of qualified electors that were invalidated solely because of the likely unconstitutional residency requirement. The State has no legitimate interest in an unconstitutional provision. Second, this Court declared a similar residency provision in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-40-112\">\n    Colo. Rev.
