Pursuant to L.R. 7.1, the court did not hear oral argument, as this matter has been thoroughly and sufficiently presented in the briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND FACTS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in which the city's drinking water became tainted with lead and other contaminants after the city switched its drinking water source to the Flint River to reduce costs. The complaint was filed as a class action in state court by named Plaintiffs Melissa Mays, Michael Adam Mays, Jacqueline Pemberton, Keith John Pemberton, Elnora Carthan, and Rhonda Kelso against the City of Flint, the Receivership Transition Advisory Board, Natasha Henderson, Eden Victoria Wells, M.D.,\n   Stephen Busch, Liane Shekter-Smith, Adam Rosenthal, Patrick Cook, Michael Prysby, Bradley Wurfel, Howard Croft, Michael Glasgow, and Daugherty Johnson. The individual defendants are current or former employees of the City of Flint or the State of Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs, who intend to represent a class of thousands of Flint water users, have set forth state claims of gross negligence, fraud, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants were grossly negligent in approving a switch in Flint's drinking water source to the Flint River and in monitoring the lead levels in the drinking water supply after that change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at \u00b6 1. Plaintiff further allege that Defendants, \"in bad faith, assured Flint water users that the Flint River water was safe to consume when they were on actual notice and had reason to believe that the water was in fact unfit for human consumption.\" Compl. at \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants Cook, Shekter-Smith, Busch, and Wurfel, who are current or former employees of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (\"MDEQ\"), filed a notice of removal of this action from Genesee County Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MDEQ Defendants contend removal is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the federal officer removal statute, and under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , based upon a substantial federal question. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to remand, arguing that this court lacks jurisdiction over their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims against the individual MDEQ defendants are relevant to the motion to remand. With respect to Stephen Busch, the District Supervisor assigned to the Lansing District Office of the MDEQ, Plaintiffs allege that he acted in a grossly negligent manner when he \"knowingly created, increased and prolonged the hazards by approving the decision to switch the water source when he was on notice of the dangers associated with same.\" Compl. at \u00b6 20. Plaintiffs further allege that Busch \"falsely reported that anti-corrosive agents had been used to treat the highly corrosive Flint River water and thereby provided assurances to Plaintiffs and the public that the Flint River water was safe when he was on actual notice, and/or had reason to believe, that these assurances were false and/or baseless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Patrick Cook was the Water Treatment Specialist assigned to the Lansing Community Drinking Water Unit of the MDEQ. Plaintiffs allege that he was grossly negligent in approving the decision to switch Flint's drinking water source and in failing \"to properly monitor and test the Flint River water; he falsely reported to the EPA that the Flint River water was treated with anti-corrosive chemicals; and he [falsely] provided assurances to Plaintiffs that the Flint River was safe.\" Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Michael Prysby was the Engineer assigned to District 11 (Genesee County) of the MDEQ. Plaintiffs allege Prysby was grossly negligent in approving the decision to switch the water source and in failing to properly monitor and test the Flint River water. Plaintiffs also allege that Prysby provided false assurances to the public that the Flint River water was safe. Compl. at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Bradley Wurfel was the Director of Communication for the MDEQ. Plaintiffs allege that Wurfel was \"responsible\n   for the deliberate, misleading and inaccurate communications that increased and prolonged the hazards, threats, and dangers that arose by replacing safe drinking water with a highly toxic alternative.\" Compl. at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Liane Shekter-Smith was the Chief of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance for the MDEQ. Plaintiffs allege that Shekter-Smith was \"grossly negligent in that she knowingly approved of, and thereby participated in, the decisions that created, increased and prolonged the hazards, threats and dangers that arose by replacing safe drinking water with a highly toxic alternative. She further provided false assurances to Plaintiffs and the entire Plaintiff class that the Flint River water was safe.\" Compl. at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Adam Rosenthal was a Water Quality Analyst assigned to the Lansing District Office of the MDEQ. Plaintiffs allege he was grossly negligent in participating in decisions that \"created increased and prolonged the hazards\" that arose from the change in water source. Plaintiffs further allege that Rosenthal provided false assurances that the Flint River water was safe.

Br. at 34-35 &amp; n.8. In other words, MDEQ contends that its approval and monitoring of Flint's drinking water source was in accordance with federal standards. The fact that MDEQ officials may have complied with federal law, however, does not transform them into federal officers. Nor does MDEQ's alleged compliance with or enforcement of federal law form the basis for Plaintiffs' claims. Rather, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants negligently approved the switch to Flint River water, failed to properly monitor and test the drinking water supply, and falsely assured the public the water was safe. Defendants have not identified how the SDWA, federal regulations, or federal officials\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   them to take the course of action they did.
