GORDON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a dispute over whether an insurance policy covers a theft scheme run by several employees of plaintiff CP Food &amp; Beverage, Inc. (CP). CP ran a club where patrons could buy \"funny money\" to tip waitresses or pay topless dancers. The waitresses and dancers could turn the funny money back into CP for cash. Certain CP employees overcharged customers' credit cards through various methods, including charging the credit card multiple times for the same bill, charging for bottles of alcohol that the employees kept for themselves, and charging for funny money that the customer never purchased and then cashing in the funny money with CP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The scheme was uncovered after multiple customers complained to the police and disputed the charges with their credit card companies. CP paid chargebacks to the customers' credit cards in a total amount of $768,617.91, both in response to its contractual requirements with the credit card companies and also as part of an agreement with law enforcement. CP also incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in professional fees to investigate and resolve issues with law enforcement and defrauded customers. However, if a customer did not dispute a charge or if the customer's dispute was not sustained, CP did not pay a chargeback.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the course of the scheme, CP was covered by a commercial crime policy issued by defendant United States Fire Insurance Company (U.S. Fire). The policy covered \"loss of or damage to 'money', 'securities' and 'other property' resulting directly from 'theft' committed by an 'employee', whether identified or not, acting alone or in collusion with other persons.\" ECF No. 26-6 at 4. The policy defines theft (which includes forgery) as \"the unlawful taking of property to the deprivation of the Insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 15. Property covered by the policy is limited to property that CP owns or leases or that CP \"hold[s] for others whether or not [CP is] legally liable for the loss of such property ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The policy does not cover a loss \"that is an indirect result of an 'occurrence' covered by this policy including, but not limited to, loss resulting from ... (3) Payment of costs, fees or other expenses you incur in establishing the existence or the amount of loss under this policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CP submitted a claim to U.S. Fire to recover the credit card chargebacks and professional fees, but U.S. Fire denied the claim. CP filed suit in this court against U.S. Fire, asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violations of the Unfair Claims Practices Act, and declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   U.S. Fire moves for summary judgment on all claims, arguing the policy does not\n   cover the employees' thefts because CP was not a direct victim of the theft. U.S. Fire contends CP instead is seeking to recover for its liability to the customers, which is not a covered loss. As for the bad faith claim, U.S. Fire contends it at least had a reasonable basis for denying CP's claim, and thus it did not act in bad faith as a matter of law. U.S. Fire also contends that CP has not identified any damages it suffered as a result of either the alleged bad faith or unfair practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CP responds that because the employees exchanged the funny money for cash from CP and because CP had to reimburse the customers for credit card charges, the employees stole from CP and the loss is covered under the policy. CP argues that it will be able to show bad faith because U.S. Fire did not investigate the claim and never asserted CP was not a direct victim of the theft until the present motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also contends that it will be able to show U.S. Fire engaged in unfair claims practices. Finally, CP argues that it has shown damages based on the chargebacks and professional fees incurred in investigating the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties dispute whether the theft scheme is a covered loss under the policy. U.S. Fire contends it is not because the scheme stole money from the customers, not CP, and CP was returning that stolen property through credit card chargebacks as a form of restitution or disgorgement. U.S. Fire argues the policy requires the loss to CP be directly caused by the employee theft, and it was not here because the employees stole from the customers and then used the stolen funds to buy alcohol or funny money from CP. CP responds that because the employees obtained cash from CP using the funny money, they stole from CP so the loss is covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Courts addressing similar policy language about a loss resulting directly from an employee's theft have fallen into two camps. Some courts view the policy language as equivalent to a proximate cause analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tooling, Mfg. &amp; Techs. Ass'n v. Hartford Fire Ins.

Starting with the policy's plain language, it covers loss resulting \"directly\" from an employee's theft. ECF No. 26-6 at 4. If proximate cause were sufficient, that would render the word \"directly\" superfluous. Additionally, the policy defines theft as \"the unlawful taking of property to the deprivation of the Insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 15. The property covered by the policy is limited to property that CP owns or leases or that it holds for others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The policy thus contemplates a loss when the insured is deprived of property (either its own or property it holds as trustee or bailee), not when a third party is deprived of property and the third party later sues the insured or requires repayment under a contractual provision. This is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the insured because this is not a policy designed to cover CP for liability to third parties for its vicarious liability due to its employees' theft of its customers' property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vons Cos., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 212 F.3d at 491 (\"Under the insuring clauses, Vons is covered only for direct losses to Vons caused by its employee's dishonesty, not for vicarious liability for losses suffered by others arising from its employee's tortious conduct.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Given the policy language and keeping in mind the purpose for which CP purchased this policy, CP would not expect coverage for the chargebacks or the investigation costs. The employees stole customers' money through unauthorized charges to the customers' credit cards. The employees then used that stolen money to purchase alcohol and funny money from CP. But the theft was of the customers' (or perhaps the credit card companies') funds, not CP's. CP admits that it would not be liable for a chargeback unless the customer disputed the charge. CP also admits that it paid the chargebacks as part of its contractual arrangement with the credit card companies and due to an agreement with law enforcement. CP's loss thus \"was contingent on the occurrence of a series of events that were not inevitable, ... were not immediate or readily ascertainable at the time of\" its employees' thefts, and if the customers never discovered the fraudulent charges or chose not to dispute them, CP \"would not have suffered the loss it now claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Direct Mortg.

Utah 2008). Its losses therefore did not \"directly\" result from the thefts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Likewise, CP's investigative costs did not directly result from the employees' theft. Instead, they resulted from CP attempting to investigate the thefts, to assure law enforcement that the owners were not involved in the scheme, and to support CP's insurance claim.

The only evidence of damages CP cites to is its own answers to interrogatories. ECF No. 26-12 at 7-8. However, that damages calculation lists chargebacks and professional fees. CP does not explain how any particular unfair claims practice resulted in chargebacks or professional fees. In those same interrogatories, CP was asked to state the amount of damages it incurred as a result of the alleged unfair practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. CP responded that it was \"in the process of calculating the exact amount of damages incurred as the result of Defendant's violations of the Nevada Unfair Claims Practices Act and evaluating whether an expert may be needed to assist in that task. As discovery is ongoing, [CP] will supplement its Answer to this Interrogatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There is no evidence CP updated this discovery response. CP thus has not pointed to evidence raising a genuine dispute as to damages on the unfair practices claim. Moreover, in its opposition, CP does not point to any evidence supporting the other elements of this claim. I therefore grant summary judgment in U.S. Fire's favor on the unfair practices claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that defendant United States Fire Insurance Company's motion for summary judgment\n   <strong>\n    (ECF No. 26) is GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   The clerk of court is instructed to enter judgment in favor of defendant United States Fire Insurance\n   Company and against plaintiff CP Food &amp; Beverage, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    This is incorrect. U.S. Fire sent a letter denying coverage on October 26, 2016, in which it stated that the thefts were not covered because the employees took money from customers, not from CP, and that CP did not suffer a loss directly from a theft.
