Tuchi, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At issue is Plaintiff and Counterdefendant Keith Ader's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims and Motion to Strike Certain Affirmative Defenses (Doc. 38, Mot. to Dismiss), to which Defendants and Counterclaimants SimonMed Imaging Incorporated, SMI Imaging, LLC, and Howard John Simon (collectively, \"SMI\") filed a Response (Doc. 39, Resp.), and Ader filed a Reply (Doc. 40, Reply). The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LRCiv 7.2(f). For the reason below, the Court grants Ader's Motion to Dismiss and the Court grants in part and denies in part the Motion to Strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Keith Ader is a modality service engineer who, for a number of years, worked for SMI, which is one of the largest providers of outpatient medical imaging in the nation. In his role, Ader performed primarily manual labor, installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting medical and radiological imaging and diagnostic equipment. Frequently, Ader worked more than forty hours in a week; however, he was not paid overtime for the additional hours that he worked each week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2016, Ader began to voice his concerns about SMI's failure to pay overtime to both him and similarly situated employees. Ader continued to express these concerns over the next year, culminating with his filing of the Complaint in the present case on June 29, 2017, which initially contained claims for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and Arizona Wage Act. Three days after service of the Complaint, on July 10, 2017, representatives from SMI's human resources department summoned Ader to an unscheduled meeting. At the meeting, SMI terminated Ader's employment with the company immediately. After his firing, Ader would amend his complaint to include a claim for unlawful retaliation under FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the months following Ader's departure, SMI learned of his role as the owner, operator, and sole employee of Hi-Caliber, Inc., which marketed and sold parts for radiological equipment and with which SMI had sometimes done business. As part of his job, Ader was able to access SMI's equipment and spare parts inventories, developing a familiarity with the processes SMI employed to maintain its own equipment. Ader used this knowledge to his advantage when, in January of 2017, he began emailing Hi-Caliber from his SMI email to inquire about a specific imaging component for sale. Ader, acting through Hi-Caliber, responded to his own email advising SMI that the component was available for purchase for $6,000. Ader then forwarded this conversation to his superiors at SMI, who were unaware of Ader's association with Hi-Caliber. Relying on Ader's representations and the emails, SMI approved the purchase of the part. SMI, however, would later learn that the fair market price of the part ranged between $3,000 and $4,500 from other vendors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the basis of Ader's alleged actions, SMI asserted a number of affirmative defenses and counterclaims in response to Ader's Complaint. In particular, SMI asserts that it is entitled to the defense of \"after-discovered evidence\" because it would have terminated Ader when it discovered the misuse of his work email and violations of company policies. (Am. Answer &amp; Counterclaim at 15.) Additionally, SMI filed five counterclaims and crossclaims against both Ader and Hi-Caliber for (1) fraud; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) negligent misrepresentation; and (5) civil conspiracy. (Am. Answer &amp; Counterclaim at 19-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ader now moves to dismiss those counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to strike two of Defendant's affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Am. Answer &amp; Counterclaim at 16.) Ader moves to dismiss the counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on two bases. First, Ader argues that the counterclaims do not form \"part of the same case or controversy\" for the purpose of \u00a7 1367. (Mot. to Dismiss at 3-4.) In the alternative, Ader argues that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1376(c)(4).

A counterclaim may be either compulsory or permissive. If a counterclaim \"arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim,\" it is compulsory and must be raised in response to the opposing party's claim unless an exception applies. Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a). Thus, under Rule 13(a), a court must consider whether \"the essential facts of the various claims are so logically connected that considerations of judicial economy and fairness dictate that all the issues be resolved in one lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Pochiro v.

For example, if a counterclaim is compulsory, the Court has supplemental jurisdiction because a counterclaim \"which arises out of the same transaction or occurrence\" as the plaintiff's claim also necessarily arises from the same \"common nucleus of operative fact.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933107\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/385/1063/#p1066\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933107\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/385/1063/#p1066\">\n    at 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The \u00a7 1367 test for supplemental jurisdiction is broader than the test for compulsory counterclaims ....\").

Indeed, the two sets of claims overlap only insofar as each arises from Ader's employment relationship with SMI. Such a relationship is insufficient to establish supplemental jurisdiction over SMI's counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poehler v.

Instead, SMI's arguments hinge on the counterclaims' relationship with SMI's affirmative defenses of set-off and after-discovered evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Resp. at 3 (\"Ader[ ] ... ignores the nexus between Defendants' affirmative defenses and SMI Imaging's Counterclaim ....\").) Thus, SMI argues that the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over its counterclaims because the counterclaims \"will rely in large part on the same evidence\" as its affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, both Rule 13 and \u00a7 1367 speak only of the relationship between\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   and contain no reference to the relationship between an affirmative defense and a purported counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawrence &amp; Assocs., Inc. v.

Because SMI fails to establish that this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over its counterclaims against Ader, so too does it fail to establish supplemental jurisdiction over its crossclaims against Hi-Caliber. As such, the Court must dismiss SMI's crossclaims against Hi-Caliber.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, Ader moves to strike SMI's affirmative defenses of set-off and laches. (Mot. to Dismiss at 15-17.) First, Ader argues that SMI's affirmative defense of set-off should be stricken because it is incorrectly cast as an affirmative defense rather than a counterclaim. Thus, because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaims, Ader asserts that it should not consider those same claims when recast as an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Courts sometimes use the terms 'setoff' and 'counterclaim' interchangeably.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sequel Contractors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"567470\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/402/1142/#p1156\">\n    402 F.Supp.2d 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1156 (C.D. Cal. 2005). The Ninth Circuit, however, has \"expressed a willingness to disregard labels and characterize an action according to its substance.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Parker N. Am. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123758,10513894\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/1145/\">\n    24 F.3d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1155 (9th Cir. 1994). SMI's affirmative defense alleges that \"[a]ny sums due to Ader from Defendants should be set off by the sums owed by Ader to SMI Imaging\" stemming from his \"engage[ment] in various activities related to the sale of radiological equipment to SMI.\" (Doc. 34 at 14.) This defense would require the presentation of SMI's own evidence about Ader's alleged misdeeds and a finding by the jury as to Defendants' damages after considering the Court's instruction\n   on the law regarding Defendants' claims. Only then would the jury offset any award of damages to Ader by the amount awarded to Defendants. The Court thus sees no distinction between the Defendants' affirmative defense of setoff and its counterclaims, which have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because the Court does not have jurisdiction over those counterclaims, the Court finds no basis for allowing the parties to litigate those same claims just because they have been framed as an affirmative defense rather than a counterclaim. As such, the Court will strike Defendants' seventeenth affirmative defense of set-off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, with regard to Ader's argument to strike SMI's affirmative defense of laches, the Court finds that Ader fails to make a sufficient showing to warrant striking the defense at this time. In his Motion, Ader cites to a single, non-precedential case from the Central District of California to stand for the proposition that laches is not a valid defense in any case brought under the FLSA. Given the lack of argument on the issue, the Court cannot conclude that it is \"absolutely clear\" that the defense \"could have no possible bearing on the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4210906\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/609/1104/#p1113\">\n    609 F.Supp.2d at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court thus denies Ader's Motion as it pertains to SMI's third affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   SMI fails to demonstrate that Counts I-V of its Counterclaim and Crossclaim arise from the same common nucleus of operative fact as Ader's claims. Thus, the Court lacks supplemental jurisdiction over those counterclaims. Additionally, the Court strikes SMI's seventeenth defense of set-off because it merely recasts SMI's counterclaims, over which the Court lacks jurisdiction, as an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   granting in part and denying in part Ader's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims and Motion to Strike Certain Affirmative Defenses (Doc. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   dismissing SMI's counterclaims and crossclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   striking SMI's seventeenth affirmative defense of setoff.
