However, the email to which Stoe points to support this argument does not create a genuine issue of fact, as no reasonable jury would make the inference from it that Stoe does.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Holcomb\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3451816,881091\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/889/\">\n       433 F.3d at 895\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . In the email, Tillery states that \"the individual that is selected\" for the position \"will replace the member of our staff currently serving as one of the two alternate Standards Executives for DOJ.\" Pl.'s Ex. 34 at 782. The email does not name Stoe as the staff member in question, and there is no evidence that Swineford would have connected Tillery's statement to Stoe. Nor does the language suggest that Stoe would not be considered for Division Director. Indeed, even if Swineford had been under the impression that Tillery did not want Stoe considered for the position, and failed to recommend her for that reason, this impression was dispelled when Tillery later intervened to ensure that Stoe received an interview. Tillery's intervention also makes it hard to infer discrimination from Stoe's initial failure to qualify for an interview.\n     </attorneys>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"10\">\n     <attorneys id=\"p-99\">\n      Stoe also claims that Tillery awarded Greene the same score as Higgins, despite admitting in his deposition that Stoe had outperformed Higgins-and therefore, by inference, had outperformed Greene.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n at 36.

Mem. for Record at 793. It is too clear for argument what Tillery's words meant: Greene's interview performance brought out evidence of his qualifications that was not apparent in his written application.

Though this is not the case, a brief word on the 2010 promotion is in order.

Stoe does not directly assert in her opposition brief that the 2010 decision provides such evidence. She argues only that her 2010 rejection for lack of supervisory experience makes the decision to hire Greene in 2014-when he admitted not to have had supervisory experience or training at DOJ-look suspect.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n at 43. And this juxtaposition does appear rather odd. The hiring panel was impressed by Greene's responses to the interview questions on ability to supervise, however,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Def.'s SMF at 12 n.4, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55, 57; and in any event there is too much evidence on the government's side regarding the 2014 promotion process itself for the 2010 promotion decision to alter the outcome,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Law v.

Pl.'s Opp'n at 13. But Stoe never argues in her opposition to the government's summary judgment motion that this evidence supports a finding of discrimination; the desk audit information appears only in the facts section of her opposition brief.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1547036,3440404\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/330/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      And in any event, the underlying evidence does not create any significant background evidence of discriminatory intent-if anything, it helps the government's case. Stoe claims that she first discussed the grading of her duties with Tillery and Hart two years before they filed the desk audit,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Stoe Dep. at 22:4-9, a claim which formed the basis for Stoe's later \"slow-walking\" allegation,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n at 12-13. However, Stoe also acknowledges that some of this time was taken up with her drafting, and Hart and Tillery editing, the desk audit package, including the description of what Stoe's GS-15 position would be.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Stoe Dep. at 26:21-27:20. While Stoe thought these rewrites were \"unnecessary,\" she did not otherwise provide any basis for inferring that Tillery was purposely delaying the desk audit. Def.'s Ex. 1 [ECF No. 16-4] at 60:3-25. Hart likewise stated that Tillery made such edits because \"[h]e wanted to make sure that the wording was correct, that we met the standards, that a desk audit would come back with a positive resolute, that we wanted to get her promoted.\" Def.'s Ex. 58 [ECF No. 21-8] at 116:12-15. Tillery \"fought very hard for this desk audit. He wanted to promote her to GS-15.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 116:6-7.\n     </attorneys>\n     <attorneys id=\"p-105\">\n      Stoe also noted that Tillery was working on a reorganization of the office at the same time. Stoe Dep. at 27:21-24. As Stoe acknowledged, Tillery revisited her desk audit with Ridgeway in 2013 and/or 2014, at her request.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s Ex. 1 at 53:9-18. Tillery did this by attempting to fold Stoe's promotion to GS-15 into the reorganization of OST.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s Ex. 8 at -27 to -28. In March 2014, after Hart had left OST, Tillery recommended to Ridgeway that Stoe's position be regraded to GS-15, because the proposed reorganization split up Hart's division into \"a Standards and Testing Team led by notionally [Stoe] and a Grants Management Team\" led by a potential GS-14 supervisor.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at -27.

Thereafter, Stoe brought this lawsuit against the Attorney General in his official capacity as her employer (hereinafter \"the government\" or \"OST\").

Prima Facie Case\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-29\">\n      While Stoe no longer needs to establish a prima facie case to proceed with her suit, the facts underlying that case remain relevant to her discrimination claims. To state a prima facie case of discrimination, a plaintiff must provide evidence that \"(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination.\"\n      <em>\n       Stella v.

Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). Stoe meets all three of these criteria. As a woman over the age of forty, Stoe is a member of a protected class under both Title VII and the ADEA.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a) ; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(a). Stoe lost out on a promotion, and failure to\n     promote constitutes an actionable adverse employment action.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Cones v.

She therefore also has shown that OST's failure to promote her \"is not attributable to 'the two most common legitimate reasons on which an employer might rely to reject a job applicant: an absolute or relative lack of qualifications or the absence of a vacancy in the job sought.' \"\n      <em>\n       George\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972012,3441413\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/405/\">\n       407 F.3d at 412\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (quoting\n      <em>\n       Stella\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872538,9506268\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/135/\">\n       284 F.3d at\n      </extracted-citation>\n      145 ).

Qualifications Evidence\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      Perhaps Stoe's strongest evidence is the comparison of her qualifications with Greene's. Stoe's experience with significant aspects of the position for which she applied is highly relevant. \"If a factfinder can conclude that a reasonable employer would have found the plaintiff to be significantly better qualified for the job, but this employer did not, the factfinder can legitimately infer that the employer consciously selected a less-qualified candidate\"-which in turn allows the factfinder to assume that discrimination has entered the picture.\n      <em>\n       Aka\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338951,1567119\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/1284/\">\n       156 F.3d at 1294\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .

At the time of the interview, they both were serving in GS-14 positions. Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 85. Stoe had been working at the GS-14 level since 2004, and Greene since 2012.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3451816,881091\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/889/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      Stoe was a \"Physical Scientist\" while Greene was a \"General Engineer.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 3, 85. Greene obtained a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering, had worked in the private sector, and had completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 87. At NIJ, Greene had led research into smart gun technologies and worked on,\n      <em>\n       inter alia\n      </em>\n      , technology and equipment performance standards.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 86. Stoe, meanwhile, estimates that she had published at least ten standards and had overseen the development of at least twenty standards and test methods at OST by 2014. Stoe Decl. at 515 \u00b6 10. She had also worked substantially with OST's standards and testing and conformity assessment programs, worked with OST's compliance testing program, and served as DOJ's alternate member on the ICSP, among other things.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Desk Audit Request at 521-24.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      Laying out these qualifications side by side, Stoe appears to have some advantage. She had eight more years' experience at the GS-14 level than Greene when they applied for the Divison Director position. At the time of the hiring decision at issue, Stoe had held a GS-14 position for ten years, while Greene had only been promoted to that level two years previously. She\n     also had published a number of standards herself, and had moved beyond publishing standards to \"supervis[ing]\" a number of program managers as they directed the development of standards. Desk Audit Request at 521. Although Greene had worked on developing standards, there is no indication in the record that he had published any himself or had supervised others in developing them. Stoe also had supervisory experience (though not an official supervisory role),\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 521-24, and had received supervisory training after losing out on the Division Director position in 2010,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Stoe Decl. at 514-15 \u00b6 6. Greene had received diversity training but not supervisory training, and he had not been a supervisor himself.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Ex. 2 (\"Greene Dep.\") at 70:17-71:2, 219:16-221:2. All of these factors point in Stoe's favor.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-35\">\n      However, the difference in qualifications is not so stark as to permit an inference of discrimination. For one thing, Greene had a good deal of experience with grant-making and other business-related aspects of OST's work, which was weighted equally to program management in importance for the position.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Position Description at 631-32. Relatedly, all three panelists gave Greene higher marks than Stoe for his interview response to the question related to \"[a]bility to provide advice and guidance on business and program management issues.\" Def.'s SMF at \u00b6 50 n.4;\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55, 57. Greene also had a Ph.D., while Stoe did not. Tillery wrote contemporaneously to Ridgeway that Greene won out due to \"his detailed understanding of the OJP grants processes and their issues and his ability to provide guidance on technology policy,\" along with \"a solid grasp\" of OST's \"standards strategy sufficient to the task.\" Pl.'s Ex. 38 at 802. The Division Director position simply had a different mix of duties than Stoe's position did. Accordingly, OST reasonably could prefer someone with a balance of experiences other than Stoe's for the job.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-36\">\n      Nor are Stoe's program management qualifications-impressive as they are-so far beyond Greene's as to permit an inference of discrimination under this Circuit's precedents. In Aka, for instance, the court found that a jury reasonably could infer discrimination when the plaintiff-who was denied a pharmacy technician job-\"had nineteen years of experience as a hospital assistant as well as bachelor's and master's degrees,\" while \"the other applicant had no college education, had worked in the hospital laundry for slightly over a year, and had spent only two months as a pharmacy volunteer.\"\n      <em>\n       Holcomb\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3451816,881091\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/889/\">\n       433 F.3d at\n      </extracted-citation>\n      897 (citing\n      <em>\n       Aka\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338951,1567119\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/1284/\">\n       156 F.3d at 1286\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1295-96 ).

Cir. 2011), an inference of discrimination was reasonable when the official who was \"at least formally the selecting official for the position\" contradicted the employer's nondiscriminatory rationale, stating in her deposition that the plaintiff was \"far superior in three of\" four job requirements-and \"far superior overall\"-to the selectee. Here, Stoe had much more experience in standards and conformity assessment than Greene, including at the GS-15 level. But the gap was not nearly as great as in\n      <em>\n       Aka\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Lathram\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Calhoun\n      </em>\n      , or other cases in which courts have found that a jury reasonably could infer discrimination from a comparison of qualifications alone.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-37\">\n      There is, of course, the undeniable fact that Greene did not receive an interview based on the qualifications shown in his written application. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 47. Instead, he only got an interview because Stoe did, since OJP policy required interviews for all certified OJP applicants whenever one employee reached that stage.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088427,5863302\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1259/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      At first glance, this fact is perhaps the most damning piece of evidence Stoe has. Even here, however, the story is more complicated than Stoe claims it is.

Tillery intervened, arguing in a conference call that Stoe's work coordinating standards development and representing OST on standards bodies showed that she had the requisite leadership skills. Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 45-46; Tillery Dep. at 79:12-16. Swineford edited Stoe's scores, and Stoe was then recommended for an interview. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 46. It is therefore due to the actions of Tillery-whom Stoe principally tags as the discriminator-that Stoe was interviewed and thus even in the running for the Division Director job.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-38\">\n      Nor does the fact that Stoe got her interview on the merits suffice to show that the ultimate choice of Greene was based on discrimination. Even after Swineford raised Stoe's initial score, for instance, Stoe remained tied with Greene at 18.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s Ex. 33 [ECF No. 16-37] at 3. Greene was not considered an interview candidate based on one perceived deficiency: his application did not demonstrate \"the requisite skills to serve as one of the two alternate DOJ Standards Executives.\" Mem. for Record at 792-93.

True, she was in some ways more qualified on paper than was Greene to hold the position she was denied. But both were plainly well qualified. \"Short of finding that the employer's stated reason was indeed a pretext, however-and here one must beware of using 20/20 hindsight-the court must respect the employer's unfettered discretion to choose among qualified candidates.\"\n      <em>\n       Fischbach v.

Stoe's evidence does, of course, remain relevant to the Court's ultimate decision.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-43\">\n      Aside from the qualifications evidence, Stoe points to several aspects of the selection process itself that she claims illustrate that OST's proffered rationale is pretextual.

Such evidence is highly relevant, as it would suggest \"the selection process was geared not to finding the best person for the position, but rather to keeping [the plaintiff] from advancing.\"\n      <em>\n       Salazar v. Wash. Metro. Transit Auth.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173836,3440333\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/504/\">\n       401 F.3d 504\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 509 (D.C. Cir. 2005). Yet the Court cannot reasonably infer that the three documents Stoe puts forward to support this claim actually do so. Two of the three are emails-one to HR, the other to Gillerman and Swineford-in which Tillery mentions that the Division Director chosen through the process would \"replace\" Stoe as NIJ's alternate member of the Standards Committee. Def.'s Ex. 21 at 1; Pl.'s Ex. 34 at 782. As Tillery mentioned in his email to HR, however, the Division Director would have to replace Stoe on the committee only because of \"OJP's decision not to increase the grade of ... Stoe's position\"-despite the \"request for a desk audit to increase the grade\"-and instead \"to strip that responsibility from [her].\" Def.'s Ex. 21 at 1.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-47\">\n      The record as a whole makes it irrational to infer from the word \"replace\" alone that Tillery sought to stymie Stoe's chances. Gillerman, for instance, did not read Tillery's email to the panelists this way, saying he \"read this as the role of the alternate standards executive goes with this position.\" Def.'s Ex. 55 [ECF No. 21-5] at 104:1-20. Tillery also clearly articulated to another member of the Standards Committee during the application process that Stoe was up for the position, though he noted that \"there is no guarantee that she will be selected.\" Pl.'s Ex. 38 at 823. And the adverse inference Stoe wishes the Court (and, presumably, a jury) to draw from the emails looks particularly unreasonable in light of Tillery's later intervention with Swineford to ensure that Stoe was fairly scored and thereby offered an interview. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 46; Tillery Dep. at 79:12-16. It would be rather perverse for Tillery to make such an effort if he had meant to signal to the panelists that Stoe was not to be considered.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-48\">\n      The third document Stoe puts forward is an email from Tillery to Ridgeway, sent after the interviews had been conducted but before any decision had been made. In that email, Tillery told Ridgeway: \"We are done except for a final conference call on Monday. It[']s between Mark Greene and Kathy Higgins.\" Pl.'s Ex. 38 at 808. This email was not sent to Gillerman or Swineford,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173836,3440333\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/504/\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173836,3440333\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/504/\">\n       ,\n      </extracted-citation>\n      and was sent two days before Tillery sent around his interview scores and five days before the other panelists sent around theirs,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 803-08. In fact, it was after sending the email to Ridgeway that Tillery suggested averaging the three panelists' scores to come up with a consensus choice-rather than, say, having Tillery unilaterally make the pick.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 805. The context in which it was sent, then, clarifies that Tillery was likely referring to his own scores, which had Greene and Higgins tied, see Def.'s SMF \u00b6 53, perhaps under the assumption that the other panelists felt the same way as he did about the interviews. Most importantly, neither this statement nor the others to which Stoe points can create a reasonable inference of gender or age discrimination; they could suggest at most an intent to bar one individual from consideration. This is particularly so given that Tillery treated Higgins-a woman older than Stoe-as an ideal candidate and rated\n     her as tied with Greene for the job.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Part II.A,\n      <em>\n       infra\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-49\">\n      2.\n      <em>\n       Alleged infirmities with the interview process\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-50\">\n      Next, Stoe attacks on several fronts the interview process itself. She claims, for instance, that the interviews varied in length in a manner that disadvantaged her.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n at 44. But there is no credible evidence of this. Stoe said of her interview: \"I think it was a little short.\" Pl.'s Ex. 3 (\"Stoe Dep.\") at 103:13. There is no evidence that her interview actually lasted less than the allotted thirty minutes. Nor did Greene's statement that his interview had lasted \"[t]o the best of [his] recollection, not longer than an hour,\" indicate that his interview in fact lasted an hour or was appreciably longer than Stoe's. Greene Dep. at 149:15-16. And while Stoe claims that Greene was asked follow-up questions while she was not, Pl.'s Opp'n at 44, Greene could not remember whether he was asked any follow-up questions, Greene Dep. at 152:4-10, while Tillery believed that he had asked follow-up \"questions that ... would have allowed Ms. Stoe to elaborate on specific experience in regard to the interview questions,\" Def.'s Ex. 54 [ECF No. 21-4] at 98:5-8. Even reading this evidence in the light most favorable to Stoe, natural variations in interview length that result from the applicants' answers and the follow-up questions such answers may generate do not support a finding of discrimination. If they did, it would be a rare hiring process that could not be challenged.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-51\">\n      Stoe also finds fault with the fact that the interview questions \"were worded to ask for one single example\" rather than asking \"about overall background and experience.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 43. But employers must have the leeway to structure their interview questions in the way they feel will give them the substantive information needed to make a decision. There is no evidence that the questions as framed favored one candidate over others. \"[T]he key question in this context 'is not the correctness or desirability of the reasons offered but whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers.' \"\n      <em>\n       Hairston v.

Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). There is no evidence here that Tillery did not honestly believe that asking the questions in terms of seeking specific examples-a common interview technique-was the best way to conduct the interview. And the questions were clearly performance-based rather than subjective, as they focused on each of the five KSAs for the Division Director position.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Thompson v.

She claims that this suggests pretext because Greene's superior scores on the grants question helped lead to his selection.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342696\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/170/#p187\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      Yet there is no credible evidence that Tillery planned to remove grants management from the Division Director in 2014. Until late 2015, grants management and standards development both remained within the Policy, Standards, and Grants Management Division. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 7. OST's 2013 reorganization \"consolidated\" grants management in this division. Pl.'s Ex. 21 at 713;\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Ex. 22 at 718. The Division Director was placed in charge of both the division's scientists and its grants management\n     specialists. Pl.'s Ex. 37 at 795. The position description for the vacancy in 2014 therefore stated that the Division Director was in charge of OST's grants management process. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 17. Stoe does not dispute that grants management was removed from the position's purview sometime after the hiring decision at issue took place.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s SMF \u00b6 7. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests that grants management formed a significant portion of the Division Director's duties, until a second reorganization in August 2015 moved those duties to another office.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s Ex. 53 [ECF No. 21-3] at 1, 13 (laying out new organizational chart approved August 3, 2015); Def.'s Ex. 57 [ECF No. 21-7] at 253:16-254:20 (Greene noting that he spent \"at least 50 percent of [his] time if not more\" on grants management in his first year as Division Director); Swineford Dep. at 228:3-229:21. Grants management was therefore an important topic for an interview question. And although the removal of these duties was at least contemplated in 2014, Tillery stated that \"at the time of the hiring action, it wasn't a done deal\" that this reorganization would occur, and he \"couldn't plan for it to be a done deal.\" Def.'s Ex. 54 at 256:1-3. Hence, it was perfectly reasonable to ask about grants management and the existence of that question does not imply pretext.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-53\">\n      The last of Stoe's interview-related concerns is her perception that Tillery shook his head as she was responding to a question, which Stoe says \"could reasonably be interpreted as signaling to the other panelists that he had no intention of selecting\" her. Pl.'s Opp'n at 41. The available evidence is that neither Swineford nor Gillerman noticed this behavior-and, if they did, that it did not influence them.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s Ex. 55 at 268:7-14, 268:21-269:7; Def.'s Ex. 56 [ECF No. 21-6] at 264:3-7. Even assuming that Tillery did shake his head, and that the other panelists saw it, a reasonable jury could not infer discriminatory intent from that action. There is no evidence that any head-shaking was connected to a desire to torpedo older or female applicants, or that he engaged in this activity during the interviews of any of the other such applicants. Other than her concern about the head-shaking, which was not discriminatory, Stoe testified that she \"think[s] the interview was appropriate.\" Stoe Dep. at 103:12. The evidence backs up that assessment.\n      <footnotemark>\n       10\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-54\">\n      3.\n      <em>\n       Interview as basis for selection\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-55\">\n      In addition to the alleged irregularities in the interview process, Stoe challenges as overly subjective-and hence discriminatory-the decision to use the interview as the sole basis for selecting the Division Director.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n at 34-36.\n      <footnotemark>\n       11\n      </footnotemark>\n      It is true that \"[t]he assessment of interview performance is inherently subjective.\"\n      <em>\n       McIntyre v.

This by itself, however, does not create an inference\n     of discrimination. \"Selecting a pool of qualified candidates based upon their written credentials and then making a final selection based upon personal interviews is an obviously reasonable method of hiring a professional employee.\"\n      <em>\n       Fischbach\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n       86 F.3d at 1183-84\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-56\">\n      Stoe nevertheless argues that the use of interview scores to make a final selection was discriminatory in this instance. In particular, she asserts that such heavy reliance on interviews is fishy since \"Greene's written application materials showed he wasn't sufficiently qualified.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 35. However, Greene made the certification list of the \"best qualified\" applicants, Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; Def.'s Ex. 24 [ECF No. 16-28] at 3, which establishes that he was qualified for the position. Although it was an OJP policy rather than his application alone that led Greene to receive an interview, Stoe does not challenge that policy as discriminatory. Nor does the fact that Gillerman did not initially consider Greene worthy of an interview render the use of interview scores suspect. The interviews did not focus on \" 'highly subjective' criteria, such as 'interpersonal skills,' \"\n      <em>\n       Aka\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338951,1567119\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/1284/\">\n       156 F.3d at 1298\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (citation omitted); the interview questions were instead focused on the substantive skills necessary for the job,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Fischbach\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n       86 F.3d at\n      </extracted-citation>\n      1184 ; Pl.'s Ex. 38 at 814-18. The panelists also provided a reasonable, nondiscriminatory rationale for why they revised their opinions of Greene in light of the interview: he proved to have a greater understanding of standards than his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 suggested.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Mem. for Record at 793.\n      <footnotemark>\n       12\n      </footnotemark>\n      The fact that they relied on interview scores to fill the post, then, is not evidence of pretext.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-57\">\n      Stoe also claims that the decision to use only interview scores departed from OST's normal selection procedures, because Tillery appeared to base his selection procedure for Division Director in 2010 solely on qualifications.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n at 35. Generally, \"departure from internal hiring procedures is a factor that the trier of fact may deem probative.\"\n      <em>\n       Johnson v.

Cir. 1982). However, the disparity between 2010 and 2014 is not probative here. Tillery appears not to have interviewed in 2010 at all, perhaps because HR recommended only two potential candidates for the position (Stoe and Hart).\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Ex. 35 at 785-89. It is inaccurate to call this single distinguishable example a \"policy\" from which Tillery later departed. OJP's written merit promotion policy, meanwhile, provides no particular procedure or metric for making a final candidate selection.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s Ex. 49 [ECF No. 16-53] at 351. It presumes that interviews will be conducted; but beyond that, it states only that any selectee chosen from those ranked under the merit selection procedures must be one of the candidates \"who have been identified as best qualified.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"553010,3631354\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/918/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      The interviewees here were selected only from the \"best qualified\" group of applicants.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 38.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-58\">\n      While the panel's use of interview scores to make its final selection is not evidence of pretext, the scoring itself points strongly against a finding of discrimination. Tillery, at whom Stoe primarily directs her\n     discrimination claims, rated an older woman (Higgins) as tied for first with Greene, a result that hardly suggests discriminatory purpose.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s SMF \u00b6 59. Moreover, taking the alleged discriminator out of the picture would not change the result. If the panel had consisted solely of Swineford and Gillerman, Greene would have beaten out Stoe by an average score of 21.5 to 19.5, a 2-point gap barely any smaller than the 2.33-point disparity when all three panelists' scores are included.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"553010,3631354\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/918/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      Indeed, no panelist scored Stoe highest: Gillerman had her tied with Greene, while Swineford scored Greene a full four points higher than Stoe.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"553010,3631354\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/918/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-59\">\n      In conclusory fashion, Stoe disputes the \"legitimacy\" of this scoring.

The sort of soft sexism alleged in these declarations, practiced over a period of years, is no less pernicious than the overt kind. And the Court must assume the allegations to be true at this stage. However, Stoe has not brought a hostile work environment claim; she is complaining about a particular failure to promote her. As discussed above, Tillery was not the sole decision-maker in the 2014 hiring process, and there is no material evidence that gender or age bias infected the other selecting officials or the decision as a whole. In the end, the declarations do not provide the sort of details that would show that the allegations they contain are \"closely related ... to [Stoe's] circumstances and theory of the case.\"\n      <em>\n       Glass\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253437\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/786/189/#p218\">\n       786 F.Supp.2d at 218\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (citation omitted). Their relevance, therefore, is rather limited.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-71\">\n      Second, Stoe asserts that \"Tillery's gender bias was further evident when he declined to appoint [her] as the Acting Division Director\" after Hart left the position in 2014. Pl.'s Opp'n at 40.\n      <footnotemark>\n       13\n      </footnotemark>\n      There is little to this claim. After Hart resigned, Tillery briefly considered appointing one of the four GS-14 scientists in the office in \"a 120-day rotation\" as an acting director. Tillery Dep. at 41:3-8. Under questioning from Stoe's counsel, Tillery admitted that Stoe \"was the most familiar with the division\" of the four GS-14s at the time and was \"probably ... senior in grade.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 45:18-46:3. Indeed, after Stoe first expressed interest, Tillery began the process of determining how to appoint her to the acting position.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Ex. 38 at 825. However, to his surprise, all four GS-14s ended up expressing interest in the acting director position. Tillery Dep. at 45:6-7. Because OST might hire a new permanent Division Director within the first 120-day period-thereby depriving all but one of the interested employees of a chance to serve as acting director-Tillery determined that it was \"fair\" for him to assume the acting director position himself, in addition to his role as head of OST, until a permanent replacement was found.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 41:18-22. There is nothing unreasonable-or\n     discriminatory-about that decision. Contrary to Stoe's implication,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n at 40, then, deciding to keep the peace amongst one's subordinates by not choosing between them for what was, in any event, only a temporary promotion is not evidence of discriminatory bias.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-72\">\n      Third, Crossland and Stoe point out that Stoe has long been \"the only female scientist at OST.\" Stoe Decl. at 514 \u00b6 4; Crossland Decl. at 510 \u00b6 7. Allegations that members of a protected class are underrepresented in an employer's workforce are \"relevant\" to individual disparate treatment, but are \"less significant\" than in pattern or practice cases because general statistics are less probative of intent as to a particular employment decision.\n      <em>\n       Krodel v.

Stoe has not made such a showing here. Allegations of underrepresentation can still be probative of discrimination in \"circumstances that are so straightforward or striking that a reasonable jury could find on its own that any underrepresentation was statistically significant.\"\n      <em>\n       Dyer v.

Being the sole member of a protected class in a workplace may fit that bill.

Even there, however, both the initial screening official and the selection panel rated that similarly situated candidate more highly than the plaintiff,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      -whereas here, Tillery was the only one of the three members of the selection panel who rated Higgins higher than Stoe, Def.'s SMF \u00b6 59. Thus, while Tillery's high score for Higgins does tend to negate Stoe's assertion that Tillery discriminated against her, it does not cut as strongly against Stoe as the government suggests.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-78\">\n      More helpful for the government's case is Tillery's request to expand the pool of candidates for Division Director after the initial certified list proved unsatisfactory. In his email making the request, Tillery noted that a candidate with \"no experience in conformity assessment\" or technology policy, and with \"minimal\" grant management experience, scored highly enough to be certified.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Def.'s Ex. 21 at 1. Tillery lamented that Higgins, by contrast, had not been certified, despite being \"an almost ideal candidate from the perspective of conformity assessment and technology policy,\" whose experience managing a $50\n     million grant program \"suggests a high degree of business acumen.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 1-2. Tillery asked: \"Can I get Ms. Higgins in front of the panel for consideration, without having to go through two rounds of review?\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 2. He further queried whether he could lengthen the list of certifications, or else work with the inactive certification list, so that Higgins could be interviewed-and if he could do so without having to consider all of the many other applicants that the existing system had ranked ahead of her.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      That Tillery went so far out of his way to ensure consideration for Higgins, who is a\n      <em>\n       woman\n      </em>\n      six years\n      <em>\n       older\n      </em>\n      than Stoe,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Def.'s SMF at 8 n.2, suggests that Tillery was solicitous of at least some female, older applicants. Likewise, Tillery only recommended two applicants for interviews among those he screened, both of them female: Higgins and Oksana Pozda. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 42. While not dispositive, this evidence certainly points away from a finding of discrimination.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-79\">\n      <strong>\n       B.

The argument for considering such evidence proceeds from the untested assumption that people only discriminate against those who are (superficially) different from themselves.

This sort of conclusory logic does little to convince the Court of an already shaky proposition.

To the extent that one could infer from Stoe's evidence that Tillery's actions disadvantaged her, it still does not raise an inference that discrimination was the cause of those actions. Indeed, the evidence in the record also establishes that Tillery got Stoe an interview, and that he went out of his way to help another sexagenarian female candidate who he felt was ideal for the job. Moreover, there is no credible evidence that Tillery improperly influenced the other interview panelists, and those panelists also chose Greene for the job based on his interview performance. As no reasonable jury would find on this record that Tillery (or anyone else) was motivated by gender or age discrimination in denying Stoe the Division Director position, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of the government.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Brady\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n       520 F.3d at 494\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-86\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        CONCLUSION\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-87\">\n      By all accounts, Debra Stoe is a credit to OST and to the government.

This is the sort of work that is often rewarded with a raise or promotion. But it is not this Court's job to tell employers how to do theirs. The Court's role is limited to policing discrimination. And here, Stoe's evidence for gender or age discrimination is insufficient to reach a jury. For the foregoing reasons, then, the government's motion for summary judgment will be granted.
