(\"Mason-Dixon\") for alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition. Mason-Dixon counter-claims for alleged trademark infringement, unfair competition, and cyberpiracy. Now pending is Mason-Dixon's motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 12). A hearing was held on August 28, 2018. For the reasons below, Mason-Dixon's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute concerns plaintiff Mayson's and defendant Mason-Dixon's confusingly similar putative service marks. Mayson, a political consulting limited liability company based in Maryland, uses \"Mayson-Dixon Strategic Consulting, LLC\" as its trade name and \"MAYSON-DIXON\" as its putative service mark. ECF No. 5, \u00b6 1. Mayson was founded in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Mason-Dixon, a political polling and consulting company headquartered in Florida, uses \"Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategic Consulting, Inc.\" as its trade name and owns the service mark \"MASON-DIXON.\" ECF No. 12-2, Coker Decl. \u00b6 3. Mason-Dixon was incorporated in 1985 in Maryland, and its most recent registration of the \"MASON-DIXON\" Mark was obtained in 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 31. While the parties agree that their service marks are confusingly similar, they disagree as to which party has superior rights to use the mark. ECF No. 5, \u00b6 52; ECF No. 12-1, p. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. History of Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategic Consulting, Inc. (\"Mason-Dixon\")\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mason-Dixon was incorporated in Maryland in 1985, ECF No. 12-2, Coker Decl. \u00b6 3. The corporation has undergone a number of legal name changes, but has remained in continuous operation and has\n   been owned and controlled by James Bradford Coker III (\"Coker\") since its incorporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mason-Dixon offers public policy and political polling research and consulting services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. The polling services have been offered under the MASON-DIXON Mark since 1983, and the consulting services have been offered under the Mark since 1992.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1992, Mason-Dixon's name changed from \"Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, Inc.\" to \"Political/Media Research, Inc.\" (\"PMR\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. The company's registered trade name was \"Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research,\" and it continued using the MASON-DIXON Mark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1993, Coker formed a spin-off company named \"Mason-Dixon Campaign Polling &amp; Strategy, LLC\" to take over the political polling and consulting aspects of the original company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. During the time period in which the new company operated, PMR focused its operations on media polling. The new company was permitted to use the MASON-DIXON Mark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It operated from 1993 through 1998, providing \"polling, direct mail, television production, advertising buys, grassroots organizing, campaign management, and campaign consulting\" under the MASON-DIXON Mark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. During Mason-Dixon Campaign Polling &amp; Strategy, LLC's entire existence, Coker was its majority shareholder and controlling owner. ECF No. 18-1, Coker Decl. (Reply) \u00b6 2. The company ceased operations in 1998 and formally dissolved in 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Mason-Dixon Campaign Polling &amp; Strategy, LLC ceased operations, PMR continued to provide services to Maryland political campaigns using the MASON-DIXON Mark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Its clients included Martin O'Malley's 1999 Baltimore Mayor campaign, Obie Patterson's 2006 Maryland House of Delegates campaign, and Marc Elrich's 2014 Montgomery County Council campaign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PMR undisputedly used the MASON-DIXON Mark in connection with its polling services. It also used the Mark in connection with its consulting services. ECF No. 12-2, Coker Decl. \u00b6 21. For example, the Mark was used in 2014 in connection with a public policy consulting project for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and in 2017 in connection with developing press releases regarding the Maryland governor's race.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March 2018, PMR changed its name to its current name, \"Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategic Consulting, Inc.\" ECF No. 5, \u00b6 42. Mason-Dixon continues to use the MASON-DIXON Mark in connection with polling and consulting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. History of MASON-DIXON Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The MASON-DIXON Mark has been used continuously by Mason-Dixon since 1983 in connection with its polling and consulting work. Since 1992, the Mark has been publicized nationally in connection with Mason-Dixon's polling and consulting services. ECF No. 12-2, Coker Decl. \u00b6 10. Mason-Dixon first filed to register the Mark on June 20, 2002. ECF No. 12-12. The registration was obtained on August 5, 2005 and remained effective through February 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The registration included Mason-Dixon's statement that the Mark had been used in connection with \"conducting public opinion poll surveys for political purposes\" and \"political consultation services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \"PTO\") cancelled the registration effective February 5, 2016 because Mason-Dixon neglected to file its Application for Renewal and Declaration of Use. Despite the cancellation, Mason-Dixon continued to use the MASON-DIXON Mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 12, 2017, Mason-Dixon again applied to register the MASON-DIXON Mark. ECF No. 12-11. The registration was obtained on February 6, 2018 in connection with the services of \"conducting\n   public opinion polls for political purposes and political consultancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The registration contains Mason-Dixon's statement that the Mark has been used in connection with these services in interstate commerce since at least June 1, 1984.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This registration remains effective through the date of this Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. History of Mayson-Dixon Strategic Consulting, LLC (\"Mayson\")\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mayson was founded by Maryland residents Jayson Williams and Matthew Newcomer in September 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 5, \u00b6 7. It operates in the field of \"strategic political consulting, including advertising and direct mail, business development, nonprofit development, marketing and communications, fundraising, and public affairs,\" and its operations exclusively take place in Maryland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Mayson claims it owns common law rights in the mark \"MAYSON-DIXON\" for political consultancy services, alleging it was the first in time to use this mark in commerce to advertise these services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. According to Mayson, Mason-Dixon has not provided political consultancy services in at least 20 years. Mayson claims that Mason-Dixon \"intentionally positioned itself for the instant conflict\" by changing its corporate name and re-registering the MASON-DIXON Mark. ECF No. 15-1, p. 16. Mayson raises two central arguments to support its claim of superior rights to the mark: (1) Mason-Dixon's registration of the MASON-DIXON Mark is void because Mason-Dixon made fraudulent misstatements on its application, and (2) Mason-Dixon abandoned use of the MASON-DIXON Mark for political consulting. ECF No. 5; ECF No. 15-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mason-Dixon learned of Mayson's operations in June 2017. ECF No. 12-2, Coker Decl. \u00b6 33. At that time, Mason-Dixon took affirmative steps to ensure its rights, including re-registering its MASON-DIXON trademark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After receiving its new registration, counsel for Mason-Dixon sent a cease and desist letter to Mayson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. The letter was followed by an unsuccessful phone conversation between counsel for the parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 26, 2018, Mayson filed suit in this Court. ECF No. 1. The Amended Complaint contains four counts against Mason-Dixon: (I) declaratory judgment of non-infringement of trademark, (II) declaratory judgment of common law trademark infringement, (III) cancellation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%205%2C395%2C587%2C\">\n    Registration No. 5,395,587,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and (IV) federal trademark infringement and unfair competition. ECF No. 5. On May 8, 2018, Mason-Dixon responded with its answer (ECF No. 8), a counter-claim against Mayson (ECF No. 10), a third-party complaint against Jayson Williams (ECF No. 11),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the pending motion for preliminary injunction (ECF No. 12). The counter-claim alleges four counts against Mayson: (I) service mark infringement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a), (II) unfair competition in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (III) service mark infringement &amp; unfair competition under Maryland common law, and (IV) cyberpiracy in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

Even without the registration, Mason-Dixon has common law ownership rights over the Mark because it has used the Mark continuously throughout the United States in connection with its polling and consulting services since 1983, decades before Mayson was formed. Mason-Dixon's status as the senior user of the MASON-DIXON Mark gives Mason-Dixon the common law ownership right of exclusive use of the Mark, even though registration of the Mark was not obtained until after Mayson began its operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emergency One, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113528\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/264/#p267\">\n    332 F.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mayson fails to put forth a successful defense to Mason-Dixon's ownership of the Mark. First, Mayson claims the registration was obtained fraudulently because (1) Mason-Dixon misrepresented on its application the date of first use of the Mark in connection with its political consultancy services, and (2) Mason-Dixon falsely stated to the PTO that no one else had the right to use the Mark. Neither allegation is true. On its registration application, Mason-Dixon listed the date of first use of the Mark in connection with the services of \"conducting public opinion polls...and political consultancy\" as June 1, 1984. ECF No. 12-11. Mayson does not dispute that the Mark was used as early as this date in connection with polling, but contends the date of first use of the Mark in connection with consulting occurred after 1984. Even if Mayson is correct, there is still no fraud. Mason-Dixon was only required to provide the date of first use for one of the services specified in the class of services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.34\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(v) (\"If the application specifies more than one item of goods or services in a class, the dates of use...are required for only one item of goods or services specified in that class.\"). Accordingly, Mason-Dixon accurately stated the date of first use as required by federal regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mason-Dixon also declared on its registration application that \"no other persons...have the right to use the mark in commerce, either in the identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods/services of such other persons, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive.\" ECF No. 5-1, p. 6. At the time it made this declaration, Mason-Dixon knew that Mayson was using a very similar mark in connection with political consulting services. Signing this declaration, however, did not constitute fraud. \"Regardless of any knowledge an applicant may have had of another's use, if an applicant believes that it was the owner of the mark sought to be registered at the time it made application for registration, no fraudulent intent can be inferred from statements made in the\n   application declaration.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel J.

Thus, no fraud was used to obtain the registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Mayson contends Mason-Dixon abandoned the Mark when Mason-Dixon allowed the Mark to be used by \"Mason-Dixon Campaign Polling &amp; Strategy, LLC,\" the spin-off company founded by Coker that operated from 1993 to 1998. Mason-Dixon and Mason-Dixon Campaign Polling &amp; Strategy, LLC, however, were related companies under trademark law because both companies were owned and controlled by Coker.

Because there are no goods involved here, this factor is not directly relevant.

These clients are less likely to be confused by the similarities between the service marks at issue.

Most striking to this Court are that the service marks and trade names at issue are virtually identical, set apart by only one silent consonant, and that the companies operate in almost the same sphere. In this specific factual scenario, the analysis of these two factors overshadows the analysis of the other factors, strongly outweighing the lack of evidence\n   of actual confusion. Many of the other factors also support the conclusion that there is a likelihood of confusion: the MASON-DIXON Mark is strong and distinctive, the parties use the same media, and there is evidence that Mayson intended to confuse the public by adopting the MAYSON-DIXON Mark. Under these facts and solely for the purpose of this preliminary injunction, this Court concludes that Mayson's use of the MAYSON-DIXON Mark is a classic example of blatant trademark infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Mayson cites one case from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to support this proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Century Time Ltd. v. Interchron Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029949\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/366/\">\n    729 F.Supp. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 1990). In that case, the\n   court, without deciding the issue, commented that plaintiffs who had delayed more than two months in seeking an injunction would be unlikely to demonstrate irreparable harm where there was evidence the plaintiffs had engaged in tactical maneuvering by timing their motion to be most injurious to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029949\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029949\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/366/\">\n    at 368-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is no such evidence of tactical maneuvering. Although Mason-Dixon moved for injunctive relief close to the time of the Maryland primary election, Mason-Dixon recognized in its moving papers that receiving an injunction before the election would increase the harm to Mayson because many of Mayson's clients were candidates in the election. Mason-Dixon therefore requested that this Court issue an injunction effective one day after the election so as not to impose additional harm to Mayson. ECF No. 18, p. 23. This request negates any allegation of tactical maneuvering by Mason-Dixon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Additionally, Mason-Dixon was actively attempting to resolve the dispute during the ten months between learning of Mayson's infringement and moving for a preliminary injunction. Upon learning of the infringement, Mason-Dixon immediately filed its application to re-register the MASON-DIXON Mark. ECF No. 12-2, Coker Decl. \u00b6 33. As soon as Mason-Dixon received its registration, its counsel sent a cease and desist letter to Mayson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. After sending the letter, counsel for Mayson and Mason-Dixon had an unsuccessful phone conversation, which was followed by Mayson filing suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37; ECF No 1. Mason-Dixon then filed its motion on the same day it filed its answer and counter-claim. ECF Nos. 8, 10, 12. In light of these facts, Mayson fails to show that Mason-Dixon's \"delay\" forecloses a finding of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Balance of Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The balance of equities tips in favor of Mason-Dixon. As discussed above, Mason-Dixon will suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction. Although Mayson will also suffer harm if the injunction is granted, Mayson's harm will be less severe and can be mitigated. Mayson can continue to operate its consulting services as long as it uses a different name and mark. In light of Mayson's relatively short history of operations compared to Mason-Dixon's decades of operations, the harm to Mayson's business does not outweigh the harm to Mason-Dixon's business. Additionally, one of Mayson's central arguments for denial of the injunction was the proximity of the primary election, but that election has now passed, neutralizing this argument. Finally, Mayson's disregard for Mason-Dixon's existing trademark registration when Mayson began its operations further tips the equities scale in Mason-Dixon's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Injunctions protecting trademarks are in the public interest \"because trademarks foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S. Olympic Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28217\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/522/#p531\">\n    483 U.S. 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 531,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28217\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/522/#p531\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28217\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/522/#p531\">\n    97 L.Ed.2d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A preliminary injunction protecting the MASON-DIXON Mark is therefore in the public interest. Accordingly, Mason-Dixon's motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 12) is granted. Mayson is enjoined from \"continued use of 'Mayson-Dixon Strategic Consulting, LLC,' MAYSON-DIXON, or any words, marks, trade names, corporate names, or domain names\n   that are confusingly similar to MASON-DIXON, or from otherwise engaging in unfair competition against Mason-Dixon, pending the final outcome of this action.\" As required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), Mason-Dixon must post a bond in the amount of $10,000.00. A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Mayson offers a curious explanation for the creation of its name, claiming it is a blend of the names of Mayson's two founders and references that both founders grew up near the Mason-Dixon line,\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The third-party complaint against Jayson Williams alleges cyberpiracy, but that claim is not relevant to the motion for preliminary injunction. ECF No. 11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Mason-Dixon's Counterclaim also included a cyperpiracy claim (Count IV), but Mason-Dixon has not requested a preliminary injunction in connection with Count IV.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
