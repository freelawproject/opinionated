COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This ruling marks the finish line of a lawsuit brought by Floyd Landis and the federal government to recover money paid by the U.S. Postal Service to sponsor a professional cycling team featuring Lance Armstrong. In 2010, Landis filed suit under the False Claims Act alleging that Armstrong and a host of associates had defrauded the Postal Service by misrepresenting and concealing the team's use of performance enhancing drugs. The United States intervened in the case in early 2013. After more than five years of active litigation, the original peloton of defendants has dwindled to two: the team's owner, Tailwind Sports Corporation, and its erstwhile manager, Johann Bruyneel. Neither has participated in the case since 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The government has moved for a default judgment on its False Claims Act claims against both defendants, which Landis joins, and on a separate common-law claim of unjust enrichment against Bruyneel. Landis has independently moved for an award of False Claims Act damages against both defendants. As explained below, the Court will grant both of the government's motions, impose $369,000 in civil penalties against Tailwind and Bruyneel, and award $1,228,700 in restitution against Mr. Bruyneel on the government's unjust enrichment claim. The Court will deny Landis' motion for an award of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Johan Bruyneel was the manager (or \"directeur sportif\") of the team; Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis were two of the team's riders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7, 10. Under agreements entered into in 1995 and 2000 for the USPS sponsorship, Tailwind (or its predecessors) represented that the riders on the team would adhere to all relevant rules governing professional cycling, including prohibitions on the use of performance enhancing drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18. In addition, the 2000 agreement specifically included the use of performance enhancing drugs, or any negative publicity associated with such use, as events of default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Over the period of the sponsorship, USPS paid approximately $32 million to Tailwind.\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As is now well known, the riders on the USPS-sponsored team did not in fact adhere to the international rules prohibiting the use of performance enhancing drugs in cycling. In a 2013 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong admitted that he had used banned substances, including during the time period that USPS sponsored the team. U.S. Compl. \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2010, Landis filed suit against multiple defendants, including Armstrong, Bruyneel, and Tailwind, on behalf of the United States under the False Claims Act.\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court will first address the Clerk's entry of default against Bruyneel and Tailwind, before moving to whether the government and Landis have established liability and damages on the three claims raised against these defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Entry of default\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Bruyneel received a copy of the complaints and waived formal service of process by the government and Landis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45, 62. Defendant Tailwind was properly served with process in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Landis v.

Moreover, both defendants were clearly aware of the suit against them: they filed motions to dismiss in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755479\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/9/#p34\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755479\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/9/#p34\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the Court denied those motions in June 2014, it directed both defendants to file an answer by late July 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (July 2, 2014) (directing Bruyneel to file an answer by July 18, 2014); Minute Order (July 2, 2014) (directing Tailwind to file an answer by July 27, 2014). Neither did so, and the Clerk of the Court entered default against both defendants in April 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 503. The defendants have not otherwise appeared in this suit since their motions to dismiss were denied in June 2014. Given the defendants' failure to respond or otherwise litigate this suit for over four years, default was appropriately entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    False Claims Act claims against Bruyneel and Tailwind Sports Corp.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    1. Liability: Presentment Claim (Count I)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The government and Landis first seek judgment on Count I of their complaints against both defendants, which assert a false presentment claim. The False Claims Act establishes liability for anyone who \"knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government ... a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (1986). The elements of a false presentment claim are thus that (1) the defendant submitted or caused to be submitted a claim to the government, (2) the claim was false or fraudulent, and (3) the defendant acted knowingly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Landis I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755479\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/9/#p34\">\n    51 F.Supp.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). The well-pled factual allegations here establish these three requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to the presentment of claims, the Court held at summary judgment that Tailwind submitted 41 claims for payment to the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 193. With respect to Bruyneel, the government contends that he caused false claims to be presented. This requires that Bruyneel's conduct \"was at least a substantial factor in causing, if not the but-for cause of, submission of false claims.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Toyobo Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181202\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/811/37/#p48\">\n    811 F.Supp.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (D.D.C. 2011) (internal quotation omitted). The factual allegations demonstrate that Bruyneel knew doping was prohibited under the sponsorship agreement, was nonetheless aware of and encouraged doping, and made public statements to conceal the doping.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 45, 49, 63B, 67B. His alleged conduct thus contributed substantially to the presentment of false claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the well-pled allegations establish that the claims Tailwind submitted (and Bruyneel caused to be submitted) were false or fraudulent. The government here relies on the \"implied certification\" theory of liability, which provides that a claim can be false or fraudulent if the defendant \"withheld information about its noncompliance with material contractual requirements\" when submitting the claim.\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted). As the Court explained in its dismissal ruling, the complaint \"allege[s] that the cycling team engaged in repeated and rampant doping activity that was prohibited by [cycling's] governing bodies while submitting claims to the Postal Service under [the sponsorship]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   agreements.\"\n   <em>\n    Landis I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755479\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/9/#p34\">\n    51 F.Supp.3d at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These allegations, the Court held, were \"sufficient to allege there was a false certification of compliance with a material contract term.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755479\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/9/#p34\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755479\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/9/#p34\">\n    at 57-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that compliance with the anti-doping regulations \"was a core term\" of the agreements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, the well-pled factual allegations establish that the defendants acted knowingly, which the statute defines as meaning either with actual knowledge, deliberate indifference, or reckless disregard.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

To determine an appropriate award of civil penalties, the Court considers the totality of the circumstances, focusing on factors such as \"the seriousness of the misconduct, the scienter of the defendants, and the amount of damages suffered by the United States as a result of the misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Speqtrum, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205349196\">\n    2016 WL 5349196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 23, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While the government and Landis urge the Court to impose the maximum amount of civil penalties-$11,000 for each of the 41 claims submitted-the Court will instead impose an amount closer to the middle of the range. Admittedly, Bruyneel and Tailwind are alleged to have engaged in egregious conduct: the complaints lay out a sophisticated scheme to use performance enhancing drugs while taking intentional steps-including making false statements-to conceal this behavior from the public, USPS, and international cycling governing bodies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But the severity of the alleged conduct does not rise to the level found in the cases the government cites where maximum penalties were imposed. For instance, it does not involve particularly vulnerable victims.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. FastTrain II Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20606346\">\n    2017 WL 606346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 15, 2017) (awarding maximum amount of civil penalties in case where the defendants intentionally targeted vulnerable young adults who lacked high school diplomas in fraudulent scheme). And while the government certainly paid Tailwind a lot of money ($32 million), the amount of damages the government suffered, if any, has been hotly disputed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Armstrong indeed makes a persuasive case that USPS received substantial value from the positive media coverage of the team[.]\"). Finally, while the defaulting defendants took steps to conceal their conduct, they did not engage in the sort of intricate, complex cover-up present in other cases.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

But the\n   circumstances here do not rise to the degree warranting the maximum level of civil penalties. The Court will instead award an amount closer to the middle of the range. It will impose a civil penalty of $9,000 per false claim submitted, for a total penalty of $369,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    4. Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, Mr. Landis independently moves for an award of damages under the False Claims Act against Bruyneel and Tailwind. He advances two arguments to substantiate damages. Neither is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, Landis contends that because Tailwind and Bruyneel have presented no evidence of benefits received by USPS under the sponsorship agreement, he is entitled to damages equal to the amount paid under the agreements. But as plaintiff, Landis bears the burden of establishing damages with reasonable certainty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Landis v. Tailwind Sports Corp.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Landis III\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205905509\">\n    2017 WL 5905509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (D.D.C. Nov. 28, 2017). This remains the case even on a motion for default judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186161\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/763/64/#p67\">\n    763 F.Supp.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When moving for default judgment, the plaintiffs must prove that they are entitled to the requested damages.\"). Landis seeks to effectively shift his burden to prove damages onto Tailwind and Bruyneel, which the Court will not permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In any event, as the Court has already detailed, there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   evidence in the record indicating that USPS received substantial benefits under the sponsorship agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Landis III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205905509\">\n    2017 WL 5905509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-12 (discussing expert witness who planned to testify at trial as to the benefits USPS received under the sponsorship agreement). Indeed, there was sufficient evidence to preclude summary judgment on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 201-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing evidence presented at summary judgment of benefits to USPS under the agreement). Without providing sufficient evidence to substantiate the amount of benefits incurred as compared to the amount of loss, Landis has failed to carry his burden of establishing his entitlement to damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, Landis argues that, as a matter of law, the amount of damages here is equal to the amount paid under the agreement because the value of the services rendered was zero. The Court has twice confronted this argument and twice rejected it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 199-201 ;\n   <em>\n    Landis III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205905509\">\n    2017 WL 5905509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. As it has explained, the actual value of the services rendered by an undisclosed tainted cycling team is not reasonably ascertainable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   200 ;\n   <em>\n    Landis III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205905509\">\n    2017 WL 5905509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The Court held that plaintiffs could substantiate damages instead by showing the negative consequences of the agreement outweighed any benefits received by USPS.\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The question is whether the promotional benefits derived from the four payments outweighed the costs.\");\n   <em>\n    Landis III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205905509\">\n    2017 WL 5905509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Landis has not provided evidence to substantiate damages under that framework. The Court will thus deny his motion seeking an award of damages under the False Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Unjust enrichment claim against Bruyneel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The government independently moves for a default judgment against Bruyneel on its unjust enrichment claim. To make out liability for unjust enrichment, the government must show that it (1) conferred a benefit on Bruyneel that (2) Bruyneel retained and (3) under the circumstances his retention of the benefit is unjust.\n   <em>\n    Landis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No contractual relationship between the parties is necessary to prevail on such a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p186\">\n    at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The government has shown that it conferred a benefit on Bruyneel that he retained. Bruyneel's bank records indicate that he was paid $2,047,833 in salary and bonuses during the period of time USPS sponsored the cycling team. Decl. of Michael J. Pugliese \u00b6\u00b6 11-13 [ECF No. 596-3]. USPS financed 60% of Tailwind's expenses, which would include 60% of the salary and bonuses paid to Bruyneel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Thus, USPS conferred a benefit on Bruyneel, specifically $1,228,700 of salary and bonuses, that Bruyneel has retained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition, the well-pled allegations in the complaint establish that under the circumstances, allowing Bruyneel to retain this benefit would be unjust. As discussed, Bruyneel is alleged to have been aware that USPS prohibited doping as a condition of its sponsorship and, under the agreement reached in 2000, could terminate the agreement if the team doped. U.S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 30. Bruyneel nevertheless encouraged and organized doping activities by the team's riders and made false statements to conceal the team's use of performance enhancing drugs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 43, 50, 63B. USPS allegedly relied on Bruyneel's deception and false statements when it continued to make payments to Tailwind-payments that covered Bruyneel's salary and bonuses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Bruyneel's fraudulent activities leading to USPS's payments make his retention of those payments unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   When there has been an unjust enrichment, the appropriate remedy is restitution in the amount of the unjust benefit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Griffith v. Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4023833\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/560/29/#p35\">\n    560 F.Supp.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35 (D.D.C. 2008). Here, the government has substantiated that Bruyneel unjustly received $1,228,700 in benefits. Decl. of Michael J. Pugliese \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11-14 [ECF No. 596-3]. The Court will thus enter judgment for the government against Bruyneel on its unjust enrichment claim and award it $1,228,700 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the United States' motion for a default judgment against Bruyneel on the unjust enrichment claim and the United States' and Landis' joint motion for a default judgment against Bruyneel and Tailwind on the False Claims Act claims seeking monetary penalties. However, it will deny Landis' motion for an award of damages under the False Claims Act. Separate orders will accompany this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
