This Court referred the case, pursuant to Local Civil Rules 72.2 and 72.3, to Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey. Minute Order (Mar. 6, 2017). Plaintiff then filed an amended complaint in April 2017, adding a cause of action under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Dkt. 13 at 12-14 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-51). Both Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint. Dkt. 14; Dkt. 16. Magistrate Judge Harvey issued a R &amp; R granting the BOP's motion to dismiss in its entirety and denying the District's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's IDEA claim. Dkt. 25 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically, the R &amp; R concluded that Plaintiff failed to state a claim under the Rehabilitation Act because he could not show that either the BOP or the District's refusal to provide him with a FAPE was in bad faith. Dkt. 25 at 29. With respect to Plaintiff's IDEA claim against the BOP, the R &amp; R concluded that the BOP was not subject to the IDEA, notwithstanding the Revitalization Act's broad language charging the BOP with the \"custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment[,] and training\" of individuals like Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 105-33, \u00a7 11201(b). Dkt. 25 at 14-20. The R &amp; R, in contrast, did not dismiss Plaintiff's IDEA claim against the District. Instead, it found that the District's obligation to provide a FAPE is triggered by a child's residency, Dkt. 25 at 21, and that this obligation is not terminated when the child is in federal custody, Dkt. 25 at 22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the R &amp; R's dismissal of his IDEA claim against the BOP and the dismissal of his Rehabilitation Act\n   claims against both Defendants. Dkt. 26. As to the IDEA claim, Plaintiff argues that the BOP is subject to the IDEA because it \"assumed responsibility for the 'education' of ... individuals [like Plaintiff]\" through the Revitalization Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Pub. L. No. 105-33, \u00a7 11201(b) ). Plaintiff also contends that holding the District-but not the BOP-responsible for providing individuals, like Plaintiff, a FAPE replaces their \"absolute right\" to a FAPE under the IDEA with one \"contingent\" on the cooperation of the BOP, resulting in their disparate treatment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the District asserts that the Revitalization Act \"carve[s] out\" an exception to the text of the IDEA because it provides that the \"BOP-rather than the District-is responsible for the education of felony offenders of the D.C. Code sentenced as adults.\" Dkt. 27 at 10. Second, the District argues that under the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(11)(C), it is only \"required to ensure that its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   facilities comply with the IDEA;\" here, it has no authority over the BOP.

Because the meaning of \"state\" in the IDEA is \"plain and unambiguous,\" and the BOP is a federal agency receiving no funds under the IDEA, that \"ends\" the Court's inquiry.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the R &amp; R,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25 at 10-20, the Court will dismiss Plaintiff's IDEA claim against the BOP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court also agrees with the R &amp; R's denial of the District's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's IDEA claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25 at 21-27, but on different grounds. Magistrate Judge Harvey reasoned that the IDEA requires states to ensure that a FAPE is \"available to all children with disabilities residing in the State,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), even if the child \"attends a school subject to a different sovereign,\" Dkt. 25 at 23. The R &amp; R's reasoning has considerable force.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v. Abramson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3437188\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/493/80/#p86\">\n    493 F.Supp.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86 (D.D.C. 2007) (holding that the District was required to fulfill its IDEA obligations to a D.C. resident who attended school in Connecticut);\n   <em>\n    Hester v.

Cir. 2007). But, in the Court's view, it is unnecessary to resolve the broader question whether states are, under all circumstances, obligated to provide a FAPE to resident children, even when they are held in federal custody for committing a violation of federal law. The Court, instead, limits its analysis to the narrower-and ultimately dispositive-question whether the District is obligated to provide a FAPE to children who are convicted as adults under the D.C. Code and held, pursuant to the Revitalization Act, in the BOP's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District does not dispute that the plain text of the IDEA generally requires states to provide a FAPE to \"children who are convicted as adults under state law and incarcerated in an adult prison.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201414\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7) (delineating IDEA protections for such children);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201414\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1412(a)(11)(C) (permitting delegation of \"responsibility of ensuring that the requirements of this subchapter are met\" to \"any public agency in the State\"). This means that, ordinarily, a state is required to provide a FAPE to all qualifying residents who are convicted under that state's laws and incarcerated in that state's correctional facilities. In this case, however, there is a wrinkle: Although Plaintiff was convicted under the D.C. Code, the Revitalization Act shuttered the District's prison system and transferred all offenders to the custody of the BOP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 105-33, \u00a7 11201. Accordingly, although Plaintiff was held in the custody of the BOP, the BOP was acting-pursuant to the Revitalization Act-in the District's stead. The District argues that this extinguished its IDEA obligations to Plaintiff for three reasons: (1) the Revitalization Act transferred the District's obligations under the IDEA to the BOP; (2) the DOE's opinion letters and Fourth Circuit precedent hold that the IDEA does not extend to children in federal custody; and (3) the District has no access to children held by the BOP.

They failed to do so. The District never raised the issue in its motion to dismiss, and the BOP dedicated only one sentence to that effect in its motion: \"Although Plaintiff did not plead a violation of the Rehabilitation Act in his Administrative Complaint, Plaintiff now claims that Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act entitles him to a FAPE,\" Dkt. 16 at 20.

The R &amp; R, however, declined to analyze Plaintiff's claims under the summary judgment standard because \"the body of [BOP's] memorandum\" only set forth \"the legal standards [for a motion to dismiss],\" and, in any case, \"[w]hen no additional evidence is introduced ..., a motion for summary judgment operates as a motion for judgment based on the evidence comprising the record.\" Dkt. 25 at 9 n.2 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Roark ex rel.
