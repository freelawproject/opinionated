The Act,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , mandates that the Pennsylvania Professional Liability Joint Underwriting Association (\"Joint Underwriting Association\" or \"Association\") transfer $200,000,000 of its \"surplus\" funds for deposit into the Commonwealth's General Fund by Friday, December 1, 2017. Act 44 includes a \"sunset\" provision purporting to abolish the Association should it fail to comply with its deadline. The Association seeks a declaration that Act 44 violates the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Joint Underwriting Association is a nonprofit association organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 60 \u00b6 1; Doc. 72 \u00b6 1; Doc. 74 \u00b6 1). The General Assembly created the Association in 1975 in response to a \"hard market\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for medical malpractice insurance in the Commonwealth. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63 \u00b6 1; Doc. 65 \u00b6 2). The Association was initially established and organized by the Pennsylvania Health Care Services Malpractice Act of 1975, P.L. 390, No. 111 (\"Act 111\"). The General Assembly repealed Act 111 on March 20, 2002, enacting in its place the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act (\"MCARE Act\"), 40 PA. STAT. &amp; CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1303.101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The MCARE Act and the Joint Underwriting Association\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The MCARE Act is a sweeping piece of legislation. The Act's overarching goal is to ensure a \"comprehensive and high-quality health care system\" for the citizens of the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.102(1). In pursuit of this objective, the Act seeks to guarantee that medical professional liability insurance is \"obtainable at an affordable and reasonable cost,\" to ensure prompt and fair resolution of medical negligence cases, and to reduce and eliminate medical errors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.102(3)-(5). The Act includes\n   patient safety rules and reporting obligations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1303.301-.315, establishes requirements relating to reduction and prevention of health care associated infections,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1303.401-.411, and develops standards for medical professional liability litigation and compensation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1303.501-.516.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The MCARE Act also establishes a Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Fund (\"the MCARE Fund\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1303.711-.716. The General Assembly designed the MCARE Fund as a \"special fund\" within the state treasury to be administered by the Insurance Department of Pennsylvania (\"the Department\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1303.712(a), -.713(a). The Fund provides a secondary layer of medical professional liability coverage for physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers in the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.711(g). It is funded primarily by annual assessments (\"MCARE assessments\") on health care providers as a condition of practicing in the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.712(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally, the MCARE Act continues operation of the Joint Underwriting Association.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(a). Unlike the MCARE Fund, the General Assembly did not establish the Association as a \"special fund\" or a traditional agency within the Commonwealth's governmental structures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1303.712(a), -.713(a). Instead, the General Assembly \"established\" the Association as \"a nonprofit joint underwriting association to be known as the Pennsylvania Professional Liability Joint Underwriting Association.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(a). Like its predecessor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Act 111, \u00a7 802, the MCARE Act mandates membership in the Association for insurers authorized to write medical professional liability insurance in the Commonwealth, 40 PA. STAT. &amp; CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1303.731(a). Currently, the Association has 621 member insurance companies. (Doc. 60 \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Association is charged by statute with offering medical professional liability insurance to health care providers and entities who \"cannot conveniently obtain medical professional liability insurance through ordinary methods at rates not in excess of those applicable to [those] similarly situated.\" 40 PA. STAT. &amp; CONS. STAT. ANN \u00a7 1303.732(a). The MCARE Act sets forth broad parameters for achieving this objective, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The [Joint Underwriting Association] shall ensure that the medical professional liability insurance it offers does all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) Is conveniently and expeditiously available to all health care providers required to be insured under section 711.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) Is subject only to the payment or provisions for payment of the premium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) Provides reasonable means for the health care providers it insures to transfer to the ordinary insurance market.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   (4) Provides sufficient coverage for a health care provider to satisfy its insurance requirements under section 711 on reasonable and not unfairly discriminatory terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (5) Permits a health care provider to finance its premium or allows installment payment of premiums subject to customary terms and conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.732(b)(1)-(5). The Association insures \"all comers\" who certify that they cannot obtain coverage at competitive rates. (P.I. Hr'g Tr. 11:3-13:8; Doc. 60 \u00b6 42). According to the Association, its insureds generally fall into four categories: (1) providers with a history of malpractice\n   occurrences, (2) providers practicing high-risk specialties, (3) providers who have gaps in coverage, or (4) providers reentering the medical profession after loss or suspension of license or voluntary withdrawal from practice. (Doc. 60 \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Association, like other insurers in the Commonwealth, is \"supervised\" by the Department through the Insurance Commissioner (\"Commissioner\"). 40 PA. STAT. &amp; CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1303.731(a);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 221.1-a to -.15-a, 1181-99. The MCARE Act prescribes four \"duties\" to the Association.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(b). It requires the Association to submit a plan of operations to the Commissioner for approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(b)(1). It tasks the Association to submit rates and any rate modifications for Department approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(b)(2) (incorporating 40 PA. STAT. &amp; CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 1181-99). It requires the Association to \"[o]ffer medical professional liability insurance to health care providers\" as described above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(b)(3). And it directs the Association to file its schedule of occurrence rates with the Commissioner, which she uses to set a \"prevailing primary premium\" for calculating the annual MCARE assessments for all health care providers in the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(b)(4) (incorporating 40 PA. STAT. &amp; CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1303.712(f) ). The Act insulates the Commonwealth from the Association's debts and liabilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The MCARE Act provides that all \"powers and duties\" of the Association \"shall be vested in and exercised by a board of directors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(a). The board's composition, and all of the Association's operative principles, are set forth in a plan of operations developed by the Association with Department assistance and approval. (Doc. 60 \u00b6 44; Doc. 63 \u00b6\u00b6 13-16);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   40 PA. STAT. &amp; CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1303.731(b)(1). The plan establishes a 14-member board of directors, which consists of the current Association president; eight representatives of member companies chosen by member voting; one agent or broker elected by members; and four health care provider or general public representatives who may be nominated by anyone and are appointed by the Commissioner. (Doc. 60 \u00b6 45). Under the plan, the Association may be dissolved (1) \"by operation of law,\" or (2) at the request of its members, subject to Commissioner approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46). The plan provides that, \"[u]pon dissolution, all assets of the Association, from whatever source, shall be distributed in such manner as the Board may determine subject to the approval of the Commissioner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Joint Underwriting Association writes insurance policies directly to its insured health care providers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63 \u00b6 27; Doc. 65 \u00b6 19). Policyholders pay premiums directly to the Association. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 60 \u00b6 65). The Association is funded exclusively by policyholder premiums and investment income. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). It is not and has never been funded by the Commonwealth, and it holds all premiums and investment funds in private accounts in its own name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 54, 65-69). The Association currently insures approximately 250 policyholders. (Doc. 63 \u00b6 26; Doc. 65 \u00b6 20). The typical medical professional liability policy issued by the Association covers a one-year period, with a limit of $500,000 per claim and aggregate limits of $1,500,000 for individuals and $2,500,000 for hospitals. (Doc. 63 \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Association maintains contingency funds-its \"reserves\" and its \"surplus\"-which allow the Association to fulfill its insurance obligations in the event of greater-than-anticipated claims or losses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 60 \u00b6\u00b6 108-12). An insurer's \"reserves\" are the \"best estimate of funds ... need[ed] to pay for claims that have been incurred but not yet paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109). Its \"surplus\" represents \"capital after all liabilities\n   have been deducted from assets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111). The surplus operates as a \"backstop\" to ensure that unforeseen events do not impede an insurer's ability to meet obligations to its insureds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112). As of December 31, 2016, the Joint Underwriting Association maintained a surplus of approximately $268,124,500. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115; Doc. 63 \u00b6 32; Doc. 65 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Act 85 of 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 13, 2016, Governor Wolf signed into law Act 85 of 2016, P.L. 664, No. 85 (\"Act 85\"). Act 85 is wide-ranging in scope, but its principal effect was to amend the General Appropriation Act of 2016 and balance the Commonwealth's budget. Act 85, \u00a7 1. Among other things, Act 85 provides for certain transfers to the Commonwealth's General Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(7). Pertinent\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , Section 18 of Act 85 amends the Commonwealth's Fiscal Code to require a $200,000,000 transfer to the General Fund from the Joint Underwriting Association. The relevant language states:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Local Rule 56.1 requires that a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 be supported \"by a separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts, in numbered paragraphs, as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried.\" Local Rule of Court 56.1.

Preliminarily, it is not the MCARE Act but the Association's own plan of operations, developed by the board with the Commissioner's approval, which sets procedures for dissolution. The Act's silence on this point hardly indicates legislative intent to retain control over the Association. Moreover, neither defendant identifies support for the claim that the state's ability to dissolve a nonprofit confers total control thereof to the state.

Surely, these provisions do not divest all such entities of their constitutional rights anent the Commonwealth.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The MCARE Act meaningfully circumscribes the Association's authority in only two ways: by requiring it to file any deficit with the Commissioner for approval thereby to borrow funds,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1303.733, and by subjecting its plan of operations to Commissioner approval,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1303.731(b)(1).

Specifically, the General Assembly avers that it could dissolve the Association by statute and order the Commissioner to refuse any proposed distribution of assets offered by the Association's board. (Doc. 62 at 17-18;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 73 at 19, 22 n.8). It submits that, in this scenario, the Association's assets would sit \"unclaimed\" until the funds escheat to the state by operation of law. (Doc. 62 at 17-18). This argument rests on several assumptions:\n    <em>\n     first\n    </em>\n    , that the General Assembly succeeds in passing a law to dissolve the Association, and,\n    <em>\n     second\n    </em>\n    , that the Commissioner rejects every proposed asset distribution submitted by the board. The General Assembly further assumes, without explanation, that the hierarchical statutory windup framework governing nonprofit dissolution \"does not otherwise apply\" to justify its invocation of the last-resort escheat alternative. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 17). We find no merit in this argument. Moreover, even if the legislature's hypothetical actualized in the future, it would not deprive the Association of its\n    <em>\n     present\n    </em>\n    possessory right in the surplus.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The Joint Underwriting Association is created by statute. But in the same legislation that created the Association, the General Assembly relinquished control thereof, for all material intents and purposes, to the Association's board of directors.

That the General Assembly chose to achieve a public health objective through a private association has a perceptible benefit: it assures availability of medical professional liability coverage throughout the Commonwealth at no public cost. By the same token, it also has a consequence: the General Assembly cannot claim\n    <em>\n     carte blanch\n    </em>\n    access to the Association's assets.

Competing expert reports debate this question at length. This dispute, genuine though it may be, is ultimately immaterial. Even if the surplus funds are \"excess\" and unnecessary to maintain the Association's solvency in a forthcoming hard market, the funds remain the private property of the Association. Pennsylvania law firmly establishes that profits earned by a nonprofit association may \"be used or set aside for the nonprofit purposes\" thereof.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    15 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 9114(d). Neither defendant identifies authority supporting their self-serving proposition that the Association's failure to identify a present purpose for the funds dilutes the value thereof to zero. Nor is there any support for Governor Wolf's view that, because the Association cannot articulate an immediate plan for divesting of its surplus, the General Assembly is free to take those funds for use toward what it deems a better purpose. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 73 at 22-23).

The Joint Underwriting Association is a private entity, and monies in its possession are private property. Act 44 endeavors to take a substantial portion of these funds-$200,000,000-for the public purpose of remedying longstanding imbalances in the Commonwealth's budget. Act 44 not only fails to provide \"just\" compensation; it fails to provide\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    compensation whatsoever.

We reject the General Assembly's eleventh hour suggestion that we allow the unconstitutional taking to occur and force the Association to try its luck in state court. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 62 at 33-34). For the same reason, we find that there is no adequate legal remedy to compensate plaintiff's injury. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has explicitly stated that \"the Eleventh Amendment bar to an award of retroactive damages against the Commonwealth clearly establishes that any legal remedy is unavailable and that the only relief available is equitable in nature.\"\n    <em>\n     Temple Univ. v.

A combination of declaratory and injunctive relief is the only way to ensure that the Association does not suffer an irreparable injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The remainder of the factors also favor the Association's request. Act 44 effects a direct loss of $200,000,000 to the Association as well as the indirect loss of both the interest on those funds and the cost of liquidating its investment portfolio. It inflicts a considerable and irreparable constitutional injury which far surpasses the General Assembly's frustration in returning to the budgetary drawing board. As concerns the public interest, we do not doubt that the General Assembly's intention was as stated-to achieve the estimable goals of balancing the state's budget and providing \"for the health, welfare and safety of the residents of this Commonwealth.\" Act 44, \u00a7 1.3. As we have already held, the General Assembly cannot achieve this legitimate end through illegitimate means. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 41 at 26-27). The public interest is furthered-not disserved-by permanently enjoining enforcement of a plainly unconstitutional statute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jamal v.

This selective quotation of\n     <em>\n      Harristown\n     </em>\n     divorces the decision from critical context.
