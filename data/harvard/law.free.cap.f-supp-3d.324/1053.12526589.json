The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (\"ICE\") has determined that Plaintiff is not lawfully present in the United States and has issued a detainer and administrative warrant for his arrest, which could lead to his removal from the country. Plaintiff brings this lawsuit against Coconino County Sheriff James Driscoll, Coconino County Jail Commander Matt Figueroa, the Coconino County Jail District, and members of the Coconino County Board of Supervisors, challenging their policy of holding persons in state custody for up to 48 additional hours as requested in ICE detainers and warrants. Plaintiff asks the Court to preliminarily enjoin the Sheriff's Office and the Coconino County Detention Facility (\"CCDF\") from detaining him on the ICE warrant after he posts bail or resolves his state charges. Doc. 14. Plaintiff's preliminary injunction motion is fully briefed, and the Court heard oral argument on June 28, 2018. Doc. 56. For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny the request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 11, 2017, Plaintiff was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence in violation of Arizona misdemeanor statutes and was confined in CCDF as a pretrial detainee. Doc. 18 \u00b6 2. On December 12, 2017, the Flagstaff Justice Court set Plaintiff's bail at $2,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The bail was the only condition of Plaintiff's release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118. The same day, Plaintiff's sister visited CCDF to inquire whether Plaintiff would be released if the $2,000 bail was posted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120. A CCDF employee told her that payment of the bail would not result in Plaintiff's release because an ICE detainer had been lodged against him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121. On December 15, 2017, Joseph Breckinridge offered to post Plaintiff's bail with a personal credit card, and was told by a CCDF employee that while it typically takes pre-trial detainees one hour to be released after bail is posted, Plaintiff would be held for up to 48 hours due to an \"ICE hold.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-28. Given this statement, Mr. Breckinridge did not tender Plaintiff's bail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A Sheriff's Detention Facility Policy and Procedure effective since 2008, and revised on July 28, 2017, provides that upon reasonable suspicion that an inmate in the facility is unlawfully present in the United States, CCDF staff must notify the Detention Removal Office (\"DRO\"), a subsidiary of ICE, and have the inmate speak to the DRO over the telephone. Doc. 18-1 at 1. If the DRO determines that the inmate is in the country illegally, ICE will fax two forms to CCDF to be placed in the inmate's file: a Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") Form I-247A Notice of Action - Immigration Detainer (\"detainer\"), and either a DHS Form I-200 Warrant for Arrest of Alien or a DHS Form I-205 Warrant of Removal/Deportation (\"ICE warrant\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A hold will then be placed in the inmate's file, and, when the inmate posts bail or resolves his state charges, detention staff will notify the DRO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The policy further provides that \"the detainer will remain in effect and the inmate will remain in custody until\" (1) the DRO or ICE sends a Form I-247A release notifying CCDF to remove the detainer, (2) ICE takes custody of the inmate, or (3) the \"detainer period\" expires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The detainer period \"commences when the local or state criminal justice agency has no\n   other legal basis for continuing the detention[,]\" and \"shall not exceed 48 hours.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"In the event DHS/ICE fails to assume actual physical custody of the detainee within 48 hours of the onset of the federal detainer (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) the detainee must be released.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 12, 2017, ICE officials in Phoenix, Arizona became aware that Plaintiff was in the custody of the Sheriff and faxed two documents to CCDF: a Form I-247A detainer and a Form I-200 ICE warrant. Doc. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 82-83; Doc. 18-4. The detainer is signed by an ICE deportation officer and states that there exists probable cause to believe that Plaintiff is a removable alien based on \"[s]tatements made by the alien to an immigration officer and/or other reliable evidence.\" Doc. 18-4 at 1. It is addressed to CCDF, and requests that CCDF maintain custody of Plaintiff for a period not to exceed 48 hours beyond the time he would otherwise be released.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ICE warrant is signed by Barry Jansen, an authorized immigration officer, and is addressed to \"any immigration officer authorized pursuant to Sections 236 and 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and part 287 of title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, to serve warrants of arrest for immigration violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.

Plaintiff's future injury is \"certainly impending.\" Defendants' written policy mandates that he be detained for up to 48 hours if CCDF has received an ICE detainer and warrant. Doc. 18-1. CCDF has received these documents and placed them in Plaintiff's file, and CCDF staff members have twice confirmed that CCDF will hold Plaintiff on the detainer if bail is posted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At oral argument, Defendants relied on\n   <em>\n    Clapper v.

In\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   , there was no concrete indication that the challenged statute would actually be used against the plaintiffs. Rather, the plaintiffs' injury depended on a \"highly attenuated chain of possibilities\" that required multiple independent actors to take actions within their discretion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    568 U.S. at 410-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, every action necessary to trigger Plaintiff's injury has been taken: ICE has submitted a detainer and warrant to CCDF, CCDF has placed the documents in Plaintiff's file, and CCDF has a written policy to detain Plaintiff if he posts bail. The mere possibility that ICE might somehow change its mind or act quickly does not render Plaintiff's imminent injury unduly speculative.

Second, he argues that federal law prohibits the Sheriff from complying with the ICE detainer. Third, he argues that detaining him under the federal detainer and warrant would violate the Fourth Amendment and a corresponding provision of the Arizona Constitution. In addressing these arguments on a preliminary injunction motion, the Court's task is to assess probabilities - whether Plaintiff is\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   to succeed on these claims. The Court is not making a final decision on the merits. That decision must await a more complete record and more thorough briefing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. State Law Authority.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties present competing interpretations of Arizona law. Plaintiff argues that county sheriffs in Arizona may act only when expressly authorized by statute, and that no statute authorizes the Sheriff to make civil immigration arrests. Defendants argue that Arizona sheriffs retain broad common law enforcement authority except where modified by statute, and that detaining Plaintiff under the federal detainer falls well within this power.

Plaintiff cites no statute that expressly restricts a sheriff from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. To the contrary, the Arizona legislature has stated a preference for such cooperation in S.B. 1070, as will be discussed below. Thus, if\n   <em>\n    Merrill\n   </em>\n   is to be taken at its word - that sheriffs possess common law powers except to the extent modified by the legislature - Plaintiff has identified no express modification that would prevent Defendants from cooperating with the ICE detainer and warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff cites statutes that govern procedures for enforcing warrants issued by another county or state and notes that no statute addresses the procedure for responding to federal administrative warrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14 at 4 (citing A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-3964, 13-3841, et seq. ; Ariz. R. Crim. P. 4.1(c)(2) ). Plaintiff notes that Arizona statutes outline the sheriff's authority to make warrantless and unilateral arrests in the criminal context and in some civil contexts, but that no statute authorizes such arrests for civil immigration violations. Doc. 51 at 4-5 (citing A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3883(1), (2), (4) (warrantless criminal arrests); \u00a7 36-525(B) (psychiatric commitment); \u00a7 8-303(C) (juvenile delinquents and runaways); \u00a7 36-2026(A) (emergency intoxication\n   commitment) ). Again, however, these arguments are helpful only if the sheriff lacks common law power to detain Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants and the United States argue that a number of Arizona statutes authorize the sheriff to comply with ICE detainers (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28 at 9-13; Doc. 41 at 22-24), but none of the statutes appears to support this assertion. Defendants cite a statute requiring the sheriff to arrest for \"public offenses.\" Doc. 28 at 9 (citing A.R.S. \u00a7 11-441(A)(2) ). But the purpose of that duty is \"the prompt and orderly administration of\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   justice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But these statutes do not expressly authorize the Sheriff to continue detention at the request of a federal agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants cite A.R.S. \u00a7 31-122(A), which provides that \"[t]he sheriff may receive and keep in the county jail any prisoner committed thereto by process or order issued under the authority of the United States.\" This appears to be the most relevant statute, but the Court needs further briefing on the scope of this statute and what is meant by \"process or order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants argue that they are authorized to hold inmates on ICE detainers pursuant to their intergovernmental service agreement with the federal government (\"IGSA\"), on which ICE is an authorized rider. Doc. 28 at 10-11. The IGSA is an agreement for housing federal inmates and receiving reimbursement from the federal government, but Defendants point to nothing in it that purports to grant them authority to make arrests on behalf of the federal government. Indeed, Defendants and the United States appear to have different understandings of how the IGSA functions in the context of ICE detainers.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28 at 10-11 (\"[O]nce the ICE detention period begins, an inmate is no longer in Defendants' custody, but the custody of the federal government.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41 at 5-6 (\"Until an immigration officer - or a state or local officer who has been delegated immigration officer authority under a 287(g) agreement - arrests the detainee, the IGSA is not triggered, and the detainee remains in state custody.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants and the United States point to A.R.S. \u00a7 11-1051, commonly referred to as S.B. 1070, as supplying the sheriff's authority.

Defendants argue that this language expressly authorizes Arizona sheriffs \"to comply with the enforcement of federal immigration law.\" Doc. 28 at 13. But the cited language is stated in terms of a prohibition: state and local officers may not limit the enforcement of federal immigration laws; it does not appear to be an affirmative grant of authority. The statute clearly establishes a strong state policy in favor of cooperating with federal immigration authorities, but it does not appear to supply the express authorization Plaintiff claims is necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Citing these provisions, Plaintiff argues that the Sheriff cannot detain aliens for immigration violations - a \"function of an immigration officer\" - because the Sheriff has not entered into a \u00a7 287(g) agreement. Doc. 51 at 11-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants argue that they have authority to comply with ICE detainers pursuant to \u00a7 1357(g)(10), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an agreement under this subsection in order for any officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (A) to communicate with the Attorney General regarding the immigration status of any individual, including reporting knowledge that a particular alien is not lawfully present in the United States; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (B) otherwise to cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(10). Specifically, Defendants argue that complying with ICE detainers constitutes permissible \"cooperation\" with \"detention\" under \u00a7 1357(g)(10)(B). Doc. 28 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Both parties cite the United States Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   decision to support their respective interpretations of \"cooperate.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   was a preemption case. In finding that the portion of S.B. 1070 granting\n   state officers independent and warrantless arrest power was preempted as an obstacle to the federal scheme, the Supreme Court explained: \"There may be some ambiguity as to what constitutes cooperation under the federal law; but no coherent understanding of the term would incorporate the unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien for being removable absent any request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal Government.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/\">\n    567 U.S. at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also noted that DHS provided the following examples of activities that would constitute cooperation under \u00a7 1357(g)(10)(B) : \"situations where States participate in a joint task force with federal officers, provide operational support in executing a warrant, or allow federal immigration officials to gain access to detainees held in state facilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   concerned unilateral arrests by state law enforcement officers - arrests for immigration offenses made without a request, approval, or other instruction from the federal government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It did not address the question presented in this case: whether the INA prohibits state officials from detaining an unauthorized immigrant at the request of federal immigration authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In any event, the Court is not persuaded at this stage that \u00a7 1357(g) prohibits Defendants from complying with detainers. Defendants' policy does not authorize Sheriff officers to unilaterally investigate, apprehend, or detain persons for immigration violations. Rather, it authorizes the Sheriff to cooperate with a request from ICE to detain a specific inmate already in the Sheriff's custody, whom ICE has independently determined is removable, for a short period to facilitate ICE's apprehension of the individual. This conduct appears to fall within \u00a7 1357(g)(10)(B). Plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of success on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court also has a general concern about the parties' arguments. Plaintiff argues that continuing to hold an individual on the basis of an immigration detainer after the state-law justification has expired constitutes a new arrest, and proceeds to address Defendants' actions entirely in the context of arrests. While the Court does not necessarily disagree with Plaintiff's premise - that continued detention is tantamount to an arrest - the Court sees at least some meaningful difference between a unilateral arrest by a sheriff's officer and continued detention on the basis of a federal warrant. In the former, the officer is acting entirely on his own authority and on the basis of his own judgment and investigation. In the latter, the officer is acting on the probable cause determination of a federal officer empowered and trained to make such determinations. The extent and significance of this distinction will need to be explored further in this litigation, but it is noteworthy that all of the authorities relied on by Plaintiff address unilateral arrests by state officers. These include the cases cited by Plaintiff, including\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's arguments regarding the need for training and supervision of state officers under \u00a7 287(g) agreements, and Plaintiff's arguments regarding 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252c. Defendants also primarily cite statutes and cases dealing with unilateral arrests. This focus undoubtedly is due to a lack of authority addressing the specific issue in this case, but future briefing should consider and address the differences between unilateral arrests and continued detentions on the basis of federal warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fourth Amendment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Even if the Sheriff is authorized by state law to comply with ICE detainers, Plaintiff claims that such compliance would violate the Fourth Amendment. But Plaintiff cites no case holding that federal immigration officers violate the Fourth Amendment\n   when they arrest persons based on probable cause to believe they are removable under federal law, and if such arrests do not violate the Fourth Amendment when made by federal officers, they do not violate the Fourth Amendment when made by state officers. The same Fourth Amendment applies to both, and Plaintiff concedes that the parallel provision of the Arizona Constitution, Article II, \u00a7 8, is \"coextensive with\" the Fourth Amendment in all aspects relevant to this case. Doc. 14 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff makes two specific arguments as to why his detention under the ICE detainer would violate the Fourth Amendment: (1) it is not supported by probable cause to believe a\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   violation has occurred, and (2) probable cause must be determined by a judge, not an ICE enforcement officer. Doc. 14 at 6-8, 12-13. Neither argument is likely to succeed or raises serious questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1.
