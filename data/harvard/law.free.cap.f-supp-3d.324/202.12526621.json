Against this backdrop, the Maine Republican Party\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed this civil action on May 4, 2018, and simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 3) seeking to prevent the Defendant, Matthew Dunlap, Secretary of State for the State of Maine (the \"Secretary\"), from implementing ranked-choice voting for the Party's June 12 primary. Also on May 4, the Party adopted a rule requiring that its nominees for elected office be selected using a simple plurality system. In its verified complaint, the Party contends that ranked-choice voting will unconstitutionally infringe on its right to freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, as incorporated against the State by the Fourteenth Amendment. For the reasons discussed below, I deny the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The Ranked-Choice Voting Act\" (the \"RCV Act\") is currently in effect for the June 12, 2018, primaries. L.D. 1557, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6 (referred to the voters, 127th Legis. 2016) (effective Jan. 7, 2017) (codified at\n   21-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1(27-C), 1(35-A), 601(2)(J), 722(1), 723-A (2018) ). Previously, Maine law required a single-choice voting system in primary and general elections, in which voters voted for a single candidate, and the candidate with the most votes (but not necessarily a majority of votes) won.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Opinion of the Justices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n    162 A.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (Me. 2017). That system is referred to by the parties as a \"plurality\" system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The RCV Act defines ranked-choice voting as \"the method of casting and tabulating votes in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, tabulation proceeds in sequential rounds in which last-place candidates are defeated and the candidate with the most votes in the final round is elected.\" L.D. 1557, \u00a7 2 (codified at 21-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1(35-A) ). Under ranked-choice voting, the first round proceeds much in the same way it did under the plurality system: Each voter's first choice vote is counted, and if any candidate captures an outright majority of the first choice votes that candidate wins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 10. But, if no candidate captures a majority of the first choice votes, there is an instant run-off.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The candidate with the fewest first choice votes is eliminated, and all of the ballots that listed him or her as the first choice candidate are counted for their second choice candidate.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The process repeats and eliminates more last place candidates until one candidate receives a majority of the votes.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Only voters enrolled in the Maine Republican Party will be eligible to cast a vote in the Party's primary on June 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 \u00b6 7. Because the ranked-choice voting process is triggered in races with more than two candidates, only two of the upcoming contests in the Republican primary-the contests for Governor of the State of Maine and Representative to the Maine Legislature in House District 75-will be subject to the ranked-choice voting process during the June 2018 primary.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the adoption of the RCV Act by public referendum in 2016, there were legislative efforts to repeal or delay its implementation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The RCV Act's complex post-adoption legislative and judicial history is chronicled in two opinions of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court related to it:\n   <em>\n    Opinion of the Justices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n    162 A.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Me. 2017) and\n   <em>\n    Maine Senate v.

IV, pt. 1, \u00a7 5, Art. IV, pt. 2, \u00a7 4, and Art. V, pt. 1, \u00a7 3 ), which, the Court opined, require plurality voting in general elections for Maine's State Senators and Representatives, and for Maine's Governor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n    162 A.3d at 209-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, as of this decision, the ranked-choice voting system is only employed in primary elections for these offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As part of its Party governance, the Maine Republican Party has promulgated rules and bylaws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 11-1, 11-2. On May 4, 2018, the Maine Republican Party adopted \"Rule 16\" at its 2018 biennial state convention. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 27. The rule provides that \"The Maine Republican Party's nominees for elected office, including United States Senator, United States Representative, Governor of the State of Maine, State Senator, and State Representative, shall be chosen by a plurality of votes cast.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11-1 at 9. The Maine Republican Party contends that the May 4 biennial convention was its first opportunity to adopt a rule governing its nomination process following the statewide adoption of ranked-choice voting. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 28. The Maine Republican Party acknowledges that it adopted Rule 16 so as to reject ranked-choice voting as applied to its primary candidates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The June primary election is 14 days away and the Secretary has taken steps to implement ranked-choice voting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 21. At the end of March, the Secretary promulgated proposed rules which will govern the ranked-choice voting process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. In early May, the Secretary provided ranked-choice voting training to approximately 275 local election officials to prepare them for the June 12 primary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at \u00b6 16. He also distributed written memoranda addressing election issues, including ranked-choice voting, to election officials in all 500 of the State's voting jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Secretary has already printed ballots that include ranked-choice voting for the Republican gubernatorial and House District 75 primary races which include instructions to rank candidates in order of preference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.

The Severity of the Burden the RCV Act Imposes on Associational Rights\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Maine Republican Party contends that by mandating ranked-choice voting, the RCV Act changes the method the Party deems most appropriate for selecting the candidates who will best represent the Party's beliefs and messages, which constitutes a severe burden on its right to freedom of association. This challenge to the State's authority to legislatively impose a specific method of primary vote counting-over the objection of a political party-presents a constitutional question of first impression. Neither party has identified, nor is the Court aware of any decision in which the Supreme Court (or any court) has ruled on whether states may impose a method for determining election winners that is at odds with a rule set by a political party. Guidance in answering this question is provided, however, by the two areas in which the Supreme Court has found that election laws violate a political party's associational rights: (1) laws regulating who\n   can vote in a party's primary election; and (2) laws that interfere with a political party's internal governance. I consider each area in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Supreme Court has found a political party's associational rights were violated where state requirements interfered with a party's ability to determine which primary voters can determine the party's nominees for public office. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court identified associational freedoms in a party's \"right to exclude,\" i.e., the right to select those who may participate in party activities.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p575\">\n    530 U.S. at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p575\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court concluded that California's \"blanket primary,\" in which voters could vote for any candidate regardless of the voter's or candidate's party affiliation, was unconstitutional because it required political parties to permit non-party members to vote in party primaries-thus \"forcing political parties to associate with those who do not share their beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p575\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p575\">\n    at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p575\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Supreme Court has similarly determined that regulations which, over a political party's objection, restrict the voters permitted to participate in the selection of the party's candidates may impose a severe burden on associational rights. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   , a closed primary statute (i.e., one that prevented political parties from allowing non-party members from voting in primaries) was found unconstitutional for impermissibly interfering with a political party's First Amendment right to define its associational boundaries.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/\">\n    479 U.S. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).

Further, the Maine Republican Party's position that Maine's adoption of a ranked-choice primary ballot should be subject to strict scrutiny would, contrary to the warning in\n   <em>\n    Clingman\n   </em>\n   , interfere with the State's ability \"to run efficient and equitable elections,\" and thus \"compel federal courts to rewrite [the] state['s] electoral codes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872036\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/581/#p586\">\n    544 U.S. at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872036\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/581/#p586\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   and the related decisions are limited to regulations that severely impair a political party's ability to function as a party composed of voters who share a common platform and beliefs because the regulations unduly restrict or expand the pool of voters given a voice in the party's primary elections. The RCV Act has no similar effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Courts also gauge the burden associated with a state's election regulations by assessing the degree to which a regulation affects a political party's governance and operations. On one end of a continuum are regulations that burden a party's wholly internal processes, which are considered severe burdens on associational freedom and rarely survive constitutional scrutiny. On the other end, are burdens that are external to the party, which have a much lower effect on associational freedom and survive constitutional scrutiny. This dichotomy is illustrated in\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v. Cox\n   </em>\n   , a case involving a challenge to a Utah statute requiring political parties to allow candidates to qualify for a primary ballot through either a nominating convention or by gathering signatures (or both), where the Tenth Circuit framed the issue presented in these terms: \"The distinction between wholly internal aspects of party administration on one hand and participation in state-run, state-financed elections on the other is at the heart of this case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516282\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1219/#p1229\">\n    885 F.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1229 (10th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Supreme Court's jurisprudence also reflects this dichotomy between a party's internal and external processes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516282\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1219/#p1229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1230 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031909\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/214/#p224\">\n    489 U.S. at 230-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031909\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/214/#p224\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Maine Republican Party argues, however, that because, under its rules, its elected statewide officials gain voting membership in, or the right appoint members to, its State Committee, the RCV Act's effect on the selection of the Party's nominees interferes with its internal governance, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Eu.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 18 at 14 n.3; ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The possibility that certain elected Maine Republican Party officials may become\n   part of the organization's governing body, or have the authority to appoint members to that body, is not a requirement imposed by the RCV Act. Thus, the RCV Act's future effect on the governance of the Maine Republican Party is incidental to its purpose. The Maine Republican Party is free to change its rules to account for that effect if it is dissatisfied with whatever effect, if any, the RCV Act has on the composition of its State Committee. Because the remedy to this potential consequence of the RCV Act is in the Party's control, any burden the RCV Act places on the Maine Republican Party's internal governance is incidental and insubstantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Where, as here, a regulation's effect is primarily external, it is unlikely to impose a severe burden on a party's associational rights. The Supreme Court has long recognized that a state's power to require parties to choose their general nominees by primary or convention: \"[it is] too plain for argument ... that the State may ... insist that intraparty competition be settled before the general election by primary election or by party convention.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Similarly, the RCV Act regulates a facet of the primary election-the ballot-which is external to issues of party governance and processes, and therefore falls within the ambit of the State's regulatory powers. Moreover, nominees selected through the primary process are not just party leaders, they are potential public officials. This necessarily imbues the selection process with a substantial external, public interest.

The relevant case law demonstrates that the possibility that a state's nondiscriminatory regulation of the time, place, and manner of an election will change an election's outcome does not, without more, offend the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Timmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651911\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/351/#p358\">\n    520 U.S. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651911\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/351/#p358\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e have repeatedly upheld reasonable, politically neutral regulations that have the effect of channeling expressive activit[ies] at the\n   polls.\") (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).

The State's second asserted interest-uniformity and consistency-is no less sound. If adopted, the Maine Republican Party's position would compel the Secretary to permit each political party to dictate how its primary ballots will be constructed and counted. Thus, if the Maine Republican Party adhered to plurality voting, the Maine Democratic Party chose ranked-choice voting, and the Maine Green Independent Party selected yet another ballot counting method, the Secretary and those responsible for administering Maine's 500 voting jurisdictions would be required to simultaneously implement three different ballot-counting procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16.

Second, even if \"An Act to Implement Ranked-Choice Voting in 2021\" is vetoed by statewide vote on June 12, 2018, it is unclear whether the RCV Act will be implemented in the general elections in November 2018; in its non-binding Advisory Opinion, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court found that the aspects of the RCV Act related to the election of the Governor and members of the Maine Legislature conflict with the State Constitution.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Opinion of the Justices\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n     162 A.3d at 209-11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    For a thorough explanation of the RCV Act's legislative and judicial history,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Maine Senate\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495874\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/183/749/\">\n     183 A.3d at 751-56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Secretary responds that whether the RCV Act will, in the end, actually influence which candidates are nominated in the party's primaries is unproven and wholly speculative.

ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 45. At this preliminary stage, I need not and, therefore, do not decide whether any one or more of these alleged reasons for the passage of the RCV Act should be treated as a state interest advanced by the RCV Act and, if so, are a proper basis for electoral regulation by the Secretary.
