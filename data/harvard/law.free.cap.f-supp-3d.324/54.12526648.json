MOSS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Following the submission of the special master's report and recommendations regarding damages, Dkt. 90, Plaintiffs have now moved for the Court to approve the special master's damages award and to enter partial final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) with regard to the U.S.-national plaintiffs. For the reasons stated below, the Court adopts the damages recommendations provided by the special master, subject to the modifications discussed below. In addition, the Court awards punitive damages in favor of Al-Taie's estate and U.S.-national family\n   members. Finally, the Court concludes that there is no just reason to delay entry of final judgment with regard to the U.S.-national plaintiffs and will, accordingly, enter partial final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In January 2007, First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz, Specialist Johnathan Bryan Chism, and Private First Class Shawn Falter were abducted from the Provincial Joint Coordination Center in Karbala, Iraq, and, shortly thereafter, murdered by their captors. In October 2006, Staff Sergeant Ahmed Al-Taie was abducted while in Baghdad, held hostage, and ultimately murdered. Plaintiffs, the estates and family members of the four direct victims, brought this action against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (collectively, \"Iran\"), alleging that the terrorist organization that carried out these brutal acts, Asaib Ahl al-Haq (\"AAH\"), could not have done so without material support from Iran. To establish subject matter jurisdiction, Plaintiffs invoked the state-sponsored terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a). Plaintiffs-all except one of whom are U.S. nationals-relied on another provision in the statute, \u00a7 1605A(c), to supply a federal cause of action, alleging that Iran provided \"material support\" to AAH, which in turn engaged in acts of extrajudicial killing, hostage taking, and torture. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 2, 2018, this Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to these claims. In summary, the Court concluded that (1) Iran provided AAH with \"significant support-in the form of training, supplies, intelligence, and funding-as part of its larger strategy to destabilize Iraq and [to] drive the United States from the Middle East,\" Dkt. 89 at 6 (Memorandum Opinion); (2) AAH \"took Fritz, Chism, and Falter hostage, and brutally beat and murdered them,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; (3) \"AAH held Al-Taie hostage, brutally beat and murdered him,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7; and (4) AAH could \"not have committed any of these acts without Iran's support,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Court further concluded that Iran's role in these events was sufficient to support the Court's subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. However, because the FSIA's cause of action, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(c), applies only to \"a national of the United States,\" \"a member of the armed forces,\" \"an employee [or contractor] of the [U.S.] Government ... acting within the scope of the employee's employment,\" or \"the legal representative of\" any such person, the Court found that only the U.S.-national plaintiffs had established their right to relief under the FSIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 89 at 56. The Court, accordingly, granted Plaintiffs' motion for default judgment against Iran with respect to the U.S. nationals, but the motion denied without prejudice with respect to the claims of Bashar Al-Taie, concluding that he had yet to establish his right to relief under D.C. law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Having granted Plaintiffs' motion for default judgment against Iran with regard to liability, the Court referred the case to a special master, Deborah Greenspan, to prepare proposed findings of fact and recommendations for damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 88 (Order Appointing Special Master). The special master has now filed her report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 90 (Special Master Report). In compiling her report and drafting her recommendations, the special master relied on sworn testimony, video depositions, medical records and autopsies, and expert reports, all of which have been filed with this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 69-83. The report lays out the effects that the abductions and murders of the four servicemen have had on the family members of the direct victims, and carefully analyzes these effects under the applicable framework for state-sponsored\n   terrorism cases. The Court thanks the special master for her thorough and thoughtful analysis, which she completed on an expedited schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs now request that the Court approve the special master's proposed damage awards and enter partial final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) with regard to the U.S.-national plaintiffs. As explained below, the Court adopts the proposed findings and recommendations of the special master, subject to the modifications discussed below. In addition, the Court will award punitive damages to the estate of Staff Sergeant Ahmed Al-Taie and his U.S.-national family members. In total, the Court awards the U.S.-national plaintiffs $193,044,753 in compensatory damages and awards the estate and family of Staff Sergeant Al-Taie $55,903,936 in punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its prior Memorandum Opinion, the Court concluded that the U.S.-national plaintiffs had \"demonstrat[ed] that they are entitled to relief under \u00a7 1605A(c).\" Dkt. 89 at 58. The only remaining questions, therefore, are what type of damages Plaintiffs are entitled to recover and in what amounts. Below, the Court resolves common questions regarding the award of damages. The damages awarded to each individual plaintiff are listed in the separate Order that accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Having reviewed the special master's damages calculation, the Court concludes the following: (1) the estates of the direct victims are entitled to economic damages; (2) all of the U.S.-national plaintiffs are entitled to non-economic damages for of pain and suffering and/or solatium; (3) an award of prejudgment interest is appropriate for both economic and noneconomic damages, and; (4) the estate and U.S.-national family members of Staff Sergeant Al-Taie are entitled to punitive damages for Iran's conduct that post-dates the enactment of the FSIA's cause of action in 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Economic Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As other district courts have noted, \"[s]ection 1605A explicitly provides that foreign state-sponsors of terrorism are liable to victims for economic losses stemming from injuries or death sustained as a result of the foreign state's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Thuneibat v.

The special master notes that \"Dr. Markham's and Mr. Staller's experience and expertise in the field of forensic economics are well-documented,\" Dkt. 90 at 33, and that both \"have testified as experts in state and federal courts nationwide,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   including this Court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265129\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/379/#p402\">\n    78 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   404-05 ;\n   <em>\n    Onsongo v.

After finding that the CFES calculations were \"reasonable,\" \"consistent with generally accepted practices,\" and \"appl[ied] appropriate assumptions based on reasonable and well-documented sources,\" the special master recommends that the Court adopt their proposed economic loss calculations, including their proposal for an increased award for the estate of Ahmed Al-Taie based on its loss of Al-Taie's household services in assisting with his parents' needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 90 at 34. The Court adopts these recommendations and will award economic loss damages to Plaintiffs in the amounts set forth in CFES reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 94 (listing awards).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Non-Economic Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Pain and Suffering of Direct Victims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The estates of the direct victims can also recover for the pain and suffering endured by Fritz, Chism, Falter, and Al-Taie. As the special master observes, although \"it is difficult to place a dollar value on pain and suffering in any situation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, the Court must nonetheless \"ensure that individuals with similar injuries receive similar awards.\"\n   <em>\n    Valore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4006876\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/700/52/#p83\">\n    700 F.Supp.2d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

In assessing pain and suffering damages, the special master bases her recommendations, Dkt. 90 at 35, on \"certain guideposts\": First, numerous decisions from this Court have adopted a general procedure for the calculation of damages that begins with the baseline assumption that persons suffering substantial injuries in terrorist attacks are entitled to $5 million in compensatory damages.\n   <em>\n    Wultz v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4003978\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/864/24/\">\n    864 F.Supp.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37- 38 (D.D.C. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

Second, previous decisions have provided compensation for the extreme fear and distress a victim experiences knowing his death is imminent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahirya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829474\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/775/48/#p81\">\n    775 F.Supp.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81-82 (D.D.C. 2011) (\"Courts have been influenced not only by the length of time that the victim endured physical suffering, but by the victim's mental anguish stemming from the knowledge that death was imminent.\");\n   <em>\n    Kilburn v.

Third, prior decisions have considered \"the duration of the pain and suffering, the nature and extent of the injuries, the fear and terror experienced by the victim, and the circumstances surrounding the death.\" Dkt. 90 at 37;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9426114\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/201/78/#p89\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (collecting cases and damages awards).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Against this backdrop, the special master recommends that the estates of Jacob Fritz, Bryan Chism and Shawn Falter should each receive $5.5 million each. Recognizing that there are offsetting reasons to depart upward and downward from the baseline assumption of $5 million, the Court will award each of these estates $5.0 million for pain and suffering. In its prior Memorandum Opinion, the Court concluded that the \"evidence support[ed] the inference\n   that all three men were kicked or otherwise beaten in the head while handcuffed and-significantly-while already suffering from severe gunshot wounds.\" Dkt. 89 at 47. Although the \"beatings [of Fritz, Chism, and Falter] did not take place over an extended period of time,\" those beatings \"were severe, and given the state of the soldiers,\" caused extreme pain and suffering. Dkt. 89 at 47. On the other hand, the $5 million baseline award often incorporates an element of future pain and suffering, which survivors of attacks must bear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4003978\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/864/24/\">\n    864 F.Supp.2d at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, in her report, the special master acknowledged that \"one could argue that the amount of damages for pain and suffering should be lower in the case of the Karbala Direct Victims because the duration of pain and suffering was relatively short.\" Dkt. 90 at 38-39. Weighing the brutality of the injuries against the short time period, the Court concludes that an award of the baseline $5 million is appropriate for each of the Karbala victims. Indeed, this is the award that Plaintiffs themselves had requested in their submission to the special master.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 70 at 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to Al-Taie, the special master suggests awarding $10,740,000 in pain and suffering to Al-Taie's estate, based on $10,000 per day for an estimated period of 1,074 days. The Court adopts the special master's recommendation for an award of $10,000 for each day that Al-Taie was in captivity but reduces the award slightly to account for the time that Al-Taie was not in AAH's custody. \"Courts in this district ... typically set damages for prolonged and abusive captivity at $10,000 per day for the pain and suffering that victims experienced while imprisoned.\"\n   <em>\n    Hekmati v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272990\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/278/145/#p163\">\n    278 F.Supp.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163-64 (D.D.C. 2017) (internal quotations omitted). Congress took a similar approach, moreover, for purposes of calculating payments to individuals held hostage in Tehran between 1979 and 1981.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020144\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this benchmark, the special master recommends that the Court award the estate of Al-Taie $10,000 per day for the period of his captivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This case, however, comes with a wrinkle: The Court does not know precisely how long Al-Taie was held before his murder. The Court concludes, however, that the special master's recommendation of a 1,074-day period of captivity is reasonable. Al-Taie was abducted in October 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 89 at 33. According to Dr. Mallak, the forensic evidence of Al-Taie's remains indicate that he was murdered sometime between February 2009 and February 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54 at 38-39 (Mallak). The 1,074-day time period for calculating damages estimates that his death occurred on October 1, 2009. This approximation, which the plaintiffs proposed, is a fair- or, in the words of the special master, a \"conservative\"-estimate of his total time in captivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court notes, however, that although 1,074 days is a reasonable estimate of Al-Taie's\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   captivity, Al-Taie was not in AAH's custody from the offset. Instead, he was abducted by other members of Jaysh al-Mahdi on October 23, 2006, and then, upon the realization that Al-Taie was an American soldier, transferred to AAH's custody sometime in \"early November 2006.\" Dkt. 89 at 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53 at 8-12. The Court, accordingly, will discount the special master's recommendation by ten days, or $100,000, to account for the time period that Al-Taie was not in AAH's custody. Therefore, the Court will award pain and suffering damages in the total amount of $10,640,000 to the estate of Al-Taie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Solatium for Family Members\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The state-sponsored terrorism exception to the FSIA expressly contemplates\n   the award of solatium damages to the close relatives of terrorism victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(c).

Applying this rule, the special master has calculated prejudgment interest at the average annual prime rate in each year from the date of the respective attacks (January 20, 2007 for the Karbala attack and October 23, 2006 for the abduction of Al-Taie). The Court adopts the special master's recommended totals, subject to the modifications discussed above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    This is double the amount of compensatory damages that Al-Taie's family members would recover if Al-Taie's mistreatment, captivity, and murder had begun on the date of \u00a7 1605A(c)'s enactment (January 28, 2008), rather than October 23, 2006. The Court calculates this amount as follows: The total amount of compensatory damages the Court will award to Al-Taie's estate and family is $32,461,968. Of that award, only Al-Taie's estate's pain and suffering award of $10,640,000 was contingent on the duration of his captivity; the pain and suffering and solatium damages of his family, and the economic loss caused by his execution, are all based on the nature of his abuse and the manner of his death, rather than his length of confinement. Those amounts, therefore, would be identical had Al-Taie's captivity begun on January 28, 2008, rather than October 23, 2006. Accordingly, the only amount the Court must discount is Al-Taie's pain and suffering award. 613 days elapsed between January 28, 2008 and October 1, 2009, the approximate date of Al-Taie's death. Accordingly, the Court applies the $10,000 per-day pain and suffering award to 613 days instead of 1,064, meaning that for the purposes of calculating punitive damages, Al-Taie's pain and suffering award would be $6,130,000 rather than $10,640,000. Al-Taie's family members would have thus recovered total compensatory damages of $27,951,968 rather than $32,461,968 had Al-Taie's mistreatment begun on the date of \u00a7 1605A(c)'s enactment. The punitive damages award, therefore, is $27,951,968 multiplied by a factor of two.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
