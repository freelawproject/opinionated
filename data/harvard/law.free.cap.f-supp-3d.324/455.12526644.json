PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants New York City Department of Education (\"DOE\") and Richard A. Carranza,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in his official capacity as Chancellor of the New York City School District, move to dismiss the Amended Complaint. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is about the special education needs of severely disabled children who rely on a variety of services to attend school. Plaintiffs are the parents of three students, aged eight to fifteen, who were born with serious medical conditions that have severely limited their cognitive and physical abilities. These disabilities present significant disadvantages for the students and their families, and constrain virtually every facet of their lives, including their ability to obtain an adequate education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The claims in this action arise from a systemic breakdown in DOE's practices, policies, and procedures governing the services it must provide to medically fragile children. While DOE is responsible for providing every child with a \"free and appropriate public education,\" its policies and procedures have hobbled the efforts of the disabled students in this case from securing the services they need. Instead of alleviating the burdens borne by disabled students and their families, the current policies spawn a cumbersome and counterintuitive bureaucracy that undermines the goal of educating these children. There is a glaring disconnect among the agencies within DOE tasked with providing nursing, transportation, and porter services. Because of these issues, the students were left with no other choice but to sit out significant periods of the school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After attempting to navigate through DOE's beadledom, one of the Plaintiffs commenced this action to compel DOE to take prompt action. With a preliminary injunction in place, Plaintiffs amended their complaint, asserting claims based on violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), New York State Education Law, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), and federal civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants move to dismiss the Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\") in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Allegations of the Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For purposes of this motion, the factual allegations of the Complaint are accepted\n   as true. J.P., M.C., and O.A. are disabled children who suffer from severe medical conditions and require substantial assistance to attend school. They require individualized nursing services, transportation to and from school on a specialized bus outfitted to carry wheelchairs, a nurse to accompany them on the bus, and another nurse that is either with or near them in school throughout the day. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-9, 11.) Additionally, two of the students-J.P. and M.C.-require porter service transporting them up and down the stairs of their walk-up apartment buildings to and from the school bus. (Compl. \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    J.L on behalf of J.P.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   J.P. is an eight-year-old-boy who suffers from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder which causes muscle spasms, hydrocephaly (an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain), and frequent severe seizures. J.P.'s medical condition requires him to use a nasal tube and a gastronomy tube. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2015, the DOE developed an Individualized Education Program (\"IEP\") to prepare J.P. for kindergarten. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.) Among other things, the IEP recommended a Bus Nurse to accompany J.P. on his commute to school. (Compl. \u00b6 60.) Despite this recommendation, DOE failed to provide J.P. with a Bus Nurse from September 2015 to June 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 67.) As a consequence, J.P. was unable to attend kindergarten for the entire 2015-16 academic year. (Compl. \u00b6 68.) The same problems persisted the following school year, leaving J.P. no choice but to stay home from August 2016 to June 2017. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79-116.) After experiencing similar roadblocks at the start of the 2017-18 school year, J.L. sought temporary injunctive relief from this Court. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Complaint details J.L.'s repeated attempts to secure IEP-sanctioned services for J.P. over three consecutive academic years. In 2015, after J.P.'s medical care providers submitted the necessary paperwork to secure a Bus Nurse, DOE inexplicably rejected the forms. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-78.) In 2016, with many of the same bureaucratic hurdles plaguing J.L.'s efforts to secure a Bus Nurse, J.L. sought legal assistance to expedite the process. (Compl. \u00b6 90.) But DOE again lagged in its response and eventually rejected J.P.'s paperwork, explaining that the \"forms required additional clarification\" before J.P. could receive a Bus Nurse. (Compl. \u00b6 94.) J.L. then worked with J.P.'s medical care providers to correct the various deficiencies, and resubmitted the forms only to have them rejected again, this time due to additional technical deficiencies. (Compl. \u00b6 101.) The tug of war among J.L., J.P.'s legal representatives, J.P.'s medical staff, and DOE representatives spanned several months. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-111.) And just when it appeared that the parties were on the cusp of obtaining approval, DOE reported that the \"school placement offered to J.L. in 2015 and 2016 was no longer available,\" further limiting J.P.'s chances of attending school. (Compl. \u00b6 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the 2017-18 school year approached, J.L. again faced challenges in securing IEP-related services for J.P. From June to September 2017, J.P. could not attend school because DOE failed to provide the necessary porter and transportation services. On some days, for example, the school bus transporting J.P. did not have enough room for his wheelchair. On other days, DOE failed to provide porter service because it could not locate a wheelchair small enough to transport J.P. safely down the stairs of his apartment building. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 124-141.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    H.B. on behalf of M.C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   M.C. is an eight-year-old boy who suffers from cerebral palsy and Menkes disease, a terminal condition caused by copper deficiency. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 147-148.) Because of his condition, M.C. is non-ambulatory, quadriplegic, wheelchair bound, and non-verbal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   M.C. should have started kindergarten in the 2014-15 school year. According to the Complaint, however, M.C. spent the entirety of the 2014-15 and 2015-16 school years at home. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 150-151.) In December 2016, DOE convened an IEP meeting for M.C. Although the parties discussed providing M.C. with a Bus Nurse and School Nurse, these services were not formally recommended. The DOE's district representative instead advised M.C.'s family that M.C. would receive a Bus Nurse and School Nurse only after the Office of School Health (\"OSH\") reviewed and approved the request. (Compl. \u00b6 154.) Because no OSH representative was present at the IEP meeting, M.C.'s family had to contact OSH separately. (Compl. \u00b6 155.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   By May 2017, although M.C.'s nursing forms were submitted to OSH at least four times, OSH did not approve any nursing services. (Compl. \u00b6 163.) M.C.'s medical professionals continued to submit the required forms on multiple occasions, but OSH repeatedly rejected them. This kabuki dance between M.C.'s medical professionals and OSH continued into the summer. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 164-173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In August 2017, DOE convened another IEP meeting and finally agreed to recommend a Bus Nurse and School Nurse. (Compl. \u00b6 175.) However, when M.C.'s family requested porter services, DOE told them that the Office of Pupil Transportation (\"OPT\") had to approve that request. M.C.'s family separately arranged a home visit with OPT to determine whether porter services were appropriate. OPT eventually approved porter services but told H.B. that M.C. could not attend school until the brakes on his wheelchair were repaired. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 179-182.) The parties spent several weeks locating a company to repair M.C.'s wheelchair. By then, however, M.C.'s physical therapist had completed a home visit to inspect M.C.'s wheelchair and concluded that it was functional. (Compl. \u00b6 186.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Having resolved the wheelchair issue, OPT assured H.B. that it would provide the necessary services to transport M.C. to school. But in October 2017, when the bus arrived, M.C. was not permitted to ride because a Bus Nurse was not present. A few days later, DOE assured H.B. that the nursing agency assigned to M.C.'s case had located an interim nurse to accompany M.C. while it continued to search for a permanent nurse. Yet when M.C.'s legal representatives called OPT to confirm the interim nurse assignment, the OPT representative could not be reached. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 196-198.) Instead, M.C.'s lawyers had to call an OPT customer service line, which reported that \"M.C. was not in the DOE's system because no bus route had been created for him yet\" and that \"routing a bus would take an additional 5 to 7 days.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 199-200.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A few days later, when a bus finally arrived to take M.C. to school, he could not go because DOE had again failed to provide a Bus Nurse. H.B. learned that \"M.C. had a Bus Nurse assigned to him ... but that the bus would not let the Bus Nurse on the bus because OPT claimed that the IEP did not provide for M.C. to have a nurse on the bus ....\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 202-203.) Having exhausted several options to secure these services, H.B. and M.C.'s legal representatives threatened DOE with legal action. Facing litigation, DOE finally \"coordinate[d] M.C.'s receipt of a Bus Nurse, School Nurse, porter service and\n   bussing [sic] simultaneously.\" (Compl. \u00b6 205.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    K.M. and D.A. on behalf of O.A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   O.A. is a fifteen-year-old boy who suffers from a progressive neuromuscular disorder with a quadriplegic level of involvement that requires him to use a wheelchair. (Compl. \u00b6 213.) O.A. also suffers from frequent seizures requiring timely medical attention. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 214-217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Like J.P. and M.C., O.A. has received special education services since he began attending school. O.A.'s IEP provides that he must be bused to and from school in a bus designed with a wheelchair lift. O.A. also needs a Bus Nurse and a School Nurse to be with him at all times since he is vulnerable to seizures. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 218-222.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Complaint alleges that O.A. miss the 2017-18 school year because DOE failed to provide the appropriate nursing and transportation services. Although K.M. submitted all of the required forms to secure a Bus Nurse and Attendant Nurse in time for the start of the 2017-18 school year, \"DOE did not provide a Bus Nurse on the first day of school.\" (Compl. \u00b6 241.) When K.M. contacted OSH to find out why, the OSH representative informed K.M. \"that she had only [ ] been informed of O.A.'s case a few days earlier, and that she would start contacting nursing agencies.\" (Compl. \u00b6 248.) About a week later, the OSH representative finally informed \"K.M. that OSH had located a Bus Nurse, and that the nurse's agency would contact K.M.\" (Compl \u00b6 253.) Despite multiple assurances from both DOE and the nursing agency that a Bus Nurse had been assigned to O.A., they repeatedly failed to provide one due to a host of administrative snafus. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 253-270.) And even when DOE finally provided nurses, they were unqualified to \"meet O.A.'s medical needs ... or were not able to work all five days of the week.\" (Compl. \u00b6 271.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lawyers for K.M. threatened to sue DOE, informing Defendants that if O.A. did not have a permanent Bus Nurse, Attendant Nurse, and busing simultaneously within a few days, that they would initial legal action. Facing litigation, DOE finally complied. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 272-273.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.

The thrust of Plaintiffs' claims, however, is that DOE's policies have undermined its ability to implement the nursing, transportation, and porter services expressly provided for in IEPs. This Court is mindful that a \"plaintiff could plausibly frame any IEP-related claim as one of 'implementation' and thereby sidestep the IDEA's exhaustion requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Polera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9437975\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/288/478/#p483\">\n    288 F.3d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Complaint is replete with allegations that DOE policies and procedures created layers of bureaucracy that made it difficult for parents of disabled children to obtain services. Plaintiffs' \"claims are systemic in that the wrongdoing complained of is inherent in the program ... that [Defendants] adopted and is not directed against any specific child.\"\n   <em>\n    J.G. by Mrs. G. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 155, 284, 291.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs were required to contact OSH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   and OPT separately after the IEP meeting. This policy created a disjointed bureaucracy in which OSH and OPT acted in isolation without coordinating-much less knowing-the services each was required to provide. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 232-237.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   J.P.'s situation is emblematic of the organizational dysfunction fostered by DOE's policies. On September 13, 2017, a \"bus came to pick J.P. up at his home, [but it] had no room for J.P.'s wheelchair, so he was unable to attend school.\" (Compl. \u00b6 137.) The next day, the bus simply failed to \"come to pick up J.P. for school.\" (Compl. \u00b6 138.) Moreover, because DOE failed to simultaneously provide J.P.'s nursing, transportation, and porter needs from June 2017 to September 2017, the \"nurse originally assigned to J.P. in June 2017 was no longer available for J.P.\" (Compl. \u00b6 139.) As a result of OSH's failure to re-assign a new nurse or tell OPT and J.P's representatives that it had eliminated his original nursing assignment, J.P. could not attend school on September 15 because a nurse was not on the bus. (Compl. \u00b6 140.) M.C. and O.A. have had similar interactions with DOE's bureaucracy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 181-203, 230-271.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   DOE's policies sanctioned a Kafkaesque approval process that often precluded receipt of IEP-related services. According to the Complaint, \"even after the Plaintiffs submitted medical documentation clearly demonstrating the medical need for nursing services, OSH denied or delayed approval of Nurse Services because of requests for information or documentation that was necessary to evaluate the students' needs for nurses.\" (Compl. \u00b6 286.) Indeed, J.P. was left out of school for nearly two years because OSH refused to accept multiple submissions from his lawyers and medical care providers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-78, 88-116;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 163-173 (alleging that O.A.'s forms repeatedly were submitted and rejected).) Even after J.P.'s representatives repeatedly re-submitted forms, OSH failed to process them in an expeditious manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   DOE also lacked a mechanism to assure Plaintiffs that J.P., M.C., and O.A. would receive IEP-mandated services. Put another way, DOE representatives were not expressly required to respond to service requests within a prescribed time frame. The Complaint alleges that concerned parents repeatedly attempted to contact OSH and OPT representatives and confirm, for example, that a bus was assigned to pick up their child on the first day of school. Those representatives were not readily reachable, and when they eventually returned the calls-sometimes several days later-they often lacked information regarding whether (and when) the requested services would be provided.

DOE provides no streamlined process for parents of disabled students to convey service requests and recommendations to OSH and OPT. Moreover, parents are routinely kept in the dark about the status of their requests-their telephone calls go unreturned, and when they do make contact with DOE, the explanations they receive are unclear.

Given that this Opinion &amp; Order completely resolves Defendants' motion to dismiss, the parties' joint request for a discovery conference is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. The motion is granted with respect to Plaintiff H.B.'s claims arising from the 2014-15 and 2015-16 school years. And to the extent that the Complaint pleads claims against the individual Defendant under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, those claims are dismissed. The motion is denied in all other respects. Further, the parties' joint request for a discovery conference is denied as moot. The Clerk of Court is directed to amend the caption to substitute Richard A. Carranza for Carmen Fari\u00f1a. In addition, the parties are directed to appear for a status conference on September 20, 2018 at 2:30 p.m. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions pending at ECF Nos. 36 and 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Carranza is automatically substituted as a party.
