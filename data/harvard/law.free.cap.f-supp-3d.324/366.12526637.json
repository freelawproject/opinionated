(Dkt. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Ocean Reef's motion to transfer venue (Dkt. 16), Centennial's motion to transfer venue, and, in the alternative, to dismiss the action (Dkt. 18), and Ocean Reef's motion for leave to file supplemental evidence (Dkt. 30). For the following reasons, Ocean Reef's motion to transfer is granted, Centennial's motion is granted to the extent that it seeks to transfer venue to the Southern District of Florida but is otherwise denied, and Ocean Reef's motion for leave to file supplemental evidence is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, a Connecticut business entity with its principal place of business located in Connecticut, is in the business of issuing marine insurance policies. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 5). In August 2016, Plaintiff issued the Policy to Ocean Reef, effective October 10, 2016, through October 10, 2017, which provided various insurance coverages for the Yacht. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15 (the Policy) ). The Bank is included as a \"loss payee\" on the Policy. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15 at 30). The Policy provides coverage for property damage, commercial towing/emergency services, liability, medical payments, longshore &amp; harbor workers, personal property, and uninsured/underinsured boaters. (Dkt. 15 at 30). The Policy contains a \"Captain Warranty,\" requiring the employment of a \"professional captain,\" and a \"Crew Warranty,\" requiring the employment of \"1 full time or part time professional crew.\" (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15 at 27-28). The Policy also includes a \"Named Storm Deductible Endorsement,\" which increases the insurance deductible to five percent \"of the Physical Damage amount of insurance\" provided within the declarations page \"for any loss or damages\" resulting from a \"named storm as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),\" under certain specified conditions. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ocean Reef has claimed that the Yacht was damaged in September 2017, as a result of Hurricane Irma. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Plaintiff alleges that Ocean Reef did not employ or otherwise secure the services of an \"approved captain\" or a \"professional crew.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-22). Plaintiff further alleges that Ocean Reef requested that Plaintiff \"make an advance payment to fund the raising of the vessel,\" and that Plaintiff agreed to do so \"subject to a complete reservation of rights, including the right to seek reimbursement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25). Ocean Reef allegedly \"received the benefit of [Plaintiff]'s payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 26, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this action requesting a declaratory judgment clarifying the parties' rights and responsibilities under the Policy. Specifically, Plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring that: (1) Ocean Reef violated the Captain\n   Warranty and the Crew Warranty; (2) Both violations preclude coverage for any claimed damages or costs; and (3) Plaintiff has no obligation to pay for any claimed damages and costs under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). In the alternative, Plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring that the \"named storm\" deductible applies to any recoverable claim sought by Ocean Reef. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff further requests that the judgment declare its right \"to recover the amounts paid to raise the vessel, plus interest and costs,\" as well as \"the costs, disbursements and reasonable fees of this action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 15, 2017, Ocean Reef filed a motion to transfer this case to the Southern District of Florida pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Dkt. 16). On December 21, 2017, the Bank filed a separate motion to transfer, which also requested that this case be transferred to the Southern District of Florida pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a). (Dkt. 18). In addition, the Bank asserts, in the alternative, that it should be dismissed from this action because the Court cannot assert personal jurisdiction over it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff opposes both motions. (Dkt. 21; Dkt. 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 31, 2018, Ocean Reef filed a motion for leave to file supplemental evidence. (Dkt. 30). Specifically, Ocean Reef requested leave to file a loan agreement related to the Yacht, which was executed between itself and the Bank in 2016. Ocean Reef claims that the agreement would rebuff Plaintiff's assertion that the Bank negotiated, delivered, and issued this loan in Rochester, New York. The Bank filed a declaration suggesting that the loan agreement is irrelevant to whether the Court should transfer this case to the Southern District of Florida. (Dkt. 33). Plaintiff opposes Ocean Reef's motion for leave to file supplemental evidence. (Dkt. 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 8, 2018, the Court heard argument on the parties' respective motions and reserved decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Motions to Transfer Venue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). \"Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) grants federal district courts the power to entertain [a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.

(Dkt. 16-1 at 4-5). Plaintiff argues that the only relevant witnesses are \"Ocean Reef's principal(s), and the professional captain and crew Ocean Reef allegedly employed.\" (Dkt. 21 at 14). In addition, Plaintiff argues that its own witnesses reside \"near New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, Plaintiff does not identify the specific \"relevant witnesses\" to which it refers and only cites to the declaration of its Marine Insurance Underwriter, Thomas F. Craig, III (\"Craig\"), who avers that Plaintiff's \"Luxury Yacht Division\" is based in Edison, New Jersey. (Dkt. 26 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-6). At oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel confirmed that at least one of its potential witnesses was located in New Jersey, and that another could be found in the State of Washington. Plaintiff has provided little to support the specifics of any testimony to be elicited from any of its potential witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, there is no indication that the individuals identified by Ocean Reef are employed by Ocean Reef. In fact, the affirmation supplied by Ocean Reef indicates that they are employed by other companies or are themselves separate business entities. (Dkt. 16-1 at \u00b6 18). Lastly, testimony regarding the condition of the Yacht, damages and repairs to its hull, and the circumstances surrounding the negotiations and performance of the Policy would be material to this case. Ocean Reef's counsel affirms that the non-party witnesses that Ocean Reef intends to call at trial would testify on these topics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, since material non-party witnesses are found in Florida, and since Plaintiff\n   has failed to provide factual submissions identifying its own non-party witnesses, the nature of their testimony, or their connection to New York State, this factor weighs in favor of granting transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

This report further provides that the purpose of the statement is to change the registered office or registered agent, or both, in the State of Florida. (Dkt. 23-1 at 5). Thus, it appears that at the time this report was filed, Ocean Reef's current registered agent resided in Palm Beach, Florida, and that Ocean Reef intended to change its registered agent to Bad Boys, LLC, which maintained an address in Rochester, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court is hesitant to place disproportionate weight upon a single annual report in determining the location of Ocean Reef's principal place of business, especially where there is little other evidence that Ocean Reef's principal place of business was located in New York at the time the action was commenced. With that said, Ocean Reef does not effectively address this issue, and instead, asserts that \"\n   <em>\n    [w]hen the Policy was negotiated and issued\n   </em>\n   , Ocean Reef and [the Bank] both had their principal places of business in Florida.\" (Dkt. 24 at 5 (emphasis added) ). Indeed, at oral argument, Ocean Reef's counsel simply pointed out that the Articles of Organization were never amended to reflect any change to its principal place of business. At least at this stage of the litigation, and where no discovery has been had between the parties, Plaintiff's submission of Ocean Reef's 2017 annual report creates a factual dispute as to the actual location of Ocean Reef's principal place of business at the time Plaintiff filed this action. For this reason, the Court will assume for purposes of this Decision and Order that Ocean Reef's principal place of business was located in New York at the time the action was commenced. However,\n   this assumption does not alter the Court's ultimate conclusion that transfer is appropriate under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

In addition, any costs incurred as a result of raising the Yacht after it had been damaged also accrued as a result of actions that took place in Florida.

(Dkt. 21 at 17). Centennial argues that the Policy was actually \"negotiated in Florida\" (Dkt. 18-2 at 9), and Ocean Reef concurs, arguing that the Policy \"was negotiated and performed\" in Florida, and that that was \"where the loss occurred\" (Dkt. 16-8 at 13). Ocean Reef also supplies the declaration of Richard Gollel (\"Gollel\"), who avers that he is \"the beneficial owner of the [Yacht].\" (Dkt. 16-7 at 1). Gollel further avers that the Policy \"was negotiated in Florida,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8), that Hull &amp; Company, Inc. (\"Hull\")-identified as the \"Producer\" on the Policy-was Plaintiff's representative that issued the Policy, and that Hull \"is located and incorporated in Florida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In response, Plaintiff filed the declaration of Craig, who avers that the Plaintiff's Luxury Yacht Division, which is located in Edison, New Jersey, issued the Policy. (Dkt. 26 at \u00b6 5). Craig also states that Hull \"never represented or acted for\" Plaintiff; rather, Hull acted as Ocean Reef's \"insurance broker.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Craig further avers that Hull \"negotiated the terms of the [Policy] with [Plaintiff's] Luxury Yacht Division in Edison, New Jersey.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). The application submitted by Hull listed Ocean Reef's address at 45 Cedarfield Commons, Suite FA, Rochester, NY 14612, and identified Lisa Steinhoff as the \"beneficial owner\" of the Yacht. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). Plaintiff then \"issued its initial policy to Ocean Reef using the Rochester, New York address provided by Ocean Reef's application.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Hull negotiated and \"solicited renewals of the Policy\" with Plaintiff's New Jersey office, and each reissuance was processed through that office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-21). Each version of the Policy \"used Ocean. Reef's Rochester, New York address.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is the Court's view that the locus of operative facts falls within New Jersey or Florida, not New York. There is no evidence that any of the negotiations regarding the Policy, or its renewals, occurred in New York. Hull, a Florida corporation, filed the initial application with Plaintiff's Luxury Yacht Division in New Jersey, and all subsequent renewals were \"processed\" through that office as well. Thus, whether or not the Policy negotiations occurred in Florida or in New Jersey, (Dkt. 16-7 at \u00b6 8; Dkt. 26 at \u00b6 11), neither position grounds this case in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is true that the Policy includes Plaintiff's Rochester, New York address, (Dkt. 15 at 24, 30, 34), and Craig confirms that each version of the Policy \"\n   <em>\n    used\n   </em>\n   Ocean\n   Reef's Rochester, New York address.\" (Dkt. 26 at \u00b6 22 (emphasis added) ). However, Plaintiff does not submit evidence indicating that the Policy was actually sent to New York. Instead, the record indicates that the Policy was negotiated in either New Jersey or Florida, was then issued to Hull-a Florida corporation-which produced the Policy to Ocean Reef for performance in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Whether or not there are multiple loci of operative facts is irrelevant, because it does not appear that New York bears any more than a tangential relation to the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Ins.
