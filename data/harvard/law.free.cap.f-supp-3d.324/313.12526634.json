R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6), as well as a motion by the Plaintiffs to certify the case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23. For the following reasons, the Defendant's motion is granted in part and denied in part, and the Plaintiffs' motion is denied without prejudice with leave to renew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plaintiffs are all Medicaid and Medicare recipients, and current or former enrollees of GuildNet, a New York State managed long-term care plan (\"MLTCP\"), that provides home care services throughout New York State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commissioner required the Plaintiffs to enroll in a MLTCP in order to receive long-term services funded by Medicaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about March 20, 2017, GuildNet sent a letter (the \"March 2017 Letter\") informing its enrollees in Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester counties that it would not be offering managed long term care (\"MLTC\") services beginning June 1, 2017. Enrollees were told that they should select a new MLTCP before May 18, 2017 to assure a smooth transition, and that they would continue to receive services from GuildNet until the transfer to the new plan was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that the DOH did not require other MLTCPs to offer the same level of care that they had received from GuildNet, or to provide notice before reducing care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Commissioner apparently received a number of complaints from GuildNet enrollees about the March 20 Letter, and in May 2017, Zucker sent a new letter to GuildNet enrollees (the \"May 2017 Letter\") advising them that they did not need to transfer to a new plan by June 1. The Commissioner's letter further stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   the State requires GuildNet to continue providing your existing services until a smooth transfer can be completed to your new plan of choice. You can contact New York Medicaid Choice (NYMC) for information about plans available to you and assistance with enrolling in a new plan. All plans provide the same core services and benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Ex. B. to Am. Compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Samele received 24-hour home care services from GuildNet since 2012. After Samele received the March 20 Letter, her son began looking for an MLTCP that would provide her with the same level of care as GuildNet. On September 1, 2017, Samele enrolled in Elderplan HomeFirst (\"Elderplan\"), which agreed to provide her with 24-hour home care. Elderplan apparently closed in several counties in 2016, and announced that it intends to close in Suffolk County \"imminently.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 180). Samele has received 24-hour home care since the March 20 Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Roher received 24-hour home care from GuildNet beginning in October 2016. After she received the March 20 Letter, her daughter contacted other MLTCPs. On or about November 1, 2017, Roher enrolled in Wellcare, which offered her 24 hour home care. Roher has received 24-hour home care since the March 20 Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Guadagna received 24-hour live-in care, as well as Adult Day Health Care (\"ADHC\"). He attended the Adult Day Health Care program one day a week, and received medical model adult day health services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and a bath. After receiving the March 2017 Letter, Guadagna's daughter reached out to MLTCPs to find one that would offer the same services as GuildNet. At the time, he was temporarily residing in a rehabilitation center where he was recovering from an episode of gout. On May 1, 2017, he enrolled in Northwell. Northwell offered Guadagna 24-hour live-in care, but did not approve his ADHC services. As a result, Guadagna came home from the rehabilitation center on or about May 1, 2017. Guadagna has not received occupational therapy or physical therapy since he transferred to Northwell, and has not had a proper bath or shower since that time. On November 1, 2017, Guadagna transferred to Agewell. Agewell also agreed to provide 24-hour care, but did not agree to provide ADHC services. On December 19, 2017, the Commissioner sent a letter to Guadagna informing him that it had directed Agewell to restore his services to the level he received from GuildNet. The services would have to continue for 120 days, or until he agreed to a new plan of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 22, 2017, after the Plaintiffs initiated this action, the Commissioner issued MLTC Policy 17.02: MLTC Plan Transition Process-MLTC Market Alteration (the \"Transition Policy\"), which updated the DOH's transition policy. The Transition Policy was sent to all MLTCP providers in New York State, and was posted on the DOH website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pursuant to the Transition Policy, MLTCPs must send notices to affected consumers when they intend to discontinue operations. The notices must list available plans; a direction to select a new plan within sixty days of the date of the letter; and state that any enrollee who does not select a new plan within that time frame will be automatically assigned to a new MLTCP. The DOH will review notices prior to their transmittal, and will require Maximus, a DOH contractor, to send out additional notices to affected enrollees to help them select a new MLTCP. The new MLTCP must provide enrollees with the same level of services that they previously received for 120 days. During that 120 days, the MLTCP must conduct a new assessment of the enrollee to determine their plan and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 25, 2017, Maximus began sending \"Outreach Letters\" to affected GuildNet enrollees. The Outreach Letters were drafted by the DOH. The first Outreach Letter told current GuildNet members who were concerned about maintaining their current service levels to remain with GuildNet until the Transition Policy is in place. As to those former GuildNet enrollees who were receiving fewer services with a new MLTCP than they had with GuildNet, the letter instructed them to contact New York Medicaid Choice (\"NYMC\") within ninety days. NYMC would then determine whether those individuals were eligible to have their previous services restored. Individuals would be so eligible if they left GuildNet after March 20, 2017; were still eligible for Medicaid; and received fewer hours of care and services from their current MLTCP than they had under GuildNet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 16, 2017, Maximus sent the second Outreach Letter to individuals who were still enrolled in GuildNet. The letter stated that the DOH had finalized the Transition Policy. GuildNet enrollees had sixty days to select a new MLTCP. If they did not select a new plan by December 15, 2017, one would be selected for them, and their enrollment would be effective on January 1, 2018. The new MLTCP would provide the same level of services for 120 days after the transfer date, unless the enrollee and the plan agreed to a different plan before that time. The letter included a list of MLTCPs available in the Medicaid recipient's area, and told the recipient to call NYMC to select an MLTCP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 30, 2017, Maximus sent the third Outreach Letter to affected current and former GuildNet enrollees. The third Outreach Letter referenced the first two Outreach Letters and reminded current and former GuildNet enrollees of their rights to maintain the levels of care they received from GuildNet, and of the impending deadlines outlines in the first two Outreach Letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 6, 2017, Samele, along with former Plaintiffs Marie Turano and Leonard Turano, commenced this action by filing a complaint. The original complaint alleged violations of the Medicaid Act, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act. The original complaint sought an order certifying the action as a class action; declaratory and injunctive relief; costs; and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 3, 2017, the Defendants filed an answer to the original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 31, 2017, the original Plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the complaint pursuant to Rule 15 to add additional Plaintiffs and additional facts. On November 4, 2017, the Court granted the Plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The amended complaint added Roher and Guadagna as Plaintiffs. The amended complaint alleged the same violations as the original complaint, and sought the same types of relief. Specifically, the Plaintiffs seek an order declaring that the Commissioner's failure to ensure that the Plaintiffs would have their long-term benefits maintained at current levels unless and until they have notice and a fair hearing to challenge any proposed reduction or termination violates the Medicaid Act and the Due Process Clause; the Commissioner's failure to ensure that Plaintiffs would not have their long-term care benefits reduced or terminated based on non-individualized criteria when GuildNet terminates its services in their counties violates the Due Process Clause; and that his failure to ensure that Plaintiffs maintain their long-term care benefits during an involuntary transfer to a new MLTCP threatens to result in unnecessary institutionalization of class members, in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To that end, the Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining the Defendant to ensure that the Plaintiffs continue to receive long-term care benefits at their current levels unless and until they receive notice and a fair hearing to challenge any proposed reduction or termination; to ensure that class members who are former GuildNet enrollees currently receiving fewer services than they received from GuildNet be restored their previous levels of care unless and until they are provided with notice and a fair hearing to challenge the reduction; and to ensure that GuildNet provides continuous coverage to its enrollees at their current level of care until they transition to a new MLTCP that provides the same level of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On November 21, 2017, former Plaintiffs Marie Turano and Leonard Turano voluntarily dismissed their claims against the Defendants pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), and they were removed as Plaintiffs from the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 1, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification pursuant to Rule 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 21, 2017, the Defendants filed their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the Defendant's motion to dismiss was made by cross-motion, it will be addressed first, since a disposition in the Defendant's favor would render the Plaintiffs' motion for class certification moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. As to the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Defendant contends that Samele and Roher's claims are not ripe for review because they have not suffered an injury in fact in that their services were never terminated or reduced. Further, the Commissioner argues that all of the Plaintiffs' claims are moot because the Plaintiffs have already been given all of the relief that they seek because the series of letters sent by the DOH and Maximus state that all GuildNet enrollees must receive the same level of care when they transfer to a new MLTCP for 120 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On the other hand, the Plaintiffs assert that all of the Plaintiffs' claims are ripe, and that the Plaintiffs therefore have standing, because the DOH never sent a constitutionally and statutorily mandated notice to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs contend that the Commissioner's failure to send such a notice, and the Plaintiffs' risk of having their services reduced or being institutionalized, constitute an injury in fact. As to the Defendants' mootness argument, the Plaintiffs contend that their claims are not moot because the DOH did not send a notice to GuildNet enrollees who lost care, and has not mandated that such notices be sent when an MLTCP intends to discontinue service in an area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), a court must dismiss a claim if it \"lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

The Plaintiffs argue that Samele and Roher suffered injury in fact when they were refused the same level of care by other MLTCPs without notice of their right to a fair hearing after they were forced to leave GuildNet. The Court finds that Samele and Roher have not suffered an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, the Court notes that the relevant date for measuring whether a plaintiff has standing is the date on which the suit commenced.\n   <em>\n    United States Parole Commission v.

In fact, although she had been assessed by ArchCare Community Life, ArchCare assessed that Samele only needed eight hours of home care services per day. At that time, her son had also reached out to Fidelis and Elderplan, but assessments had not yet been scheduled. Samele alleged that if she did not receive 24 hours of home care, she would possibly have to move to a nursing home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   When the Plaintiffs sought leave to allow Roher to join the suit, August 31, 2017, two MLTCPs assessed that she required less than twenty-four hours of care per day. When Roher's daughter asked one of the MLTCPs if she could appeal the assessment, she was apparently told that she had to accept or reject the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   However, in May, both Samele and Roher received the Commissioner's letter which stated that GuildNet would have to continue providing existing services to them until they transitioned to a new plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Neither Samele nor Roher had their benefits reduced, suspended, or terminated. As such, they were not entitled to notice or a fair hearing. At the time they each joined the suit, they were still receiving the same level of care from GuildNet that they had always received, and were informed by the Commissioner that they would be receiving the same level of care from GuildNet until they transitioned to a new plan. Therefore, they did not suffer an injury in fact. As the Court holds below, had they enrolled in one of the plans that offered less care without notice and hearing, they would have suffered an injury in fact. However, since they did not so enroll, they do not have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that they should have been afforded notice of their right to a fair hearing and aid continuing when they were assessed for less care than they received under GuildNet. In the Court's view, this assertion is contrary to the statute and regulations, and is unworkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under the regulations, individuals are entitled to notice \"[a]t the time the agency denies an individual's claim for eligibility, benefits or services; or denies a request for exemption from mandatory enrollment in an Alternative Benefit Plan; or takes other action, as defined at \u00a7 431.201; or whenever a hearing is otherwise required in accordance with \u00a7 431.220(a).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20431.206\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

The MLTCPs did not have to send notice of their right to a fair hearing with aid continuing to those Plaintiffs because they had not enrolled in those plans, and therefore there was no date certain when Samele and Roher would have their benefits reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Furthermore, the Plaintiffs' proposition that MLTCPs provide notice and a fair hearing anytime they are assessed for less care than they previously received is unworkable. For instance, Roher's daughter\n   contacted five different MLTCPs after GuildNet sent their initial notice. Under the Plaintiffs' asserted interpretation of the statute and regulations, all five would have had to offer Roher notice and a fair hearing even though she was not yet enrolled with any of the plans. Conversely, if two offered fewer services than GuildNet had, but three offered the same as or more than GuildNet, the two that offered less would still have to provide notice and a fair hearing even if Roher had enrolled with one of the other three because the two that offered her less care would be unaware that other MLTCPs were offering a higher level of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In that way, neither Samele nor Roher were at risk of losing their care. Instead, at the time they each joined the action, the risk was hypothetical or conjectural.

Pursuant to the Commissioner's May 2017 letter, GuildNet had to continue providing the same level of care to them until they found a new provider. The letter even said that enrollees \"may remain in GuildNet\n   and continue to receive your existing levels of service until you have found a plan that meets your needs and the enrollment transfer can be arranged.\" (Ex. B to Am. Compl.). While several MLTCPs had assessed that Samele and Roher required less care than previously offered by GuildNet, they were free to seek out other MLTCPs who would offer the same level of care. Indeed, both Samele and Roher were eventually offered 24-hour care by different MLTCPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For those same reasons, neither Samele nor Roher were in danger of being institutionalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Therefore, Samele and Roher did not suffer injuries in fact, and they do not have standing. Accordingly, the Defendant's motion to dismiss their claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is granted. In any event, as discussed below, their claims are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   However, as the Defendant seemingly concedes, Guadagna does have standing. Indeed, the Court finds that when Guadagna enrolled in Agewell, and received less care than he had received under GuildNet without notice of a right to a fair hearing with aid continuing, he suffered injury. The Court notes that the Defendant's silence on Guadagna's standing seemingly contradicts their position that an MLTCP need not provide notice of a right to a fair hearing when an enrollee decides to switch to their plan and receive less care. By conceding Gaudagna's standing, the Commissioner seemingly admits that AgeWell should have afforded notice of a right to a fair hearing when they provided him with less care than he received under GuildNet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This finding is consistent with one of the Decisions After Fair Hearing cited by the Plaintiffs, In the Matter of the Appeal of [redacted] from a determination by the Nassau County Department of Social Services, Fair Hearing No. 7584246R (Nassau, Aug. 2, 2017), available at http://otda.ny.gov/fair%20hearing%20images/2017-10/Redacted_7584246R.pdf. (last visited June 6, 2018). In that case, the 97-year-old appellant sought coverage from Integra after she was told that GuildNet would no longer be offering services in her area. The appellant had received 24-hour live-in services while enrolled in GuildNet. On April 6, 2017, Integra assessed that the appellant should receive 43 hours of live-in services per week. On May 1, 2017, Integra authorized 56 hours per week of live-in care, and the appellant enrolled the same day. On August 2, 2017, the appellant requested a fair hearing. On August 23, 2017, Integra issued a notice to the appellant advising her that her request for 24-hour care was denied, and that her care would remain at 56 hours per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Relevant here, the Commissioner's Designee determined after the hearing that the assessment and the limited authorization of service constituted an action that gave the Commissioner jurisdiction to review the matter. Specifically, the decision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   At issue is the Plan's determination based on its nurse's assessment of April 6, 2017 to grant the Appellant, age 97, a [personal care services] authorization in the amount of 56 hours per week (8 hours per day, 7 days per week), even though Appellant's representative had sought and requested a 24-hour live-in [personal care services] authorization for the Appellant.... The Plan's nurse assessment and Tasking Tool of April 6, 2017, as well as the Plan's internal email communication of April 7, 2017, submitted at the hearing, indicate that the Plan was then on notice that Appellant's representative was seeking a 24-hour live-in PCS authorization from the Plan, yet the Plan approved only 56-hour weekly PCS authorization effective May 1, 2017; i.e. the date of Appellant's enrollment in the Plan. In accordance with the applicable\n   Regulations set forth above, the Plan's limited authorization of service constitutes an \"action\" and the Commissioner has jurisdiction to review same as well as the adequacy of the Plan's service authorization. The fact that the Plan has not issued an official written determination regarding such authorization at the time of the fair hearing request does not bar the Commissioner from reviewing same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. The Commissioner's Designee determined that Integra took an adverse action by authorizing fewer hours than previously provided by GuildNet, and sought by the appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In the same way, Guadagna suffered injury when AgeWell authorized him for less care than he received from GuildNet, and was not provided with notice of a right to a fair hearing. Therefore, Guadagna had standing to bring his claims at the time he commenced this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    b. As to Whether the Plaintiffs' Claims Are Moot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Defendant contends that all of the Plaintiffs' claims are moot, because the Commissioner has already provided all of the relief that they seek. Specifically, the Commissioner states that since the letters and Transition Policy force MLTCPs to accept enrollees at their previous levels of care when another MLTCP closes, the Plaintiffs' claims are moot. On the other hand, the Plaintiffs argue that the DOH has not eliminated the harm because the Transition Policy does not state that MLTCPs accepting enrollees from closing MLTCPs must provide notice of a right to a fair hearing when they assess and authorize them for a lower standard of care; the Plaintiffs' claims are capable of repetition yet evading review, and inherently transitory; and that the Defendant has not met its burden in mooting the case due to voluntary cessation. The Court finds that although the named Plaintiffs' claims have been mooted, the nature of claims such as Guadagna's are inherently transitory, and therefore the putative class action claims survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Standing and mootness are interrelated concepts, but are not to be confused.

That is, the Defendant's conduct which serves as a basis for this lawsuit has ceased. By mandating that receiving MLTCPs accept enrollees at their previous levels of care, the DOH has ensured that the Plaintiffs and those similarly situated continue to receive their care at the levels previously provided by GuildNet. Furthermore, contrary to the Plaintiffs' contentions, the Transition Policy also ensures that anyone who is forced off of one MLTCP to another due to closure will receive notice of a right to a fair hearing if they are assessed to require less care. Since the enrollees will receive their previous levels of care by the receiving MLTCPs before they are reassessed, any assessment finding that the enrollee requires less care would have to be accompanied by notice of a right to a fair hearing with aid continuing. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(3)-(4) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20431.206\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 431.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)-(c), 431.210, 431.211, 438.210(c)-(d), 438.400, 438.404. As the MLTCPs are already bound by statute and regulation to provide notice to enrollees when they take action, the Transition Policy did not need to reiterate it. Therefore, the Commissioner has provided the relief sought by the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Second, the Court finds that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur. The DOH issued the Transition Policy in response to CMS' amending of 42 C.F.R. 438.62. Relevant here, the amendment requires states to have \"a transition of care policy to ensure continued access to services during a transition from [one Medicaid provider to another] when an enrollee, in the absence of continued services, would suffer serious detriment to their health or be at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20438.62\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The transition of care must provide,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"[t]he enrollee has access to services consistent with the access they previously had, and is permitted to retain their current provider for a period of time ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20438.62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 438.62(b)(1)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   While the Plaintiffs are correct that the Defendant's Transition Policy was not issued pursuant to notice and comment, they are incorrect that the DOH could change its policy in the future. This is because the Transition Policy is the state's answer to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20438.62\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   issued pursuant to notice and comment. If the DOH changed its policy in the future, it would\n   not be in compliance with the federal regulation requiring such a transition policy. Therefore, as the Code of Federal Regulations requires that states ensure that enrollees are permitted to receive their previous levels of care when they transition between Medicaid providers, the Court finds that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"Defendants have shown that there is no reasonable expectation that the old time policy will recur.

Therefore, the Plaintiffs' proposed class cannot be certified under its current definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   While the Court in its discretion could certify a more narrow class, such as one that includes those individuals who switched plans and received a lower standard of care without notice of a right to a fair hearing with aid continuing, the Plaintiffs stated in their memorandum in opposition to the Defendants' motion to dismiss that they had not yet received any information regarding those individuals.

Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 18 (\"DOH has provided no evidence whatsoever about the status of the care of putative class members who switched from GuildNet to a new MLTCP as Mr. Guadagna did.\") ). Therefore, at this juncture, the Court does not have any information as to how many individuals switched from GuildNet to a new MLTCP and received less care without notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   While the Plaintiffs need not provide an exact number of individuals to meet the numerosity requirement, they must at least present some evidence of, or reasonably estimate, the number of class members.\n   <em>\n    Robidoux v.

As their motion dealt solely with a class of individuals who had been previously been served by GuildNet, they did not provide any evidence as to the number of individuals who received less care upon switching to a new MLTCP. Although the Second Circuit has held that a prospective class of forty or more raises the presumption of numerosity,\n   <em>\n    Consol. Rail Corp. v.

In light of the Court's decision, the Plaintiffs should address the size of any class encompassing persons who switched from GuildNet to a new MLTCP, and received less care without notice of a right to fair hearing with aid continuing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

It is granted to the extent that Samele and Roher's claims are dismissed because they do not have standing. It is denied to the extent that the inherently transitory exception applies to claims such as Guadagna's, and his claims are preserved for the purposes of the putative class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In addition, the Plaintiffs' motion for class certification pursuant to Rule 23 is denied without prejudice with leave to renew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to terminate Samele and Roher from the action.
