Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 7; Code \u00a7 22.1-28. Code \u00a7 22.1-295 provides: \u201cThe teachers in the public schools of a school division shall be employed and placed in appropriate schools by the school board upon recommendation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>division superintendent.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-297 gives a division superintendent authority to assign all teachers to their respective positions in the school wherein they have been placed by the school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In Article 3 of Chapter 15 of Title 22.1 of the Code, the General Assembly has provided a method for resolving disputes relating to the work of teachers. Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-306 to -314. The Virginia Board of Education, in its \u201cProcedure For Adjusting Grievances,\u201d has established a process, mainly tracking the statutes, \u201cfor resolving disputes concerning application of local school board policies, rules, and regulations as they affect the work of employees.\u201d Generally, the State Board procedure sets out a four-step process in which a teacher may submit a dispute successively to the teacher\u2019s immediate supervisor, the principal, the division superintendent, and a fact-finding panel. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-308 to -312.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The statutory scheme allows the school board initially to decide, either at the request of the division superintendent or the grievant, whether a matter \u201cis grievable.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-314. That decision may be appealed to the circuit court having jurisdiction in the school division. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, the narrow question is whether the court below erred in deciding that the matters complained of are \u201cgrievable.\u201d If the trial court was correct, the remaining steps of the grievance procedure may be utilized to decide the merits of the matters at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">During the 1991-92 school year, appellees Virginia Epperson and Anne Marie Boelt were employed by the York County School Board and assigned as elementary school teachers at Magruder School. In April 1992, each teacher was notified in writing by the School Board that her assignment for the next school year \u201cwill be other than Magruder Elementary School.\u201d The letter stated that the reassignments were being made \u201cto optimize the instructional program throughout the School Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In May 1992, each teacher, using a form prescribed by the State Board\u2019s procedure, filed a \u201cStatement of Grievance,\u201d signed by each teacher and their attorney. In the blank space labelled \u201cSpecific relief requested,\u201d each teacher stated that she wishes \u201cto remain at Magruder School\u201d in her \u201ccurrent capacity\u201d and desires the School Board to follow certain of its policies \u201cas found in the policy manual.\u201d Subsequently, the teachers completed the first steps of the grievance procedure by meeting with the Magruder principal, who decided that he lacked the authority to grant the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Proceeding to the next step in the process, the teachers scheduled meetings with the division superintendent. Prior to the date set for those meetings, at the request of the superintendent\u2019s designee, each teacher filed a written statement amplifying the nature of the grievance. The identical statements were attached to and became a part of the grievances, and the designee filed a statement saying \u201cI have received and understand the explanation of the grievances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Before either teacher met with the superintendent, he elected to place the issue of grievability before the School Board. Upon consideration of a memorandum from the teachers\u2019 attorney and oral argument at a hearing, the School Board decided by a vote of four to one that the matters were not \u201cgrievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The teachers appealed this ruling to the circuit court which, after a combined hearing on the issue of \u201cgrievability,\u201d ruled that the teachers \u201chave stated grievable matters\u201d because the teachers allege \u201cthat the School Board failed to apply applicable rules, regulations, policies and procedures as written and established by the School Board.\u201d The trial court thus reversed the School Board and remanded the matters with direction that the School Board allow the teachers \u201cto process their grievances as to each issue raised.\u201d We awarded the School Board an appeal from the trial court\u2019s September 1992 judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The focus of this appeal is upon Code \u00a7 22.1-306, which contains the definition of \u201cGrievance.\u201d In subparagraph (1), the statute provides that \u201c \u2018Grievance\u2019 means a complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to his or her employment including, but not necessarily limited to\u201d certain enumerated matters such as disciplinary action including dismissal or placement on probation, acts of reprisal against a teacher for filing or processing a grievance, and complaints of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Following this enumeration, the statute specifies: \u201cEach school board shall have the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of the school division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Continuing, subparagraph (1) provides that the term \u201cgrievance\u201d shall not include teachers\u2019 complaints or disputes relating to certain other enumerated matters such as establishment of wages, suspension or nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who has not achieved continuing contract status, discharge because of decrease in enrollment, suspension from duties in emergencies, and, important to the present case, \u2018 \u2018hiring, transfer, assignment and retention of teachers within the school division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The subparagraph concludes with this sentence: \u201cWhile these management rights are reserved to the school board, failure to apply, where applicable, the rules, regulations, policies, or procedures as written or established by the school board is grievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">On appeal, the teachers point out that the \u2018 \u2018scope of review of the issue of grievability is to determine if grievants have alleged matters which, if proved, would be within the definition of a grievance, and not whether, for purposes of such review, the School Board agrees or disagrees with the substance of the grievances.\u201d Continuing, the teachers contend that they provided \u201cadequate information\u201d under the State Board procedure \u201cto constitute proper filing of grievances\u201d under Code \u00a7 22.1-306 because they have described the event complained of, given a concise description of the School Board regulations upon which the claims are based, and specified what they seek through use of the grievance procedure. All of this, coupled with the statement by the superintendent\u2019s designee that she understood the teachers\u2019 explanation of their grievances, the teachers contend, demonstrates that the trial court correctly ruled in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">These contentions require an examination of the identical statements of grievance. The adequacy of the documentation must be measured against the standards recently established in <em>Tazewell County School Board </em>v. <em>Gillenwater, </em>241 Va. 166, 400 S.E.2d 199 (1991), in which, on similar facts, we held that a teacher\u2019s complaint did not constitute a \u201cgrievance\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 22.1-306 when, as here, the teacher asserted that the school board had failed to apply a particular rule, regulation, policy, or procedure in effecting the teacher\u2019s involuntary transfer. In that case, we said that the teacher\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not contain any facts from which the trial court could have inferred that the School Board failed to comply with this regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 400 S.E.2d at 201. As we shall demonstrate, close scrutiny of the documentation in the present case reveals that the matters asserted are not \u201cgrievable\u201d under the <em>Gillenwater </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">On their \u201cStatement of Grievance\u201d forms, each teacher asserted: \u201cI have been involuntarily transferred from Magruder because of reduction of staff.\u201d Each alleged that the principal and division superintendent had \u201cpublicly stated that the reason for the transfer is reduction of staff <em>at Magruder. </em>Reduction of staff has specific guidelines as stated in policies listed above. I further feel that because I exercised the \u2018open door\u2019 policy, I am being unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>treated\u201d (emphasis added). The policies were \u201clisted above\u201d in the following fashion: \u201c7.2.23; 7.2.23R; 7.2.28, 1st Amendment-Freedom of Speech, 7.1.7-R.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In their written statements amplifying the \u201cStatement of Grievance,\u201d the teachers repeated most of the assertions contained on the forms but focused on specific parts of the School Board\u2019s policies, as set forth in its Policy Manual, that were \u201cbeing grieved.\u201d First, referring to policy No. 7.2.23, each teacher said it \u201callows legitimate assignments in accordance with the needs of the school system. The proposed transfer does not meet that standard.\u201d Policy No. 7.2.23 provides: \u201cEach employee will be assigned or transferred by the Superintendent in accordance with the needs of the school system.\u201d But, paraphrasing <em>Gillenwater, </em>the teachers\u2019 statements do not contain any facts from which it can be inferred that the School Board failed to comply with this regulation. Conclusory statements, such as \u201cthe proposed transfer does not meet that standard,\u201d will not suffice. In addition, complaints about the school authorities\u2019 determination regarding the needs of the school system are clearly outside the power of a teacher to raise in the context of a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Second, referring to policy No. 7.2.23-R labelled \u201cCertificated Staff Procedures For Assignment And Transfer,\u201d the teachers focused on subparagraph 111(2). Noting that the subparagraph deals with \u201cInvoluntary Transfers - Between Different Schools,\u201d they say it applies \u201cfor reduction in number of staff,\u201d stating \u201cI was not given preference based on my length of service and qualifications.\u201d Subparagraph 111(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cWhen overstaffing occurs and a reduction in the number of staff members is necessary, members of the overstaffed school will be given preference over all requests for transfers. In effecting such transfers, preference will be given to presently employed staff members and such preference will be based on length of service and qualification for the position. (See policy 7.2.28 - Reductions in Staff)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">That policy does not apply to these teachers. It applies only when there is a system-wide reduction in the number of teachers, thereby threatening teachers with layoffs, not when the number of teachers at one school is to be reduced. When \u201ca reduction in the number of staff members is necessary\u201d because of \u201coverstaffing,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>then \u201cpreference\u201d will be afforded to \u201cpresently employed staff members\u201d when transfers are effected. This is a promise that teachers selected for transfer from an overstaffed school will be given \u201cpreference\u201d over teachers that are newly employed in the system when there are vacancies elsewhere in the school system. In other words, as the School Board argues, <em>\u201call </em>presently employed teachers will be preferred for open positions over otherwise qualified applicants who are seeking first-time employment with the school division.\u201d Clearly, neither teacher has alleged she is in that situation. They simply are being relocated, not laid off. Thus, the question of \u201cpreference\u201d over new applicants is not an issue, according to the teachers\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Third, referring to policy No. 7.2.28, which is entitled \u201cCertificated Staff Reductions In Force,\u201d the teachers say it \u201csets forth a seniority based system for RIF\u2019s.\u201d They state, \u201cThe policy was not complied with.\u201d Again, paraphrasing <em>Gillenwater, </em>the conclusory statement does not contain any facts from which it can be inferred that the School Board failed to comply with this regulation. In addition, the plain language of the policy deals with a reduction in \u201cthe professional staff,\u201d a clear reference to a division-wide curtailment of the total number of teachers employed by the School Board. Rather than implicating this policy in their statements of grievance, the teachers have demonstrated that the policy has no application to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Finally, referring to policy No. 7.1.7-R, labelled \u201cOpen Door Policy,\u201d each teacher stated, \u201cI further feel that because I exercised the \u2018open door\u2019 policy, I am being unreasonably treated.\u201d Elaborating, each teacher said, \u201cI participated in meetings pursuant to 7.1.7-R, wherein the subject matter was the administration of Magruder. I believe I am being punished for this participation. Evidence will be presented in the grievance to substantiate this.\u201d Continuing, each teacher declared, \u201cMy grievance statement as to the first amendment is related to the above paragraph, as to being penalized for my exercise of a constitutional right to speak on matters at Magruder. Elementary School, to my supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Generally, the School Board\u2019s \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d permits direct communications between School Board employees and persons other than their immediate supervisor. Stating that employees ordinarily communicate directly with their immediate supervisors, the policy establishes \u201cprocedures to be followed in the unusual instance when a School Board employee b\u00e9lieves sufficient cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>exists to address an issue ... to a person in the administrative organization higher than their immediate supervisor.\u201d Among the procedures set forth, the policy states: \u2018 \u2018No School Board employee has the authority <em>... to penalize </em>a subordinate for using this channel of communication\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The teachers observe that the School Board should \u201cbe accountable for complying with its own voluntarily enacted policies.\u201d They argue that their exercise of the right to speak freely with their employer, \u201cas created and encouraged by the employer with a promise of non-retaliation for such speech, and the allegation of the taking of retaliatory action by the employer afterwards, does state for the purposes of a grievance, a grievable matter.\u201d We do not agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The complaint of an alleged violation of this policy, including the supposed constitutional deprivation, suffers from the same <em>Gillenwater </em>inadequacy as the foregoing complaints \u2014 conclusory statements that do not contain facts from which it can be inferred that the School Board failed to comply with its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">More importantly, however, the claimed violation of this policy suffers from another, fatal flaw. The teachers are attempting to convert simple transfers into an alleged effort by the School Board, in the words of the policy, \u201cto penalize\u201d them for exercising the \u201cOpen Door\u201d privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">But nowhere in the policy is there any provision that recognizes as punitive action the mere involuntary transfer of a teacher. Given the unambiguous legislative mandate of Code \u00a7 22.1-306(1) that each school board \u201cshall have the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of the school division,\u201d the School Board policy relied upon must unambiguously allow an involuntary transfer to be transformed into punitive action amounting to a \u201cpenalty\u201d that is \u201cgrievable.\u201d There is no such statement, unambiguous or otherwise, in the \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy recognizing involuntary transfers as penalties. Hence, a transfer is not \u201cgrievable\u201d as a violation of this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling that the teachers\u2019 assertions are \u201cgrievable\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 22.1-306. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the proceedings will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
