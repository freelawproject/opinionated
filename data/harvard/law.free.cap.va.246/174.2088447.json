We also granted the cross-error assigned by the Commonwealth in order to address the question whether this Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate that assignment. Because we decide both questions in the negative, we do not reach the subsidiary issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Joseph H. Campbell, a judge of the General District Court of the City of Norfolk, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk of a violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-152.14 and 18.2-168. The indictment charged that Campbell did \u201cforge or cause to be forged certain public records in that he directed that the true name \u2018Paul A. Sciortino\u2019 which appeared in computer data relating to . . . [a traffic ticket] be altered to the false name \u2018Anthony P. Schortinoe\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">The evidence adduced at trial is detailed in the record before us and, under familiar principles, we will review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On March 20, 1989, Paul A. Sciortino, then Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for the City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Virginia Beach, was charged with making an improper turn that resulted in a minor traffic accident. Sciortino was earlier involved in a traffic accident that had exposed him to adverse publicity and cost the City of Virginia Beach more than $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Pursuant to a longstanding policy of the General District Court, Sciortino and his attorney, Andrew Ege, met with Campbell in his chambers to plead guilty to the ticket. During the meeting, Ege, in a \u201clighthearted manner\u201d, asked Campbell if the court could \u201cjust dismiss it.\u201d Campbell informed Ege and Sciortino that \u201cthe usual disposition on a plea of guilty is $60 fine and thirty suspended and traffic school.\u201d Sciortino and Ege agreed that this was acceptable and Sciortino paid the fine. Ege then asked if Sciortino\u2019s name had to \u201cappear on the docket\u201d. Campbell said that the <em>case </em>had to appear on the docket. Next, Ege asked, \u2018 \u2018if his name is misspelled you don\u2019t have to correct it, do you?\u201d Campbell responded that \u201cthere are a lot of clerical errors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">After Sciortino left, Campbell approached Kathleen Baker, a deputy clerk, and asked her to display Sciortino\u2019s record on the computer. This computer was utilized to create a daily docket record for the General District Court. Sciortino was engaged in a political campaign for reelection, and Campbell told Mrs. Baker that Sciortino was \u201cscared to death about this accident because Paul thinks that the newspaper is going to crucify him again, and they probably will.\u201d Campbell then asked Mrs. Baker to \u201cscramble or jumble\u201d the letters of Sciortino\u2019s last name on the computer screen. Mrs. Baker changed the spelling from \u201cSciortino\u201d to \u201cSchortinoe\u201d and asked Campbell, \u201cHow is that?\u201d Campbell then asked her to switch the middle and the first name from \u201cPaul A.\u201d to \u201cAnthony P.\u201d. As he walked away from the computer, Campbell told everyone to \u201cget back to work\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The jury fixed Campbell\u2019s punishment at three years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Campbell moved to set aside the verdict on the ground that the Commonwealth had produced no evidence of harm or prejudice to another\u2019s rights. The trial court ruled that conviction of forgery of public records did not require such proof, denied the motion, and imposed the sentence fixed by the jury with the balance of the term of imprisonment to be suspended after six months\u2019 confinement in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Assigning error to that ruling and to other incidents at trial, Campbell appealed to the Court of Appeals. In an opinion issued September 10, 1991, a panel of the Court of Appeals examined the statutory scheme of forgery and, affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">As the forgery of a public record is specifically listed as a writing or document which serves as a predicate to the offense of forgery, as codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-168, it need not be considered under the catch-all provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-172 which addresses \u201cother writings.\u201d The words \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d are only employed in cases involving writings other than those specifically listed as predicates to the offense of forgery. In the context of \u201cother writings,\u201d the words \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s rights\u201d serve to distinguish \u201cbetween those writings which might affect the rights of others whereof forgery might be committed, and other writings, by which, whether false or genuine, the pecuniary interests of others could not be affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 33, 40, 409 S.E.2d 21, 25 (1991) (citation omitted). Applying Rule 5A:18, the panel further held that it could not consider Campbell\u2019s challenge to the intent-to-defraud instruction granted by the trial court because he had not properly preserved the issue at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 409 S.E.2d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Granting Campbell\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>enbanc, </em>the Court of Appeals limited the rehearing to the question whether the panel should have applied the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A.18. <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 988, 421 S.E.2d 652 (1992) . In the August 11, 1992 opinion, the Court of Appeals decided that question in the affirmative but left \u201cunchanged the panel\u2019s disposition of other issues originally raised on appeal\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 990, 421 S.E.2d at 653. The <em>en banc </em>court reversed Campbell\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. Campbell appeals so much of that decision as upholds the rulings of the panel and the trial court that harm or prejudice to the right of another is not ah element of forgery of public records. The Commonwealth assigns error to the <em>en banc </em>ruling underlying the decision to reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>I. FORGERY OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Code \u00a7 18.2-168, entitled Forging public records, etc., provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">[i]f any person forge a public record, or certificate, return, or attestation, of any public officer or public employee, in relation to any matter wherein such certificate, return, or attestation may be received as legal proof, or utter, or attempt to employ as true, such forged record, certificate, return, or attestation, knowing the same to be forged, he shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">This statute controls our determination of the case; however, the first inquiry we make in our interpretation of this statute concerns the posture of English common law. Code \u00a7 1-10 provides that \u201c[t]he common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Campbell argues that by \u201cutilizing the common-law term \u2018forge,\u2019 Code \u00a7 18.2-168 necessarily invokes the common law\u201d and that one of the elements of the crime of forgery at common law was \u201ctangible harm or prejudice to the rights of another\u201d, irrespective of whether the writing involved was a private paper or a public record. While we agree that forgery of both public records and private papers was a common-law crime in England, we do not agree with Campbell\u2019s interpretation of the elements of those crimes at common law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u201cOf Forgery there are two kinds; First, by common law. Secondly, by the Statute. Sect. 1. Forgery by the common law seemeth to be an offence in falsely and fraudulently making or altering any matter of record; or any other authentic matter of a public nature . . . .\u201d 1 William Hawkins, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>263 n. 1 (London, 8th ed. 1824).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u201c[A]t Common Law the Counterfeiting a Matter of Record is Forgery; for since the Law gives the highest Credit to all Records, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>cannot but be of the utmost ill Consequence to the Publik to have them either forged or falsified.\u201d 2 Matthew Bacon, <em>Abridgment </em>*568 (1786). The common-law crime of forgery of public records, a capital offense in England, was augmented by statutes punishing the lesser offense of forgery of certain private documents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em>An Act Concerning Counterfeit Letters or Privy Tokens to Receive Money or Goods in Others Men\u2019s Names, 1541-42, 33 Hen. VIII, ch. 1 (Eng.). Unlike the crime of forgery of public records in which \u201cill Consequence to the Publik\u201d was conclusively presumed, and unlike the common-law crime of forgery of private papers in which proof of <em>potential </em>harm or prejudice to another was required, conviction of the several statutory offenses generally required proof of <em>actual </em>harm or prejudice to the rights of another person. <em>See </em>1 Hawkins at 263 n. 1; 2 Bacon at *568.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The question whether proof of harm or prejudice was essential to conviction of forgery of public documents, as well as conviction of the crime of forgery of private writings and the distinctions between the common-law crimes and the statutory offenses were considered in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Ward, 92 </em>Eng. Rep. 451 (K.B. 1727). There, Ward was convicted of a charge of \u201cfalsely making and forging a writing upon the back of a certificate in writing\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 452. On appeal, Ward contended that forgery was an offense at common law only if the writing was a public document and that the writing in issue was a private paper. Ward also maintained that the statutes creating the crime of forgery of such a paper required proof of actual harm or prejudice and that, absent such proof against him, he was wrongfully convicted of forgery. The King maintained that forgery of private papers was not a crime at common law; that \u2018 \u2018if such counterfeit letters had been at common law punishable as forgery, the making [of] that statute was unnecessary and useless\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 453; and that the proof of harm or prejudice resulting from Ward\u2019s acts was sufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Resolving these conflicting views, the court in <em>Ward </em>concluded that forgery of private writings, as well as forgery of public records, was an offense at common law; that proof of the potential for harm or prejudice to another was an element of the former but not of the latter; that the writing in issue was a public document; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and that the conviction should be upheld, irrespective of proof of harm or prejudice to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Most commentators have understood the <em>Ward </em>decision to establish that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">at common law it was forgery to make false <em>private </em>writings, as a bill of sale, bill of lading, an acquittance, a warrant of attorney, a bill of exchange. And <em>[Ward] </em>made this distinction between forgery at common law, and cheats by means of false tokens, under the stat. 33 Hen. 8. c. 1. that by the statute it was necessary the party should receive an actual prejudice, which was not necessary in forgery; in the latter case, it was sufficient if the party <em>might </em>be prejudiced by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">1 William Hawkins, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>263 n. 1 (London, 8th ed. 1824) (emphasis added); <em>accord 2 </em>William Russell, <em>On Crimes </em>348-49 (Philadelphia, 4th ed. 1841); 3 Chitty\u2019s, <em>Criminal Law </em>449-50 (Philadelphia, 1819); 2 Edward East\u2019s, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>859-60 (Philadelphia, 1806); 2 Matthew Bacon, <em>Abridgment </em>*568 (1786).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Applying the rules reconciled and the principles established in <em>Ward </em>and summarized by contemporary commentators, we hold that actual harm or prejudice to the rights of another was not an element of the crime of forgery of public records at English common law and that, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 1-10 and -11, this became the law of this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Even so, Campbell contends that the posture of the English common law in 1776 has been altered by the General Assembly. Specifically, he maintains that \u201cthe history of \u00a7 18.2-168 and its statutory predecessors makes clear that harm or prejudice is an element of forgery of public records.\u201d The Code of 1819, he says, \u201cbelies the Commonwealth\u2019s argument . . . that \u2018prejudice\u2019 has somehow been <em>statutorily </em>excised from the elements of the crime of public records forgery.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The Code of 1819 defines the crime of forgery for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>any land warrant. . .; any paper bill of credit. . .; any certificate, manifest or receipt of any public inspector of flour, hemp, tobacco, or other thing; any loan office certificate; certificate of. . . stock . . .; or any record of any court, or public office, or of any body politic or corporate; or any will, testament or codicil; any deed, bond, writing or note; any bill of exchange, draft or order; any assignment, transfer or endorsement; any defeasance, acquittance or receipt; or any letter of credit, or other writing, to the prejudice of another\u2019s right ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Va. Code ch. 154, \u00a7 4 (1819).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Construing this language, the Attorney General asserts that \u201c[t]he descriptive phrase \u2018to the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u2019 appears only in relation to \u2018other writings.\u2019 \u201d Campbell believes that \u201c[t]he better reading of the 1819 act... is that in <em>each </em>of its list of objects, forgery requires proof of the element of prejudice, just as forgery of the \u2018other writings\u2019 in the residual category <em>also </em>requires proof of prejudice\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We agree with the Attorney General\u2019s construction. We think that the purpose of the 1819 Act was to codify the English common law and to preserve its distinctions between forgery of public records and forgery of private documents. In our view, the language \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d modifies only writings other than those specifically listed by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Campbell\u2019s reading of the language ignores both English common law and this Court\u2019s decisions construing that language. In <em>Murry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>32 Va. (5 Leigh) 720 (1835), this Court faced the issue whether the Code of 1819 required an allegation of actual prejudice of another\u2019s right in an indictment charging forgery of a bank note. We concluded that those words</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">relate, not to the different writings particularly mentioned in the previous part of the section, the counterfeiting of most of which had, long before, been made [a] felony; but only to the words immediately connected with them; \u201cany <em>other writing, </em>to the prejudice of another\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 723 (emphasis in original); <em>accord Powell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 822, 824-25 (1854); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, 4 </em>Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 476, 478 (1825).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Our interpretation of the 1819 statute is reinforced by the content and structure of the forgery sections contained in the Code of 1849. In its revision of the 1819 Code, the General Assembly divided the old statute into six sections. One dealt with public documents generally, one with keeping an instrument to forge the seal of court, one with forgery of official currency, one with the forgery of stamps, and one with forgery of bank notes. Section five alone dealt with forgery of private papers, and only that section required proof of \u201cprejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">For more than a century, the statutory scheme framed in the Code of 1849 has remained essentially unchanged in form and substance. In every revision made by the General Assembly, \u201cprejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d or equivalent language has been written into only those sections of the forgery statutes defining forgery of private writings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In no revision has any such language been included in those sections defining forgery of public records.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Construing the seven sections of the current forgery article literally and strictly, we find that the article emphasizes legislative intent to continue that policy. Code \u00a7 18.2-172 provides that \u201c[i]f any person forge any writing, other than such as is mentioned in \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-168 [public documents] and 18.2-170 [currency], to the prejudice of another\u2019s right ... he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Unwilling to acknowledge the design and import of the statutes, Campbell invokes a decision of this Court which he says has \u201cfor the first (and only) time,\u201d decided that \u201cprejudice to the rights of another is an element of forgery of public records.\u201d He cites <em>Coleman </em>v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 865 (1874). There, the trial court, which had refused one of the defendant\u2019s instructions containing that element, added it to another instruction. The principal question- on appeal was whether a warrant book was a public record as defined in other instructions. This Court held that \u2018 \u2018there was no error in giving and refusing the instructions set forth in the first bill of exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 885. It is true that the opinion commented that the instructions under consideration \u201cdeclare in what consists the forgery of a public record\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 880. However, while this Court held that the harm-or-prejudice issue was preserved at trial, nothing in the opinion suggests that it was raised on appeal by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">To give the decision in <em>Coleman </em>the interpretation Campbell urges is to assume that this Court ignored the scheme of the Code current at that time and that of all its predecessors, the opinions of this Court in <em>Murry, Powell, </em>and <em>Linton </em>cited above construing the Code of 1819, and the common law of England as pronounced in <em>Ward. </em>We make no such assumption, and to the extent <em>Coleman </em>fairly may be subject to the interpretation Campbell urges, that decision is expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We agree with the ruling of the panel of the Court of Appeals affirming the ruling of the trial court that harm or prejudice to the right of another person has never been and is not now an element of the crime of forgery of public records in this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>upheld those rulings; to that extent, we will affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>II. CROSS-ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">As we have said, our order granting the cross-error assigned by the Commonwealth in Campbell\u2019s appeal was conditioned upon our instruction that the parties address the question whether this Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate that assignment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In support of the affirmative, the Attorney General argues on brief that \u201c[w]hen a criminal defendant appeals to this Court, he brings the entire judgment of the Court of Appeals before this Court for review, and there is no valid constitutional or statutory prohibition to assignment of cross-error by the Commonwealth.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The source of the original and appellate jurisdiction of the courts of this Commonwealth is Article VI, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution of Virginia. The Constitution provides that \u201cthe Supreme Court shall, by virtue of this Constitution, have appellate jurisdiction ... in cases involving the life or liberty of any person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Constitution grants the General Assembly provisional authority to determine appellate jurisdiction of Commonwealth appeals in particular criminal cases. Thus, \u201can appeal by the Commonwealth may be allowed in any case involving the violation of a law relating to the State revenue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under amendment ratified in the general election on November 4, 1986,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">[t]he General Assembly may also allow the Commonwealth a right of appeal [from certain pre-trial orders] in felony cases . . . [provided the appeal is pursued] before a jury is impaneled and sworn ... or, in cases tried without a jury, before the court begins to hear or receive evidence or the first witness is sworn ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">However, the Constitution expressly mandates that \u201c[n]o appeal shall be allowed to the Commonwealth in a case involving the life or liberty of a person\u201d. <em>Id. </em>That provision, first included as section 8 of the Bill of Rights and, later, as section 88 of the 1902 Constitution of Virginia, was designed \u201cto insure that in a criminal prosection, where a man\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charge made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>against him is at issue, he may not \u2018be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Godwin, </em>188 Va. 753, 763-64, 51 S.E.2d 230, 235, <em>cert. denied, </em>337 U.S. 946 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The final sentence in Article VI, \u00a7 1, vests the legislature with further power to determine the original and appellate jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth, but only \u201c[sjubject to the foregoing limitations\u201d. The General Assembly has exercised that power but, always, strictly in accord with specific constitutional constraints. For example, Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.08 and 19.2-317 grant the Commonwealth an appeal in a criminal case \u201crelating to the state revenue\u201d; Code \u00a7 19.2-398 grants the Commonwealth the right in felony cases to appeal those pre-trial rulings expressly identified in Article VI, \u00a7 1. Significantly, no statute other than Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.08 and 19.2-317 presumes to allow the Commonwealth an appeal from a conviction in \u201ca case involving the life or liberty of a person\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The case at bar is such a case. Campbell was convicted of a criminal offense. Confirming the penalty fixed by the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court sentenced him to confinement for three years in the penitentiary, the balance of the term to be suspended after he had served six months confinement in jail. In support of his assignment of cross-error,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Attorney General, posing a question wholly distinct from the issue raised in this appeal, contends that the Virginia Court of Appeals erred in reversing Campbell\u2019s conviction and that \u201cthe judgment of the circuit court should be affirmed. \u201c</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As the Attorney General observes, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution does not bar reprosecution following reversal of conviction on appeal. <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 189 (1957). Yet, if we were to consider and uphold the Attorney General\u2019s assignment of cross-error, Campbell would lose the opportunity for acquittal in the new trial afforded him by the <em>en banc </em>judgment of the Court of Appeals.

The answer to this question is straightforward and plain. The Constitution and statutes are the source of this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. There is nothing in either which creates appellate jurisdiction of this type in this Court. Consequently, this Court does not have the jurisdiction to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the cross-error asserted by the Commonwealth.
