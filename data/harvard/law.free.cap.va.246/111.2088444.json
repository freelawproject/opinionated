(the corporation) was duly incorporated in accordance with Virginia law. Guy R. O\u2019Hazza was the president of the corporation. Guy O\u2019Hazza\u2019s parents, Francis E. and Susie W. O\u2019Hazza (the O\u2019Hazzas), were the vice president and secretary-treasurer, respectively, and the sole stockholders. The O\u2019Hazzas provided the initial capitalization for the corporation by contributing $10,000. The corporation issued a stock certificate to the O\u2019Hazzas, jointly, for fifty shares of stock in the corporation. The corporation made a subchapter S election for federal income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The corporation operated from 1987 to 1989 and engaged in the business of installing sound equipment in commercial establishments. Guy O\u2019Hazza conducted the day-to-day affairs of the business and received $4,500 a month, taken as a corporate loan in lieu of salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The corporation\u2019s tax returns and financial statements prepared by its accountants showed that the O\u2019Hazzas lent the corporation approximately $64,000 in 1988 and $75,000 in 1989. The 1989 amount included a $20,000 loan and a $50,000 line of credit for the corporation with Burke and Herbert Bank, which the O\u2019Hazzas arranged, personally guaranteed, and repaid. There were no corporate documents that authorized or memorialized these debts and the O\u2019Hazzas testified that they had no expectation of repayment by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Patrick J. Hughes, president of Executive Credit Corporation (ECC), met Guy O\u2019Hazza in early 1988. ECC was in the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>leasing equipment that it brokered to others or retained in its own accounts. Hughes testified that ECC was involved in approximately 10 business deals with Sounds You See, Inc., prior to the project that gave rise to the loan at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In October 1988, Guy approached Hughes regarding a project to install a sound system in the Hilton Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland. Guy told Hughes about the corporation\u2019s financial status and its cash flow problems and indicated that he would need an \u201carrangement\u201d with Hughes in order to do the hotel project. Under the \u201carrangement,\u201d Hughes would advance the money to the corporation for the purchase of the equipment to be installed. After installation, the ownership of the equipment would be transferred to ECC and it would lease the equipment to the hotel for a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">After meeting with the general manager of the hotel about the project and receiving assurances that the hotel was \u201cdefinitely going to go ahead with some sort of sound and lighting and video system,\u201d Hughes agreed to advance Guy funds for the equipment purchase. Hughes understood that, if the deal with the hotel did not go through, the equipment would be used for \u201cany one of a number of other proposed jobs, and that [Hughes] would secure a lease with whoever that company was and then get [his] money back.\u201d Hughes also testified that, based on Guy\u2019s representations and statements the O\u2019Hazzas made before the hotel project arose, he believed that the O\u2019Hazzas would \u201cstand behind these deals.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">ECC advanced the money in three installments: $15,990 on December 12, 1988; $9,450 on January 31, 1989; and $10,000 on February 7, 1989. A December 14, 1988, invoice from Sounds You See, Inc., indicates that it purchased equipment for the hotel project and billed it to ECC. That invoice, totalling $15,990 for equipment and labor, was marked \u201cPaid in Full.\u201d On February 7, at Hughes\u2019s insistence, Guy executed a promissory note for $35,000 payable on demand to ECC.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Hughes drafted the lease documents for the hotel\u2019s signature, but learned in March 1989 that the management of the hotel had refused to approve the installation and lease of the equipment. Consequently, the transaction was never consummated. After repaying $1,000 of the loan, Guy informed Hughes that he did not intend to pay the remainder of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ECC filed suit to recover the remaining unpaid balance of the loan, naming Sounds You See, Inc. and its sole shareholders, Francis E. and Susie W. O\u2019Hazza, as defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the trial court held that Sounds You See, Inc. was a sham corporation, the instrumentality and alter ego of its shareholders, the O\u2019Hazzas, \u201cemployed for the sole purpose of transferring funds to their son.\u201d Based on this holding, the trial court disregarded the corporate entity and entered judgment against the O\u2019Hazzas for $34,000. We awarded them an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The independent legal existence of a corporation is a basic component of corporate law and of the economic policy it supports. <em>Cheatle </em>v. <em>Rudd\u2019s Swimming Pool Supply Co., </em>234 Va. 207, 360 S.E.2d 828 (1987). Ignoring the separate existence of a corporation and imposing personal liability on shareholders for debts of the corporation is an extraordinary act to be taken \u2018 \u2018only when necessary to promote justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 360 S.E.2d at 831 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">There is no single rule or criterion that can be applied to determine whether piercing the corporate veil is justified. The cases and commentators generally agree, however, that one who seeks to disregard the corporate entity must show that the shareholder sought to be held personally liable has controlled or used the corporation to evade a personal obligation, to perpetrate fraud or a crime, to commit an injustice, or to gain an unfair advantage. <em>Lewis Trucking Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 23, 31, 147 S.E.2d 747, 753 (1966); F. Hodge O\u2019Neal and Robert B. Thompson, <em>O\u2019Neal\u2019s Close Corporations </em>\u00a7 1.10 (3d ed. 1971 and Supp. 1992). Piercing the corporate veil is justified when the unity of interest and ownership is such that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer exist and to adhere to that separateness would work an injustice. <em>Lewis Trucking, </em>207 Va. at 32, 147 S.E.2d at 753-54; 1 William M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 41.30 (perm. ed. rev. vol. 1990) (hereinafter Fletcher).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Each case is <em>sui generis </em>and requires examination of the particular factual circumstances surrounding the corporation and the acts in question. Determination of these facts is within the province of the trial court and that court\u2019s findings \u201cwill not be overturned on appeal unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Cheatle, </em>234 Va. at 213, 360 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>S.E.2d at 831. In this case, the trial court found that the under-capitalization of, and continuing loans to, the corporation and a non-business corporate purpose with associated personal tax advantages, established the requisite lack of separate identities between the corporation and the O\u2019Hazzas. The trial court further found that the O\u2019Hazzas\u2019 failure to take responsibility for the corporation\u2019s activities resulted in an injustice to ECC, the creditor here. Thus, the trial court concluded that piercing the corporate veil was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\">Based upon our review of the record and relevant case law, we conclude that, as a matter of law, the factual findings and the factors utilized by the trial court to pierce the corporate veil either are not supported by the record or do not support the trial court\u2019s conclusions. We will consider the factors relied upon by the trial court and its factual findings <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\n<em>Undercapitalization and Continuing Loans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The O\u2019Hazzas contributed $10,000 in initial capital to the corporation, and subsequently loaned the corporation approximately $140,000 over a two-year period. The trial court specifically found that the corporation was undercapitalized and that the corporation would have \u201cfailed almost immediately\u201d without the loans from the O\u2019Hazzas.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Initial capitalization of a corporation can be an indicator of whether a corporation was created and operated as a sham or as the alter ego for another corporation or person. If, from its inception, a corporation is unable to pay its costs of doing business because of grossly inadequate capitalization, its legitimacy is suspect. Under such circumstances, stockholders may not be entitled to the corporate shield. Fletcher \u00a7 44.1. Thus, the court in <em>In re County Green Ltd. Partnership, </em>438 F. Supp. 701 (W.D. Va. 1977), held that initial capitalization of $100, accompanied by a situation in which the controlling shareholder drained the corporation\u2019s earnings and increased the corporation\u2019s financial dependency, were factors used to justify a decision to pierce the corporate veil. <em>Id. </em>at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In the instant case, ECC produced no evidence to show what an appropriate level of capitalization would have been for a business that installed sound equipment. Consequently, a determination that $10,000 was insufficient initial capitalization is questionable, particularly in light of the $9,412 profit shown on the corporation\u2019s federal tax return for 1987, its first year of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>We note also that, to gain certain tax advantages, small corporations increasingly, and legitimately, choose to initially capitalize the entity with a small portion of the investment represented by stock and with the larger portion of capital set up as loans to the corporation. If the corporation fails, these loans are subordinated to those of other creditors. Fletcher \u00a7 44.1. And, as pointed out by the O\u2019Hazzas, federal courts, in distinguishing between corporate debt and risk capital, have considered a loan made to a corporation by stockholders without expectation of repayment as an indication that the transaction involved venture capital, not a true loan. <em>See e.g., Liflans Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 F.2d 965 (Ct. Cl. 1968); <em>Cuyuna Realty Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>382 F.2d 298, 301 (Ct. Cl. 1967); <em>P.M. Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>302 F.2d 786 (3d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">Finally, we never have recognized loaning money to a business that is sustaining losses as a ground for piercing the corporate veil. In <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Ancarrow Marine, Inc., </em>211 Va. 755, 180 S.E.2d 668 (1971), creditors of a closely held corporation were unsuccessful in their attempt to pierce the corporate veil and enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien against the property of the corporation\u2019s stockholders, even though the corporation was \u201cinsolvent and able to continue in business only because of substantial loans made\u201d by the stockholders. <em>Id. </em>at 756, 180 S.E.2d at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">We find that the trial court clearly erred in finding that the corporation was undercapitalized and in relying on this finding and the fact of the subsequent loans by the O\u2019Hazzas to the corporation as grounds for piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\n<em>Corporate Purpose and Personal Tax Advantages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Integral to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the corporation was a sham and an instrumentality of the O\u2019Hazzas were its findings that: (1) the primary purpose of the corporation was to allow the O\u2019Hazzas to provide a constant source of income to Guy O\u2019Hazza through a monthly loan from the corporation; and (2) that the sub-chapter S election by the corporation allowed the O\u2019Hazzas to \u201cderive a tax benefit from the operating losses of the corporation, while at the same time avoiding any gift tax associated with the transfer of these funds from the shareholders to their son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The O\u2019Hazzas testified that they felt an obligation as parents to give their son financial support, and that they gave their son the money \u201c[f]or business purposes and so he\u2019d have a job.\u201d They also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>testified that they \u201cintended the money to go into the business,\u201d and that the \u201ccorporation was a business to make money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">This testimony, which the trial court stated from the bench that it believed, at a minimum dictates a conclusion that the corporation was not formed for a single purpose, but for purposes that included the hope of establishing a functioning, viable business. In fact, the corporation had gross receipts exceeding $1 million over its corporate life, had up to seven employees, and had a number of subcontractors and installation jobs. It had the attributes of an ongoing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Even if the O\u2019Hazzas established and funded the corporation to provide a personal benefit to their son, as the trial court found, the corporation did not operate solely as a paper entity to pass money from parents to child. The testimony and financial documents, including tax returns, show that the trial court\u2019s holding that the purpose of the corporation was \u201cnot for any proper business purpose\u201d is clearly erroneous and, therefore, does not support piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Similarly, neither the actual nor the potential tax consequences to the O\u2019Hazzas from subchapter S election suggests any impropriety justifying piercing the corporate veil. Election of sub-chapter S status for federal tax purposes is common and legitimate. In this case, the election resulted in the O\u2019Hazzas reporting both income and losses from the corporation\u2019s operations on their federal tax returns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The trial court found that the O\u2019Hazzas did not engage in any actual fraud, but that their knowledge of the \u201ccorporation\u2019s financial difficulties with others\u201d and their \u201cdisregard for <em>any </em>responsibility regarding the corporation,\u201d allowed Guy O\u2019Hazza to \u201ccontinue improperly dissipating corporate assets.\u201d Relying on <em>In re County Green Ltd. Partnership, </em>438 F. Supp. 701 (W.D. Va. 1977) the trial court held that this lack of active oversight on the part of the O\u2019Hazzas was a \u201cbreach of their fiduciary duty to the corporation and its creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The <em>County Green </em>case does not address the factual situation of this case and is inapposite here. There, the controlling shareholder of a development corporation ran that corporation and did so in its own interest, not in the interest of the corporation. Under those circumstances, the court held that the shareholder breached its fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealings owed to the corporation and its creditors and, therefore, \u201coperated in effect as a fraud on creditors.\u201d 438 F. Supp. at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">Here, the O\u2019Hazzas, although controlling shareholders, were not involved in, and did not exercise any direction or control over, the corporation\u2019s activities. <em>County Green </em>addresses the parameters of fiduciary duty only in the context of the controlling shareholder\u2019s affirmative control of corporate actions, not where there is no such involvement or control by the controlling shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Furthermore, in <em>County Green, </em>the fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing was stated as requiring that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">each transaction entered into by the corporation through its officers and directors ... be entered into in good faith. In most all instances, good faith requires an intent to benefit the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>Id. </em>There is nothing in the record in this case that supports a finding that the transaction at issue, the ECC loan, was entered into in anything other than good faith with an intent to benefit the corporation. Clearly, Hughes and Guy O\u2019Hazza initially believed that the hotel project would be mutually beneficial to the corporation and to ECC. The failure of the project to materialize was not due to any actions of the parties but because the hotel management decided not to go through with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Finally, the record does not show that ECC was the victim of fraud, of any type, perpetrated by the O\u2019Hazzas or by anyone else. Hughes had been involved with the corporation on at least 10 previous deals. The O\u2019Hazzas had not been involved in any of those transactions. Hughes knew the financial situation of the corporation prior to advancing Guy O\u2019Hazza the money for the hotel project. Hughes was a voluntary creditor who had the knowledge and opportunity to investigate the corporation before he agreed to loan the funds. We agree with the O\u2019Hazzas\u2019 position that ECC \u201cknowingly made a risky loan to a corporation on shaky financial footing with the hope of making a profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Neither the record, nor the case law relied upon by the trial court and by ECC, supports the trial court\u2019s holding that the O\u2019Hazzas breached a fiduciary duty to the corporation and to its creditors through their actions generally, or with regard to the transaction giving rise to the debt owed ECC.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">In summary, we find that the trial court clearly erred in holding that the corporation was the alter ego and instrumentality of the O\u2019Hazzas and in disregarding the corporate entity and imposing personal liability for the debt of the corporation on the O\u2019Hazzas. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment for the O\u2019Hazzas.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"> At trial, counsel for ECC conceded that there was no evidence of any written or verbal guarantees by the O\u2019Hazzas, and that ECC relied solely on piercing the corporate veil to impose liability on the O\u2019Hazzas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\"> Sounds You See, Inc.\u2019s corporate existence was automatically terminated for failure to pay the annual license fee. Code \u00a7 13.1-752. A default judgment was entered against the defunct corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> If the sole purpose of the corporation was to benefit the O\u2019Hazzas, Guy O\u2019Hazza\u2019s monthly draw should have been taken as a direct salary, not as a loan, thereby increasing the corporation\u2019s deficit position for tax purposes in 1988 and 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
