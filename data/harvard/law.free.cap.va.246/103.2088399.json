Fralin &amp; Waldron then contracted with Randall G. Moss, d.b.a. Moss &amp; Co. (Moss) to perform on-site grading for the project. Moss, in turn, purchased materials necessary to perform the project from two materialmen, Isle of Wight Materials Company, Inc. (Isle of Wight Materials) and Cowling Bros., Inc. (Cowling).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">Moss did not pay either materialman. On December 7, 1987, Isle of Wight Materials filed a memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Moss for $11,521.6o.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Four days later, Cowling filed its memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien against Moss for $13,832.67. On June 7, 1988, Isle of Wight Materials filed a petition to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien. The project was completed on September 19, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">Medical Facilities and Fralin &amp; Waldron filed this interpleader action against Moss, Isle of Wight Materials, and Cowling on July 7, 1988. Moss agreed with Medical Facilities and Fralin &amp; Waldron that it was owed $11,572.39 and that amount was deposited with the trial court. Isle of Wight Materials and Cowling filed answers to the bill of interpleader in which they sought application of the available funds to their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">At the March 10, 1992 hearing on the interpleader, Isle of Wight Materials filed a plea of the statute of limitations and a motion for summary judgment against enforcement of Cowling\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien. The trial court overruled the plea and denied the motion, holding that the filing of the bill of interpleader tolled the statute of limitations with regard to Cowling\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien, and that Cowling\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien claim was valid. The trial court entered an order dividing the deposited funds between the two materialmen. We awarded Isle of Wight Materials an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Isle of Wight Materials argues that filing the bill of interpleader did not toll the limitations period of \u00a7 43-17 and that Cowling\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was not enforceable because Cowling failed to take appropriate action to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien within the time specified by Code \u00a7 43-17. Therefore, Isle of Wight concludes, Cowling was not entitled to share in the deposited funds based on that lien. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Mechanic\u2019s liens are wholly statutory in nature and the existence of the lien, \u201cas well as the jurisdiction of the court to enforce it, rest upon compliance with the statute, and not upon equitable principles.\u201d <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Brumback, </em>177 Va. 36, 40, 12 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Code \u00a7 43-22 provides the method of enforcing a perfected mechanic\u2019s lien. That section authorizes a lienor to seek enforcement of its lien only by filing an independent suit or by filing a petition to intervene in the enforcement suit of another lienor. Code \u00a7 43-17 requires a lienor to file its suit to enforce a perfected lien no later than six months after the recordation of the lien or sixty days after the structure was completed or the work thereon otherwise terminated, whichever is later.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>These statutes require a lienor to take affirmative action within a specific time period to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien as a prerequisite to recovering on the lien. <em>Donohoe Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Mount Vernon Assoc., </em>235 Va. 531, 538, 369 S.E.2d 857, 861 (1988). Merely being named as a defendant in an enforcement action of another lienor is not the equivalent of either filing an independent suit or intervening in the suit of another. <em>Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, </em>222 Va. 330, 332, 281 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1981). There is no relevant difference between being a named party defendant in a bill to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien and being a named defendant in the interpleader action filed here. Neither constitutes an affirmative act on the part of the lienor to enforce its lien, and neither complies with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">Cowling has not filed an independent enforcement petition, nor has it filed a petition to intervene in the enforcement proceeding instituted by Isle of Wight Materials. Nevertheless, it argues that a separate bill to enforce its lien is not required in this interpleader action because \u201call parties were brought before the Court and all issues could be decided in th[is]suit.\u201d Thus, Cowling concludes that the purpose of the limitations period was satisfied since the owner and builder knew \u201cat an early date the extent to which the property involved is encumbered, who seek to enforce its liens and the amount claimed.\u201d This argument ignores the fact that a mechanic\u2019s lien is enforceable only under the conditions established by statute and, in the absence of compliance with those statutory provisions, a court has no jurisdiction to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Wallace, 177 </em>Va. at 40, 12 S.E.2d at 802. Cowling has not taken the requisite action to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien under Code \u00a7 43-22 and, therefore, the trial court had no jurisdiction to order that Cowling was entitled to any of the deposited funds based on Cowling\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The trial court also erred in holding that the filing of the bill of interpleader tolled the limitations period set out in Code \u00a7 43-17. An analogous situation was addressed in <em>Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors. </em>In that case, lienors, named as defendants in another lienor\u2019s enforcement suit, attempted to enforce their mechanic\u2019s liens by filing intervening petitions in the enforcement suit. On appeal, the trial court\u2019s action sustaining demurrers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>intervening petitions was affirmed because those petitions were not filed within the limitations period set out in Code \u00a7 43-17. The Court rejected arguments that the limitations period had been tolled by the filing of the other lienor\u2019s enforcement suit and confined the effect of tolling the limitations period to cases involving \u201cliens filed by a general contractor and his subcontractors,\u201d <em>Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors, 222 </em>Va. at 333, 281 S.E.2d at 812, and to cases in which the lienors had become parties to third party suits \u201cby filing intervening petitions within the prescribed period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334 n.4, 281 S.E.2d at 813 n.4. Neither circumstance is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">As noted above, for purposes of the issues presented in this case, there is no relevant difference between being named a party defendant in a bill of interpleader and in a bill to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien. Neither tolls the limitations period of Code \u00a7 43-17 for materialmen seeking to enforce their mechanic\u2019s liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment allowing Cowling Bros., Inc. to recover a portion of the funds deposited with the trial court based on its mechanic\u2019s lien and will remand the case for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> The trial court held that Isle of Wight\u2019s claim was $11,572.60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-5\"> This holding does not affect Cowling\u2019s right to recover on any contractual claim it may have against Moss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
