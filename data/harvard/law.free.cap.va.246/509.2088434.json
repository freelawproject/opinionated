In September 1992, the Prince William County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution requesting that the Prince William County Service Authority (the Authority) acquire the entire water system owned and operated by Virginia-American in its Prince William District. The Authority is an instrumentality created pursuant to the Act, and is granted powers of eminent domain pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Pursuant to the Board\u2019s resolution, the Authority made an offer to purchase Virginia-American\u2019s Prince William District water system. When Virginia-American refused the offer, the Authority filed a petition in the Prince William County Circuit Court, seeking condemnation of that system pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-1250(f), 15.1-335, and 15.1-340.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Simultaneously, Virginia-American filed a petition for declaratory judgment before the State Corporation Commission, requesting that the Commission rule that, prior to any condemnation of Virginia-American\u2019s system, the Authority must comply with Code \u00a7 25-233<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by obtaining a certification from the Commission that \u201ca public necessity or essential public convenience\u2019 \u2019 requires condemnation of that system.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">On January 21, 1993, while the Authority\u2019s condemnation action remained pending, the Commission granted the Authority\u2019s motion to dismiss Virginia-American\u2019s declaratory judgment action. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Commission found that \u201cthe Authority\u2019s right to proceed with condemnation action without prior Commission approval is clear from the face of the language of [Code] \u00a7 15.1-1250(f).\u201d In reaching this decision, the Commission construed Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) together with Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission held that Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) creates two classes of water authorities: one class that is subject, under Code \u00a7 25-233, to Commission approval of condemnation proceedings, and another class, those authorities located in cities or counties to which Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340 apply, that need not secure Commission approval under Code \u00a7 25-233. Virginia-American appeals this decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">The question presented for our review is whether the Commission correctly interpreted Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) and the related statutes. In resolving this issue, our analysis will be guided by certain principles of appellate review and statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">A presumption of correctness attaches to actions of the Commission. <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 401, 404, 192 S.E.2d 744, 747 (1972). Its findings will not be disturbed when they are based upon the application of correct principles of law. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Attorney Gen. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Washington Gas Light Co., </em>221 Va. 315, 325, 269 S.E.2d 820, 826 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">None of the parties has argued that the statute is plain and unambiguous. Instead, Virginia-American contends that Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) requires the Authority to obtain Commission approval before proceeding with condemnation, while the Commission and the Authority contend that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The statute itself does not specifically address whether Commission approval must be obtained in eminent domain proceedings of this kind. Instead, it contains internal references to three other statutes, Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340, as well as Code \u00a7 25-233.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">This Court has held that language is ambiguous if it can be understood in more than one way. <em>See Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). Further, we have remarked that divergent interpretations tend to show that a statute\u2019s meaning is difficult to ascertain. <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 101, 353 S.E.2d 758, 762 (1987). Applying this standard, we hold that the relevant provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) are ambiguous. Thus, we are called upon to interpret the meaning of those provisions and to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent. <em>Vollin </em>v. <em>Arlington County Electoral Bd., </em>216 Va. 674, 678-79, 222 S.E.2d 793, 797 (1976). In doing so, we may avail ourselves of extrinsic evidence and the rules of statutory construction. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. at 101-02, 353 S.E.2d at 762. We also examine the disputed provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) in the context of other closely related statutes. <em>Commonwealth v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., </em>193 Va. 37, 44, 68 S.E.2d 122, 126 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">This Court previously had occasion to consider the interaction of the predecessor statutes to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-1250(f), 15.1-335, and 15.1-340. In <em>Board of County Supervisors v. Alexandria Water Co., </em>204 Va. 434, 132 S.E.2d 440 (1963), this Court held that the Fairfax County Water Authority could not take \u2018 \u2018by condemnation proceedings any property belonging to any corporation possessing the power of eminent domain . . . unless the Commission \u2018shall certify that a public necessity or that an essential public convenience shall so require, and shall give its permission thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 132 S.E.2d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Despite this limitation on the power of the Fairfax County Water Authority, the Court held that the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>County, to which the former version of Code \u00a7 15.1-335 was applicable because of the size of the county\u2019s population, could condemn the Alexandria Water Company\u2019s facilities without permission from the Commission. Under Code \u00a7 15.1-335, the Board had \u201cunconditional\u201d power to condemn the Alexandria Water Company\u2019s properties. In addition, the former version of Code \u00a7 15.1-340, applicable to the Board, provided that in a condemnation proceeding under Code \u00a7 15.1-335, the provisions of Code \u00a7 25-233, requiring Commission approval, \u201cshall not apply.\u201d 204 Va. at 439-40, 132 S.E.2d at 443-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">In <em>Alexandria Water, </em>it was argued that the Fairfax County Water Authority must obtain Commission approval under the former version of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) because, although the Board had initiated the acquisition of the Alexandria Water Company, it \u201chad announced publicly that the condemnation proceeding was being prosecuted on behalf of the [Fairfax County] Authority, to which the properties would be conveyed.\u201d 204 Va. at 435-36, 132 S.E.2d at 441. The Court rejected this argument, however, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">Under [the former version of Code \u00a7 15.1-335] the power of the Board to acquire by condemnation the properties here involved is unconditional. That it may do so without the permission of the Commission is clearly stated. The power of the Board to convey to the Authority the properties thus acquired is likewise unconditional. There is no requirement in these statutes, or others, that if the property sought to be acquired by the Board is to be transferred to an authority for operation such condemnation proceedings may not be instituted by the Board unless and until such <em>authority </em>obtains from the Commission its permission to do so. To require such permission, as the Commission holds, is to write into the statutes a condition and qualification which are not found therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">204 Va. at 440, 132 S.E.2d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In 1970, after our decision in <em>Alexandria Water, </em>the General Assembly enacted legislation effecting substantial changes to Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f). As amended, the relevant portions of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) provided that each authority created under the Act \u201cis hereby authorized and empowered\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>to acquire by gift, purchase or the exercise of the right of eminent domain lands or rights in land or water rights in connection therewith . . . provided, that in the exercise of the right of eminent domain the provisions of \u00a7 25-233 shall apply. In addition, the authority in any county or city to which \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340 are applicable shall have the same power of eminent domain and shall follow the same procedure therefor as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340 of the Code of Virginia[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">This amended language controls the case before us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Virginia-American contends that Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f), in referring to the mandatory provisions of Code \u00a7 25-233, requires that any water authority exercising the right of eminent domain against another corporation also possessing the power of eminent domain, such as Virginia-American, must first obtain the Commission\u2019s certification and approval under Code \u00a7 25-233. The Authority argues, however, that under the second sentence of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f), it is granted the \u201csame power of eminent domain\u201d and directed to follow the \u201csame procedure therefor\u201d as provided in Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340. We agree with the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The legislative history of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f), and the construction this Court placed on the statutes at issue in <em>Alexandria Water, </em>support the conclusion we reach here. As we held in <em>Alexandria Water, </em>the law before 1970 clearly barred a water authority from condemning a system such as Virginia-American without the certification and permission of the Commission. At that time, the predecessor to Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) contained grants of certain powers of eminent domain, including references to the predecessors to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340, followed by a provision requiring Commission certification in language similar to that of Code \u00a7 25-233.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The 1970 amendment, however, repositioned the sequence of the grants and stipulations contained in Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f). Since its amendment, the statute grants certain powers of eminent domain to all authorities, subject to the specific requirement that the provisions of Code \u00a7 25-233 shall apply. The second sentence of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) then enlarges the powers of eminent domain of certain authorities, by its reference to Code \u00a7 15.1-335. It also directs that procedures other than those in Code \u00a7 25-233 be followed, by its reference to Code \u00a7 15.1-340.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">As a general rule, a presumption exists that a substantive change in law was intended by an amendment to an existing statute. <em>Dale v. City of Newport News, </em>243 Va. 48, 51, 412 S.E.2d 701, 702 (1992); <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>114 Va. 688, 693, 77 S.E. 470, 472 (1913). Further, we assume that the General Assembly\u2019s amendments to the law are purposeful and not unnecessary or vain. <em>Cape Henry Towers, Inc. v. National Gypsum Co., </em>229 Va. 596, 600, 331 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We conclude that, by its 1970 amendment, the General Assembly intended to grant authorities located in larger cities and counties the same powers of eminent domain, and the same freedom to proceed without Commission approval, as was already accorded those cities and counties. Thus, we agree with the Commission\u2019s holding that \u201ca second classification of authorities \u2014 those in counties [and cities] already exempted from the Commission\u2019s authority under [Code] \u00a7 25-233 \u2014 was added.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Virginia-American argues against this interpretation, relying on the language of other Code sections. It contends that, because Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) incorporates by reference the eminent domain powers of the Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it must be read together with Code \u00a7 33.1-95.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 33.1-95 mandates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>application of Code \u00a7 25-233 to every statute incorporating by reference the eminent domain powers of the Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner, unless the statute specifically states that Code \u00a7 25-233 does not apply. Therefore, Virginia-American asserts that the disputed portion of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) must be subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 25-233. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\">The language of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) itself specifies in what situations Code \u00a7 25-233 shall and shall not apply; authorities subject to the first sentence of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) are told that \u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 25-233 shall apply,\u201d while authorities subject to the second sentence are referred to Code \u00a7 15.1-340, which states just as clearly that \u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 25-233 shall not apply.\u201d In such a case, there is no need to resort to Code \u00a7 33-1.95 to determine whether the provisions of Code \u00a7 25-233 shall apply. \u201cThe plain, obvious and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Vollin, </em>216 Va. at 679, 222 S.E.2d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In addition, Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) explicitly directs authorities in cities or counties to which Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340 apply to \u201cfollow the same procedure\u201d as provided in Code \u00a7 15.1-340. That section specifies that jurisdiction will lie in the circuit court of the city or county where the property is situated, and it makes no provision for jurisdiction by the Commission. Further, it specifically negates any uncertainty as to whether Code \u00a7 25-233 applies. To hold that the Authority in this case must secure Commission approval would require that we ignore the clear directive in Code \u00a7 15.1-340 that \u201cthe provisions of Code \u00a7 25-233 shall not apply.\u201d This we may not do. An enactment must be interpreted, if possible, to give meaning to every word. <em>Monument Assocs. v. Arlington County Bd., </em>242 Va. 145, 149, 408 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1991). <em>See also Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>213 Va. 545, 548, 193 S.E.2d 671, 674 (1973); 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.37 (5th ed. 1992 Rev.).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Virginia-American also urges that, in holding that Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) creates two classifications of authorities, the Commission mistook the true purpose of the 1970 amendment to Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f). It asserts that, before the 1970 amendment, <em>all </em>authorities had the power to condemn entire water systems under Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f), through incorporation of Code \u00a7 15.1-335, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>which granted the same power only to <em>some </em>cities and counties. Virginia-American argues that the changes made in 1970 to Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) were meant only to resolve an anomalous situation that existed before 1970 whereby an authority might have condemnation power over an entire system, while the city or county in which it was located did not. Virginia-American contends that the General Assembly meant to rectify this situation but left intact the requirement of Commission approval for all authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\">This argument can be accepted, however, only by disregarding the fact that the 1970 amendment also effected a significant recasting of the language of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f). Prior to 1970, the provision dealing with Commission approval appeared at the end of all grants of power to all authorities, thus limiting all such grants. The 1970 amendment placed the Code \u00a7 25-233 requirement at the end of the general provisions applicable to all authorities, but <em>before </em>the second sentence granting additional powers to certain authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The form of these revisions strongly suggests that the legislature intended more than one substantive change in the law. This amendment withdrew from authorities in smaller municipalities the power to condemn entire systems, reserving that power to authorities in larger municipalities through the reference to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-335 and 15.1-340, while relieving the authorities in larger municipalities of the need to obtain the Commission\u2019s approval under Code \u00a7 25-233.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Virginia-American correctly maintains that statutes conferring the power of eminent domain must be strictly construed against the grant of such power. <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>201 Va. 514, 519, 112 S.E.2d 137, 141 (1960). It contends that the language of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) does not speak with sufficient clarity to exempt certain authorities from the requirement of Commission approval. Virginia-American argues that the legislature could make such an intention plain only by stating once again, at the end of the disputed language, that \u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 25-233 shall not apply.\u201d We disagree. The fact that Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f) incorporates by reference the procedures set forth in Code \u00a7 15.1-340 sufficiently manifests the General Assembly\u2019s intention to exempt certain authorities from the requirements of Code \u00a7 25-233.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Further, Virginia-American argues that because the words \u201cin addition\u201d are used to introduce the second sentence of Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f), that sentence should not be construed to create an exception to the requirements of Code \u00a7 25-233 in favor of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>authorities. It contends that the General Assembly would have chosen exclusionary words such as \u201cprovided, however,\u201d or \u201cexcept that\u201d if it intended to create such an exception. We do not agree, however, for we do not find it unusual that the phrase \u2018 \u2018in addition\u2019 \u2019 should be included in a sentence whose effect is to confer additional powers of eminent domain upon certain authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\">Finally, Virginia-American argues that, since the General Assembly rejected a proposal in 1970 (Senate Bill No. 283) to dispense with Commission approval in condemnation proceedings for all authorities, and the final bill included the present reference to Code \u00a7 25-233 found in Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f), this Court should infer that the General Assembly intended to retain the Code \u00a7 25-233 requirement as to all authorities. We disagree that logic compels such a conclusion. The fact that the General Assembly did not dispense with the requirement as to all authorities does not prove that the General Assembly retained the requirement as to all authorities. Rather, the revisions to Code \u00a7 15.1-1250(f), as explained above, specifically require otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Finding no error below, we will affirm the order of the Commission granting the Authority\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-12\"> Code \u00a7 15.1-1250 provides, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">\u00a7 15.1-1250.
