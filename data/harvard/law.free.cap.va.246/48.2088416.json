On appeal, the dispositive question is whether the Board applied erroneous principles of law in granting the variance and the trial court, therefore, erred in affirming the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">On March 19, 1991, Roanoke Mental Hygiene Service, Incorporated (the Applicant) applied to the Board for a special exception and variance that would allow the Applicant to operate a residential substance abuse group care facility for 24 persons. The Board denied the application when its members deadlocked by a 2-2 vote. The Board also denied the Applicant\u2019s request for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">The Applicant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the trial court. Code \u00a7 15.1-497. On October 23, 1991, the trial court, with the consent of the Applicant and the Board, remanded the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to the Board \u201cfor a hearing by the Board and such further proceedings as it may determine.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">On December 3, 1991, the Board conducted another hearing and, by a 3-2 vote, approved the application. Thereupon, neighbors, George F. Riles and others (collectively, Riles), filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the trial court, and the trial court consolidated their case with the Applicant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After considering the record and conducting a hearing, the trial court, by orders entered May 14 and May 26, 1992, affirmed the Board\u2019s decision granting the special exception and variance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The subject property is a 13.414-acre tract located at 1919 Andrews Road, Northwest, in the City of Roanoke. The property is zoned RS-3, Residential Single-Family District, and a large house is located on the property. The property is in a predominantly \u201cmiddle class\u201d neighborhood, consisting of single-family dwellings, several churches, an elementary school, and a city park.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The Applicant contracted to purchase the property provided it could obtain a special exception and variance that would allow the Applicant to operate a group care facility for 24 residents. Persons would be confined in the facility, as an alternative to confinement in a jail or the penitentiary, for the conviction of drug and drug-related offenses. While confined in the facility, the residents would receive therapeutic treatment. The RS-3 zoning classification did not permit the proposed facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The property had been listed for sale for a number of months. In spite of realtors\u2019 diligent efforts, no offers to purchase had been received until the Applicant made its offer. The Applicant contended that denial of the variance would produce an unnecessary hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">We stated our well-established standard of review for a case like this in <em>Alleghany Enterprises </em>v. <em>Covington, </em>217 Va. 64, 67, 225 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>A proceeding before the trial court under Code \u00a7 15.1-497 is not a trial <em>de novo. </em>There is a presumption that the Board\u2019s decision was correct and the burden is on the appellant to overcome this presumption. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals </em>v. <em>Combs, </em>200 Va. 471, 476-77, 106 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1959). The court may not disturb the decision of a board of zoning appeals unless the board has applied erroneous principles of law or, where the board\u2019s discretion is involved, unless the evidence proves to the satisfaction of the court that the decision is plainly wrong and in violation of the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals of Alexandria </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>201 Va. 942, 948, 114 S.E.2d 753, 757-58 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><em>Accord Board of Zoning Appeals </em>v. <em>Glasser Bros. Corp., </em>242 Va. 197, 200, 408 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The principles of law that govern a board of zoning appeals when it considers an application for a variance to a zoning ordinance are set forth in Code \u00a7 15.1-495(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That section provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a board of zoning appeals is empowered to grant a variance when, \u201cowing to special conditions[,] a literal enforcement of the provisions [of a zoning ordinance] will result in unnecessary hardship.\u201d The section defines \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d as one that occurs when \u201cthe strict application of the terms of the ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property\u201d or create \u201ca clearly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-495(b); <em>accord Board of Zoning App. </em>v. <em>Nowak, </em>227 Va. 201, 204, 315 S.E.2d 221, 223 (1984); <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Hornsby, </em>221 Va. 117, 120-21, 267 S.E.2d 140, 141-42 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Additionally, a board of zoning appeals cannot grant a variance unless it makes three findings. These findings, as specified in Code \u00a7 15.1-495(b), are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">(1) That the strict application of the ordinance would produce undue hardship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>(2) That such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">(3) That the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>Accord Glasser Bros. Corp., </em>242 Va. at 201, 408 S.E.2d at 897; <em>Nowak, </em>227 Va. at 204, 315 S.E.2d at 223; <em>Packer, </em>221 Va. at 121, 267 S.E.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Thus, an applicant must establish \u201cspecial conditions\u201d that would cause compliance with a zoning ordinance to result in an \u201cunnecessary hardship,\u201d and the board of zoning appeals must find that the three tests are satisfied. <em>Nowak, </em>227 Va. at 204-05, 315 S.E.2d at 223; <em>Packer, </em>221 Va. at 121, 267 S.E.2d at 142. Indeed, in variance cases, these prerequisite findings are crucial to the exercise of the power of judicial review that has been vested in the courts by the General Assembly. <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Town of Painter, </em>239 Va. 343, 348, 389 S.E.2d 702, 704 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In the present case, the record is devoid of any evidence suggesting that \u201cspecial conditions\u201d exist so that a literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance will result in \u201cunnecessary hardship,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a hardship that would \u201ceffectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict\u201d the use of the property or create \u201ca clearly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation.\u201d The zoning classification does not unreasonably restrict the owners in the use of their property or create a hardship approaching confiscation. To grant the Applicant a variance under the facts presented would give it an impermissible \u201cspecial privilege or convenience.\u201d Moreover, the Board did not make the three findings required of it before granting a variance. We conclude, therefore, that the Board applied erroneous principles of law in granting the variance, and the trial court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment, dismiss the application, and enter final judgment in favor of Riles.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> In the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to decide whether the trial court had the authority to order the remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\"> Riles had not become a party litigant before the case had been remanded to the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-11\"> Riles, by several assignments of error, has challenged the Board\u2019s authority to conduct a \u201crehearing\u201d and the validity of the vote that granted the application. In view of the decision we reach, however, we do not address those assignments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\"> On March 22, 1991, Code \u00a7 15.1-495 was amended by redesignating its subdivisions. However, the substance of Code \u00a7 15.1-495(b) was not amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
