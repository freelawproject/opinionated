Welsh, served as an accountant overseeing the financial activities of the National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC), an organization founded by Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr., to promote his political activities in this country. Welsh also supervised the financial operations of a number of other LaRouche corporations, including Publication and General Management, Inc. (PGM).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">In 1984, faced with substantial financial deficits, the LaRouche organization began soliciting loans from individuals nationwide, but misinformed prospective lenders about the financial condition of LaRouche\u2019s operations. Knowing at the time that loans could not be repaid, Welsh, as corporate secretary of PGM, executed and delivered letters of indebtedness and promissory notes to many of the lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">In the spring of 1986, federal and state authorities began investigating the financial activities of LaRouche and the individuals and corporations associated with him. This investigation involved the United States Attorneys\u2019 offices in Alexandria, Virginia, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Boston, Massachusetts, the office of the Attorney General of Virginia, and the office of the Attorney General of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Virginia\u2019s investigative and prosecutorial team was headed by Assistant Attorney General John Russell, aided by Assistant Attorneys General George Chabalewski, Marcia Davis, and Barbara Gaden. Investigator John Parthum of the State Corporation Commission, Donald Moore, Deputy Sheriff of Loudoun County, and Special Agent Charles Bryant of the Virginia State Police also assisted Russell. In addition to his role as deputy sheriff, Moore was commissioned as a Special United States Deputy Marshal to assist the federal investigatory teams in Alexandria and Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Kent Robinson, Assistant United States Attorney, was the lead federal prosecutor in Alexandria. In Boston, Assistant United States Attorney John Markham headed a prosecutorial team that included Assistant United States Attorney Mark Rasch. Participating in the federal probe were investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the United States Postal Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In the New York prosecution, Assistant Attorney General Katherine Law initially was the lead prosecutor, but she left the Attorney General\u2019s office in July 1988. Assistant Attorney General Dawn Cardi succeeded Katherine Law, and Cardi was assisted by Assistant Attorney General Rebecca Mullane.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On October 6 and 7, 1986, federal and state officers, armed with search warrants, seized more than 450 boxes, containing approximately 1,000,000 documents, from NCLC offices at Leesburg in Loudoun County. The investigators stored most of the seized items in a warehouse at Springfield in Fairfax County, where state and federal officers conducted an examination to identify those documents that might be useful in subsequent grand jury investigations and criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">On February 17, 1987, a Loudoun County grand jury indicted a number of individuals and organizations associated with the LaRouche movement on a variety of charges stemming from the movement\u2019s fund-raising activities. Welsh was among those indicted, and he was charged with four counts of violating the Virginia Securities Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-501 to -527.3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Retired Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Carleton Penn of the Circuit Court of Loudoun County was designated by this Court to hear the cases, and, in the ensuing two years, he handled numerous motions filed by the several defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">A federal grand jury in Alexandria also investigated LaRouche\u2019s fund-raising activities. In May 1987, the grand jury subpoenaed Welsh as a witness. He notified the United States Attorney that he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Assistant United States Attorney Robinson obtained an immunity order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6001 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a result, Welsh testified before the Alexandria grand jury on July 22, 1987, and on six other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In the fall of 1988, the Alexandria grand jury returned indictments against Lyndon LaRouche and six others on mail fraud charges. LaRouche was also indicted for conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. In late 1988, Welsh was compelled, under an immunity order, to testify at trial of the Alexandria indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In the meantime, beginning on December 17, 1987, and continuing until May 4, 1988, trial was conducted in Boston on indictments returned by a federal grand jury against several LaRouche associates. Welsh testified at the Boston trial under an immunity order. Trial of indictments returned by a New York grand jury began on April 10, 1989, and continued until.August 31, 1989. Welsh did not testify in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The first prosecution under the Virginia indictments occurred in January 1989, when Rochelle Ascher, a LaRouche fund-raiser, was brought to trial in Loudoun County. John Russell and George Chabalewski, Assistant Attorneys General of Virginia, prosecuted the case. Welsh did not testify at Ascher\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">On April 12, 1989, upon motion of the remaining Loudoun County defendants, including Welsh, Judge Penn granted a change of venue because of the \u201cextreme difficulty . . . encountered ... in empaneling a jury\u201d at Rochelle Ascher\u2019s trial. The cases were transferred to the Circuit Court of Roanoke County, where Judge Clifford R. Weckstein of the Twenty-Third Judicial Circuit, acting under a designation issued by this Court, presided over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The second Virginia prosecution under the Loudoun County indictments, involving Michael Billington, a LaRouche fund-raiser, took place in September 1989. Assistant Attorneys General John Russell and Barbara Gaden prosecuted the case. Welsh did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Welsh\u2019s trial on the Loudoun County indictments, with Russell as the lead prosecutor, was scheduled to begin on April 24, 1990. However, on March 30, 1990, Welsh filed a motion to dismiss \u201call charges\u201d or, in the alternative, to suppress the evidence \u201cto be presented against [him] at. . . trial.\u201d This motion sought \u201cto determine whether and to what extent the Commonwealth made direct and/or derivative use of [Welsh\u2019s] immunized testimony\u201d in preparation for trial of the indictments against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In a memorandum filed in support of the motion, Welsh claimed that under <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441 (1972), he was entitled to a hearing in which the Commonwealth would be required to show that the evidence it intended to introduce against him at trial was \u201cderived from legitimate independent sources apart from leads derived from [his] immunized testimony.\u201d Absent such a showing, Welsh maintained, the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cproffered evidence must be suppressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">After a pretrial hearing, the trial court denied Welsh\u2019s motion. Then, on May 7, 1990, pursuant to a plea agreement, Welsh entered a conditional plea of guilty to one felony count of selling unregistered securities with intent to defraud the purchaser. He also plead guilty to one misdemeanor count of transacting business as an unregistered agent and two misdemeanor counts involving the sale of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The trial court convicted Welsh and sentenced him to seven years\u2019 imprisonment on the felony count, with execution of sentence suspended upon certain conditions. The court also sentenced Welsh to concurrent terms of twelve months on the three misdemeanor counts, with sentence suspended after he served seventy-five days in jail and performed community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In the plea agreement, Welsh reserved the right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of several pretrial motions, including his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>motion to dismiss or suppress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon review of the reserved matters, the Court of Appeals affirmed Welsh\u2019s convictions. <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 300, 416 S.E.2d 451 (1992). We awarded Welsh an appeal limited to the question whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss or suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\n<em>Kastigar Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The question for decision in <em>Kastigar </em>was \u201cwhether the [prosecution] may compel testimony from an unwilling witness, who invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, by conferring on the witness immunity from use of the compelled testimony in subsequent criminal proceedings, as well as immunity from use of evidence derived from the testimony.\u201d 406 U.S. at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The witness in <em>Kastigar </em>contended that \u201cthe scope of immunity provided by the federal witness immunity statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002, is not coextensive with the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, and therefore is not sufficient to supplant the privilege and compel testimony over a claim of the privilege.\u201d 406 U.S. at 448. \u201cThe constitutional inquiry,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cis whether the immunity granted under this statute is coextensive with the scope of the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Tracing the history of Congressional action and its own prior decisions on the subject of compelled testimony, the Court noted that \u201c[w]hile a grant of immunity must afford protection commensurate with that afforded by the privilege, it need not be broader\u201d and go so far as to encompass the concept of transactional immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 453. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cimmunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination, and therefore is sufficient to compel testimony over a claim of the privilege.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The Court went on to say that \u201c[t]his total prohibition on use provides a comprehensive safeguard, barring the use of compelled testimony as an \u2018investigatory lead,\u2019 and also barring the use of any evidence obtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460 (footnote omitted). And, the Court continued, \u201c\u2018[o]nce a defendant demonstrates that he has testified .. . under a ... grant of immunity,... the [prosecuting] authorities have the burden of showing that their evidence is not tainted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Waterfront Comm\u2019n, </em>378 U.S. 52, 79 n. 18 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">As the <em>Kastigar </em>court stated, the prosecution\u2019s burden is a \u201cheavy\u201d one, 406 U.S. at 461, and \u201cis not limited to a negation of taint,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 460. Instead, the burden is on the prosecution to prove that \u201call of the evidence it proposes to use was derived from legitimate independent sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-62. \u201cMost courts following <em>Kastigar </em>have imposed a \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 evidentiary burden on the [prosecution].\u201d <em>United States v. North, </em>910 F.2d 843, 854 (D.C. Cir.), <em>modified, </em>920 F.2d 940 (1990), <em>cert, denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 111 S.Ct. 2235 (1991) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cWhen [a trial] court uses correct legal principles, its taint determination is a factual finding subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>973 F.2d 333, 337 (4th Cir. 1992). Welsh agrees this is the rule, but he contends that the trial court did not use correct legal principles. Consequently, he argues, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard does not apply, the trial court\u2019s findings are not entitled to deference, and we must conduct a <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">We disagree with Welsh. The record demonstrates that the trial judge was fully conversant with the principles enunciated in <em>Kastigar </em>and that he applied them painstakingly. Hence, we will review his findings according to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">After a <em>Kastigar </em>hearing lasting six days, the trial court found the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the evidence it proposed to use against Welsh at trial was derived from \u201ca legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled testimony.\u201d Then, after Welsh was convicted and the decision in <em>North, supra, </em>was announced, Welsh moved \u201cto reopen the Kastigar Hearing.\u201d Following argument, the trial court denied the motion and affirmed its earlier action, finding again that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Commonwealth had carried its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence \u2018 \u2018that it had an independent source for the evidence used in preparing the prosecution of Mr. Welsh and to be used at trial.\u201d We turn to the record to determine whether this finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\n<em>The Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cChinese Wall\u2019\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">At the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing, the Commonwealth undertook to show that it had erected a \u201cChinese Wall\u201d to insulate the members of its prosecutorial and investigative team from the prosecutors and investigators, both federal and state, who had access to Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony. As noted previously, the million or so documents seized in the search of LaRouche offices in Leesburg on October 6 and 7, 1986, were stored in a warehouse at Springfield. Virginia State Police Special Agent Charles Bryant and a number of federal agents worked together at Springfield sorting and examining the documents. Bryant had been informed by Assistant Attorney General Chabalewski of \u201cthe need to be absolutely screened from any immunized testimony of Richard Welsh,\u201d and lead prosecutor Russell gave Bryant the same advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The federal agents who were engaged in examining the documents knew that the Virginia authorities were not to be exposed to any information concerning Welsh. Accordingly, the federal agents would cease any discussion concerning Welsh when Bryant entered the room or, if he were already present, they would ask him to leave if they planned to discuss any grand jury matters involving Welsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Prior to seeking the order immunizing Welsh\u2019s testimony, federal prosecutor Robinson contacted Virginia\u2019s lead prosecutor, John Russell, to ascertain whether Russell thought \u201cimmunizing Richard Welsh . . . would present any problems for [Virginia\u2019s] prosecution.\u201d Russell said he did not think the immunization \u201cwould pose any problem, so long as [the federal authorities] made sure that [Russell and the people working with him in the State case] didn\u2019t learn anything that Mr. Welsh said during the course of his immunized testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Concerning Loudoun County Deputy Sheriff Donald Moore, who assisted the Boston authorities in their LaRouche investigation, Chabalewski wrote letters to Moore himself, to the Sheriff of Loudoun County, who was Moore\u2019s employer, and to John Markham and Mark Rasch, the federal prosecutors in Boston. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>letters admonished each addressee of the need for Moore to be insulated from any information concerning Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony. In addition, Russell telephoned Markham and told him to avoid telling \u201canyone from Virginia anything that Mr. Welsh testified to while he was on the Stand\u201d in Boston. Rasch, Markham\u2019s assistant, undertook to \u201ckeep Donald Moore away\u201d from any information relating to Welsh. Moore actually left Boston during the time Welsh testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Dawn Cardi and Rebecca Mullane, the New York prosecutors, had access to Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony and also had contact with the Virginia authorities in preparing the New York case for trial. But, as a result of conversations with Russell, the New York prosecutors were \u201caware that they were not to discuss Richard Welsh\u2019s testimony\u201d with the Virginia authorities. Indeed, on Cardi\u2019s \u201cfirst meeting . . . with John Russell,\u201d he told her he could not \u201cdiscuss Richard Welsh with [her],\u201d and she \u201cunderstood that because [she] had [another LaRouche defendant] in a similar situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">With respect to the handling of documentary evidence, measures were employed to segregate and make inaccessible to Virginia authorities those documents that were to be used in federal grand jury proceedings. Documents identified as \u201cimportant\u201d by either state or federal agents were placed in a so-called \u201cgoody box.\u201d Documents chosen by the federal agents for grand jury use were photographed, and the copies were labelled with \u201cGrand Jury exhibit stickers.\u201d The labelled copies were then stored in a separate filing cabinet, accessible only to federal agents, for later presentation to grand juries. The originals were returned to the \u201cgoody box\u201d without \u201cstickers\u201d or other labelling to indicate they had been used for grand jury purposes. As a result, a state agent examining a particular document found in the \u201cgoody box\u201d would not have been put on notice that the document may have been considered important, or had been used, in the grand jury proceeding in which Welsh gave his immunized testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Independent Sources</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The Commonwealth also undertook to show that the evidence it proposed to use against Welsh at trial was derived from legitimate independent sources. First of all, as noted previously, Welsh was indicted by the Loudoun County grand jury on February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>17, 1987, more than five months before he first testified under an immunity order in his appearance before the Alexandria grand jury on July 22, 1987. Hence, as the Court of Appeals observed, \u201cnothing [Welsh] said in his immunized testimony could have influenced the Virginia authorities in their decision to indict him.\u201d 14 Va. App. at 310, 416 S.E.2d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Furthermore, by the time Welsh was indicted, the numerous documents seized in the October 1986 search at Leesburg \u201chad been narrowed down to a much smaller universe,\u201d the investigation into Welsh\u2019s activities was 90 to 95% complete, and the prosecution had developed a \u201cWelsh file\u201d containing all documents seized in the Leesburg search that were written by or addressed to Welsh or that made reference to him by name. Most of the documents the Commonwealth intended to introduce against Welsh, including bank records, had already been used by the Commonwealth in prosecutions of other LaRouche associates. Thereafter, exhibits \u201cunique to Mr. Welsh [in the form of documents] provided by victim witnesses ... relating specifically to loan transactions\u201d were added to the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Also, the Commonwealth \u201ccanned\u201d its evidence, meaning it recorded the time the prosecution acquired knowledge of the existence of a particular item, in several ways. First, all the documents in the \u201cWelsh file\u201d were numbered sequentially by the use of a \u201cBates Stamp.\u201d Second, when the Commonwealth learned of Welsh\u2019s prospective appearance as a witness at the Boston trial, each document in the \u201cWelsh file\u201d was stamped with the date February 4, 1988, to show its presence in the file on that date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Third, a \u201cdocument control sheet\u201d was attached to each \u201cpotentially useful\u201d piece of evidence seized in the October 1986 Lees-burg search showing the name of the Commonwealth\u2019s agent who had identified it and the date of its identification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Finally, the Commonwealth established that even before Welsh was indicted it had identified and interviewed most of the witnesses it intended to use against him at trial and that the remainder were identified and interviewed before he gave his immunized testimony or were derived from sources other than the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>itself. The names of victim witnesses came \u201calmost exclusively [from] the analysis of loan records . . . done shortly after the October 6th and 7th [, 1986] search\u201d; victim witnesses added later either originated from further analysis of the loan records or from \u201cpeople calling [in as a result of] publicity given to the search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The chief \u201cinsider\u201d witnesses the Commonwealth intended to use against Welsh at trial were former LaRouche associates Wayne Hintz and Christian Curtis. Deputy Sheriff Donald Moore interviewed Curtis in November 1986, \u201c[r]ight after the search.\u201d The Commonwealth began \u2018 \u2018focusing on Chris Curtis as a witness ... at least as early as December of \u201886.\u201d In December 1986 or January 1987, Assistant Attorney General John Russell interviewed Curtis on one occasion and State Police Special Investigator Charles Bryant conducted \u201cseveral interviews\u201d with Curtis, who was cooperating with both state and federal authorities in the LaRouche investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Curtis informed the state investigators that Hintz \u201chad left the [LaRouche] organization and might be willing to cooperate\u2019 \u2019 as he, Curtis, \u201cwas doing.\u201d In January 1987, Charles Bryant met with Hintz and discussed the possibility of \u201chis cooperating with the Commonwealth.\u201d Bryant conducted \u201cat least five very lengthy interviews\u201d with Hintz in February and March 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u201c[A]t least as early as March of 1987,\u201d the Virginia prosecutors \u201cknew that both Chris Curtis and Wayne Hintz would play central roles in any . . . Virginia trials and prosecutions.\u201d And, at that early time, the prosecutors knew the substance of the testimony both Curtis and Hintz would give. This, of course, was at least four months before Welsh gave his immunized testimony on July 22, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>Specific Instances of Taint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Welsh argues that there are \u201choles in [the Commonwealth\u2019s Chinese] Wall\u201d and, therefore, that the \u201cwall\u201d was insufficient to guarantee the absence of taint. Welsh also says the Commonwealth failed to show that its testimonial and documentary evidence, even if independently discovered, was not tainted by Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In the Court of Appeals, Welsh cited eleven specific instances of alleged taint that, in his view, demonstrated the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to meet its <em>Kastigar </em>burden. 14 Va. App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>311, 416 S.E.2d at 457-58. He cites the same instances here and adds new ones to the list. However, we will consider only the eleven he cited in the Court of Appeals. Each instance will be worded in the language employed in that court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">(1) Virginia investigator Charles Bryant had extensive contact with the federal agents who had access to Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony while Bryant was engaged in the document selection process at the Springfield warehouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">As we demonstrated <em>supra, </em>Welsh was indicted more than five months before he gave immunized testimony and, at the time of his indictment, the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation into his activities was 90 to 95% complete. Then, as also noted <em>supra, </em>once the Commonwealth learned Welsh had been immunized, elaborate measures were instituted to insulate Bryant from receiving knowledge of Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony through contacts with federal agents.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">(2) LaRouche operatives, Chris Curtis and Wayne Hintz, were interviewed in the presence of Virginia prosecutors and agents by federal agents and prosecutors from New York who had had access to Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">As noted previously, Curtis and Hintz had been identified as prosecution witnesses, they had been interviewed extensively by state agents, and the'substance of their testimony had been known by the Virginia prosecutors long before Welsh testified as an immunized witness on July 22, 1987. And, although as Welsh asserts, Hintz was interviewed after Welsh gave his immunized testimony, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that the subsequent interviews were merely in \u201cpreparation for trial\u201d and yielded nothing \u201cnew, additional and more elaborate.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">(3) Virginia investigator Bryant selected lender witnesses to be used in Welsh\u2019s prosecution based on reports compiled by federal agents who had been exposed to Welsh\u2019s testimony and which reports summarized the interviews with them!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The evidence showed that the Commonwealth\u2019s list of lender witnesses was developed from an analysis made by Virginia agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>of the loan records seized in the search of October 6 and 7, 1986, before Welsh was indicted and prior to the time he gave his immunized testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">(4) Assistant Attorneys General Russell and Chabalewski attended portions of the opening statements in the Boston trial and may have been influenced in trial strategy or exposed to evidence derived from Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">(5) Russell and Chabalewski read media accounts of the Boston and Alexandria trials at which Welsh testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">While the record shows Russell \u201cattended a small portion\u201d of the opening statements at the Boston trial, he testified at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing that he did not know \u201cwhat the testimony of Richard Welsh was at [that] trial.\u201d With respect to Chabalewski, although he was present during the entire opening statements in Boston, he testified he did not \u201clearn anything from that opening statement [he] didn\u2019t already know,\u201d and he had previously testified he had never received any information \u201cin any form . . . that had to do with Richard Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.\u201d And, while Russell and Chabalewski read \u201csome media coverage\u201d of the Alexandria and Boston prosecutions, the articles had been subjected to a \u201cscreening process,\u201d before Russell and Chabalewski read them, to eliminate any reference to Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(6) Russell and Chabalewski had extensive contact with Dawn Cardi and Rebecca Mullane, the New York prosecutors who had access to Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Although Cardi and Mullane had not read the immunized testimony Welsh gave in Alexandria, they had been exposed to his Boston testimony. Both stated at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing, however, that they had never discussed Welsh or his testimony with the Virginia prosecutors.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">(7) Russell read the Alexandria indictment, which was based in part on Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">It is true that Russell read the Alexandria indictment and that it was based in part on Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony. But, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>having read or having otherwise become familiar with Welsh\u2019s testimony, Russell could not have known that portions of the indictment came from the testimony. Nor would those allegations of the indictment that actually mention Welsh have put Russell on notice that they were based upon Welsh\u2019s testimony; the allegations could just as well have been framed from documents seized in the 1986 search or from witnesses who testified about the same matters that Welsh covered in his testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">(8) Karen Koch, a legal assistant for the Commonwealth with the Attorney General\u2019s office, heard a portion of Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony at the Alexandria federal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Karen Koch, a paralegal, did attend the Alexandria trial. Before she left her office to go to court, she heard Russell tell Investigator Bryant \u201cnot to stay in the courtroom\u201d during Welsh\u2019s testimony, but she was uncertain whether the admonition applied to her. However, she stayed for only fifteen minutes of Welsh\u2019s statement, during which she \u2018 \u2018just tuned out the testimony\u2019 \u2019 and wrote a letter to a friend. She left the courtroom when Assistant United States Attorney Robinson informed her during a recess that she should leave. In a contemporaneous memorandum memorializing the incident, she stated that she could not \u201cremember much of [the testimony] anyway\u201d and that she did not discuss Welsh\u2019s testimony with anyone. She testified to the same effect at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">(9) The Commonwealth obtained copies of all the Alexandria federal trial transcripts, including those of Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Transcripts of the Alexandria federal trial were received in the Attorney General\u2019s office by Karen Koch. At the direction of Assistant Attorney General Chabalewski, Koch removed the segments containing Welsh\u2019s testimony from the previously unopened box and, without reading them, placed them in a manila envelope, initialed the seal, and put tape over her initials. When examined at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing, the envelope did not appear to have been opened.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">(10) [JJust before the trial of Michael Billington, Billington moved to call Welsh as a defense witness and supported the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>motion to call Welsh with a <em>pro se </em>submission that summarized portions of Welsh\u2019s testimony, which summary was read by Russell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">(11) [A]t a hearing on Billington\u2019s motion to subpoena Welsh, at which Russell and Barbara Gaden were present, the trial judge referred specifically to portions of Welsh\u2019s immunized testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Michael Billington sought by motion to have Welsh summoned as a defense witness in his trial. During a discussion of the motion in Russell\u2019s presence, Billington submitted a statement explaining \u201cwhy Richard Welsh is a necessary witness for Michael Billington.\u201d Russell read the statement, and the trial judge orally analyzed the effect Welsh\u2019s testimony might have on Billington\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The content of Billington\u2019s statement was either already known by the Commonwealth or was self-serving and exculpatory. The Court of Appeals aptly characterized the contents of the statement as material \u201cthat the government did not use and . . . which the government would have had no reason to use in the prosecution of Welsh.\u201d 14 Va. App. at 314, 416 S.E.2d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Contrary to Welsh\u2019s assertion on brief, the trial judge did not \u201cread immunized statements from Welsh\u201d or otherwise detail the substance of Welsh\u2019s testimony. Rather, conscious of what he said was the need \u201cnot to pollute the prosecutor,\u201d the judge made only general references to Welsh\u2019s testimony and merely assessed the effect his appearance as a witness might have on Billington\u2019s defense. And, beyond all that, Russell testified at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing that neither \u201cthe Billington statement [nor] Judge Weckstein\u2019s remarks . . . influence[d] or focus [ed] in any way [his] preparation or investigation for the Welsh trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">As the Court of Appeals observed, \u201ceach of these occurrences creates an abstract possibility of taint.\u201d 14 Va. App. at 311, 416 S.E.2d at 458. And, as the Court of Appeals also observed, the burden of proof imposed by <em>Kastigar </em>does not require the prosecution to \u201cnegate every abstract possibility of taint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>765 F.2d 1524, 1529 (11th Cir. 1985)). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[t]he focus of the inquiry under <em>Kastigar </em>... is not whether the prosecutor was aware of the contents of the immunized testimony, but whether he used the testimony in any way to build a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>case against the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>973 F.2d at 338 (quoting <em>United States v. Caporale, </em>806 F.2d 1487, 1518 (11th Cir. 1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1021 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">We are satisfied that the \u201cChinese Wall\u201d erected by the Commonwealth was sufficient to keep its prosecutors and agents unaware of the contents of the immunized testimony and that the Commonwealth proved by a preponderance of the evidence it had legitimate independent sources for the evidence it proposed to use against Welsh. But, in any event, we are equally satisfied that the prosecution did not use the immunized testimony, either directly or indirectly, to build a case against Welsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In making these observations, we are not unmindful of <em>Kastigar\u2019s </em>promise that \u201c[a] person accorded . . . immunity under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002, and subsequently prosecuted, is not dependent for the preservation of his rights upon the integrity and good faith of the prosecuting authorities.\u201d 406 U.S. at 460. But we know that a \u201ctaint determination [under Kastigar] is a factual finding,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>973 F.2d at 337, and it is certain that, as with most factual determinations, the outcome depends upon whether the trier-of-fact chooses to believe or disbelieve a particular witness or a particular group of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Here, it is obvious that the trial court, as it had a perfect right to do, chose to believe the prosecuting authorities who participated in the investigation at issue in this case. Once believed, their testimony, along with the other evidence in the case, provided support for the trial court\u2019s finding that the Commonwealth had met its <em>Kastigar </em>burden of proof. This did not make \u201cthe preservation of [Welsh\u2019s] rights [dependent] upon the integrity and good faith of the prosecuting authorities,\u201d <em>Kastigar, </em>406 U.S. at 460, but, rather, upon the integrity and good faith of the fact-finding judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Welsh cites a number of cases in which it was held the <em>Kastigar </em>burden had not been met. Because they present substantially different factual situations involving clear misuse of immunized testimony, we find the cases inapposite. <em>E.g., United States v. Harris, supra, </em>(government found file only after witness gave immunized testimony revealing file\u2019s location); <em>United States </em>v. <em>North, supra, </em>(government used immunized testimony to refresh memory of witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The Court of Appeals held the trial court was \u2018 \u2018not clearly erroneous\u201d in finding that the Commonwealth had met its burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>proof. We agree with the Court of Appeals and, accordingly, will affirm its judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\"> The promissory notes Welsh executed and delivered as corporate secretary of PGM formed the basis of the indictments against him.
