Maislin was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>motor freight common carrier with headquarters in LaSalle, Quebec Province, Canada. Robinson sued Maislin and recovered a $225,000 judgment in 1989. However, Robinson was unable to collect all of his judgment because of the insolvencies of Maislin and its excess liability insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">Asserting that Carriers Insurance Company (Carriers), an Iowa insurance company authorized to do business in Virginia, had issued Maislin\u2019s excess liability insurance policy and, subsequently, had become insolvent, Robinson then sued the Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Association (the Association) to recover that portion of his unsatisfied judgment payable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Relying upon the provisions of former Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.1-760(4) and 38.1-760(5), the Association defended on the ground that Robinson did not have a claim covered by the Act because Maislin\u2019s excess insurance liability policy had not been \u201cissued\u201d by an \u201cinsolvent insurer . . . authorized to transact insurance in [Virginia].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the Association contended that the policy had been issued by United Canada Insurance Company (United), a wholly owned subsidiary of Carriers that was <em>not </em>authorized to do business in Virginia. United apparently delivered this policy to Maislin Industries Ltd., the parent corporation of Maislin, with Maislin listed as an additional insured in Endorsement No. 1. Because Carriers <em>was </em>authorized to do business in Virginia and Carriers had treated the policy of United \u201cin all respects as its own,\u201d the court found Carriers had \u201cissued\u201d the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">As both companies had been declared insolvent and apparently neither had any assets available to pay any part of Robinson\u2019s claim, the court concluded that Robinson had a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the Act. Accordingly, the court entered judgment against the Association for $164,900, the agreed limit of Robinson\u2019s claim against the Association. The Association appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>There is no evidence that Carriers was a successor in title to United. Therefore, the question in this case is whether Carriers \u201cissued\u201d Maislin\u2019s policy so as to give it a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of former Code \u00a7 38.1-760(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In <em>Homestead Fire Ins. Co. v. Ison, </em>110 Va. 18, 23, 65 S.E. 463, 465 (1909), we noted a dictionary definition of the term \u201cissuance\u201d as \u201cthe act of putting, sending or giving out,\u201d and the \u201clegal definition\u201d as \u201cto send out officially; to deliver for use; to put into circulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The word \u201cissue\u201d has the same connotation: \u201c[t]o send forth; to emit; to promulgate; as, an officer issues orders, process issues from a court. To put into circulation; as, the treasury issues notes. To send out, to send out officially; to deliver, for use, or authoritatively.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 830 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">With this definition in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. The policy in dispute and covering Maislin was originally issued by United to Maislin\u2019s parent corporation as United\u2019s policy No. 8290. However, the number \u201c8\u201d was deleted on the policy and the number \u201c7\u201d inserted in its place, making the policy number \u201c7290.\u201d The date of issuance is not shown on the policy, but the policy was effective January 1, 1981, and continued in effect on the date of Robinson\u2019s injury. Coverage Clause 4 provided \u201cExcess Liability Insurance over and above the Schedule of Underlying Insurance outlined therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">United is the only insurance company described in the policy with the exception of two of the eighteen endorsements placed on the policy before Robinson was injured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, neither of these two endorsements affected Maislin\u2019s liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On December 18, 1980, 14 days before the policy at issue became effective, Carriers certified to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that it had issued its liability insurance policy No. 7290 to Maislin. However, Paul D. Turner, the only witness in this case who had been employed by Carriers prior to its insolvency, testified that no such policy had been issued by Carriers. Noting that Maislin\u2019s trucks were insured by United for operations both in Canada and the United States, Turner testified that Carriers\u2019 ICC certification was necessary because the ICC required \u201ca certificate from some United States insurance company stating that the insured has ... the insurance required by their regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Stanley K. Stevens, whose employment in the claims department by Carriers\u2019 statutory liquidator began in 1987, testified that he struck out the number \u201c8\u201d on United\u2019s policy No. 8290 and inserted the number \u201c7,\u201d making the policy number read \u201c7290.\u201d Stevens did this because when Carriers \u201cmade filings in the United States for Maislin, their filings went out under 7290.\u201d Stevens testified that the method of operation between United and Carriers was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-3\">that any policy that is written out of United Canada and where [Maislin] had trucks running in the United States . . . [a]ll the filing procedures and requirements were done by Carriers personnel, but they would not file it under 8290 because that policy would be cover[ed by an insurer] in Canada, which wouldn\u2019t be licensed to do business in the United States, so then they used 7290 for Carriers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Additionally, Stevens indicated that Carriers handled some claims made against United in the United States. Robinson also introduced in evidence a letter dated April 29, 1987, from the claims manager of United\u2019s Canadian liquidator stating that \u201cUnited Canada was responsible for accidents involving Maislin which occurred in Canada, whereas Carriers Insurance was responsible for accidents which occurred in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Recognizing that United had issued Maislin\u2019s policy No. 8290, Robinson argued that Carrier \u201ctook the policy form of their subsidiary, United Canada, on which appeared the number \u20188290\u2019 and adopted it as Carriers Policy Number \u20187290\u2019.\u201d In oral argument, Robinson contended that Maislin had \u201cat least two insurers in United Canada and Carriers.\u201d According to him, \u201cUnited Canada issued the policy, and then it was issued by adoption by Carriers Insurance Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In support of his contention, Robinson likens Carriers\u2019 ICC filings to an informal insurance agreement or binder made by an authorized agent of the insurer to an insured. However, in those instances, there must be some evidence of the alleged insured\u2019s agreement to such an arrangement. <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Conklin, </em>218 Va. 59, 67-68, 235 S.E.2d 450, 456 (1977). The record is silent on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Moreover, there is no evidence that Carriers ever notified Maislin that it was assuming or \u201cadopting\u201d any liability under United\u2019s policy, or that it furnished Maislin with a copy of its ICC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>certificate or of the two endorsements containing Carriers\u2019 name. Therefore, it cannot be said that Carriers \u201cissued\u201d an informal insurance agreement or binder to Maislin.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Finally, Carriers\u2019 apparently false certification to the ICC might have subjected it to liability by estoppel to parties with personal injury and property claims against Maislin arising in the United States. However, that liability would be based on the misrepresentations made in the certificates or filings, not on any insurance policy issued by Carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Although we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to Robinson, who prevailed in the trial court, we conclude that at most it shows only an intercorporate agreement between Carriers, the parent corporation, and United, its subsidiary, to adjust each other\u2019s claims arising in the jurisdictions where each was authorized to do business. It does not support the conclusion that Carriers \u201cissued\u201d United\u2019s policy within the context of former Code \u00a7 38.1-760(4), as the trial court concluded. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment for the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-12\"> The Act, which previously consisted of Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.1-756.1 to -774 (1981), was rewritten effective July 1, 1986, Acts 1986 ch. 562, and is now found at \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-1600 to -1623 (1990 &amp; Supp. 1992).
