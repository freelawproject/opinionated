Morrissey, Petitioner</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b351-6\">Record No. 931012</docketnumber>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\">On July 28, 1993, came the parties, by counsel, upon the petition for a Writ of Mandamus and a Writ of Prohibition filed by Joseph D. Morrissey, upon the motion to dismiss of the respondents, a majority of the judges of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, and upon argument of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Upon consideration whereof, the Court is of opinion that the said Writ of Mandamus should issue and that the order of the Circuit court of the City of Richmond dated June 21, 1993, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">The said circuit court order, applying Code \u00a7 19.2-155, found that \u201cthe circumstances and limitations currently involving Joseph D. Morrissey render him unable to attend to his official duties as Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for the City of Richmond\u201d and appointed an attorney-at-law \u201cto act in place of, and otherwise perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for the City of Richmond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Code \u00a7 19.2-155 provides, in part, that if the attorney for the Commonwealth of any city or county \u2018 \u2018is unable to act, or to attend to his official duties as attorney for the Commonwealth, due to sickness, disability or other reason of a temporary nature, then upon notification by such attorney for the Commonwealth, or upon the certificate of his attending physician, or the clerk of the court, which fact shall be entered of record, the judge of the circuit court shall appoint an attorney-at-law\u201d to act in the place of such disqualified or disabled attorney for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The foregoing statute is not applicable under the facts and circumstances of this case. Under the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>when a particular class of things is enumerated in a statute and general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>words follow, \u2018 \u2018the general words are to be restricted in their meaning to a sense analogous to the less general, particular words.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 298, 301, 295 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1982). Thus, the general statutory language, \u2018\u2018or other reason of a temporary nature,\u201d must be restricted in its meaning to conditions analogous to \u2018\u2018sickness\u201d or \u2018\u2018disability.\u201d According to the record, the reasons alleged for Morrissey\u2019s so-called \u2018\u2018inability to act\u201d have nothing to do with conditions of sickness, or physical or mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Accordingly, and because it is settled in Virginia that mandamus is a proper remedy for reinstating a public officeholder wrongly deprived of his office, <em>Giles County Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>222 Va. 379, 381, 282 S.E.2d 14, 15 (1981); <em>Dew </em>v. <em>Judges of Sweet Springs, </em>13 Va. (3 Hen. &amp; M.) 1 (1808), it is ordered that a peremptory Writ of Mandamus do forthwith issue directed to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond requiring that the court\u2019s said order of June 21, 1993, be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Upon further consideration whereof, the petition for a Writ of Prohibition is denied for the reason that prohibition does not lie under the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">It is further ordered that the mailing of an attested copy of this order to counsel for the respondents shall have the same force and effect as service of a peremptory Writ of Mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">It is further ordered that a copy of this order shall be printed in the Virginia Reports.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b352-8\">JUSTICE WHITING,</author>\n<p id=\"AT\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">I concur in the result. However, mandamus would not lie unless it clearly appeared that the public officer was wrongfully deprived of his office. In <em>Dew </em>v. <em>Judges of Sweet Springs, </em>13 Va. (3 Hen. &amp; M.) 1, 37 (1808), we recognized that mandamus might not lie if the issue was doubtful and the officeholder had another remedy (an appeal in Morrissey\u2019s case). Under the facts and circumstances of this case, Code \u00a7 19.2-155 clearly did not authorize Morrissey\u2019s temporary deprivation of office. Hence, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Unlike the majority, however, I would not limit the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-155 to those instances in which the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney is unable to act due to \u2018\u2018sickness\u201d or \u2018\u2018disability.\u201d In my opinion, the additional language in Code \u00a7 19.2-155 concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s disability for \u201cother reasons of a temporary nature\u201d covers situations in which that official is unable to be physically present to perform his official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Although Code \u00a7 19.2-156 provides for the appointment of an acting Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney during any prolonged absences of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, I think that the General Assembly also intended in Code \u00a7 19.2-155 to give the Circuit Court the power to appoint an acting Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney when the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s absence may not be prolonged and a temporary Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney is required. For example, if the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney in a small county is the only lawyer in the office and is required to be away from the county for a short period of time, I believe that Code \u00a7 19.2-155 authorizes the appointment of an acting Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">A Copy,</p>\n<p id=\"AW7\">Teste:</p>\n<p id=\"pAIy\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">/s/ David B.
