The City planned to transport the water by pipe lines approximately 86 miles through a number of Virginia counties and municipalities, all of which gave the consent required by Code \u00a7 15.1-875.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">However, the City needed assurance of a sufficient water flow in Pea Hill Creek to supply water during periods of dry weather. Accordingly, in 1984, it contracted with the United States Government (the Government) for the right to use a designated amount of the water stored in the John H. Kerr Reservoir, which is located partially in Mecklenburg and Halifax Counties. The reservoir, owned and operated by the Government since 1953, was part of its John H. Kerr Dam project, designed and built to contain water from the Roanoke River for flood control, recreational, water-supply, and hydropower purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Following are the pertinent provisions of the City\u2019s contract: \u201cThe Government shall operate and maintain\u201d the dam and reservoir; the City has \u201cthe right to utilize an undivided 1.066 percent . . . of the usable storage space in the [reservoir]\u201d by requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Government to release sufficient water from the City\u2019s share of stored reservoir water to maintain the required water level in Pea Hill Creek.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">The City did not seek the prior consent of Mecklenburg and Halifax Counties (the Counties) to its use of the water in the reservoir because the City did not believe its contractual right to that water was subject to the consent requirement of Code \u00a7 15.1-875. The Board of Supervisors of Mecklenburg County (Mecklenburg) disagreed with this interpretation of Code \u00a7 15.1-875 and filed this action against the City. The Board of Supervisors of Halifax County (Halifax) later intervened in that action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both Counties sought a declaratory judgment that Code \u00a7 15.1-875 required their consent to the City\u2019s exercise of its contractual right.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">After the pleadings were filed and some pretrial proceedings completed, the City and Mecklenburg each moved for summary judgment consistent with its construction of Code \u00a7 15.1-875. Upon a consideration of admissions in the pleadings and pretrial proceedings, and after hearing argument of counsel, the trial court agreed with Mecklenburg\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 15.1-875 and entered summary judgment, declaring that this code section required the City to obtain the Counties\u2019 consent \u201cbefore [it] may operate that portion of its water supply system which involves water storage in the [reservoir].\u201d The City appeals, and the Counties assign cross-error.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Because the parties recognize correctly that Code \u00a7 15.1-875 is ambiguous, we resort to principles of statutory construction. <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus. v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 101-102, 353 S.E.2d 758, 762 (1987). In doing so, our primary objective is to determine the legislative intent in the use of the term in question. <em>Harward v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 363, 365, 330 S.E.2d 89, 90 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">An important principle of statutory construction is that \u201c[w]ords in a statute are to be construed according to their ordinary meaning, given the context in which they are used.\u201d <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>context may be examined by considering the other language used in the statute, <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Board of County Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983), and the language of other statutes dealing with closely related subjects. <em>See Commonwealth v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., </em>193 Va. 37, 44, 68 S.E.2d 122, 126 (1951) (similar tax on another class of public service corporations similarly situated examined because it provided plain expression of legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">Examining the statutory scheme involving municipally run water systems, we see: (1) the authorization in Code \u00a7 15.1-875 to municipalities to \u201cprovide and operate . . . water production, preparation, distribution and transmission systems, facilities and appurtenances\u201d with a proviso that no municipality \u201cshall construct, provide or operate\u201d such systems after July 1, 1976, without prior approval of any county or municipality in which that system \u201cis to be located,\u201d and (2) the language of a closely related statute, Code \u00a7 15.1-335, which authorizes cities and counties to acquire an existing \u201cwaterworks system,\u201d but contains <em>no </em>provision for the consent of another jurisdiction in which such a system is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In our opinion, these statutory provisions evidence a legislative intent to impose the consent requirement upon a Virginia municipality\u2019s construction, provision, or operation of those tangible parts of a water supply system that are <em>to be built </em>in another Virginia jurisdiction after July 1, 1976. The reservoir in question was built before that date, and the summary judgment proceedings indicate that the Government\u2019s change in the allocation of a part of the storage capacity of the reservoir did not involve the City in its construction, provision, or operation. We conclude, therefore, that the City\u2019s contractual right to use water in the reservoir as a part of its water supply system did not require consent under Code \u00a7 15.1-875. Accordingly, the trial court erred in entering a summary judgment declaring that such consent was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In an assignment of cross-error, the Counties contend that the trial court erred in ruling upon the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment before it ruled upon Mecklenburg\u2019s motion to compel the City to answer the Counties\u2019 discovery requests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Counties argue that if the City had been required to answer their discovery requests <em>before </em>the trial court ruled on the motions for summary judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>such answers may have established: (1) that a part of the physical facilities of the City\u2019s water supply system would be located within the Counties, and (2) that the City \u201cconsidered\u201d its storage rights as part of its water supply system.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\">Although Mecklenburg asserted these arguments in its motion to stay or to strike the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the arguments were waived when the motions for summary judgment were argued. At that time, the Counties agreed that both parties\u2019 motions could be heard and decided at the same time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hence, we will not consider this assignment of cross-error. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and will enter a declaratory judgment in favor of the City in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV0z\">JUSTICE COMPTON concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> The extent of the City\u2019s right to require the release of water was later reduced by the Government\u2019s modification of the City\u2019s permit to take water from Pea Hill Creek. This modification does not affect the issues in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> Halifax filed no pleadings or motions in the trial court other than its motion for leave to intervene and its \u201cpetition in intervention.1</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\"> Because our decision is based solely upon a construction of Code \u00a7 15.1-875, we need not consider the Counties\u2019 other assignment of cross-error regarding the City\u2019s allegedly untimely assertion of a defense under Code \u00a7 15.1-1250.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\"> The Counties did not object to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the City\u2019s assurance that none of the physical facilities of its water supply system would be located in the Counties. Their only reservation to the court\u2019s disposition of the case on the motions for summary judgment was that if the City withdrew from its \u201cconcession that the storage space is part of their system ... we will need to revisit the motion to compel.\u201d The City has not withdrawn from its \u201cconcession\u201d that its contractual right to a part of the stored water was a part of its proposed water supply system.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
