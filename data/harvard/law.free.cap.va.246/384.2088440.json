Marx, Sr., filed a motion for judgment against appellant Maynard Strickler seeking recovery in the amount of $11,840 with interest. This sum represents the total of two checks made in November 1981 by the defendant and eventually transferred to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Following a July 1992 bench trial, the court below, in a letter opinion, ruled in favor of the plaintiff. We awarded the defendant an appeal from the October 1992 order entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The facts relating to the dispositive question are not in dispute. In 1981, the plaintiff, a resident of Alexandria, provided financing for a business enterprise conducted in Charlottesville by one Charles W. Davis, also known as Chuck Davis. Prior to his association with Davis, the plaintiff had incorporated Energy Technology Corporation. Davis operated A-l Body Shop, also known as A-l Car Body Shop, one of the entities falling under the corporate umbrella of Energy Technology Corporation. The plaintiff and Davis were also associated in another corporation that plaintiff had created, which was engaged in the used car rental business in Charlottesville.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In November 1981, defendant Strickler, a farmer living in the Charlottesville area, performed automobile repair work for Davis. Davis owed defendant money from an earlier incident in which Davis was convicted of larceny from defendant and defendant was awarded a money judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">During 1981, defendant occasionally advanced funds to Davis to meet his payroll at the end of a week so that Davis could stay in business and repay defendant the prior obligation. In the fall of 1981, defendant often left Charlottesville on weekends to officiate college football games. On these weekends, defendant would give Davis a personal check, signed and payable to A-l, and allow Davis to fill in the amount needed to meet the payroll. Davis would cash the check and repay defendant after the weekend. These transactions resulted in Davis filling in the checks for $200.00 to $300.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">On November 27, 1981, a Friday, defendant left Charlottesville to officiate a game. He gave Davis a signed check payable to the order of \u201cA-l Body Shop,\u201d completed except for the amount, and drawn on defendant\u2019s account at National Bank and Trust Company. When defendant returned on the following Monday, Davis asked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>another check to replace the first check, stating \u201che messed the check up, but the bank give him the money, but he had to replace the check.\u201d On that day, November 30, 1981, defendant gave Davis another signed check payable to the order of \u201cA-l Car Body Shop,\u201d completed except for the amount, and drawn on defendant\u2019s account at National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Davis filled in the amount of $4,860.00 on the first check and the amount of $6,980.00 on the second check. He presented the checks to Albemarle Bank &amp; Trust Company, where he had an account, after indorsing each, \u201cPay To The Order of Albemarle Bank &amp; Trust Co. Charlottesville, Va. For Deposit Only Chuch [sic] Davis Body Shop.\u201d Apparently, Davis was given immediate credit for the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The checks subsequently were dishonored by National Bank and returned to Albemarle Bank because defendant had insufficient funds in his National Bank account to pay them. Defendant routinely maintained a balance in that account of no more than $500.00. Because Davis had withdrawn the funds from his Albemarle account, the subsequent charge by Albemarle Bank resulted in an overdraft on Davis\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In December 1981, plaintiff learned, either from Davis or Albemarle Bank, that the two checks had \u201cbounced.\u201d Subsequently, plaintiff and Davis executed a note payable to Albemarle Bank for approximately $15,000 to cover the amount of the checks plus other sums owed the bank by A-l. The plaintiff, who had no prior legal obligation to the bank, executed the note to protect his interest as a creditor of Davis\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In the spring of 1983, plaintiff paid the note without any contribution from Davis and Albemarle Bank delivered the dishonored checks to plaintiff. In addition to Davis\u2019s original indorsement, the checks carried the indorsement, \u201cPay Any Bank, P.E.G.\u201d by Albemarle Bank. No other indorsement, except that of the Federal Reserve System, appears on the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In the meantime, defendant learned of the resulting overdrafts by notice from National Bank. He contacted Davis to find out \u2018 \u2018what was going on.\u201d Davis stated that the funds had been used to pay A-l\u2019s bills and \u201csome outstanding debts in gambling.\u201d Davis told defendant, \u201cI will take care of it . . . right now.\u201d Based on this representation, and after verifying with Albemarle Bank that \u201cMr. Davis and Mr. Marx had taken care of it,\u201d defendant took no further action. Subsequently, defendant realized that Albemarle Bank had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>obtained judgments against him in the amounts of the checks. These judgments were marked satisfied when plaintiff paid the amount of the note to Albemarle Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In 1985, A-l\u2019s business failed. The plaintiff testified that he \u201cgot an assignment of the assets of A-l\u201d from the trustee in bankruptcy. No written assignment was presented in evidence nor was there testimony of the details of such assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Subsequently, this action ensued against defendant only. The whereabouts of Davis is unknown. In the motion for judgment, plaintiff alleged that he \u201cis the assignee and transferee of all assets, including claims and causes of actions, of Energy Technology Corporation, trading as A-l Car Body Shop and A-l Body Shop.\u201d Reciting that defendant \u201cdrew, uttered and delivered\u201d the checks, which were \u201creturned marked \u2018insufficient funds,\u2019 \u201d and not paid by defendant\u2019s bank, plaintiff asked for judgment against defendant. The broad allegations of the motion for judgment were narrowed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">At trial, the parties and the court agreed that the central issue in the case was whether the plaintiff qualified as a \u2018 \u2018holder\u2019 \u2019 under the U.C.C. For example, plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that \u201cwe concede he\u2019s not a holder in due course ... he\u2019s a holder because he gave value. I think that a creditor that gets a cause of action on a check [has] given value. So, I think he\u2019s a holder.\u201d In addition, plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cHe\u2019s a holder for value though, Your Honor, and we think that that puts the burden on Mr. Strickler to establish defenses.\u201d Also, at the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge stated that the \u201cturning point\u201d in the case is whether plaintiff is \u201ca holder of these two checks, and is [in] a valid position to seek to collect.\u201d The judge further said, \u201cIt\u2019s simply a matter of law under the Uniform Commercial Code, whether or not Mr. Marx can collect on these two checks.\u201d The defendant took the position that plaintiff was not a \u201cholder.\u201d Alternatively, defendant asserted that even if the plaintiff was a \u201cholder,\u201d defendant had established the defenses of lack of consideration and material alteration of the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The trial court, in ruling for the plaintiff, implicitly decided that the plaintiff was a \u201cholder,\u201d although the court did not discuss the issue in the letter opinion. Instead, the court discussed its rulings that defendant had failed to prove lack of consideration or material alteration. We do not reach the question whether defendant established those defenses because we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the plaintiff was a \u201cholder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Under the provisions of the U.C.C. effective at the time of this controversy, the right of a party to payment of an instrument depended \u201cupon his status as a holder. Code \u00a7 8.3-301.\u201d <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>232 Va. 21, 24, 348 S.E.2d 214, 216 (1986). (\u00a7 8.3-301 has been replaced by \u00a7 8.3A-301.) The U.C.C. defined \u201cHolder\u201d as \u201ca person who is in possession of ... an instrument . . . drawn, issued or indorsed to him or to his order or to bearer or in blank.\u201d Former Code \u00a7 8.1-201(20) (now amended). \u201cA transferee may become a holder of order paper only by \u2018negotiation,\u2019 that is, by indorsement and delivery, and the indorsement must be by or on behalf of a person who is himself a holder.\u201d <em>Becker </em>v. <em>Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 222 </em>Va. 716, 720, 284 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1981) (interpreting former Code \u00a7 8.3-202(1) now, with changes, \u00a7 8.3A-201). \u201cA transfer of an order instrument without a necessary indorsement is not a negotiation.\u201d Virginia Comment to former Code \u00a7 8.3-202(1), citing <em>Citizens Bank and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>151 Va. 65, 69, 144 S.E. 464, 465 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In the present case, we hold that the plaintiff was not a \u201cholder\u201d of the checks, which were order paper, because they had not been indorsed to him or to his order or to bearer or in blank. The checks carried Davis\u2019s indorsement to Albemarle Bank and Albemarle Bank\u2019s indorsement, \u201cPay Any Bank, P.E.G.\u201d According to former Code \u00a7 8.4-201(2), \u201cAfter an item has been indorsed with the words \u2018pay any bank\u2019 or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder (a) until the item has been returned to the customer initiating collection; or (b) until the item has been specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.\u201d (The form of \u00a7 8.4-201(2) has been amended.) The plaintiff, as transferee of the checks, did not qualify as a \u201cholder\u201d under either (a) or (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">At trial, the plaintiff argued that he was a \u201cholder\u201d simply because he received an \u201cassignment\u201d of A-l\u2019s assets. <em>Becker </em>demonstrates that this argument has no merit. In that case, we focused on whether a bank was a \u201cholder\u201d when the instruments had been transferred by mere assignment. We held that because the entity that transferred notes to the bank took them by mere assignment and not through indorsement, the entity was not a \u201cholder\u201d and thus could not \u201cnegotiate\u201d the notes so as to permit its transferee, the bank, to qualify as a \u201cholder.\u201d 222 Va. at 721, 284 S.E.2d at 795-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Here, as the defendant argues, the essential components of negotiation were not fulfilled by proper indorsements on the instruments. Simple delivery of the checks to the plaintiff did not give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>him the status of a \u201cholder,\u201d entitling him to the remedies of the U.C.C. The so-called \u201cassignment\u201d did not suffice as a substitute for indorsement. \u201cAn indorsement must be written by or on behalf of the holder and on the instrument or on a paper so firmly affixed thereto as to become a part thereof.\u201d Former Code \u00a7 8.3-202(2) (now repealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Consequently, the judgment in favor of the plaintiff will be reversed and final judgment will be entered here in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-15\"> The General Assembly made numerous changes in the U.C.C. effective January 1, 1993. Acts 1992, ch. 693. The events giving rise to this controversy predated those changes. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>this appeal is decided under the pre-1993 version of the applicable statutes and the cases interpreting those statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
