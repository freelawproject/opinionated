Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 27, after he had been found not guilty of a homicide by reason of insanity. Approximately two years later he petitioned for release as permitted by that section.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Application for release under \u00a7 27 is \u201cpursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 15 of this article.\u201d See also <em>Keiner v. Superintendent, </em>240 Md. 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Section 15 allows any mental patient to petition the equity court for release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It sets forth a unique procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>hearing the petition, attempting to provide abundant safeguards against wrongful commitment. The result is a bastard proceeding, for the petition is heard in equity but the patient has the right to a jury, and the trial procedure is as a civil action at law. Apparently, the legislature sought to provide a petitioner with the procedural safeguards of proceedings at law, the conscience of an equity court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>availability of a jury trial \u2014 historically sacred and constitutionally sanctified as the <em>deus ex machina </em>of justice and right.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Upon filing his petition for release in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, appellant prayed, and received, a jury trial. When the \u201cgod machine\u201d failed to release him, he appealed to us, complaining that the verdict resulted from the chancellor\u2019s having unconstitutionally assigned him the burden of proving his sanity. He asks one question only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201cIs placing the burden of proof on the patient seeking release from a state mental hospital after having been found not guilty by reason of insanity a violation of the patients right to equal protection?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied equal protection is based upon two arguments. First, he complains that by regulation 10.04.03 of the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, civil involuntary committees are entitled to periodic administrative hearings at which the Department must affirmatively establish the petitioner\u2019s insanity \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Presumably because appellant was compelled to carry the burden of proving sanity upon his petition under the judicial release statute, the only route available to him,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he contends that he was denied equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Although the legislature authorized the Department to provide a procedure to release civilly committed patients, that authority did not extend to the establishment of judicial procedures for release of committees under \u00a7 27. See Md. Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 18 (a). Relying in part on <em>Bush v. Director, </em>22 Md. App. 353, we said in <em>Davis v. Director, </em>29 Md. App. 705, 717:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">\u201cWe do not deem it to have been the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>intent in authorizing the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene to make rules and regulations for the administration and enforcement of the Mental Hygiene article and for the operation and administration of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, that the Secretary, in exercise of such authority, could set the standard of proof in judicial proceedings, including those related to matters completely independent of his responsibilities, duties, and jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Furthermore, the judicial release procedure set forth in \u00a7 15 should not be entwined or confused with the Department\u2019s administrative release procedure in Reg. 10.04.03. The burdens are different, the standards are different and certainly the tribunals are different. There is no constitutional requirement that procedural protection, from whatever source it may emanate, be reduced to the lowest common denominator. The Department\u2019s administrative procedure does not supplant a civil committee\u2019s application for judicial release. Rather, it provides an additional route to release, more as an administrative safeguard to the Department, than as a substitute for judicial release. The judicial release procedure remains available to civil, as well as criminal, patients,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and when invoked the same standards are applied, including the assigned burden of proof to both classifications of committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Since the judicial release procedure is available to all, it appears that appellant\u2019s real complaint is that he is denied equal protection because the additional administrative release procedure available to civil committees is not available to criminal committees. However, if that is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>crux of his claim, he has missed an important procedural step. Appellant has not applied for administrative release and been denied access to that procedure. Instead, he immediately sought judicial release under the statute. Perhaps more significantly, he did not argue in the circuit court that he was entitled to the administrative procedure. Having failed to do so, he cannot now protest what he perceives to be an unconstitutional dearth of an administrative remedy. Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Even if appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied equal protection were properly before us, he assumes a proposition with which we would have to disagree: that the judicial procedure affords less protection than would the administrative procedure. Conceding that the procedures are not equal (i.e., the same), the protections afforded judicially are no less than those afforded administratively. That concern went to its repose in the persuasive Fourth Circuit opinion of <em>Dower v. Boslow, </em>539 F. 2d 969. The alleged unequal protection argued there was the variance in the standards of proof between the judicial release procedure for defective delinquents committed to Patuxent Institute pursuant to Md. Code, Art. 31B, \u00a7 5, and the same administrative procedure regulation protested here. Judge Craven, writing for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cWe are unable to conclude that a person is afforded less protection by a <em>judicial procedure </em>which requires proof by a <em>preponderance of the evidence, </em>but which also grants the important right of <em>jury trial, </em>than he is given by an <em>administrative procedure </em>before a single <em>hearing officer, </em>even though the state is required there to prove the issue by <em>clear and convincing evidence. </em>We are inclined to think it may be greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">New lawyers, we think, would give up trial by jury in favor of a higher burden of proof before an administrative officer. The right to a jury may well more than counterbalance a difference in standard of proof. Indeed, in a similar context the Supreme Court held that failure to provide \u2018judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>before a jury\u2019 to persons committed at the expiration of his criminal sentence, where that right was afforded to those involuntarily committed outside the criminal context, denied equal protection.\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Dower v. Boslow, </em>539 F. 2d at 972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">This brings us to the second portion of appellant\u2019s equal protection claim. During oral argument he informed us that the \u201ccustomary trial procedure\u201d in nisi prius courts is to assign different burdens of proof to petitioners seeking judicial release under \u00a7 15, depending upon whether the petitioner was committed under a civil or criminal commitment procedure. If civilly committed, the Department is given the burden of proving insanity. Appellant contends that, by contrast, because he was a criminal committee, he was given the burden of proving sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">This argument is conjectural, not a matter of evidence in the record and surely not a proper subject of judicial notice. Even if appellant\u2019s information is correct, we would have to take judicial notice that the trial courts generally apply erroneous standards and further find that appellant was denied equal protection because the judge in his case did <em>not </em>err. The contradiction in that premise is apparent. We are concerned, therefore, only with whether the trial judge in this case properly assigned the burden of proof to appellant when he charged the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201c ... the burden of proving the issues to you rests with the Plaintiff.\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">not with what other nisi prius judges may have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Unhesitatingly, we hold that the judge in this case was correct in assigning appellant the burden of proving his sanity. If appellant\u2019s general procedural postulate is correct, we assume the erring judges will mend their ways and place the burden upon the petitioner in hearings upon application for judicial release pursuant to \u00a7 15, whether the petitioner was committed civilly or criminally.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">One guideline often followed in placing the risk of failure of proof is to put it upon the party who seeks to change the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>present state of affairs or who contends that the more unusual event has occurred. McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>(2d ed.) Ch. 36, \u00a7 337; but see 14 Vand.L.Rev. 807, 817-818. In most cases, however, the party who has the burden of pleading a fact or who has the affirmative of an issue will have the burden of producing evidence of the fact and of persuading the jury of its existence. See <em>Operations Research v. Davidson, </em>241 Md. 550, 574; <em>Burgess v. Lloyd, </em>7 Md. 178, 196-197. The pleadings, therefore, provide the common guide for apportioning the burden of proof. McCormick, <em>op. cit, </em>\u00a7 337. This is so even though one has the burden of proving a negative fact as part of his cause of action. See <em>Burgess v. Lloyd, supra, </em>7 Md. at 196. It is thus of no moment whether appellant\u2019s burden is viewed affirmatively, as having to prove that he is sane, or negatively, as having to prove that he is not insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In the absence of prior adjudication, sanity is presumed by law. See <em>McCloskey v. Director, </em>245 Md. 497, 504; <em>Higgins v. Carleton and Scaggs, </em>28 Md. 115, 141-142. That presumption is overcome when an accused pleading not guilty by reason of insanity produces sufficient evidence to raise a doubt as to his sanity in the mind of a reasonable man. <em>Strawderman v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 689, 698. Having overcome the presumption of sanity in defense of his homicide case as a matter of public judicial record, appellant may no longer rely upon a presumption of sanity. <em>Cf. Salinger v. Superintendent, </em>206 Md. 623, 631.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His present status, derived from his adjudication of insanity, is that he is not sane. To alter this state of affairs, appellant must act affirmatively by asserting his sanity under \u00a7 15, and follow with sufficient proof to overcome the inertia of the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>facts. We hold that Judge Grady properly instructed the jury that appellant had the burden of \u201cproving the issues. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We have scrutinized appellant\u2019s contentions from every angle, but fail to see that appellant has been denied equal protection because society is protected from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">.
