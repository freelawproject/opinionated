Wright and his wife, Oreva C. Wright, filed a second amended bill of complaint in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City seeking, among other things, an accounting of sums allegedly due them under a \u201cpercentage rental\u201d clause in a \u201cLease Agreement\u201d with Frank J. Trotta and Florence Trotta, his wife, two of the appellees here. After lengthy pre-trial proceedings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the case came on for trial before the chancellor on 2 February 1976. The evidence submitted to the chancellor consisted of various exhibits and stipulations of the parties. No testimony was taken or depositions offered. By decree dated 26 February 1976, the chancellor dismissed the second amended bill with prejudice and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">By the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d, dated 19 June 1970, the Wrights leased to the Trottas premises in Baltimore City known as No. 2910 Edmondson Avenue, improved by a two-story brick building, for a term beginning 1 July 1970 and ending 30 June 1976, to be followed by another term beginning 1 July 1976 and ending 30 June 1980. The lease provided that \u201c[t]hese consecutive terms shall end and begin, respectively, without notice and each is noncancellable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Prior to leasing 2910 Edmondson Avenue to the Trottas, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Mr. Wright had used the premises as headquarters for selling memberships in his \u201cCar Care Club\u201d, an automobile club that apparently offered various services to its motorist members, such as payment for legal services incurred by members and payment for towing and emergency road services.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Also located at 2910 Edmondson Avenue, prior to the lease, was Broker\u2019s Insurance Service, an insurance agency operated by Dianne D. McNaney, Mr. Wright\u2019s daughter, who then held a valid license to sell insurance. Mr. Wright\u2019s insurance license was cancelled in 1969. On the same date the lease was executed McNaney sold her insurance business to Mr. Trotta. The sales agreement provided that within 15 days of the date of the lease Trotta \u201cshall form a corporation to conduct a general insurance agency\u201d and that he \u201cassign this Agreement to said Corporation and . . . have the Corporation assume the obligations imposed upon the Buyer by this Agreement. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The Lease Agreement between the Wrights and the Trottas likewise required the Trottas to form a corporation \u201cwhich shall conduct the business of a general insurance agency\u201d and a second corporation to \u201cconduct the business of an automobile, travel or motorists\u2019 service club\u201d, and to assign the lease to both corporations \u201cjointly and severally\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The rent clause of the lease provided for a \u201cfixed rental\u201d plus a \u201cpercentage rental\u201d for each term of the lease. In pertinent part the rent clause for the first term reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201c(a) Fixed Rental: the yearly sum of three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars in monthly installments, each in advance in the amount of Two hundred Fifty ($250.00) dollars, beginning for the first thereof on the first day of July, 1970, and continuing thereafter on the first day of each succeeding month during the continuation of this Lease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">(b) Percentage Rental: the further sums of money equal to the percentages of \u2018gross sales\u2019 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u2018gross writings\u2019 or by whatever name the businesses of the Lessees shall be known, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">(1) a sum equal to two and one-half (2V2%) percent of the gross premiums on <em>all insurance policies written, by or through the insurance business conducted at the demised premises.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">(2) a sum equal to twenty-five (25%) percent of the fee \u2014 by what ever name it be known \u2014 charged for <em>each automobile, travel or motorists\u2019 service club membership written by, through and/or for the Lessees in the State of Maryland', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">(3) a sum equal to five (5%) percent of the fee \u2014 by whatever name it be known \u2014 charged for each automobile, travel or motorists\u2019 club membership written by, through and/or for the Lessees for <em>residents of States other than Maryland.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">The aforesaid percentage rentals are cumulative, not only each with the other, but also with the fixed rental specified in sub-paragraph (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">As of the close of business on Friday of each week during the continuation of this Lease, and beginning for the first thereof on June 26th, 1970, the Lessees shall prepare and deliver to the Lessors at the place then fixed for payment of Rent, a sworn statement of gross writings of insurance policies and auto club memberships \u2014 as immediately hereinbefore defined \u2014 for the week then just ended. With each such weekly statement, the Lessees shall pay the percentage rental for that week, calculated as hereinbefore specified.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">By an addendum to the lease, the Trottas \u201cassume[d] the obligations of any memberships in the Car Care Club existing at the date of this lease\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In August 1970, pursuant to the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d the lease was assigned to Broker\u2019s Insurance Service, Inc. and International Travel Club, Inc., both of which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>apparently wholly owned and controlled by Mr. Trotta and through which he operated both an insurance agency and a motor club business at the leased premises on Edmondson Avenue. It appears from the stipulations submitted at trial that Mr. Trotta also owned and operated another insurance agency known as Howard Insurance Service, located at 635-37 North Howard Street in Baltimore City. The record does not reveal when this latter agency was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">It was further stipulated that \u201cthere has been an accounting of the rents ... in accord with the percentage rental agreement through and up to August 7, 1971 on a weekly basis, but there has been no accounting since then\u201d; that the \u201cbase rent\u201d (i.e. the \u201cfixed rental\u201d of $250 per month) had been paid through November 1972; that \u201con December 6th, 1973 no business was being conducted on the premises known as 2910 Edmondson Avenue; and that \u201cthe tenancy was terminated on 2910 Edmondson Avenue by a letter dated May 20, 1974 .. . from [the Trottas\u2019 trustee] to Mr. Frank J. Trotta\u201d. It further appears from the exhibits that the Wrights\u2019 trustee sold the property on May 31, 1974, to a party unrelated to these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The chancellor dismissed the second amended bill of complaint because he felt, as argued by appellees, that payments to the Wrights under the \u201cpercentage rental\u201d clause of the lease was a violation of \u00a7 167 of Art. 48A of the Maryland Code (1972 Repl. vol.) and therefore the Wrights could not enforce the clause. Section 167 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">\u201c(a) <em>License required to act as agent or broker. </em>\u2014 No person shall in this State act as or hold himself out to be an agent or broker, nor shall any person in any manner solicit, negotiate, make or procure insurance covering subjects of insurance resident, located or to be performed in this State, unless then licensed therefor pursuant to this subtitle or not subject to the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided in this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>(b) <em>Agent or broker not to solicit, etc., kinds of insurance for which he is not licensed. </em>\u2014 No agent or broker shall solicit or take application for, negotiate, procure or place for others any kind of insurance for which he is not then qualified and licensed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">(c) <em>Commissions, fees, etc., not to be paid to unlicensed persons. </em>\u2014 No commission, fee, reward, rebate or other consideration <em>for procuring or influencing the procurement of any insurance shall be paid, directly or indirectly, to any person who is not then licensed </em>pursuant to the provisions of this subtitle, except as to the kinds of insurance, types of insurers and transactions exempted from the provisions of this subtitle by \u00a7\u00a7 165 and 171; provided, however, that in the case of life insurance and health insurance the provisions of this section shall not prevent the payment or receipt of commissions on renewal premiums on existing policies or other deferred commissions to or by any person solely because such person has ceased to hold a license to act as agent, or broker except as otherwise provided by this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">(d) <em>Penalty. \u2014 </em>Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500.00 or to imprisonment for not more than 6 months, or both, for each such violation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">It is clear that the requirement of the statute that an insurance agent or broker be licensed by the State is not merely for the purpose of raising revenue. The license is required primarily for the protection of the public and to prevent improper persons from acting as brokers or agents, <em>Goldsmith v. Mfgrs.\u2019 Liability Ins. Co., </em>132 Md. 283, 103 A. 627 (1918); therefore, any contract entered into by an unlicensed person requiring compensation to be paid him \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d, for his services in \u201cprocuring or influencing the procurement of any insurance\u201d can not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>enforced by such person. <em>See Goldsmith, supra, </em>pp. 286-289; 17 Am. Jur. 2d; <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 155 et seq. (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Appellees argue that the Wrights \u201cwere using the guise of a Lease to profit from the sale of insurance, something Appellants could not do directly because they did not have a license\u201d. Under the terms of the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d, there is no doubt that the more insurance and motor club memberships <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the lessees sold the more the Wrights would profit. It does not follow, however, that payment by the Trottas or receipt by the Wrights of the \u201cpercentage rental\u201d pursuant to the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d is violative of \u00a7 167. There is nothing in the lease requiring, directly or indirectly, that the Wrights be paid anything \u201cfor procuring or influencing the procurement of any insurance\u201d; nor is there any evidence that the percentage rent paid the Wrights up to 7 August 1971 or for which they seek an accounting since then, was, or is, in return \u201cfor procuring or influencing the procurement of any insurance\u201d. The consideration for the \u201cpercentage rent\u201d is the use and occupancy of the leased premises, not any activity on the part of the Wrights requiring them to be licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">A precept now firmly established in Maryland and enunciated by the Court of Appeals almost a century ago in <em>Maryland Fertilizing and Manufacturing Company v. Newman, </em>60 Md. 584, 588 (1883), is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cParties have the right to make their contracts in what form they please, provided they consist with the law of the land; and it is the duty of the courts so to construe them, if possible, as to maintain them in their integrity and entirety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">See <em>Mortgage Investors of Washington v. Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Maryland, </em>29 Md. App. 591, 347 A. 2d 647 (1976), <em>cert. granted and affirmed, </em>277 Md. 739 (1976), for the latest recognition of this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>It is also firmly established that one who would avoid a contract on the ground of illegality has the burden of producing evidence to show the illegality. The rule was succinctly stated in <em>McNally v. Moser, </em>210 Md. 127, 122 A. 2d 555 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">\u201cIt was . . . [defendants] who pleaded illegality, it is they who had the duty of producing evidence to show it, and finally, it is they who had the burden of persuading the court that they had established the illegality. One who relies upon illegality, failure of consideration or other affirmative defenses, has imposed upon him the burden of persuasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We find no evidence in the record before us from which the chancellor could properly find the \u201cpercentage rental\u201d clause to be illegal. His fears that \u201cthis arrangement has all of the ingredients for a violation of the statute by way of procuring and influencing\u201d are not enough. This is not to say that in a proper case a lease such as the one before us may not be found to be a mere sham to allow an unlicensed person to engage in activity for which regulatory statutes require him to be licensed. In the case before us, however, there is no evidence that in furtherance of the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d the Wrights, or either of them, were required to or did in fact perform any act for which an insurance license is required. Indeed, the appellees do not claim that the Wrights performed or were required under the lease to perform any such acts, and there is no evidence or claim that the Trottas or their corporate assignees of the lease, in engaging in the insurance and motor club businesses, were acting as agents for the unlicensed Wrights, or that the Wrights otherwise exercised any control over those businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The contention of the appellees is that because Mr. Wright <em>discontinued </em>to sell motor club memberships, because his daughter sold her insurance business, and because the tenants were required to use the premises for the conduct of an insurance business and a motor club business, the \u201cpercentage rental\u201d clause is somehow illegal and may not be enforced. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>A \u201cpercentage rental\u201d clause in a lease is, of course, not <em>per se </em>illegal; nor does such a clause \u201caffect the validity of the relationship of landlord and tenant created by the lease, absent a union of the essential provisions of another distinct legal relationship\u201d. 49 Am. Jur. 2d. <em>Landlord &amp; Tenant, </em>\u00a7 519 (1970). In the case <em>sub judice </em>there is no claim or evidence that the relationship created by the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d was anything other than that of landlord and tenant. Under these circumstances, the fact that a landlord does not have a license to engage in the business conducted by the tenant on the leased premises does not render a \u201cpercentage rental\u201d clause in a lease unenforceable for illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">For the reasons stated, we hold that the chancellor erred in dismissing the second amended bill of complaint against the appellees, Alphonso John Trotta and Florence Kwiatkowski Trotta (the personal representatives of Frank J. Trotta)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Florence Trotta, Brokers Insurance Service, Inc. and International Travel Club, Inc. As to these appellees we think the Wrights are entitled to an accounting of the \u201cpercentage rental\u201d due under the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d and as to them. the case will be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">As to the other appellees captioned as respondents.in the second-amended bill of complaint, we shall affirm the decree of dismissal. These other appellees are Howard Insurance Service, Inc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Charles E. Chian and Howard Travel Club, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The gravamen of the allegations in the second-amended bill of complaint against Howard Insurance Service is that insurance business that allegedly \u201coriginated at No. 2910 Edmondson Ave.\u201d was \u201cdeliberately\u201d referred by the tenants \u201cto the offices at Nos. 635-637 North Howard Street, at which latter address such insurance business has been written by Brokers Insurance Services, Inc. <em>and/or Howard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Insurance </em>Service\u201d, but that Howard Insurance Service and the other appellees \u201cfailed to account to the Complainants for such insurance business and to pay the percentage rent required ... . thus deliberately defrauding the Complainants of their rightful income\u201d. As to Howard Insurance Service there was no evidence offered at trial substantiating these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">As to appellees Charles E. Chian and Howard Travel Club, Inc., of which Chian was the controlling stockholder, the gravamen of the allegations against them is that they were also part of a \u201cdeliberate attempt . . . acting in concert with all the other Respondents ... to defraud the Complainants of the percentage rates to which they are entitled by the terms of the aforesaid lease\u201d. After the stipulated evidence had been presented to the chancellor, the attorney for the appellants told the chancellor, \u201c. . . that the evidence that has been introduced through stipulation would not be sufficient to support our claim against Mr. Chian [and presumably Howard Travel Club, Inc.]. Therefore we would like to reserve the right to put on brief testimony\u201d. The chancellor replied: \u201cWhen we get to his case\u201d. The record shows that appellants never did \u201cget to\u201d the case against Chian or Howard Travel Club, Inc.; therefore, as to them the dismissal of the second-amended bill of complaint was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In this appeal, appellants nevertheless argue that their \u201cposition\u201d against Chian and Howard Travel Club, Inc. is \u201cpreserved\u201d because at the trial they \u201chad not closed the case against the Chian Group\u201d. They do not argue that they were prevented from presenting or proffering evidence to substantiate their allegations against the \u201cChian Group\u201d, only that none was presented because the \u201ctrial court ... expressly stated that the case against the Chian Group must stand or fall with the decision in the case against the Trotta Group\u201d. It is true that the chancellor did indicate, quite correctly we think, that if the \u201cpercentage rental\u201d clause was unenforceable against the Trotta Group (i.e. Mrs. Trotta and Mr. Trotta\u2019s personal representative and the assignee corporations) then the derivative claims against all other appellees-respondents would necessarily fail. This truism, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>however, did not prevent the appellants from offering evidence against the other appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The case below was not presented pursuant to Md. Rule 502 as a separate trial of an issue at law. It was therefore incumbent upon the appellants to present whatever evidence they had to prove their case against all the appellees. As to those appellees against whom they failed to present such evidence nothing is \u201cpreserved\u201d for yet another \u201cday in court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The appellants further contend that \u201cthe trial court erred when it refused to allow the appellants to amend their bill of complaint after hearing on the merits, but before a decree was entered\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">On 5 February 1976, three days after the trial on the merits and prior to the entry of the decree of 26 February 1976 dismissing the second-amended bill of complaint, appellants filed a pleading entitled \u201cStill Further Amendments to the Second Amended Bill of Complaint \u2014 As Amended and as Further Amended \u2014 For an Accounting, For Specific Performance of a Contract, Etc.\u201d The amendments added to the second-amended bill of complaint allegations against the tenants (Mrs. Trotta and Mr. Trotta\u2019s personal representatives and the two assignee corporations) that the \u201cfixed rental\u201d called for by the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d had not been \u25a0 paid since November, 1972, and asked for a money judgment against them for $7270, the amount alleged to be due therefor. On 6 February 1976 the tenants filed a \u201cMotion Ne Recipiatur or To Strike\u201d and a request for a hearing thereon. On 26 February 1976, the chancellor, without hearing, granted appellees\u2019 motion. Appellants have appealed from the chancellor\u2019s order granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Amendments to actions at law or equity are governed by Md. Rule 320 which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201ca. <em>Scope and Purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">1.

This circumstance and: the stipulated fact that the base rent had been paid only through November, 1972 and the further stipulated fact that the tenancy was \u201cterminated\u201d on 20 May 1974, indicate a valid claim for at least part of the base rent claimed by the disallowed amendments, i. e\u201e the base rent from 1 December 1972 to 20 May 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">As we pointed out in <em>Staub v. Staub, </em>31 Md. App. 478, 480 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-19\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that amendments should be freely permitted in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>better to promote the ends of justice. <em>Dart Drug Corp. v.

Zell, </em>12 Md. App. 563, 280 A. 2d 22 (1971). An Amendment should not be allowed, however, if it will result in prejudice to the opponent or will unduly delay the results. <em>Robertson v.

Clark, Law of Code Pleading \u00a7 115, at 708-15 (2d ed. 1947).\u201d 272 Md. at 485.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">As stated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Robertson v. Davis, </em>271 Md. 708, at 709, \u201cThe objective of these rules is to facilitate the attainment of a just, speedy and inexpensive determination of all disputes between the same parties\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">While we recognize that \u201c.. . the allowance or refusal of an amendment is ordinarily within the discretion of a trial court and that no appeal will lie from the action, in the absence of a clear showing of an abuse of discretion,\u201d 272 Md. at 489, we think, in view of the \u201cincreased liberality\u201d allowing amendments as evidenced by the Maryland Rules and decisions applying them, that under the circumstances of this case the amendments should have been allowed.
