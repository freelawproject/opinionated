Stonesifer and Jerome B. Milburn, under Article 101 (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Article) of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The orders were entered on the basis that appellants were receiving pension benefits provided by their employers which were in excess of their workmen\u2019s compensation awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Appellant, Erma V. Stonesifer, sustained an accidental injury while in the course of her employment with the State of Maryland at Spring Grove State Hospital on April 22, 1971. After a hearing on the issue of the nature and extent of her disability, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, on March 8, 1973, awarded her compensation benefits for permanent partial disability in a sum not to exceed $6,125, payable at the rate of $35 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">On May 9, 1970, appellant, Jerome B. Milburn, sustained an accidental injury while in the course of his employment with the Department of Corrections at Patuxent Institution. Upon a hearing on the nature and extent of his disability, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission awarded him, on December 28, 1971, compensation benefits for permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>partial disability in a sum not to exceed $10,680, payable at the rate of $40 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The State Accident Fund, the insurer of appellees, made weekly payments in both cases until July 26, 1974, when it informed appellants that future compensation would be disallowed as they were receiving retirement benefits in excess of compensation under Article 101. It is uncontested that both appellants were receiving more benefits from their respective retirement and pension funds supplied by their employers than they were from the State Accident Fund under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Article 101, \u00a7 33 (c) of the Annotated Code of Maryland, which became effective as of May 28,1971, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cWhenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, any benefit or benefits are furnished employees of employers covered under \u00a7 21 (a) (2) of this article, the dependents and others entitled to benefits under this article as a result of the death of such employees, the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full as the case may be, the liability or obligation of the employer for any benefit under this article. If any benefits so furnished are less than those provided for in this article the employer shall furnish the additional benefit as will make up the difference between the benefit furnished and the similar benefit required in this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Upon appellants\u2019 requests, a hearing was held before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission on the issue of the failure of the employer/insurer to comply with the aforementioned Orders of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission. In both cases the Commission disallowed compensation under Article 101 pursuant to a retroactive application of \u00a7 33 (c). No payments have been made by the State Accident Fund since July 26, 1974. The parties agree that, aside from the merits of appellees\u2019 contention, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>an unpaid balance due Stonesifer of $1,027.89 and one of $3,332.86 due Milburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Appellants filed appeals to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Following a hearing in each case, Judge Kenneth C. Proctor affirmed the Orders of the Workmen\u2019s ,Compensation Commission ruling that \u00a7 33 (c), which became effective May 28, 1971, a date subsequent to the date of injury in both cases, is retroactive and thus encompasses appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Appellants contend that the court below erred when it held \u00a7 33 (c) to be retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We hold that the issue of the retroactivity of \u00a7 33 (c) is irrelevant with regard to appellant, Milburn. Milburn\u2019s injury, as noted above, was sustained on May 9, 1970. The law is clear that a \u201cclaimant\u2019s rights are governed by the statute at the time of the injury and not as of the time of filing the claim.\u201d <em>Mutual, Etc. Co. v. Pinckney, </em>205 Md. 107, 113 (1954). As of May 9, 1970, the relevant law, then embodied in Article 101, \u00a7 33 (a), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201cWhenever and so long as by State law, city charter, or municipal ordinance, provision equal to or better than that given under the terms of this article is made for municipal employees injured in the course of employment, such employees shall not be entitled to the benefits of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In <em>Montgomery County v. Kaponin, </em>237 Md. 112 (1964), the Court of Appeals interpreted this provision as not allowing a set-off when the employer\u2019s retirement plan provided less benefits than that allowed under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Thus, unless the employer\u2019s plan was equal to or better than the Commission\u2019s award, a claimant was allowed to recover twice for the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">\u201cIn what was apparently a delayed reaction to the <em>Kaponin </em>holding, the 1970 General Assembly deleted the provision [\u00a7 33 (a)] from the law. Acts 1970, ch. 741.\u201d <em>Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md. App. 348, 350 (1975). This Act, however, did not take effect until July 1, 1970. As such, applying <em>Mutual, Etc. Co. v. Pinckney, supra, </em>the afore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>mentioned \u00a7 33 (a) was still the applicable law as of May 9,1970, the date of Milburn\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">While <em>Kaponin </em>was decided on the fact that the employer\u2019s retirement plan was less than the award provided under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, in Milburn\u2019s case the benefits provided by his employer\u2019s retirement plan exceeded that of the Commission\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Furthermore, since Milburn is one of the \u201cmunicipal employees\u201d specifically enumerated in \u00a7 33 (a), we reach the inevitable conclusion that he is not entitled to benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act by virtue of his employer\u2019s retirement plan being in excess of that of the Commission\u2019s at the time he sustained his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Stonesifer\u2019s injury was sustained on April 22, 1971. Thus, it is clear that her claim is not affected in any manner by former \u00a7 33 (a), the repeal of which became effective on July 1, 1970. We note that the General Assembly did not enact a new law on the issue of an employer\u2019s retirement and pension plan vis-a-vis recovery under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act until the Acts of 1971, ch. 785 (the present \u00a7 33 (c) of Art. 101), the effective date of which was May 28, 1971. It was during this eleven month \u201cgap\u201d that Stonesifer was injured, namely, April 22, 1971. Thus, unless \u00a7 33 (c) is to be applied retroactively, Stonesifer will be allowed to receive under both her employer\u2019s retirement plan and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The prevailing rule with regard to a statute\u2019s retroactivity <em>vel non </em>was stated by this Court in <em>Wittel v. Baker, </em>10 Md. App. 531, 539 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">\u201c[T]he courts, under the cardinal rule, should ascertain whether the legislative intent was to have an Act apply prospectively or retrospectively and give that intention effect. When the legislature provides in the Act how it is to be applied the legislative intent is clear. When it does not so expressly or implicitly provide, certain presumptions arise as an aid in determining the legislative intent. \u2018The general presumption is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>all statutes, State and federal, are intended to operate prospectively and the presumption is found to have been rebutted only if there are clear expressions in the statute to the contrary. Retroactivity], even where permissible, is not favored and is not found, except upon the plainest mandate in the Act.\u2019 * * * \u2018This rule of construction is particularly applicable where the statute adversely affects substantive rights rather than only altering procedural machinery.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In our view, whether an injured employee is allowed to recover under two compensation plans or just one is clearly a question of substantive right. Thus, following the dictates of <em>Wittel v. Baker, supra, </em>unless there are \u201cclear expressions\u201d in \u00a7 33 (c) that it is to be applied retroactively, the presumption is that it was intended by the Legislature to be prospective only. Appellees stress the fact that since \u00a7 33 (c) begins with the word \u201c[w]henever,\u201d it was the intention of the General Assembly that the statute be retroactive. We do not deem this to be a \u201cclear expression\u201d of the Legislature\u2019s intent. Moreover, \u201c[t]he Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u201d <em>Keene v. Insley, </em>26 Md. App. 1, 11 (1975). We conclude that \u00a7 33 (c) is not to be given retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Judgment as to appellant, Mil-bum, affirmed; Milbum to pay one-half the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\n<em>Judgment as to appellant, Stonesifer, reversed; appellee to pay one-half the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
