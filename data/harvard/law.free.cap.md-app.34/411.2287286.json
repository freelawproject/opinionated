By stipulation, Howard County, Maryland was permitted to intervene as a party defendant (County).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The chancellor passed a decree declaring, among other things:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\u201cThat the sum of $191,400.00 which was paid by the Petitioners on August 14, 1975 to the Clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the Circuit Court of Howard County, as being the amount of recordation tax due on the aforesaid instrument recorded among the Land Records of Howard County in Liber C.M.P.

Before any additional debt is incurred which is to be secured by an instrument previously recorded, the debtor shall file with the clerks of the courts with which such instrument has been recorded a duly verified statement showing the amount of such additional debt and shall pay the tax with respect thereto upon, but only upon, the amount of such additional debt so secured which has been incurred after May 31, 1937, and with respect to which such tax shall not theretofore have been paid, less the principal amount of any debt then outstanding and secured by such instrument which is to be paid or refunded out of the proceeds of such additional debt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\n<em>The Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">We find <em>Hammond v. Phila. Elec. Pwr. Co., </em>192 Md. 179, 63 A. 2d 759 (1949), to be dispositive of the subject dispute. In <em>Hammond, </em>the Power Company in 1946 issued what it called a supplemental indenture authorizing the issuance of $30,000,000.00 worth of 25/s% bonds to redeem outstanding 5V2% bonds in the same amount that had been issued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>conjunction with a mortgage that had been executed in 1926. The Court of Appeals, after discussion of decisions in other jurisdictions that had turned upon the issue whether the particular document was a \u201cnew\u201d or a \u201csupplemental\u201d instrument, said at 189-90 [764]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">\u201cThe debt, therefore, is the important factor. In the case before us the debt is the same, at least to the extent of the unpaid bonds outstanding under the mortgage of February 1, 1926. The creditors are not the same, but the trustee representing them is. The old mortgage is not extinguished, and its lien is preserved. The words at the end of Sec. 220 (sub-section (k)), in our opinion, contemplate an exemption from the tax for any debt by an original mortgage which is to be refunded. ... we cannot see how the appellees can be compelled to pay the recordation tax in the face of our statutory provision. Refunding cannot be accomplished through the same instrument which creates the original debt without some additional agreement, and to suppose that the legislature intended to exempt only such refunding as can be done through the original mortgage alone is to convict it of enacting an absurdity. If the refunding is accomplished without the need of the original mortgage, then the new instrument is not supplemental, but original, and the tax must be paid. But if the lien of the old instrument is retained, only the evidence of the same debt is changed, if the new instrument cannot operate without the retention of the old, then we think the last is supplemental to the first within the meaning of our statute, and is exempted from the tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In the subject case, the indebtedness secured by the document in question included $81,662,689.00 in unpaid obligations outstanding under the prior deeds of trust. The creditors are the same. The trustee representing the creditors is the same. The full force and effect of all of the prior deeds of trust remain after the terms of the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>take effect. The liens of those prior deeds of trust are preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We are persuaded that the subject document effected a refunding of the original deeds of trust but with retention of the liens of those prior instruments. In such a case, when the modifying document includes a previously unsecured obligation, the recordation tax properly will be calculated only upon that previously untaxed obligation and may not be levied upon the sums so refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Otherwise stated, the recordation tax in the subject case may be levied only upon \u201cthe amount of such additional debt [created by the instrument] and [the taxpayer] shall pay the tax with respect thereto upon, but only upon, the amount of such additional debt so secured.\u201d Article 81, \u00a7 277 (k), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Howard County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\">. The parties executing the document were: The Howard Research and Development Corporation, Columbia Industrial Development Corporation, 95-32 Corporation, 95-216 Corporation, Premble, Inc., Columbia Mall, Inc., Oakland Ridge Industrial Development Corporation, and The Columbia Development Corporation, as Grantors, and Maryland National Bank, as Trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\">.
