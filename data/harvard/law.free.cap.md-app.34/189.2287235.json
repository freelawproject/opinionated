That collateral estoppel did not arise out of the prior litigation, because such litigation lacked both identity of parties and identity of subject matter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">2. That the statute and ordinance impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of United States Constitution Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 (see footnote 2, <em>supra) </em>in that (a) the obligations of tenants were increased and (b) the rights of landlords were enlarged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">3. That the statute and ordinance is violative of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (see footnote 3, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The chancellor held that prior litigation created conditions whereby the doctrine of collateral estoppel in substantial measure barred constitutional attack upon the enabling act and the County bill by complainants in the subject case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">For reasons to be hereafter stated, we disagree and are compelled to reverse for error of law. In such circumstances this Court ordinarily would be required to remand to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to permit that court to address the substantive constitutional issues. Counsel for all parties have, however, submitted the case to this Court for final adjudication and judgment upon the facts set forth in the record, pursuant to Maryland Rule 1075 c.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We shall, accordingly, pass upon all questions of fact and law arising in the case and enter final judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\n<em>Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The complainants in the subject case are: (1) tenants in multifamily residential units in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, including military personnel receiving quarters allowances lesser in amount than the rental charges for their rented premises; or (2) limited partnership owners of 428 rental multifamily residential units in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland; or (3) management agents for owners of rental multifamily residential units in Prince George\u2019s County; or (4) officers of corporate owners or agents of owners of rental multifamily residential units in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The action was instituted as a class action under Maryland Rule 209.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 c of that Rule the chancellor required publication of notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>pendency of the litigation in three Prince George\u2019s County newspapers of record as designated by \u00a7 1008 of the County Charter and required the posting of such notice upon the Court House door.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\n<em>The Prior Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The litigation suggested as giving rise to the operation of the doctrine of collateral estoppel barring prosecution of the subject action is a cause entitled Landon Court Tenant Association and others <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> against Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland and the County Executive (Landon Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The prior litigation had sought a declaration that Chapter 897 of the Laws of Maryland 1975 (earlier enabling act) and CB 93-1975 (earlier County bill) were unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The constitutionality of the earlier enabling act and the earlier County bill was upheld by the chancellor. The complainants in Landon Court, having reserved the issues for consideration of the Court in Banc, Maryland Rule 510, were thereby foreclosed from further appeal after affirmance by the latter tribunal. Constitution of Maryland, Article IV, Section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">County argues that the final order of the Court in Banc in Landon Court declaring Ch. 897 of the Laws of Maryland 1975 and CB 93-1975 to be constitutional gave rise to collateral estoppel by judgment as to the enabling act and the County bill now at issue in the subject case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">In <em>Davis v. Frederick County, </em>25 Md. App. 68, 334 A. 2d 165 (1975), we said at 74 [168]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">\u201cIn Maryland the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>or estoppel by judgment, consists of two branches, direct estoppel by judgment and collateral estoppel by judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">In either case the bar of the doctrine does not arise unless there is identity of subject matter and identity of parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>prior litigation concluded on its merits in a court of competent jurisdiction. <em>DeMaio v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual, </em>247 Md. 30, 34, 230 A. 2d 279, 281 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\n<em>Identity of Subject Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The declaration in Landon Court sustained the constitutionality of the earlier enabling act and the earlier County bill. A comparison of that statute and that ordinance with the enabling act (Ch. 925 of the Laws of Maryland 1976) and the County Bill (CB 77-1976) that are attacked in the subject proceedings demonstrates the absence of an identity of subject matter in the subject litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>Differences in the Enabling Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The legislative authority to Prince George\u2019s County conferred by the subject enabling act granted the following <em>entirely new rights </em>to the County:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">1. The right to provide that \u201cthe operator or owner of a multifamily residential unit shall... be personally liable for the remittance of all taxes due at intervals as set by the governing body\u201d; (Ch. 925 \u00a7 (c)(1))</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">2. The right to provide that \u201cthe operator or owner of a multifamily residential unit . . . shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from the lessee or in respect to non-payment of the tax by the lessee, as if the tax were a part of the rental fee charged and payable when the same is due\u201d; (Ch. 925 \u00a7 (c)(2))</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">3. The right to provide \u201cfor the payment of reasonable costs, in such amounts and in a manner as set by the governing body, to the owner or operator of a multifamily residential unit for the collection and remittance .of this tax\u201d; (Ch. 925 \u00a7 (c)(4))</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">4. The right to provide \u201cfor enforcement or collection of this tax against the landlord or the tenant at law or in equity\u201d; (Ch. 925 \u00a7 (c)(7))</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">5. The right to provide \u201cfor the Director of Finance ... to collect the tax . . . and to make, adopt and amend such rules and regulations as are reasonably necessary and proper to fully collect this tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Other differences, minor in character, related, in sum, to changes in the amounts of money giving rise to a tenant\u2019s liability for or exemption from the authorized tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\n<em>Differences in the County Bills</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The subject County bill enacted by Prince George\u2019s County to implement the subject enabling act made the following <em>entirely new changes in the law:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">1. Imposed personal liability upon landlord for the tax collected or to be collected (CB 77-1976-8 b, c, d), but holds harmless any landlord who acted in good faith to collect the tax, (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-8 e) and establishes standards for determination of \u201cgood faith\u201d (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-6 c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">2. Defined housing subsidy to exclude quarters allowance to military personnel (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-6 e).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">3. Required detailed monthly reports by landlord to Director of Finance (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-8 h).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asi\">4.

Imposed a civil penalty upon landlord for refusal to collect tax (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-9 b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-17\">6. Allowed landlord a credit from collected rent to compensate for cost of collection and remittance (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-10 a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-19\">7. Provided procedures to permit landlord or tenant to obtain refunds for taxes \u201cerroneously or mistakenly paid.\u201d (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-11).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-21\">8. Empowered Director of Finance to make rules and regulations. (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-12).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-23\">Other new provisions of lesser substantive significance included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-24\">(a) Elimination of exemption previously allowed to persons under the age of eighteen years (CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-6 d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(b) Elimination of particular reference to benefits derived from Federal Civil Service in definition of gross income.

(CB 77-1976 \u00a7 75-8 a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">(h) Providing detailed procedures for determination of a tenant\u2019s right to exemption. (CB 77-1976, \u00a7 75-8 g).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">In <em>Commissioner v. Sunnen, </em>333 U. S. 591, 599-601, 92 L. Ed. 898, 907, 68 S. Ct. 715, 720-21 (1948), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-15\">\u201cAnd so where two cases involve income taxes in different taxable years, collateral estoppel must be used with its limitations carefully in mind so as to avoid injustice. It must be confined to situations where the matter raised in the second suit is identical in all respects with that decided in the first proceeding and where the controlling facts and applicable legal rules remain unchanged. Tait v. Western Maryland R. Co. (US) supra. If the legal matters determined in the earlier case differ from those raised in the second case, collateral estoppel has no bearing on the situation. See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Commissioner (CCA 2d) 161 F2d 93. And where the situation is vitally altered between the time of the first judgment and the second, the prior determination is not conclusive. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Duel, 324 US 154, 162, 89 L ed 812, 818, 65 S Ct 573; 2 Freeman, Judgments 5th ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>(1925) \u00a7 713. As demonstrated by Blair v. Commissioner, 300 US 5, 9, 81 L ed 465,469,57' S Ct 330, a judicial declaration intervening between the two proceedings may so change the legal atmosphere as to render the rule of collateral estoppel inapplicable. But the intervening decision need not necessarily be that of a state court, as it was in the Blair Case. While such a state court decision may be considered as having changed the facts for federal tax litigation purposes, a modification or growth in legal principles as enunciated in intervening decisions of this Court may also effect a significant change in the situation. Tax inequality can result as readily from neglecting legal modulations by this Court as from disregarding factual changes wrought by state courts. In either event, the supervening decision cannot justly be ignored by blind reliance upon the rule of collateral estoppel. Henricksen v. Seward (CCA 9th Wash) 135 F2d 986, 988, 989, 150 ALR 1; Pelham Hall Co. v. Hassett (CCA 1st Mass) 147 F2d 63, 68, 69; Commissioner v. Arundel-Brooks Concrete Corp. (CCA 4th) 152 F2d 225, 227, 162 ALR 1200; Corrigan v. Commissioner (CCA 6th) 155 F2d 164, 165; and see West Coast L. Ins. Co. v. Merced Irrig. Dist. (CCA 9th Cal) 114 F2d 654, 661, 662, 44 Am Bankr NS 91; contra: Commissioner v. Western U. Teleg. Co. (CCA 2d) 141 F2d 774, 778. It naturally follows that an interposed alteration in the pertinent statutory provisions or Treasury regulations can make the use of that rule unwarranted. Tait v. Western Maryland R. Co. supra (289 US 625, 77 L ed 1408, 53 S Ct 706).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>See also </em>Annotation 162 ALR 1204, <em>et seq., </em>particularly 1210-14; Annotation 150 ALR 5, <em>et seq. Compare State Tax Commission v. Bullis School, </em>218 Md. 558, 147 A. 2d 849 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">We regard the changes of substance and procedure effected by the subject enabling act and the subject County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>bill to be so extensive in character as to cause the doctrine of collateral estoppel to be inapplicable in the subject litigation. <em>State Tax Commission v. Bullis School, supra, </em>at 563 [852].</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Weaver further suggests that because of the absence of <em>actual </em>identity of parties, coupled with the circumstance that in Landon Court no notice was given to \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests of the persons on whose behalf the action [was] brought\u201d (Rule 209 c), the prior litigation did not bar the right to litigate the subject cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">With respect to the requirement that the identity of parties must be shown, there can be no doubt that <em>actual identity </em>of parties is not a requisite in class actions. In <em>Hansberry v. Lee, </em>311 U. S. 32, 40-41, 61 S. Ct. 115, 117-18, 85 L. Ed. 22, 26 (1940), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201cIt is a principle of general application in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process. A judgment rendered in such circumstances is not entitled to the full faith and credit which the Constitution and statute of the United States prescribe and judicial action enforcing it against the person or property of the absent party is not that due process which the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201cTo these general rules there is a recognized exception that, to an extent not precisely defined by judicial opinion, the judgment in a \u2018class\u2019 or \u2018representative\u2019 suit, to which some members of the class are parties, may bind members of the class or those represented who were not made parties to it.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Having previously concluded however, that the Landon Court litigation did not possess such identity of subject matter as would give rise to collateral estoppel, we do not reach the question whether the litigation involved the necessary identity of parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\n<em>The Constitutional Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The appellants in brief and argument in this Court have limited their constitutional attack as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">1. The 1976 Renters Tax is a property tax and not an excise tax [in violation of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">2. The 1976 Renter\u2019s Tax Impairs the obligation of Contracts [in violation of Article I Section 10 of the Constitution of the United States],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\n<em>Article 15, Maryland Declaration of Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">We do not regard the subject tax as a property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">In <em>Herman v. Baltimore, </em>189 Md. 191, 55 A. 2d 491 (1947), it was said at 197-98 [495]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">\u201cA property tax is assessed on property by reason of ownership alone \u2014 or of the exercise of any one of substantially all the rights that constitute ownership. Excises have been defined as taxes laid upon the manufacture, sale or consumption of commodities within the country, upon licenses to pursue certain occupations, and upon corporate privileges. <em>Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, </em>7th Ed., 680; 1 <em>Cooley, Law of Taxation, </em>4th Ed., sec. 42; <em>Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., </em>220 U. S. 107, 31 S. Ct. 342, 349, 55 L. Ed. 389, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; <em>Blaustein v. Levin, </em>176 Md. 423, 4 A. 2d 861. Unless a third class of taxes, neither property nor excise, is recognized (which except perhaps with respect to federal taxes could serve no useful purpose), it seems convenient to regard excises as including all internal taxes that are not property taxes, <em>e.g., </em>most of the new taxes introduced during this century. So regarded, excises include income taxes <em>(State v. Philadelphia, W. &amp; B. R. Co., </em>45 Md. 361, 379, 24 Am. Rep. 511; <em>Oursler v. Tawes, </em>178 Md. 471, 481, 485, 486, 13 A. 2d 763; <em>Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. Co., </em>240 U. S. 1, 17, 36 S. Ct. 236, 60 L.

Cas. 1917B, 713) and new taxes on the exercise of incidents of ownership short of mere ownership itself. The nature of a tax must be determined by its operatipn, rather than by any particular descriptive language which may have been applied to it. <em>Educational Films Corporation of America v. Ward, </em>282 U. S. 379, 51 S. Ct. 170, 75 L. Ed. 400, 71 A. L. R. 1226.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">A case quite similar factually was before the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Ampco Printing-Adv. Off. Corp. v. City of New York, </em>247 NYS2d 865, 14 N.Y.2d 11 (1964). In that case the Court dealt with a rental tax imposed by New York City under an enabling act authorizing \u201ccities having a population of one million or more\" to tax \u201cpersons occupying premises in such city for the purpose of carrying on or exercising any trade, business, vocation or commercial activity, measured by the rent paid for the use or occupancy of such premises.\u201d The local law provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cevery tenant of taxable premises is required, after June 1, 1963, to pay a tax of 2V2% of his base rent. .. .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The decision made it plain that if the tax thus imposed was a tax on real estate the legislation and ordinance would be void under the New York State Constitution. The Court rejected the contention that the legislation imposed a tax on real estate, saying at 869-70 [21]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cWe are not persuaded by the plaintiffs contention that the economic impact of the tax is equivalent to a tax on real estate and that, therefore, it should be treated as coming within the constitutional limitation. After observing that ownership of real property includes the right to use it and to lease it for use by others, the plaintiffs conclude that a tax on the use of real estate is a tax on the real estate itself. Such reasoning has been repeatedly rejected. (See, e. g., Bromley v. McCaughn, 280 U.S. 124, 50 S.Ct. 46, 74 L.Ed. 226; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U.S. 308, 314-315; 57 S.

Ed. 226):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u2018While taxes levied upon or collected from persons because of their general ownership of property may be taken to be direct, Pollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429, 15 S.Ct. 673, 39 L.Ed. 759; Id., 158 U.S. 601, 15 S.Ct. 912, 39 L.Ed. 1108, this court has consistently held almost from the foundation of the government, that a <em>tax imposed upon a particular use of property or the exercise of a single power over property incidental to ownership, is an excise </em>which need not be apportioned, and it is enough for present purposes that this tax is of the latter class.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We adopt the rationale of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Ampco, supra, </em>and find that the tax here imposed is an excise tax and thus not proscribed by Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights. <em>See Reinhardt v. Anne Arundel Co., </em>31 Md. App. 355, 370, 356 A. 2d 917, 925 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The only case to the contrary we have found is <em>Florida Revenue Commission v. Maas Brothers, Inc., </em>226 S.2d 849 (D. Ct. of Appeal 1st Dist., Fla. 1969). We reject its rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">We regard <em>Anne Arundel County v. English, </em>182 Md. 514, 35 A. 2d 135 (1943) to be inapposite. In <em>English </em>the Legislature imposed a fixed annual tax upon the owners of specific personalty (trailers) without regard to value. The Court of Appeals pointed out that the Legislature could not, by describing the legislation as a \u201cuse\u201d tax alter its actual character, saying at 531 [143]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">\u201cThe legislative designation is entitled to much weight, but it is not controlling. It cannot be made an occupation or license tax by calling it so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\n<em>United States Constitution, Article I, Section 10, Clause 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The impairment of contracts contention is without merit. All leases, whether or not antecedent to a taxing statute, are subject to the State\u2019s power to tax. If the taxing statute is within that power there is no impairment of a contract. <em>Lake Superior Consolidated Iron Mines v. Lord, </em>271 U. S. 577, 70 L. Ed. 1093, 46 S. Ct. 627 (1926); <em>Barwise v. Sheppard, </em>299 U. S. 33, 81 L. Ed. 23, 57 S. Ct. 70 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>The Ultra Vires Declaration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The enabling act, authorizing passage of the taxing ordinance, required that there be incorporated within the latter an exemption, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201ca multifamily residential unit .. . occupied by a family receiving a housing subsidy.\u201d Ch. 925 \u00a7 75-4 d(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The County bill included a provision exempting facilities \u201coccupied by a family receiving a housing subsidy\u201d (CB 1976 \u00a7 75-7 c (3)) but included as well a definition of \u201chousing subsidy\u201d reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u201cDirect or indirect payments by the federal or state government, payable to either a tenant or to a landlord on behalf of a tenant where the amount is based on the tenant\u2019s income or ability to pay and used exclusively for the payment of rent. <em>This term, shall not include quarters allowances or similar military housing allowances.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) (CB 1976 \u00a7 75-6 e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">The issue, in short, involved determination whether the amount paid to military personnel for \u201coff post\u201d housing allowances is a housing subsidy. The chancellor declared that it was. We think it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">In <em>Perdue v. State Dept. of Assess. &amp; T., </em>264 Md. 228, 286 A. 2d 165 (1972), it was said at 232-33 [167]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\u201cIt is fundamental that statutory tax exemptions are strictly construed in favor of the taxing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>authority and if any real doubt exists as to the propriety of an exemption that doubt <em>must </em>be resolved in favor of the State. In other words, \u2018to doubt an exemption is to deny it.\u2019 <em>Pan Am. Sulphur v. State Dept., </em>251 Md. 620, 629, 248 A. 2d 354 (1968). . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">We think that the words \u201chousing subsidy\u201d as used in the enabling act must be interpreted in the light of the circumstance that State and Federal housing subsidy programs are intended to benefit families of limited income or to effect housing rehabilitation, or both. <em>See </em>42 USCA \u00a7 1401; Maryland Code Article 41, \u00a7 257K, 257L.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u201cHousing allowances\u201d to military personnel vary widely in amount, depending upon the rank of the individual concerned from the lowest to the highest. Title 37 USCA \u00a7 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We think it plain that the Legislature did not intend that a multifamily unit occupied by a general officer or admiral in the Armed Forces whose basic pay exceeds $1200.00 monthly (Title 37 USCA \u00a7 203) should be exempt from payment of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Of course, military personnel whose income falls within the general exemption limitations provided by the ordinance would be entitled to the benefit accorded thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Incorporation of the provisions of CB 1976 \u00a7 75 6 e within the County bill did not exceed the powers of the County Council and was not an <em>ultra vires </em>act.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\n<em>Declaration and order affirmed in part and reversed in part and case remanded for passage of an amended declaration and order consistent urith this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\n<em>Costs to be paid one-half by appellants and one-half by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-14\">.
