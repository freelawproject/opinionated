The judgments were also entered against Alex Luciano and Alex Luciano Company, Inc. by the direction of the trial judge, but no appeal has been filed by the Lucianos. Garden filed a cross-claim against Alex Luciano and Alex Luciano Company, Inc. which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>submitted to the judge without intervention of the jury and he gave a judgment in favor of the cross-defendants. Garden also appeals from the denial of its cross-claim. Regional Management Incorporated was originally a defendant but received a directed verdict in its favor. There is no appeal from the judgment entered on that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On September 25, 1971, Gertrude Sajdak was standing on a concrete slab which constituted the base of the rear porch of the dwelling located at 5911 Laclede Road, Baltimore, and her daughter, Gertrude Russo, was standing beneath the porch attempting to unlock the cellar door, when the porch collapsed causing severe injuries to both of them. Mrs. Russo and her husband at the time of the accident were tenants in the property and Gertrude Sajdak, her mother, was an invitee. The legal title to 5911 Laclede Road, Baltimore was held by Garden. Thunderwood held the \u201cbeneficial title.\u201d The record shows that Regional Management Incorporated managed the property in question as well as some 7,000 houses in the City of Baltimore; Regional and the appellants were all part of the Macht group of companies which were engaged in large scale building, renting, and selling of homes. Thunderwood acted as general contractor and applied for the building permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Alex Luciano, individually, or as Alex Luciano Co., Inc., under a written order from Thunderwood dated July 22, 1960, undertook to manufacture and install, in accordance with the provisions of the Building Code of Baltimore City, precast concrete slab rear porches at all 600 homes in the Garden project, including 5911 Laclede Road. In 1964, Luciano, after initially measuring the size of the slabs required for these homes, manufactured and installed the slab for 5911 Laclede Road, using his own men and equipment, free of any direction, supervision or control from the appellants as builder and owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The precast concrete slabs manufactured by Luciano, measured 3-1/2 feet by 5-1/2 feet by 4 inches for the porch in question. The slab was made by pouring concrete into a mold, then adding steel reinforcing rods. The rods were then covered with more concrete to complete the slab. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>slab was completed, the rods were completely hidden from view. This type of precast slab was described by the appellees\u2019 witness, Samuel Mortimer, Chief of Engineering of the City of Baltimore, as an \u201celementary type structure\u201d which required no detailed plans or specifications. Donald Radcliff, an architect since 1954, testified that it was not a general practice in the trade to draw plans or submit specifications with regard to precast concrete porches.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The cause of the collapse of this slab, some six years following its construction and installation, was that the metal reinforcing rods within the concrete slab ran the wrong way. Proper construction required that the rods be placed lengthwise in order to properly support the weight of the slab. In the case of the slab furnished for 5911 Laclede Road, the rods were not so placed, and Luciano admitted that the precast concrete slab rear porch at 5911 Laclede Road failed through his negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">According to Samuel Mortimer, the failure of Luciano to insert the metal reinforcing rods in the proper direction would constitute a violation of the Building Code. The inspection by the City authorities of 5911 Laclede Road, after its completion, did pot reveal this defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Luciano had manufactured precast concrete products in conjunction with his father and brother for a period of some 30 years prior to 1960 and had furnished companion companies of the appellants with various types of precast concrete products, including precast concrete front porches, precast steps and other precast concrete forms which required the use of metal reinforcing rods.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The building permit for 5911 Laclede Road was issued on October 25, 1963. The appellants, Garden and Thunderwood, listed as owner and general contractor, respectively, became permit holders and, as such, were required to conform to and comply with the Baltimore City Code. Mr. William H. Cohen, Vice President of Thunderwood, was responsible for purchasing and, in that capacity, was familiar with the Baltimore City Code and with building permits. Mr. Cohen would consider a supplier incompetent if the supplier did not have knowledge of the Code. Mr. Samuel Mortimer, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>job it is to enforce the Building Code, testified that it would be a prerequisite for any individual or corporation building prefabricated porches to be familiar with the Building Code. He, like Mr. Cohen, expressed an opinion that an individual or corporation building these porches, having no knowledge of the Code, would be incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Luciano does not now and never did have knowledge of the Baltimore City Code requirements for making concrete slabs. In making the precast concrete slab for 5911 Laclede Road, he did not refer to the Baltimore City Code. Mr. Cohen gave Luciano no details other than the size, price, and directions to comply with the Baltimore City Code. He did not ask if Luciano knew about the Code, nor did he ask if he knew anything about engineering manuals pertaining to the building of porches. The order directed Luciano to adhere to the Code and Cohen did not check to see if, in fact, he did. Mr. Donald Radcliff, the architect who drew up the plans used by the appellants to get the building permit, included in the plans a reference to the concrete back porch, giving the size of 3-1/2 ft. x 5-1/2 ft., but gave no further details concerning the prefab' porch. Had he been asked, Mr. Radcliff would have supplied the details. In order to do so, he would have had to refer to the Baltimore City Code or an engineering manual concerning requirements of reinforcements. Mr. Radcliff would not consider a supplier qualified who had no knowledge of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\n<em>Appellants\u2019 Motion for Directed Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The appellants argue that their motion for directed verdict should have been granted because an owner-builder is not liable, as a matter of law, for injuries resulting from a latent defect. In making their argument the appellees concede that the slab in question was negligently manufactured by Luciano, an independent contractor, by improperly inserting the reinforcing bars in the wrong direction. They also concede that the negligence was the cause of the collapse six years after manufacture and installation by Luciano. For the purposes of the argument they concede that there was a violation of the Building Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>It is well settled in Maryland that a violation of a building code can be evidence of breach of a duty owed. <em>Stein v.

We find the language of \u00a7 1010 to be dispositive. It recites that the purpose of the act is to protect the public health, safety, and security of the people of Baltimore. This ordinance created a duty on the part of the appellants to erect the property in accordance with the Code. There can be no doubt that the appellees were members of the group the ordinance was designed to protect and that the violation of the ordinance constituted at least evidence of negligence. <em>State, Use of Parr v. Board of County Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>207 Md. 91, 113 A. 2d 397 (1955); <em>Gosnell v. B. &amp; O. Railroad Co., </em>189 Md. 677, 57 A. 2d 322 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">While the mere violation of a statute or ordinance will not support an action for damages, even though it is evidence of negligence, it is sufficient if the violation is the proximate cause of the injury. <em>Austin v. Buettner, </em>211 Md. 61, 124 A. 2d 793 (1956).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>There was certainly sufficient evidence, which the appellees do not deny, to show that the collapse of the porch was a direct result of the defect in the concrete slab built in violation of the-Code. The question becomes whether social policy and fairness will allow an imposition of liability on the appellants where their negligence was passive when opposed to the negligence of the subcontractor. If the statute imposes a strict liability on the owner and permit holder, then there is no distinction between active and passive negligence. Liability attaches if the violation of the Code was the cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Citing <em>Cutlip v. Lucky Stores, </em>22 Md. App. 673, 677, 325 A. 2d 432 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>273 Md. 719, the appellants state the old established rule that the employer of an independent contractor is not subject to liability for bodily harm caused to another by reason of a tort committed by the contractor. The rationale behind this rule is that the employer has no control over the acts of the independent contractor and in the case, as we have here, where the independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>contractor\u2019s negligence causes injury from a latent defect, the owner and general contractor would have no knowledge of the negligence. Appellants contend that as they had no knowledge of or control over the defective concrete slab they should not be subject to liability. In <em>Cutlip, supra </em>at 677 we stated that the established rule has appended to it some twenty exceptions as set out in the <em>Restatement </em>(Second) <em>of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 410-429. Section 424 has particular application to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201c\u00a7 424. <em>Precautions Required by Statute or Regulation</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cOne who by statute or by administrative regulation is under a duty to provide specified safeguards or precautions for the safety of others is subject to liability to the others for whose protection the duty is imposed for harm caused by the failure of a contractor employed by him to provide such safeguards or precautions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">See also Comment b.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cb. Statutes and regulations of the kind described are of two types. One type of statute or regulation imposes upon those doing the work an absolute duty to see that the specified safeguards or precautions are provided. The other type imposes merely a duty to use reasonable care to provide them. Whether a statute or regulation is of one type or the other is a matter of construction of the particular provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cIf the duty imposed is an absolute one, the employer is subject to liability for the failure of the contractor to provide the required safeguard or precaution, even though the contractor has exercised all reasonable care in his effort to do so. On the other hand, if the duty imposed is only one of reasonable care, the employer is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>liability only if the contractor has failed to exercise such care.. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Attaching the ordinary meaning to the words in \u00a7 1032 and \u00a7 1408, it is apparent to us that the City Council, in order to achieve their purpose of protecting the residents of Baltimore, has affirmatively placed the responsibility of compliance with the Building Code on the owner and permit holder. This does not mean that an owner-permit holder is liable for every injury which happens on his premises, but it does make him responsible for injuries caused by the failure to comply with the Code. We hasten to add that this liability only attaches to those situations where the owner has title at the time the structure is built. He is in a position to oversee the work and insure compliance with the Building Code. It would not apply to a subsequent owner who would not be in a position to check compliance with the Code. This duty expressly imposed by the council cannot be delegated. Non-delegable duties arise in situations in which the law deems a particular duty \u201cso important and so peremptory that it will be treated as non-delegable. . . . Duties imposed by statute are often found to be of this kind. ...\u201d 2 Harper &amp; James, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 26.11 at 1406 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The questions of to what extent a city building ordinance changes and supersedes the common law relation between landlord and tenant, and when a landowner\u2019s liability to his tenants for negligent construction ceases were specifically reserved by the Court of Appeals in <em>Peterson v. Underwood, supra </em>at 21. We also note that prior decisions of the Court of Appeals may indicate a contrary philosophy than we have expressed. For example, <em>see Bona v. Graefe, </em>264 Md. 69, 285 A. 2d 607 (1972) and <em>Thomas v. Cryer, </em>251 Md. 725, 248 A. 2d 795(1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">On the other hand, the Court of Appeals has recently adopted the theory of strict liability in the manufacture and sale of defective products. <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A. 2d 955 (1976). There is an indication that this theory applies to the case at bar. As stated by Professor William Prosser in his <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>(4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ed. 1971), page 680: \u201cThe liability of building contractors has tended to follow the same general path of development as that of suppliers of chattels, but to lag behind it by some twenty years.\u201d He stated futher at 682:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">\u201cReference has already been made to the direct \u2018warranty\u2019 of the builder of a new house to the initial buyer to whom he sells it. The analogy of the manufacturer of chattels led more or less inevitably to the extension of this strict liability to third persons. In 1965, in Schipper v. Levitt <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Inc.,11 New Jersey again led off by holding that the warranty protected a child of the buyer, injured by a defective water heating apparatus. The decision has since been followed in California,12 Florida,13 and Mississippi,14 with dicta in two or three other jurisdictions approving it.15 Again the prediction is easily made, that this too is rapidly to become the prevailing rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201c11. 1965, 44 N.J. 70, 207 A.2d 314.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201c12. Kriegler v. Eichler Homes, Inc. 1969, 269 Cal. App. 2d 224, 74 Cal. Rptr. 749. This was followed, as to the land itself, in Avner v. Longridge Estates, 1969, 272 Cal. App.2d 695, 77 Cal. Rptr. 633.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201c13. Calvera v. Green Springs, Inc., Fla. App. 1969, 220 So.2d 414.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201c14. State Stove Mfg. Co. v.

Morton, Tex. 1968, 426 S.W.2d 554.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Some courts in addition to those cited by Professor Prosser, have adopted the rule as to sellers of new houses. <em>Rogers v. Scyphers, </em>161 S.E.2d 81 (S. Carolina 1968); <em>Fisher v. Simon, </em>15 Wis. 2d 207, 112 N.W.2d 705 (1961); <em>McDonough v. Whalen, </em>365 Mass. 506, 313 N.E.2d 435 (1974). It has also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>been applied to lessors of a product. <em>Cintrone v. Hertz Truck Leasing, </em>45 N. J. 434, 212 A. 2d 769 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">While we decline to decide this case on those grounds as the question was not raised or argued by either side, it does appear that the Court of Appeals has adopted the policy of protecting the consumers when they are not in a position to protect themselves.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court stated in <em>Phipps, supra, </em>that the reasons for adopting strict liability for the manufacturer and seller of defective products were (1) that the cost of injuries should in equity be borne by those who manufacture or sell such products rather than the injured person who was powerless to protect himself; (2) because it shifts the loss to those better able financially to bear the loss; (3) that the consumer relies on the seller in expecting the product to be safe for the uses for which it has been marketed and the expectation is better fulfilled by strict liability than negligence or warranty theories. Although not applicable to the instant case the fourth reason would be a reason to apply the rule in most cases; (4) the showing that the product is unreasonably dangerous is a sufficient showing of fault to impose liability without placing an almost impossible burden on the plaintiff of proving specific acts of negligence. The same reasoning would apply to the tenant in the case at bar. She was powerless to determine whether the premises were safe. For these reasons we find that the Building Code places a non-delegable, affirmative duty on the owner-permit holder at the time of construction, to insure compliance with the Code. <em>See McCoy v. Coral Hills Associates, Inc., </em>264 A. 2d 896 (D.C. App. 1970) and <em>Leimbach v. Bickford\u2019s, Inc., </em>214 Md. 434, 442, 135 A. 2d 633 (1957). <em>But see Rigger v. Balt. Co., </em>269 Md. 306, 311, 305 A. 2d 128 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\n<em>Court\u2019s Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Appellants argue that the instructions given by the trial judge were confusing. While we agree that they were not a model of clarity, the jury was instructed several times that if they found a violation of the ordinance that that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>evidence of negligence, but that they could not find for the plaintiffs unless, in addition, they found that the violation was the proximate cause of the accident. As we have previously indicated, under our interpretation of the present state of the Maryland law the instruction was more favorable to the appellants than one of strict liability for violations of the Building Code, under \u00a7 424 of the <em>Restatement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Negligence of Independent Contractor Imputed to Owner-Builder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Under this heading the appellants argue that the trial judge\u2019s instructions based on <em>Deford v. State, Use of Keyser, </em>30 Md. 179 (1869), was in error. The instruction read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201c[ W]here the thing contracted to be done causes the injury and the injury can be said to arise from the authority of the employer because this thing contracted to be done is imperfectly performed, then the employer must be taken to have authorized the act and is responsible for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">We agree that this instruction imposed strict liability for the latent defect on the appellants and is not supportable under <em>Deford </em>because in that case the wall constructed under the owner\u2019s contract was fronting on a public street in a large city and in an obviously most defective and dangerous manner, \u201cso much so, that it excited the alarm and apprehension of hundreds of people as they passed, and caused them to avoid the pavement in its immediate front.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204. We find, however, that the instruction was no more than the court should have granted under \u00a7 424 of the <em>Restatement </em>and \u00a7\u00a7 1032 and 1408 of the Building Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\n<em>Appellants\u2019 Claim Against Luciano</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">We entirely agree with the appellants\u2019 argument that their negligence, if any, was passive and the negligence of the cross-defendant, Luciano, was active, and therefore the court should have granted relief to Garden for indemnification against Luciano. <em>See Pennsylvania </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mutual Casualty Insurance Co. v.

In Peterson v. Underwood, 258 Md. 9, 16, 264 A. 2d 851 (1970), Judge J. Dudley Digges, speaking for the Court, gave a most lucid definition of proximate cause in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">\u201cIt should be clarified at this point that our inquiry is directed specifically to the issue of \u2018causation in fact\u2019 which has been regarded as an aspect of \u2018proximate cause.\u2019 W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts, \u00a7 41, at 240 (3d ed. 1964), 2 F. Harper and F. James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 20.2, at 1110 (1956). Proximate cause ultimately involves a conclusion that someone will be held legally responsible for the consequences of an act or omission. This determination is subject to considerations of fairness or social policy as well as mere causation. Thus, although an injury might not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 an antecedent act of the defendant, liability may not be imposed if for example the negligence of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>person is merely passive and potential, while the negligence of another is the moving and effective cause of the injury. Bloom v. Good Humor Ice Cream Co., 179 Md. 384, 18 A. 2d 592 (1941), or if the injury is so remote in time and space from defendant\u2019s original negligence that another\u2019s negligence intervenes. Dersookian v. Helmick, 256 Md. 627, 261 A. 2d 472 (1970); Liberto v. Holfeldt, 221 Md. 62, 155 A. 2d 698 (1959).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201cCausation in fact is concerned with the more fundamental (and some have thought metaphysical) inquiry of whether defendant\u2019s conduct <em>actually </em>produced an injury. If lay testimony together with reasonable inferences does not directly show this causal relation (such as a witness\u2019s observing a brick hurled through a plate glass window) it may be shown in a number of other ways. The most familiar method today is through the opinion of the expert who states that, based on facts in evidence, X was the efficient cause of the injury. Such opinion testimony is not always required, and the plaintiff produces legally sufficient proof to get to the jury once he shows it is more probable than not that defendant\u2019s act caused his injury. Wilhelm v. State Traffic Comm., 230 Md. 91, 185 A. 2d 715 (1962); Otis Elevator v. LePore, 229 Md. 52, 57, 181 A. 2d 659 (1962). This does not mean plaintiff is required to exclude every other possible cause of the accident. State of Maryland v. Manor Real Estate &amp; Trust Co., 176 F. 2d 414 (4th Cir. 1949); Wilson v. Blaustein, 144 Md. 289, 124 A. 886 (1924). But where plaintiff by his own evidence shows two or more equally likely causes of the injury, for only one of which defendant is responsible, plaintiff can not recover. Langville v. Glen Burnie Lines, 233 Md. 181, 195 A. 2d 717 (1963); Joffre v. Canada Dry, Inc., 222 Md. 1, 158 A. 2d 631 (1960).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\">.
