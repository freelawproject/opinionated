Tomas, filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Mathias, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>presiding) on July 29,1975, seeking an absolute divorce from appellee, John M. Tomas, on the grounds of voluntary separation. By motion raising preliminary objection, appellee challenged the court\u2019s jurisdiction, alleging that neither party was a resident of Maryland at the time the action was initiated. After hearing testimony on December 22, 1975, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion and dismissed the action by order dated January 29, 1976. It is from this ruling that the present appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The issue before us is whether the Circuit Court was correct in finding that Mrs. Tomas was not domiciled in Maryland at the time the action was initiated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The relevant facts are fairly simple. Mrs. Tomas lived continuously in Maryland from May, 1972, to July 23, 1975. While living in Maryland she was employed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture at Beltsville. There is no dispute that Mrs. Tomas was domiciled in Maryland during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Shortly before the bill of complaint was filed in this case, Mrs. Tomas moved to the New Jersey home of her parents. She testified at the hearing that this move was motivated by her desire to participate in a job training program (not then available in Maryland) which would eventually qualify her for a higher position with the Department of Agriculture. She also indicated that she planned to return to Maryland upon completion of her training.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Appellee argues that by moving to New Jersey, appellant gave up her Maryland domicile. Appellee elicited testimony which purported to show that Mrs. Tomas did not intend to return to Maryland after completing the program in New Jersey. The court accepted appellee\u2019s theory and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction in the matter. In doing so, the court emphasized that Mrs. Tomas had in fact left Maryland prior to the filing of her complaint. The court also relied on its conclusion that the evidence did not demonstrate an intent to return to Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Although there is testimony to contradict the latter finding, it is not necessary to determine whether such finding was clearly erroneous, as appellant contends, because the record shows that the court did not correctly apply the Maryland law in reaching its conclusion. We quote the relevant portions of the court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201c]T]his case is going to turn to relatively simple facts. * * * [T]he plaintiff in this case did in fact move from Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, to New Jersey or Delaware prior to the time that the Bill was even filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201cIn other words, her move to New Jersey to take the training program * * * was not related to a training with an intent to return to the Agriculture Department in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">It is apparent from these portions of the opinion that the court\u2019s decision was based on two factors: first, that appellant had in fact moved and, second, that the court interpreted the evidence as showing that appellant did not intend to return to Maryland. Yet, under the applicable Maryland law, neither of these factors can be conclusive. \u201cIt is * * * well settled in Maryland that a person\u2019s domicile remains the same until he acquires a new residence with an intention to remain there indefinitely and that the burden of proof rests on the party who claims that a change of domicile has taken place.\u201d <em>Bartell v. Bartell, </em>28 Md. App. 180, 186 (1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>278 Md. 12 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The \u201csimple fact\u201d that appellant had moved, which was given considerable weight by the court below, is inconclusive without additional evidence showing an intent to remain at the new residence. Instead of relying on its finding that Mrs. Tomas did not demonstrate an intent to return to Maryland, the court should have required an affirmative showing by appellee that Mrs. Tomas intended to remain at the New Jersey residence \u201cindefinitely.\u201d Otherwise stated, Mrs. Tomas did not give up or lose her Maryland domicile since it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>was not shown that she had established a new and different domicile. Absent such a showing, her domicile remains in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\n<em>Order granting motion of dismissal, reversed; case remanded for farther proceedings; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">. The Maryland courts have consistently held that the words \u201creside\u201d or \u201cresident\u201d in a constitutional provision or statute are \u201cconstrued to mean domicile\u201d unless a contrary intent be shown.
