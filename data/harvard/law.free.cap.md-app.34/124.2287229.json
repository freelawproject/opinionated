They were: 1st count, motor vehicle larceny; 2nd count, receiving stolen goods; and 3rd count, possession of a manufactured article whose serial number had been removed or altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">On June 7, 1975, Corporal Jahn of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department was in a marked county police car routinely patrolling the Bladensburg area. A passenger in his vehicle was Thomas Blair, an assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County. There apparently was no special significance to Blair\u2019s presence in the car other than as a testimonial to his zeal beyond the call of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">Corporal Jahn and his passenger observed a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which they later determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>was being operated by the appellant, proceeding at a rate of speed substantially higher than that permissible in the area. It is conceded that Conner was exceeding the speed limit. The police officer stopped the appellant and requested him to produce his driver\u2019s license and registration card. Conner gave the officer a \u201ccompletely obliterated\u201d District of Columbia driver\u2019s license, as well as a driver\u2019s license from Virginia, and an Alabama registration slip in the name of Gerald King. Corporal Jahn gave the registration slip to Blair who walked to the opposite side of the motorcycle and compared the numbers on the registration slip with those on the motorcycle frame and engine housing of the vehicle. These numbers were visible on the outside of the motorcycle. Blair had some experience with motorcycle identification in his position as an assistant State\u2019s Attorney; he verified that the numbers on the frame and housing were identical, but he noticed that they had been stamped in a die not usually found on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Blair called this fact to Jahn\u2019s attention whereupon Jahn checked Conner\u2019s license status through the computer at the Motor Vehicle Administration and learned that Conner had been refused a license to operate a motor vehicle in Maryland. The appellant was requested to follow Corporal Jahn to the Hyattsville station for further investigation. At the station Corporal Bruciak, an auto theft investigator for the county police, made a further examination of the vehicle and discovered that the frame number was stamped in a standard die stamp \u2014 not the \u201cposident\u201d die. In addition, the number was not enclosed with a star in front of the number and a star at the end of the last number as was the practice of Harley-Davidson. There was evidence that the original number on the vehicle had been obliterated. Corporal Bruciak checked a \u201csecret\u201d number located near the crankcase of the vehicle and obtained from that location a different identifying number. Investigation disclosed that one Jeffrey Ashe had reported a motorcycle owned by him, bearing that number, to have been stolen. On the basis of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>information the charges previously recited were placed against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Prior to trial the appellant filed a motion to suppress all the evidence obtained as a result of the search and seizure of the motorcycle on the grounds that the search and seizure was without a warrant and without probable cause and that the appellant did not consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">A hearing was held on the motion to suppress and the motion was denied. On a later date, trial was had before a jury (Mathias, J., presiding) and the appellant was found not guilty of the larceny charged in the first count of the indictment but was found guilty of receiving stolen goods and possession of a manufactured vehicle whose serial number had been removed or altered. After a motion for new trial was denied, sentences were imposed and it is from these judgments that this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The appellant urges six grounds for reversal. We have considered each of them and for the reasons detailed <em>infra, </em>we have determined that they are without merit. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The first question raised by the appellant in this appeal is: Did the trial court err in denying the appellant standing to raise the issues urged by the appellant in his motion to suppress?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have in this instance a classic case of a correct result reached for an incorrect reason. The judge who heard the motion to suppress relied on the legal principles enunciated by this Court in <em>Duncan and Smith v. State, </em>27 Md. App. 302, 340 A. 2d 722 (1975). He held that Conner, in possession of recently stolen goods, did not have standing to raise the issue of the alleged illegal search and seizure. Several months later the Court of Appeals had <em>Duncan </em>before it on certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The Court in <em>Duncan and Smith v. State, </em>276 Md. 715, 351 A. 2d 144 (1976), vacated our judgment and remanded the case for a determination as to whether the search and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>seizure was proper. In its opinion, Judge Smith, speaking for the Court, held that when the possession of the evidence is in itself an essential element of the offense charged against the accused, the State is precluded from denying that the defendant has the requisite possessory interest to challenge the admission of the evidence. The Court neid that <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), was still controlling law in Maryland, and that under the circumstances the defendant had automatic standing to raise the issue of the validity of the search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The subsequent decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Duncan and Smith v. State, supra, </em>makes it obvious that the trial court\u2019s reason for the denial of the motion to suppress was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The appellant has consistently argued that the search and seizure of his motorcycle was illegal because of the proscriptions of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Our appellate review is limited to the evidence that was submitted to the trial court, out of the presence of the jury, at the hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search of the motorcycle. <em>Glover v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 454, 287 A. 2d 333 (1972). We have reached the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\"><em>Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U. S. 583, 94 S. Ct. 2464, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974), was before the Supreme Court on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit. In a habeas corpus proceeding, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio had ruled the warrantless examination of the exterior of a vehicle was a search violative of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in a plurality opinion reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The case arose out of the murder of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>victim who had died as a result of shotgun wounds. Tire tracks from a vehicle other than that in which the deceased\u2019s body had been found were discovered at the scene. Casts were made of these tracks and, in addition, foreign paint was removed from the right rear fender of the vehicle in which the deceased was found. An investigation over a period of several months indicated that there was probable cause to believe Lewis was involved in the homicide. Lewis was arrested by law enforcement officers who had secured an arrest warrant for his person. After his arrest, Lewis\u2019 car keys and a parking lot claim check were released to the police. A tow truck was dispatched to remove the car from the parking lot where it had been left by Lewis, and the car was taken to the police impoundment lot. There a technician made a cast of the right rear tire of the vehicle, and it was found to match the cast of the tire taken at the scene. In addition, paint samples scraped from Lewis\u2019 vehicle were found to match those of the paint on the victim\u2019s car. Both the District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the evidence obtained should have been excluded on the grounds that the scraping of the paint from the exterior of the car was an unlawful search, that it was not incident to the arrest, and that the seizure of the car could not be justified as a seizure of an instrumentality of a crime in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Mr. Justice Blackmun, writing for the plurality, said at page 589, 90:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201c \u2018The decisions of this Court have time and again underscored the essential purpose of the Fourth Amendment to shield the citizen from unwarranted intrusions into his privacy ....\u2019 At least since <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U. S. 132 (1925), the Court has recognized a distinction between the warrantless search and seizure of automobiles or other movable vehicles, on the one hand, and the search of a home or office, on the other. Generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>less stringent requirements have been applied to vehicles .... \u2018[T]he circumstances that furnish probable cause to search a particular auto for particular articles are most often unforeseeable; moreover, the opportunity to search is fleeting since a car is readily movable. <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U. S., 50-51.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">At page 592 Mr. Justice Blackmun continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cUnder circumstances such as these, where probable cause exists, a warrantless examination of the exterior of a car is not unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The main thrust of the plurality opinion was that the Fourth Amendment was inapplicable. The Court said at pages 588-589:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">\u201cThe evidence with which we are concerned is not the product of a \u2018search\u2019 that implicates traditional considerations of the owner\u2019s privacy interest. It consisted of paint scraping from the <em>exterior </em>and an observation of a tread of a tire on an operative wheel. The issue, therefore, is whether the examination of an automobile\u2019s exterior ... invades a right to privacy which the interposition of a warrant is meant to protect.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The plurality opinion went on to conclude that a citizen had no constitutional expectation of privacy in the exterior of an automobile. At page 591 the opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">\u201cIn the present case, nothing from the interior of the car and no personal effect, which the Fourth Amendment traditionally has been deemed to protect, were searched or seized and introduced in evidence. With the \u2018search\u2019 limited to the examination of the tire on the wheel and the taking of paint scrapings from the exterior of the vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>left in the public parking lot, we fail to comprehend what expectation of privacy was infringed.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We agree with this reasoning. We find no reasonable expectation of privacy in serial numbers stamped on a motorcycle readily visible to a cursory inspection. Under the circumstances, we find the rights guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment inapplicable. Though the ground for the denial of the motion to suppress was incorrect, the action of the Court was proper for the reasons we have stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The appellant next contends that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting Ashe\u2019s Virginia title and warranty cards since he contends that they were the only pieces of documentary evidence which enabled the State to prove that the correct vehicle identification number (serial number) on the motorcycle was the same as the number on the vehicle which had been stolen from Ashe.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Ashe identified the title as the <em>original </em>Virginia title to his motorcycle. The warranty card was furnished to him at the time of purchase. These were the personal records of the owner and admissible as direct evidence. Assuming, arguendo, that it was error to admit these documents, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U. S. 18, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A. 2d 665 (1976). The record reveals that the information as to the serial numbers was testified to by a factory representative of Harley-Davidson. His testimony established that the vehicle identification number found on the exterior of the seized motorcycle was not the same number assigned to the vehicle sold to Ashe. The owner, Ashe, identified the motorcycle as being his property by three different identifying marks: a dent on the front fender, markings on the rear fender caused by a loose chain, and markings on the engine block made during repairs on the motor. The testimony as to the title and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>warranty card was cumulative and its admission was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">For convenience, we shall consider together the appellant\u2019s third and fifth suggestions of error. In the third complaint, the appellant contends that the oral testimony of Corporal Bruciak, a police officer, concerning the manufacturer\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d serial number located in a \u201csecret\u201d place on the motorcycle should not have been admitted under the \u201cBest Evidence Rule.\u201d The fifth complaint is that the trial court restricted the cross-examination of Corporal Bruciak as to the actual location of the \u201csecret\u201d number and that this restriction amounted to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">From our reading of the record, it is obvious that counsel for the appellant attempted, by his objections, to force the State to steer a dangerous course between Scylla and Charybdis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The appellant urged that the trial court require the State to prove the \u201csecret\u201d number either by bringing in the motorcycle and demonstrating its position, or at the very least requiring the production of a photograph which would show the location of the number. On cross-examination it was established that the \u201csecret\u201d number was in the general area of the crankcase of the vehicle, but the Court refused to permit any additional testimony which would have finally pinpointed its actual position on the motorcycle. To have required the State to comply with the appellant\u2019s trial tactics would have been to destroy the usefulness nationwide of the \u201csecret\u201d number.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The rulings made by the trial court were within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>bounds of its discretion. Wigmore, in discussing the Best Evidence Rule at Section 1182 (Chadbourn Rev. 1970), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cIt is impossible to say that any settled doctrine has found favor respecting the application of the rule to <em>material objects, </em>not paper, <em>bearing inscriptions in words </em>.... The rational and practical solution is to allow the trial court in its discretion to require production of an inscribed chattel wherever it seems <em>highly desirable </em>in order to ascertain accurately a <em>material fact.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Our Court of Appeals in <em>General Builders v. MacArthur, </em>228 Md. 320, 327, 179 A. 2d 868, 872 (1962), indicated the flexibility to be applied to the Best Evidence Rule when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201c[ W]here it is not shown by the objecting party that there is a higher grade of available evidence, which, if produced, would <em>more satisfactorily explain and establish a fact than the evidence offered, </em>then the evidence actually produced should not be excluded on the ground that it is secondary evidence. See 32 C.J.S. <em>Evidence, </em>Section 780; <em>Billeter v. Halsam Products Company, </em>38 N.E.2d 994 (Ill. 1942)....\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Similarly, the scope of cross-examination is within the discretion of the trial judge, and grounds for reversal will occur only when there is an abuse of that discretion. <em>Kable v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 16, 299 A. 2d 493 (1973); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 648, 244 A. 2d 632 (1968); <em>Holt v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 544, 240 A. 2d 355 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The trial court restricted cross-examination as to the exact location of the \u201csecret\u201d number after noting the need for confidentiality to preserve the ability of law enforcement officials to prosecute offenders for the theft of vehicles. <em>Gurleski v. United States, </em>405 F. 2d 253 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U. S. 981, 89 S. Ct. 2140, 23 L.Ed.2d 769 (1969), was a case in which the appellant insisted the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>committed reversible error by not allowing him to cross-examine an FBI agent as to the location of the secret identification number.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The Court in rejecting the appellant\u2019s contention said at page 266:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">\u201cJust as the prosecution need not generally divulge the name of an informer unless some materiality is shown, they need not reveal the location of these marks, which are a highly valuable tool to law enforcement officers in discovering and solving car thefts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The record reveals an even more compelling reason for finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the cross-examination of the Corporal as to the \u201csecret\u201d number. The evidence as to the existence and location of the \u201csecret\u201d number was irrelevant to the appellant\u2019s defense. There was already in the record evidence more than sufficient to identify the \u201cbike\u201d as the one owned by Ashe which had been stolen from him. It is significant that the defense offered by the appellant, through the only witness called on his behalf, was that the appellant had purchased a similar motorcycle from a man named Gerald King. Considering the nature of the \u201csecret\u201d number and the patent justification for its confidentiality, the appellant has failed to convince us that it would have been \u201chighly desirable\u201d to require the production of the motorcycle or a photograph depicting the \u201csecret\u201d number. It would have been even less desirable to permit cross-examination as to its location.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The appellant complains that the trial court erred in permitting the owner of the vehicle to refer to a \u201cwarranty card\u201d when testifying as to the serial number of the motorcycle. There is no merit to this contention. This is clearly an instance of present recollection revived in which the witness was permitted to use the writing to refresh his recollection so that he might testify about past events from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>present recollection. In <em>Askins v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 702, 284 A. 2d 626 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 745, this Court held that it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to permit a witness to use a memorandum or any other object as a stimulus to present memory, without restriction by rule as to authorship, guarantee of correctness, or time of making, <em>cf. Edwards and Person v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 562, 358 A. 2d 590 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The appellant\u2019s final ground for reversal is his contention that the assistant State\u2019s Attorney who tried the case made impermissible comments on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. A reading of the record indicates that at one point the prosecuting attorney in his argument did say, \u201cthe defendant must prove to you that it wasn\u2019t recently stolen property.\u201d Defense counsel objected, a bench conference was held and the trial court then instructed the jury that while there was an inference of guilt raised by the possession of recently stolen property, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201cthe defendant must prove\u201d was \u201ccompletely inconsistent with the law.\u201d The jury was instructed by the Court to disregard the statement \u201cthe defendant must prove.\u201d The prosecuting attorney in continuing his argument corrected his terminology and stated \u201che must give a reasonable explanation for his possession.\u201d The appellant contends, however, that the use of the pronoun <em>he </em>in connection with statements \u201che did not explain his possession,\u201d and \u201che had no reasonable explanation for having the bike\u201d were impermissible comments on the appellant\u2019s failure to testify in his own behalf. No objection to the offending language was made in the trial court, nor did the appellant request any correction of the allegedly improper language even though the trial court had acted promptly in the one instance where objection was made. A failure to object and to request the Court\u2019s correction is a waiver of the contention for appellate review. Maryland Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Our review of the closing argument convinces us that the appellant\u2019s construction of the effect of the offending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>language is not justified. We believe <em>Sizemore v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 507, 248 A. 2d 417 (1970), is dispositive of the appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AIR\">.
