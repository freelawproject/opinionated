He appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In the proceedings the appellant filed two petitions alleging he could not obtain a fair trial in Montgomery County and requesting a removal to another court having jurisdiction. As he alleged no facts showing why he could not obtain a fair trial in Montgomery County, he was relying upon an alleged absolute constitutional right of removal under Article IV, section 8 of the Maryland Constitution. The court denied the motion. An appeal from such an order, though interlocutory in nature, does lie, providing the order denies an absolute constitutional right. <em>Smith v. Fredericktown Bank </em>&amp; <em>Trust Company, </em>258 Md. 141, 265 A. 2d 236 (1970). <em>Contra </em>if the right of removal is discretionary with the court. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>271 Md. 189, 191, 315 A. 2d 524 (1974) .</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Unfortunately for the appellant\u2019s position, the Court of Appeals in <em>Davidson v. Miller, </em>276 Md. 54, 344 A. 2d 422 (1975) , declared Article IV, section 8 of the Maryland Constitution in conflict with the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution insofar as section 8 purports to give an absolute right of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">As the appellant has no absolute constitutional right of removal we have no jurisdiction and we must dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>appeal from the interlocutory order <em>sua sponte. Nu Car Carriers, Inc., et al. v. Everett, et al., </em>33 Md. App. 310, 364 A. 2d 71 (1976); <em>Firstman v. Atlantic Construction &amp; Supply Co., </em>28 Md.

Appellant also cites the recently enacted Chapter 454 of the Laws of 1976 amending Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 6-204 (Code, 1974 Vol.,_1975 Cum. Supp.) as authority for the_right to have his case removed. This was declared unconstitutional in Perkins v. Eskridge, 278 Md. 619, 366 A. 2d 21 (1976), per curiam order filed Sept. 24, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
