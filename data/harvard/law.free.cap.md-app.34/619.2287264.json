J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AtIj\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Labor disputes resulting in strikes are never pleasant, are ofttimes filled with bitterness and rancor, and are sometimes violent. When the strikers\u2019 jobs are filled by management with strikebreakers or \u201cscabs,\u201d as they are commonly known, emotions may give way to violence. In that event, the labor dispute becomes more than a management-union controversy because the police and the courts then become involved as keepers of the public peace. This appeal is the direct result of such an occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">To comprehend fully the issues herein discussed, we shall briefly set the factual predicate giving rise to this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Lafayette Square Nursing Center, Inc. (Center) purchased on August 9, 1976, a nursing home from Community Health Corporation (Community Health). Immediately prior to the acquisition of the home by Center, the home was known as Bolton Hill Nursing and Convalescent Center (Bolton). Community Health had previously entered into a labor agreement with National Union of Hospital and Health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Employees, District 1199E, an unincorporated trade union (Union). By terms of the agreement, Union was recognized as the collective bargaining agent for certain employees of Bolton.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Almost simultaneously with Center\u2019s emption of Bolton from Community Health, it entered into an agreement with Olympic Management Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, whereby Olympic was to supply the labor for Center. The employees of Community Health who had been working at Bolton were informed that they could make job applications to Olympic and \u201cthey would be hired . . . and continue to receive the same wages, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment they enjoyed as employees of Community Health. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">At approximately 1 p.m. on August 10, 1976, representatives of the Union went to the Center and demanded that the Union be recognized by Center as the collective bargaining agent and that Center assume Community Health\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. Unsuccessful in that endeavor, the Union advised Center, by telegram from its parent organization, that a strike would be called, and Center would be picketed commencing 6 a.m., August 22, 1976. Notwithstanding the date set in the telegram, pickets arrived on the morning of August 11, 1976, and the strike began.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Two days later a \u201cBill of Complaint for Temporary and Permanent Injunction\u201d was filed by Center against the Union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Bill recited that acts of coercion, intimidation, violence and property damage had occurred at the nursing home and prayed that the Union be enjoined \u201cfrom threatening, intimidating, warning, assaulting, blocking or in any other way molesting or interfering with any person on or about the premises\u201d of Center. Additionally, the Circuit Court of Baltimore City was asked to limit to not more than two (2) the number of pickets \u201cat any of the entrances to the premises\u201d of Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Following the hearing of August 17 and 18, 1976, the trial court issued an injunction which restrained the Union from,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">\u201c(c) Threatening, intimidating, warning, assaulting, blocking or in any other way molesting or interfering with any person on or about the premises of . . . [the Nursing Center] or seeking entrance or exit to or from the . . . [Center\u2019s] premises; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">(d) Placing or allowing more than four (4) pickets at the main or Lafayette Avenue entrance to . . . [Center\u2019s] nursing home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">(e) Placing or allowing more than two (2) pickets at the courtyard entrance to . . . [Center\u2019s] nursing home, said entrance being located on John Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">(f) Placing or allowing more than two (2) pickets at the ambulance entrance ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">(g) Placing or allowing more than two (2) pickets at either of the alley entrances . .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The Union promptly appealed to this Court where it alleges that the chancellor erred because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">\u201cA. The Court\u2019s finding that unlawful acts have been threatened or committed and will be executed or continued unless restrained is clearly not supported by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">B. The Court\u2019s finding that substantial and irreparable injury to . . . [Center\u2019s] property will follow unless relief is granted is unsubstantiated by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">C. The Court\u2019s finding that ... [Center] has no adequate remedy at law is not supported by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">D. The record does not support the Trial Court\u2019s finding that the police could not control the situation nor that police protection was inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-14\">E. The Maryland Code requires that a complainant seeking an injunction make every reasonable effort to settle a labor dispute either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>with the aid of any available machinery, through governmental mediation or voluntary arbitration, unless irreparable injury is threatened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The scope of review of injunctions by the Court of Appeals is governed by Md. Rule 886. <em>Md. Trust Co. v. Tulip Realty, </em>220 Md. 399, 411, 153 A. 2d 275, 283 (1959). The Court of Special Appeals has its counterpart in Md. Rule 1086. <em>Sullivan v. Auslaender, </em>12 Md. App. 1, 3 n. 3, 276 A. 2d 698, 700 (1971). The standard to be applied, therefore, in this Court\u2019s review of Union\u2019s contentions \u201cA\u201d through \u201cD\u201d, is whether the chancellor\u2019s findings of fact were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The General Assembly has declared with regard to the use of injunctions in labor-management disputes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201cNegotiations of terms and conditions of labor should result from voluntary agreement between employer and employees. Governmental authority has permitted and encouraged employers to organize in the corporate and other forms of capital control. In dealing with such employers the individual unorganized worker is helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract, and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment. Therefore it is necessary that the individual workman have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from interference, restraint or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 100, \u00a7 63.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>By enactment of Md. Ann. Code art. 100, \u00a7 68, the legislature has mandated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">\u201cNo court nor any judge or judges thereof shall have jurisdiction to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, as herein defined, except after hearing the testimony of witnesses in open court, (with opportunity for cross-examination) in opposition thereto, if offered, and except after findings of all the following facts by the court or judge or judges thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">(a) <em>Acts committed. </em>\u2014 That unlawful acts have been <em>threatened or committed </em>and will be executed or continued unless restrained; \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">(b) <em>Injury </em>\u2014 <em>In general. </em>\u2014 That substantial and irreparable injury to complainant\u2019s property will follow unless the relief requested is granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">Tc) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Extent. \u2014That _as to each item of relief granted greater injury will be inflicted upon complainant by the denial thereof than will be inflicted upon defendants by the granting thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">(d) <em>Jurisdiction. </em>\u2014 That no item of relief granted is relief that a court or judge thereof has no jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin under \u00a7 65 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">(e) <em>No remedy at law. </em>\u2014 That complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">(f) <em>Failure to protect property. </em>\u2014That the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant\u2019s property have failed or are unable to furnish adequate protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">(g) <em>Notice of hearing. </em>\u2014 Such hearing shall be held after due and personal notice thereof has been given, in such manner as the court shall direct, to all known persons against whom relief is sought, and also to those public officers charged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>duty to protect complainant\u2019s property.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The chancellor found as a fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201ca.) that the mass picketing, blocking of exits and entrances, acts of violence, loud noise, verbal abuse, verbal assaults and threats set forth . . . are illegal and unlawful acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>caused by or engaged in by the representatives, agents, servants, and employees of Respondent Local 1199E and those acting in consort and participation with them and such Acts will continue unless restrained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">b. ) that the potential for violence to Complainant\u2019s employees and destruction of Complainant\u2019s property is great and substantial and irreparable injury to Complainant\u2019s property will more probably then [sic] not follow unless the relief requested in the Bill of Complaint is granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">c. ) that as to each item of relief requested, greater injury will be inflicted upon Complainant by the denial thereof than will be inflicted upon Respondents by the granting thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">d. ) that as a matter of law, those acts complained of by the Complainant and sought by it to be enjoined are not within the prohibitions of S 65 of Article 100 of the Annotated Code of Maryland and that there has been no Federal pre-emption of the right of the State courts to prohibit the acts complained of;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">e. ) that as a result of the aforesaid unlawful acts by Respondent Local 1199E, Complainant has suffered substantial and irreparable injuries for which it has no adequate remedy at law and unless a permanent injunction is issued, Complainant will suffer substantial and irreparable injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">f. ) that the public officers charged with the duty to protect ... [Center\u2019s] property have failed or are unable to provide adequate protection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">g. ) that only by the issuance of the injunctive relief hereinafter set forth may the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>peace and security of the citizens of this State and their property be protected;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">h.) that the end sought to be obtained may best and most fairly be reached by prohibiting those particular acts which lead to the continuing disorders and may place reasonable limitation on the number of pickets that may be maintained by Respondent Local 1199E; that the unlawful acts which have been committed will be continued unless restrained . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">At the hearing before the trial court, there was testimony that (1) the noise created by the picketers of the Center was great and disturbed persons living in the neighborhood; (2) a hose was placed through the window of the kitchen of the Center and the water was turned on; (3) tacks were placed in the driveway of the Center; <em>(4) </em>a picket was struck by a car driven by an employee of Center; (5) Arlene Lewis, an employee of Center, while on her way to work, was pushed against a wall by pickets and told to \u201cget her ass back on the bus\u201d; (6) Mary Nutter, an employee, was blocked from entering the Center, and subsequently had a bottle thrown at her car as well as having Rick Ehrman, District 1199E\u2019s Administrator, beat and kick her car; (7) Harriet Pitt was told, on two occasions, by a picket that if she went into the building the picket \u201cwas going to whip ... [her] ass\u201d; (8) Employee Margarite Thomas, as she left the Center, was allegedly assaulted by her brother who was picketing for 1199E; and (9) Sonya Gershowitz, owner of the Center, testified that pickets kicked her car and threw rocks and stones at it, broke windows in the chapel, called her names and tried to stop trash from being picked up and food from being delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The Union refers us to a number of cases decided in various other State courts as well as Federal tribunals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>reading of those cases, however, fails to reveal that in any of them was a trial court precluded from issuing an injunction to prevent violence to the person or to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Although it is clear that Md. Ann. Code art. 100, \u00a7\u00a7 63-75 (sometimes called \u201cMaryland\u2019s Little Norrjs-La Guardia Act\u201d) was intended to and did abridge substantially the authority of courts of equity to issue injunctions in matters involving labor disputes, the act did not strip those courts totally of injunctive power. Indeed, \u00a7 68, quoted above, makes it beyond question that an equity court may issue an injunction in labor disputes provided that the issuing court shall first find from the evidence certain specific facts. If <em>all </em>of those facts are found, the injunction may issue. Conversely, if any one or more is not so found, no injunction may be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Applying the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 100, \u00a7 68 to the evidence produced at the hearing before the trial court, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>summation of which we have heretofore recounted, and to the findings of the judge, it is manifest that those findings by the trial court comply completely with the statutory mandate. Moreover, we are unable to conclude that the findings of fact are clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086; <em>Md. Trust Co. v. Tulip Realty, supra; Sullivan v. Auslaender, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Union also argues that the Center did not comply with the expressed ukase of Md. Ann. Code art. 100, \u00a7 69 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cNo restraining order or injunctive relief shall be granted to any complainant who has failed to comply with any obligation imposed by law which is involved in the labor dispute in question, or who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any available machinery or governmental mediation or voluntary arbitration, <em>but nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require the court to await the action of any such tribunal if irreparable injury is threatened. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">As we have earlier indicated, the Maryland Anti-Injunction Act is a sibling of the Norris-La Guardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-115. Because of the paucity of Maryland cases interpreting the Maryland Act, we must look to federal decisions for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We construe \u00a7 69 to be a condition precedent to the granting of an injunction in a labor dispute. Thus, before the trial court may issue an injunction the complainant must show affirmative compliance with the section even though all the elements of \u00a7 68 are found to be present. <em>General Electric Co. v. Gojack, </em>68 F. Supp. 686, 689 (N.D. Ind. 1946).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The italicized language of \u00a7 69 above does not permit a court to enjoin a strike because \u201cirreparable injury is threatened\u201d Unless there first is shown full compliance with \u00a7\u00a768 and 69. Once that compliance has been proven, however, the court need not await <em>the action </em>of any \u201cgovernmental mediation or voluntary arbitration\u201d to enjoin threatened or real irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">We observe that the Supreme Court, in <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Toledo, P. &amp; W. R. Co., </em>321 U. S. 50, 64 S. Ct. 413, 88 L. Ed. 534, 150 A.L.R. 810 (1944) said of the Norris-La Guardia Act \u00a7 8, almost identical to Maryland Act \u00a7 69,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cIn general the Act [Norris-La Guardia] was not intended to interfere with the power to restrain violent acts. And it was contemplated expressly the court might intervene to prevent them, when the particular circumstances show the complainant has had no opportunity to comply with such requirements as those of \u00a7 8. But one major purpose of the Act was to prevent the use of injunction improperly as a strikebreaking implement. And the discussion of \u00a7 8 in the Congressional debates shows that, while it would not apply if on the facts the complainant could not meet its terms, it was intended to apply when he had had ample opportunity but refused to do so. This is clear not only from Representative O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u2018clean hands\u2019 characterization of the section, but also from the general character of the discussion regarding it. Most, if not all, of the objection was upon the mistaken view that \u00a7 8 would apply even though the complainant might have no notice or knowledge of the facts calling for him to take the conciliatory steps before seeking injunctive relief. What has been said above shows this was not the intent or effect of the section. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>There was indeed no expression of concern for the complainant who, having full opportunity to comply with the section, might refuse deliberately and steadfastly to do so. On the contrary, it appears to have been understood clearly he would be remitted to other forms of relief not touched by the Act.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 321 U. S. at 65-66, 64 S. Ct. at 421-22, 88 L. Ed. at 543-44, 150 A.L.R. at 818-19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Paraphrasing what Judge Johnsen said in <em>International Ass'n of Bridge, etc. Workers v. Pauly Jail Bldg. Co., </em>118 F. 2d 615, 616-17 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 U. S. 639, 62 S. Ct. 75, 86 L. Ed. 513 (1941), of the Norris-La Guardia Act and transposing it to the Maryland Act, strict compliance with its terms is mandatory. The very purpose of injunctive relief in a labor dispute, no matter how narrowly the injunction be drawn, is to tip the scale of the controversy. Such an event is the very iniquity the Act was designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Except for the failure of the complainant, Center, to demonstrate that it had met the requirement of Section 69 overtly or was prevented from meeting those requirements, <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Toledo, P. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, </em>321 U. S. at 66, 64 S. Ct. at 422, 88 L. Ed. at 544, 150 A.L.R. at 819, the injunction in this case would have been properly issued. The record, however, is silent with respect to compliance or inability to comply with \u00a7 69. That silence is, in the instant case, fatal to the relief sought, and the trial court should not have issued, under the circumstances, the requested injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">We believe that by the enactment of Md. Ann. Code art. 100, \u00a7 69, particularly when read together with the legislative purpose articulated in \u00a7 63 thereof, that \u00a7 69 sets forth a condition precedent to equitable relief, that chancellors may not ignore, no matter how loudly the other facts seem to cry out for such relief. <em>General Electric v.
