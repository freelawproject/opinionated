Plaintiffs, the fee owners, sought to quiet title to the land in question. Defendant cross-complained claiming title to the timber in question. The trial court found for defendant and gave it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>until December, 1955, in which to remove the timber from the premises. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On February 23, 1939, the Hugheses deeded to the Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Company, predecessor in interest of defendant Heppner Lumber Company, <em>\u201call </em>pine and merchantable fir timber\u201d situated upon approximately 1160 acres of land herein involved. On February 25,1939, the Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Company conveyed to the Hugheses approximately 692 acres of the land in litigation. The deed contained the following reservation: \u201cThe grantor, however, reserves all the pine and merchantable fir timber on the above described premises together with the right to log the same at its convenience.\u201d As a part of the transactions the Lumber Company agreed to and did pay one-third of the taxes thereafter levied on the property. As the timber was cut, as hereinafter explained, it ceased paying taxes. In 1940 the Heppner Lumber Company was incorporated and succeeded to the rights of the Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Company in the timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The evidence discloses that the land involved was mountainous, with deep ravines. The timber in controversy is that largely found in the above areas with the exception of a small tract in a remote section of the property which was not listed on the tax roll as timber land and which was admittedly inaccessible. For a number of years thereafter logging was carried on by \u201cgypo\u201d loggers with horses and the entire area was logged with the exception of the remote part herein-before mentioned. As the timber was logged it was delivered to defendant\u2019s sawmill to be cut up into lumber. Periodically, as logging was concluded, from 1939 to 1948, inclusive, in order to remove the timber from the tax rolls and relieve the company from paying taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>on the same, its officers and agents executed and delivered affidavits to the county assessor in which it stated that it had cut and removed all the timber situated on the premises involved excepting on a remote and inaccessible portion of the property which had no timber listed on the assessment roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">At the conclusion of the logging operations in 1948, defendant pulled up stakes and, like the Arabs, folded its tents and silently stole away. Shortly thereafter plaintiffs fenced most of the lands and installed a gate which was kept padlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">No claim on the part of defendant was made to any timber remaining on the property until in 1951 when the prices of lumber soared some 400 per cent over that which existed in 1939. It was then that plaintiffs instituted the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 position is tersely stated in their brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-8\">\u201c(1) The respondent has already cut and removed all the timber it ever owned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-9\">\u201c(2) If there is any such timber left (which appellants deny) respondent forfeited its right thereto because a reasonable time for removal has expired, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-10\"><em>\u201c</em>(3) If there is any such timber left (which appellants deny), respondent relinquished its right thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">The controlling feature of the case, in our opinion, is that stated in proposition No. 1 of appellants\u2019 brief above set out. In other words, did defendant remove all the merchantable timber as contemplated by the parties in 1939, during the years 1939 to 1948, inclusive?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">The parties agree on the issues, at least in respect to this question. Defendant claims and plaintiffs dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>claim that the timber now contended for was merchantable timber in 1939. Defendant asserts therefore that they have a reasonable time to remove it. If the timber, however, was not merchantable at that time it follows that the \u201creasonable time for removal\u201d doctrine would have no applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">A grant of merchantable timber is a grant only of the merchantable timber on the land at the date of the contract. <em>Rayburn et ux. v. Crawford et ux., </em>187 Or 386, 398, 211 P2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">What is merchantable timber, in the absence of agreement, is a question of fact. We quote from <em>Dahl et al. v. Crain et ux., </em>193 Or 207, 225, 237 P2d 939, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-8\">\u201cIt may he conceded that there is no definition of \u2018merchantable timber\u2019 which will fit all occasions and all localities. Although a term very frequently used in timber sales contracts, as it was used in the contract here, nevertheless, it is one having no definite and fixed meaning. What may he \u2018merchantable timber\u2019 at one time or place may not be deemed such at another time or place. In determining what is covered by the term at a particular time and in a particular locality many factors are considered. Size and quality are of prime importance. Location, accessibility, demand, and market conditions are regarded. We do not assume to enumerate all the elements involved in the term. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Again, in <em>Parsons v. Boggie, </em>139 Or 469, 471, 11 P2d 280, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">\u201c* * * The court must, as far as possible, construe the instrument from the words used as showing what the parties had in mind at the time of its execution. The respondent sold and the appellant bought with the understanding that the timber was to he removed. We must also take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>at the time the sale was made; <em>also their attitude toward the subject matter subsequent to the execution of the contract. </em>* * *\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">One of the factors in determining the merchantability of timber, according to Glenn Parsons who was employed by defendant Lumber Company and had charge of its cruising and logging operations, is whether or not a timber tract is operable. He was called as a witness by defendant and testified that he had cruised the timber on the tract in question and that in cruising timber the cruiser\u2019s objective is to determine, among other things, what is an operable tract. His testimony follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">\u201cQ When you say operable, what do you mean by that? A Some areas due to certain conditions make a tract operable and some of them inoperable due to the volume, terraine [sic], and so on, accessibility, whether you could go in and log it and do it economically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\"><em>i 6 </em>* * sfc * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">\u201cQ Now even though you might have some good timber in a certain location, it might not be operable ? A That is right; it would depend upon accessibility along with it. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Since operability depends upon volume, terrain and accessibility, we are satisfied that under the circumstances of this case defendant never did consider the tracts on which the present timber is located as operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">Bruce Hoffman was called as a witness by plaintiffs. He is a consulting forester with offices in Portland. He was employed for many years by the government forest service in Alaska, Oregon, Washington and northern California. Prom 1919 until 1928 his work primarily had to do with pine operations nity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>of Klamath Falls, Medford and eastern Washington. He testified that his duties were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">\u201cto make up and consider the lay-out of the areas in regard to pine sales that the Forest Service planned to make, and at the same time, to make a very thorough and complete study of the costs of logging operations as well as manufacturing operations in pine. We attempted to conduct quite a series of time studies and production, and keeping up that work in order to give us the opportunity to know what the mills were operating on in the areas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Intermittently he was employed by private companies, one being the Edward Hines Lumber Company in Burns. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">\u201cI cruised and appraised first their large tract, 40,000 acres, on the Rodaugh Mountain, and I attempted to figure out the most practical way of getting that stuff out of there, whether to take it out in logs, and attempt to put a small mill at Seneca, or to the Hines Mills near Burns, or manufacture on the ground in small mills or to put a mill in at Dayville.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Other employment included that with the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, the Shevlin-Hixon Company at Bend, and others. He testified that he was familiar with the land in question, having traveled over the area twice. He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">\u201cQ Now, did you make a sufficient examination of those lands to determine what logging operations had been conducted on the land and to determine the areas which had been logged over? A We went over the greater part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">\u201cQ And you did see it with that in view, see most of the area when you were over there? A Yes. Well, as it was lying there, it is characteristic of other similar lands in Eastern Oregon and in Southern Oregon logged over under the conditions of 1939. Operators went in and took the best out and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>left the rest there. What was left is practically of no value under those conditions at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">\u201cQ In other words, you could state in your opinion that the logs which had been taken out of there \u2014the logging which had taken place there, and during the logging operations which had taken place, all of the timber which had commercial value in 1939 had been removed, is that right? A I would say that it was removed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Mr. Orville Smith, president, general manager and director of the defendant, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">\u201cWe took trees according to \u2014 at that time according to more or less the accessibility and the quality that could be obtained to get the timber into the mill at a profit. We did occasionally \u2014 we had to leave some that the cost would be a little too great to make a profit on it; after we got it in, the log costs would be too great.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The deeds in question were executed in 1939 at the tail end of the depression which swept the country. The price of timber was low and logging was conducted by horses. It was deemed impracticable and commercially not profitable to log in the deep ravines and mountain tops where timber was not readily accessible. Loggers hired by the defendant logged the entire area as was customarily done at that time, and, as various tracts of timber were logged, reports were made to the company and the affidavits of removal were executed and delivered to the assessor. The defendant does not dispute the making of the affidavits but attempts to evade their evidentiary value by claiming that they were misled by the reports of the loggers. It will be remembered that the timber had been cruised by defendant\u2019s employees, including Glenn Parsons, whose testimony follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">\u201cQ What sort of work do you do for them? A I look after the logging operation, cruising, line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>running, timber affidavits, cutting and I check on the gypos to see that we are getting compliance with the contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">\u201cQ The logging \u2014 you supervise the logging, but you don\u2019t actually do the logging? A That is correct; I see that we are getting compliance with the contract and log problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Defendant makes much of the trial court\u2019s finding that the affidavits were based upon erroneous information furnished to defendant and are therefore not binding on defendant. It is urged that since the court saw and heard the witnesses we should not disturb its finding. In the present case the evidence is more or less documentary and based upon testimony of the officers and employees of defendant. This being so, we are in the same position as the trial court'with respect thereto. Indeed, the following finding is based upon the court\u2019s misconception of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">\u201c* * * Representatives of the defendant had not examined the property themselves before making the affidavits. Sometime prior to 1949, representatives of the defendant examined the prop\u00e9rty and discovered that, in addition to those areas not logged at all, a large amount of marketable timber remained upon the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">In this connection, it will be noted that the last affidavit filed by Allen L. Piper, forester of defendant company, was executed on February 28,1949, obviously after the time when a representative of the defendant examined the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">It is clear to us from a close scrutiny of the record that when defendant\u2019s officers and employees signed the affidavits they knew what they were doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">The testimony of Earl Blake, a cattle rancher and owner of a small sawmill in the vicinity, pointedly sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>gests that the defendant had cut all the timber it thought merchantable and desired to cut. It follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">\u201cQ Now, do you recall a conversation that you had with Mr. Orville Smith of the Heppner Lumber Company, concerning the Hughes\u2019 land, which is involved in this controversy and which is indicated by the red and blue shaded areas on the map on the black board, which is Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 10? A I do, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">\u201cQ Would you state when and where this conversation took place? A It was about a year ago last spring in Mr. Smith\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">\u201cQ That is in Heppner, Oregon? A Yes, in the Heppner Sawmill office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">\u201cQ Would you state what was said? A I was there for the purpose of arranging to take their lumber out for them, and I also asked him if he knew where we could get some timber, that we were short, and he said that he didn\u2019t know. Then I asked if there wasn\u2019t something on the Hughes\u2019 tract and he said that there was none, that they had logged that off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">There is another reason why plaintiffs should prevail in this case. Since no time limit was specified in the deeds for the removal of the timber, defendant had a reasonable time for its removal. <em>Rayburn et ux. v. Crawford, et ux., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Glenn Parsons, defendant\u2019s logging expert, testified :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">\"Q * * * How long would it take to log it off, leaving off the argumentative part? A Pour months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-12\">\u201cQ And it could have been taken off in 1948 in 4 months, couldn\u2019t it? A I think it could.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">Mr. Smith, president of the company, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-14\">\u201cQ Assuming that there is approximately 3,500,000 feet of merchantable pine and fir on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>property now and that it is scattered over approximately 2,000 acres of land, how long would it ordinarily take to log that if yon were trying to do it in a reasonably economical fashion. * * * A It would take about one season, a logging season, to log it. In that area it is about 6 months. They could log about 6 months out of the 12.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">For over a period of years after defendant ceased logging operations no effort was made by it to remove the timber. In our opinion a reasonable time had elapsed for its removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b33-8\">WARNER, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"As\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">I am compelled to dissent for the reasons that follow, but primarily upon the ground that plaintiffs failed to sustain the burden of proving that the lumber company\u2019s title to the timber was forfeited by a lapse of a reasonable time in which to harvest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">As a result of a stipulation of the parties and order of the court, the three above entitled suits were consolidated for the purposes of appeal and argument. Justification for this course is found in the identical character of the complaints, answers and replies, except for the legal descriptions of the several parcels of real property involved. These lands comprehended approximately 2,000 acres located in what is known as the Blue Mountain Pine Belt in Morrow county, Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">All the plaintiffs seek to quiet title in themselves to cut-over timber lands separately described in their respective complaints. From decrees in favor of the defendant Heppner Lumber Company, the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">Pursuant to an agreement for the exchange of land and timber made between the plaintiffs Hughes or their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>predecessors in interest and the Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Co., predecessor to the defendant Heppner'Lumber Company, the following transactions were had between them:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">(1) On February 23, 1939, A. Percy Hughes and Mabel A. Hughes (one of the appellants) deeded to the Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Co. \u201call pine and merchantable fir timber\u201d situated upon approximately 1,160 acres of the land herein involved. By the terms of the conveyance, the grantors retained title to the land and agreed to pay the taxes due thereon, the grantee agreeing to reimburse them to the extent of one third of the taxes. This parcel I will hereinafter refer to as the \u201cHughes tract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">(2) On February 25, 1939, Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Co. conveyed to the plaintiff-appellant W. E. Hughes (also known as Edwin Hughes) and one Arthur Hughes approximately 692 acres of the land involved in this suit, reserving, however, to the grantor \u201call the pine and merchantable fir timber\u201d on said premises, \u201ctogether with the right to log the same at its convenience.\u201d This parcel I will hereinafter refer to as the \u201cPearson tract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Neither of the deeds specified a term for the removal of the timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The net result of these transactions, as of the dates thereof, was to leave the plaintiffs owning title to the land described in the deeds, which they have ever since used for grazing only. Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Co. thereafter owned all the pine and merchantable fir timber thereon. It subsequently transferred this interest to the defendant-respondent Heppner Lumber Company (hereinafter called the lumber company and meaning thereby not only the respondent but its predecessor, Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Co,).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Between the years 1939 and 1948 the lumber company removed the greater part of the pine and merchantable fir timber from the areas described in the deeds. This was done by different contract loggers, known to the industry as \u201cgypos\u201d. For various reasons, including weather conditions limiting logging operations to six months a year, logging difficulties, lack of equipment, neglect on the part of the respondent\u2019s contract loggers and, in part, to wartime restrictions, a portion of the merchantable timber alleged to have been on the deeded areas in 1939 had not been logged by the lumber company at the time of the commencement of the instant suits. The terrain upon which the timber was situated was mountainous and broken by many precipitous ravines and high ridges. This resulted in the loggers leaving some trees on high ridges and in isolated, relatively inaccessible pockets. There was also left a scattering of low-quality timber and yellow-bark trees in other portions of the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">As I have previously indicated, the appellants are the undisputed owners of the fee to all the lands in the Hughes and Pearson tracts and have been ever since the execution of the deeds hereinabove referred to, subject, however, to such interest as the lumber company may have in and to the timber reserved or conveyed to it by those deeds. The plaintiffs claim that the timber which was reserved by or deeded to the lumber company has been removed by the company\u2019s operators and, therefore, what timber presently remains is their own. In short, plaintiffs claim an absolute and complete ownership of the real property, including all timber now growing thereon, to the exclusion of any right, title or interest therein as claimed by the lumber company. Both plaintiffs and defendant seek to have their respective titles so quieted.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The basic issue for determination is: Has the respondent lumber company any interest in any timber presently standing on the land?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The appellants Hughes assert that the respondent lumber company has no interest in the timber for any one of the following reasons: (1) all timber owned by the lumber company had already been cut and removed; (2) if any such timber was left by respondent (which the appellants deny), then they claim that the lumber company had forfeited its right thereto because a reasonable time for its removal has expired; and (3) if any such timber remained, the lumber company had long since relinquished its right thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">For reasons that will presently appear, I first address myself to appellants\u2019 proposition (2). It is, in essence, a challenge to the soundness of the court\u2019s Finding XI, upon which respondent places heavy reliance. That finding reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201cIn the vicinity, timber contracts and deeds, involving areas of 2,000 acres, frequently provide for extended terms, for instance 15 years, for removal of the timber. Under all of the facts, 14 years is short of a reasonable time for removal of defendant\u2019s timber, and two additional years are reasonable for the removal of the remaining timber. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The law is settled in Oregon that when the contract does not fix the time in which the timber must be removed, it must be removed within a reasonable time. <em>Rayburn et ux. v. Crawford et ux., </em>187 Or 386, 399, 211 P2d 483; <em>Parsons v. Boggie, </em>139 Or 469, 472, 11 P2d 280. Also see Kinney, Essentials of American Timber Law, 146-149, \u00a7 116; 34 Am Jur 507, Logs and Timber, \u00a7 27; 54 CJS 704, Logs and Logging, \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">I have already noted that neither the preliminary agreement previously made between the parties nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>deeds thereafter given pursuant to it specified the time in which the timber was to be remov.ed, with the exception of the lumber company\u2019s deed of February 25 with a reservation reading, \u201call the pine and merchantable fir timber * <em>* </em>* together with the right to log the same <em>at its convenience.'\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Italics mine.) See 54 CJS 704, Logs and Logging, \u00a7 19. Such language is similar in import to the language of the contract in <em>Parsons v. Boggie, </em>supra, reserving the right to remove the timber \u201c <em>\u2018at any time\u2019 </em>\u201d, and held in the Parsons case to mean only a reasonable time. (Italics mine.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">To lay a proper foundation for a favorable finding that a reasonable time had elapsed, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to prove, under the formula of the Rayburn and Parsons cases, what was, in fact, a \u201creasonable time\u201d, that is, the length of time necessary in which to accomplish the complete removal of all the timber the lumber company had purchased or reserved, including when such \u201creasonable time\u201d began and when it terminated. The beginning point is one of easy determination. It necessarily runs from the dates of the deeds, that is, from the latter part of February 1939. <em>Rayburn et ux. v. Crawford et ux., </em>supra, at p. 399. Having once established the date when the \u201creasonable time\u201d began to run, the next step was to establish the length of time for removal. Our own cases furnish the rule for this calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In <em>Parsons v. Boggie, </em>supra, at p. 472, we observed that a \u201creasonable time\u201d depends upon \u201cthe particular facts in each case.\u201d In <em>Rayburn et ux. v. Crawford et ux., </em>supra, at p. 399, it is said (quoting from <em>Union Sawmill v. Agerton, </em>181 Ark 144, 25 SW2d 13, 14):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">\u201c'* * * What is a reasonable time depends upon circumstances such as the quantity of timber, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the character of it, facilities for marketing it, and all other facts and circumstances showing the conditions surrounding the parties <em>at the time of the execution of the contract. </em>In case of dispute, this becomes a question of fact for the determination of the court or of the jury trying the case. * * *' <em>\u201d </em>(Italics mine.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Also see 34 Am Jur 507, Logs and Timber, \u00a7 28; 54 CJS 705, Logs and Logging, \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Thus it follows that the court must be placed, so far as possible, in the same situation the parties were in when they executed their respective deeds. In that position, the court then measures the probable total time .for the logging of the timber <em>in terms of circumstances and conditions prevailing in the theater of operations in 1939. </em>With these factors established and in mind, the court will then look forward prospectively to determine what would, in fact, constitute a reasonable time to complete the removal of the timber deeded or reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">This concept bars a retrospective consideration, that is, a speculative examination of facts and circumstances, particularly when made in terms of improved methods of logging unknown to the parties in 1939 but which might have come into existence after the cutting operations began in February 1939. It would be easier to say in September 1953, the month of the trial and more than 14 years after the removal of the first timber began, that, in the light of the then known more modern logging techniques and more modern machinery then in use in logging operations of the community where the premises are located, it should take, for example, only four months or six months to complete the removal and far less than the term of 14 years stated in the decree. However, such a method of deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ruination is not contemplated by the Bayburn and Parsons cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">No doubt, a retrospective determination as of trial time in September 1953 would result in a shorter \u201creasonable time\u201d than if that more or less illusive factor were established prospectively as of February 1939. However, to make the approach on that basis would vary the initial agreement as made by the parties subject to and under the circumstances and conditions prevailing in 1939. If the forward-looking determination of \u201creasonable time\u201d made as of February 1939 might, for example, justify a period of 20 years in which to remove the timber, then the lumber company would be entitled to its full bargain, that is, 20 years in which to accomplish the harvest of its trees, and could not be limited to a lesser term of perhaps 15 years, which might seem to be a justified estimate when derived by looking backward 14 years from September 1953. In short, the terminal date of the reasonable period would be the date of the deeds, plus such length of time as was found to be reasonable when determined under the rule laid down in the Bayburn and Parsons eases, with such extension given for equitable reasons hereinafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Having first made a determination of what was a \u201creasonable time\u201d to harvest the logs, according to the rule in the Bayburn case, there is nothing to preclude the court from thereafter taking into consideration certain events, if any, which may have occurred after the date of the deeds and which in their nature could not have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time of the execution of their agreement. Such unforeseen events generally are those beyond the control of the grantee and of a nature to interrupt or delay the mechanics of the timber harvest and of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>character which would warrant a court in proper cases granting an extension but not a curtailment of the previously determined \u201creasonable time\u201d by way of compensation .for the time lost because of the happening of such unforeseen or unforeseeable events.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is settled that a court of equity may extend the time for cutting or removing the timber if there are equitable grounds of excuse for not removing the timber within such time as the court may have earlier determined as a reasonable time. Acts of God or acts of the vendor or grantor resulting in unforeseen delays exemplify but do not limit the reasons for such equitable indulgence in proper cases. 34 Am Jur 515, Logs and Timber, \u00a7 36; 54 CJS 710, Logs and Logging, \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">There is much evidence in the record from the mouths of plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s witnesses indicating varying periods of time that it would take <em>to remove the remaining merchantable timber; </em>but we are not concerned here as to the length of time it will take to harvest the 3,347,000 feet of the 1939 merchantable timber now on the premises, whether done by prevailing methods of logging or those of the 1939 era. Our only concern is whether the removal of the remaining timber can be completed within the time contemplated by the parties or their predecessors in 1939, plus such additional time, if any, as the court may allow by reason of the happening of events not in the contemplation of the parties when the deeds were executed and delivered and which might equitably excuse delays by reason thereof. For example, if this court could find from the evidence that in 1939 twelve years appeared to the parties as a reasonable time in which to remove the timber, but because of wartime restrictions imposed by the federal government the lumber company was delayed five years, then the period for removing the tim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ber would not terminate until February 1956 and wbat timber remained would have to be removed before then or the lumber company\u2019s rights therein would be forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">It is apparent from the record here that each party was persuaded the burden of producing evidence and proving whether or not a reasonable time had elapsed rested upon his adversary. Such is the trial record and such is the argument of the parties in their respective briefs. It is, therefore, necessary to determine where this burden actually reposed in order to appraise properly the result which follows. In this case the discovery of where the burden lies becomes very important in evaluating the sufficiency of the proof on the issue of \u2018 \u2018 reasonable time \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The true test is to be found in the nature of the pleadings peculiar to a suit to quiet title. In such a suit the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title and not on the weaknesses of his adversary\u2019s title. The burden is on plaintiff to establish that he has a perfect legal or equitable title, regardless of whether defendant\u2019s title is valid or invalid. As a result, when properly in issue under the pleadings, plaintiff has the burden of showing that his title is superior to the defendant\u2019s. <em>Murphy.v. Bjelik, </em>87 Or 329, 345, 169 P 520, 170 P 723. This is true even where each party claims to be the owner of or have some interest in the subjedt property and when it is incumbent on each to make good by evidence his affirmative averments touching his own title. <em>Darling v. Christensen, </em>166 Or 17, 26, 109 P2d 585; <em>Durkin v. Ward, </em>66 Or 335, 338, 133 P 345. Also see 74 CJS 119, Quieting Title, \u00a7 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Where the defendant asserts an adverse claim, as here, it becomes incumbent upon the plaintiffs to prove that such a claim is invalid or, in terms of plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>allegations in this matter, that the lumber company\u2019s claim of interest or estate \u201cis false and without any right.\u201d 74 CJS 121, Quieting Title, \u00a7 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">When a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, the burden of going forward with the evidence will be shifted to defendant. <em>Evans v. Marvin, </em>76 Or 540, 544, 148 P 1119. In the instant matter it is necessary for plaintiffs to make out only a prima facie case in order to put the defendant lumber company on its proof; but the burden of proof, which rests upon plaintiffs when the allegations of the complaint are denied, <em>does not shift. </em>If defendant has established the due execution of the' instrument under which it claims, the burden is again cast on plaintiffs to show facts in avoidance; and if they succeed in doing so, the burden of going forward with the evidence returns to defendant. 74 CJS 121, Quieting Title, \u00a7 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The confusion and not infrequent loose statements which are sometimes found concerning the purport of the \u201cshifting of the burden of proof\u201d in suits of this kind prompt us to employ the following clarifying statement as conveying our meaning here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201cThe courts frequently do say that when plaintiff in an action to quiet title has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case the burden of proof shifts to defendant. The difficulty arises because the words \u2018burden of proof\u2019 are used in two senses; one to indicate the burden which rests upon the plaintiff when the allegations of the petition are denied, and the other to indicate the duty to meet and rebut some evidence introduced by the adverse party by proof to overbear it in the' mind of the tribunal. The burden of proof in the former case does not shift. The duty of going forward with the evidence may shift from time to time.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>Lake Front Corp. v.

By the terms of the conveyance, defendant has a perpetual right to remove the pine and merchantable fir timber situated on said real property, or, in any event, a reasonable time to remove said timber at its convenience. <em>A reasonable time for the removal of such timber has not elapsed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">\u201cII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\"><em>\u201cAt the time or times when defendant and its predecessor acquired or retained ownership of the standing timber, a period of from 15 to 99 years was regarded as a reasonable time for the removal of timber from lands located in the general vicinity of the real property described in the complaint.\u201d </em>(Italics mine.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">In terms of pleading, the complaints and defendant\u2019s answer contain all the essential allegations de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>manded in a suit of this nature. The answer, however, goes beyond the boundaries of good pleading to the extent that it contains several unnecessary, but not fatal, averments. This fault is found in the pleading of anticipatory defenses. The parts of defendant\u2019s further and separate answer vulnerable to that criticism are those which are quoted above, with emphasis upon that portion of the answer which alleges that the lumber company\u2019s title to the standing timber is encumbered with a condition subsequent, i. e., it is subject to termination upon the happening of a future event \u2014 the elapse of a reasonable time in which to remove the timber conveyed by the deeds in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The rule is established that the pleader is under no legal obligation to the adverse party to advise him of the defense he should interpose, nor is it necessary or proper for a pleader so to do, and under it the pleader ought not to anticipate or negative a possible defense. A condition which qualifies or defeats the pleader\u2019s title, being a condition subsequent, may be safely ignored by him in the pleading. \u201cIn general, non-performance or non-occurrence of a condition subsequent need not be alleged\u201d, since its nonperformance is a matter of defense to be availed of affirmatively by an answer or, as in this case, by a reply. 71 CJS 193, Pleading, \u00a7 80; Phillips, Code Pleading 2d ed, 303, \u00a7 294; and see notes in Pomeroy, Code Remedies 5th ed, 779, \u00a7 471, under heading \u201cConditions Subsequent, Negativing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The foregoing rule was employed and applied in <em>Little Nestucca Road Company v.

Cellars-Murton Co., </em>92 Or 113, 121, 170 P 298, 179 P 561; <em>Murphy v. Bjelik, </em>supra, at p. 345; <em>Durkin v. Ward, </em>supra, at p. 338; <em>Clark v. City of Salem, </em>61 Or 116, 121, 121 P 416, Ann Cas 1914B 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">However, this burden does not carry with it the obligation to make good the pleader\u2019s affirmative allegations which are in the nature of anticipatory defenses. This is for the evident reason that such allegations in anticipation are superfluous, immaterial and improper as they do not state facts belonging to the pleader\u2019s ease and may be disregarded by the adversary. 1 Bancroft, Code Pleading, supra, p. 288, \u00a7 168; Bliss, Code Pleading, supra, p. 316, \u00a7 200; 1 Sutherland, Code Pleading, 162, \u00a7 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The reason for the law\u2019s antipathy for anticipatory pleadings is stated in Mr. Justice Robert Bean\u2019s opinion in <em>Savage v. Savage </em>(a suit to quiet title), 51 Or 167, 171, 94 P 182:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201cThe better practice in this class of cases is for a court to decline to determine the validity of defendant\u2019s claim, even if plaintiff has assumed to set it out in the complaint, until he has disclosed it by answer. Its nature is necessarily known to him, but may not be to the plaintiff, and therefore the court, in attempting to adjudicate it before answer, may be deciding a mere moot question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Without moving against the irrelevant anticipatory allegations found in defendant\u2019s answer, the parties went to trial. Unnecessary anticipatory allegations do not vitiate the pleadings of which they are a part but, as suggested by Mr. Justice Bean in the Savage case, frequently create situations during the progress of the trial which ought to be avoided when possible. Here, the lumber company\u2019s answer apparently resulted in a mistaken notion of when the <em>burden of going forward </em>shifted in contradistinction to who had the <em>burden of </em>proof, and a further erroneous notion that having pleaded allegations anticipatory in character, the defendant pleader thereby incurred a burden to supply evidence in proof of these immaterial allegations of its answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">After introducing the contract and deeds provocative of the present suit, through and under which plaintiffs and defendant each claim title, and several statements \u2014 referred to in the majority opinion \u2014 filed in the assessor\u2019s office indicating the removal of taxable timber from a large area of the property described in the deeds, the plaintiffs rested their case, as they properly could at that stage of the trial. If nothing else was shown, deeds operating to vest title in fee simple in plaintiffs, as they claim, constituted at least a prima facie proof of the allegations of the complaint. <em>Evans v. Marvin, </em>supra, 66 Or at p. 340. When that point was attained, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifted to the defendant lumber company. <em>Evans v. Marvin, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">I have noted that the alleged titles of the opposing parties spring from the same conveyances introduced by plaintiffs. In fact, they served a twofold purpose by proving a prima facie case of title for the plaintiffs and also for defendant. Although it was incumbent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>upon the defendant to establish its own case, at this juncture it was not bound to do more than make a prima facie showing. As hereinbefore said, this did not impose upon the lumber company an obligation at that point in the trial to establish, as a part of its prima facie case, proof that its title to the timber was subject to extinguishment by removal or, if not entirely removed, then by an elapse of a reasonable time measured from the date of the deeds, nor was the lumber company then bounden to establish what constituted a reasonable time for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">When the defendant had established the execution of the deeds under which it claimed, in the normal course of presentation the burden again shifted back to the plaintiffs to show facts in avoidance; and if they had so done, then the burden of going forward would again have shifted back to the defendant to rebut, if it could, the showing made by plaintiffs in avoidance of the lumber company\u2019s claim of title in the timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">However, having unnecessarily assumed, as a part of its case in chief, to offer without objection evidence concerning the nonoccurrence of the condition subsequent, the defendant reversed the traditional order of presenting the evidence in a suit of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">I venture to say that had the parties carefully observed the rules relating to the sufficiency of proving a prima facie case and the burden imposed upon the plaintiffs to go forward and avoid the defendant\u2019s prima facie proof of title, a stronger and better showing would have been made by both parties, or by one or the other of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">I have diligently read and considered all the testimony accompanying the transcript and, for the reasons which follow, am of the opinion that there is no clear and convincing evidence in the record, brought forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>by either party, from which it may be concluded what is a reasonable length of time in which to remove the timber in controversy and, hence, whether or not such \u201creasonable time\u201d has elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Turning to a consideration of the evidence of the several witnesses produced by plaintiffs and defendant on the question of when defendant\u2019s rights in the timber terminate, let us first look to plaintiffs\u2019 case on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The plaintiffs depended solely on the testimony of Bruce E. Hoffman, a consulting forester and admittedly a person of rich background in forestry, to sustain their position that the time for removing the timber had long since elapsed. Hoffman testified that 15 million feet could have been removed in two years; but in all his estimates of time for removal of merchantable timber, he referred to and defined \u201cmerchantable timber\u201d as that kind of timber \u201cwhich can be converted into <em>products that can he marketed at a profit\u201d. </em>(Italics mine.) Profit is not a proper element of merchantability when employed in the phrase \u201cmerchantable timber\u201d; it does not lose its merchantable character if it is salable, even though its sale cannot be consummated at a profit to its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In <em>Dahl et al. v. Crain et ux., </em>193 Or 207, 237 P2d 939, this court had before it a contract for the sale of \u201c \u2018all merchantable timber\u2019 \u201d located upon a tract of land in Crook county. The ultimate purchase price was dependent upon a cruise made by a cruiser selected by the buyers. The evidence revealed that the only timber cruised was such as \u201cwould <em>\u2018render a net profit </em>to the type of sawmill Mr. Johnson [one of the buyers] was planning to operate\u2019(Italics mine.) The cruiser testified that all other timber was disregarded. (193 Or 218) In canceling the contract because of misrep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>resentations made to the sellers Crain as to the true amount of \u201cmerchantable timber\u201d, the court said, at p. 225:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">\u201cIt must be kept in mind that the parties were dealing with \u2018merchantable timber.\u2019 It is so described in the contract entered into between them. At no time during their negotiations did Johnson even intimate to defendants that he considered as \u2018merchantable timber\u2019 only that which would return to him a net profit in the type of operation which he claims he had in mind. We know of no authority, nor has any been cited to us, that defines \u2018merchantable timber\u2019 to be only such as that contained in the instructions given Milius [the cruiser hired by Johnson].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The extent of the merchantable timber in the instant matter, with its incident of fluctuating values when quantitatively estimated in terms of timber which could be marketed at a profit, furnishes no sound basis, of course, for the determination of what was on the premises in 1939, or in any year thereafter, which could be of assistance to the court in making this necessary finding of what was a reasonable time in which to harvest such timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The majority opinion leans heavily upon the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 witness Hoffman, forgetting apparently that his conclusions rest upon his own premise that \u201cmerchantable\u201d, when applied to timber, must be read as synonymous with \u201cprofitable\u201d. His phrases quoted in the majority opinion are likewise tinctured with the \u201cprofit\u201d concept of merchantability when he speaks of \u201cWhat was left is <em>practically of no value under those conditions at that time\u201d </em>and again by his affirmative answer when asked if \u201call of the timber which <em>had commercial value in 1939 </em>had been removed\u201d. (Italics mine.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>So, too, must one read the majority opinion\u2019s quotations from the testimony of Orville Smith, vice president and general manager of the lumber company, and Glenn Parsons, who superintended the company\u2019s logging operations and cruised the questioned timber just before trial but who did not come into that area until 1945. That is to say, their words, as quoted by the majority opinion, stress the <em>profit element </em>when discussing the value of the timber removed or to be removed. This is illustrated by that part of the quotation from Smith\u2019s testimony reading, \u201cwe had to leave some that the cost would be a little too great <em>to make a profit on it; </em>after we get it in, the log costs would be too great.\u201d The character of the quoted part of Parsons\u2019 testimony likewise stresses the profit factor when he says, \u201cSome areas due to certain conditions make a tract <em>operable </em>and some of them <em>inoperable </em>due to the volume, terraine [sic], and so on, accessibility, whether you could go in and <em>log it and do it economi</em>cally(Italics mine.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u201cOperable\u201d is defined by Webster as \u201cpractical\u201d and when so read in conjunction with the context of Parsons\u2019 testimony at the point from which the quotation is excised unquestionably gives to the phrase \u201cmerchantable timber\u201d the character of timber which can only be logged and sold at a profit; so, too, the foregoing references to Hoffman\u2019s and Smith\u2019s testimony. Yet, when so construed, they lose worth and weight as evidence in this matter because as we said in <em>Dahl et al. v. Crain et ux., </em>supra, at p. 225, \u201cWe know of no authority, nor has any been cited to us, that defines \u2018merchantable timber\u2019 to be only [that which would return a net profit].\u201d If we introduce for the convenience of easy solution the words \u201cpractical\u201d, \u201cof commercial value\u201d and \u201coperable\u201d as equivalents of \u201cmerchant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>able\u201d timber \u2014 meaning timber that can at a given time be logged and converted into lumber selling at a \u201cprofit\u201d \u2014 then we are creating an element and meaning not known to the industry nor to the law in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Ordinarily, \u201cmerchantable timber\u201d of a given contract is determined, in the absence of anything in the writing to the contrary, by the standard in use at the time the deed or agreement was executed. The general rule is that when standing timber of designated dimensions or to be used for designated purposes is sold, only such timber is conveyed as measures up to such dimensions or is suitable for the purposes specified <em>as of the date of the deed or contract of sale. </em>34 Am Jur 504, Logs and Timber, \u00a7 22; 54 CJS 696, Logs and Logging, \u00a7 17b. The fundamental principles above enunciated were employed in Oregon in <em>Tenny v. Mulvaney, </em>9 Or 405, 410, more than 74 years ago where this court in determining the meaning of \u201c \u2018good, sound, merchantable logs\u2019 \u201d, as used in the contract then before it in that case, laid down this classic test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201c* * * The words used in that contract, to denote the quality of logs to be delivered, are \u2018good, sound, merchantable logs.\u2019 Evidently these descriptive words should be construed together, and in view of the use to be made of the logs which the written instrument shows to have been in contemplation of both parties when they executed it, and with reference to the place where the contract was to be performed. (Tenny v. Mulvaney, 8 Or., 517.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201cA log might be \u2018good, sound and merchantable\u2019 for many purposes, and yet not fit for being manufactured into lumber, and the same log might, owing to a difference in the settled usages of the business in two different localities,' be deemed a \u2018merchantable\u2019 log in one and not in the other. \u2018Merchantable\u2019 logs, then, in reference to the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ness of manufacturing lumber in any particular locality, are such logs as are ordinarily used for that purpose at that particular place, and if the usage of the business in that locality requires the logs ordinarily used to be \u2018good and sound,\u2019 then the word \u2018merchantable\u2019 would include the particular meaning of each, and render their employment of no utility in any such contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">With the slender thread of support tendered by Hoffman\u2019s testimony which, standing alone, is no support for any theory of \u201creasonable time\u201d in this case, the plaintiffs turn in vain to the testimony adduced by the defendant in their effort to supplement that which was their burden to supply. Unfortunately, the weak and incomplete record of \u201creasonable time\u201d, as we shall presently see, is utterly inadequate to supply the deficiencies in plaintiffs\u2019 evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Let us now consider what, in fact, is the testimony, if any, produced by the defendant lumber company which will assist this court in making any determination of a reasonable period to remove the timber from plaintiffs\u2019 lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The lumber company\u2019s evidence was tendered through Orville Smith, Glenn Parsons and P. W. Ma-honey, an officer and director of the lumber company who since 1931 has been actively engaged in the practice of law in Heppner. The testimony of these three men was supplemented by two deeds, hereinafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Mahoney\u2019s testimony was evidently offered as proof that it was the custom of the community to allow from 15 to 25 years as a reasonable time in which to remove timber of the kind conveyed or reserved here and situated on comparable land of the same approximate area.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In using the word \u201ccustom\u201d in this matter, I employ it in its more popular sense as a practice or course of acting. 25 CJS 77, Customs and Usages, \u00a7 1. Also see <em>Maeder Steel Products Co. v. Zanello, </em>109 Or 562, 579, 220 P 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In 54 CJS 706, Logs and Logging, \u00a7 19, will be found this statement on the subject of local custom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\u201cA local custom or usage is not ordinarily relevant or material evidence in determining what is a reasonable time, which should not be determined with respect thereto unless its observance was shown to be general and universal as to what became necessarily, by implication, a part of the contract.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Making an established custom a part of the contract accords with the practice in Oregon. In <em>Harrison v. Birrell, </em>58 Or 410, 420, 115 P 141, this court cited with approval and followed the practice then prevailing in the state of Massachusetts. It quoted from <em>Sawtelle v. Drew, </em>122 Mass 229, saying: \u201c \u2018A custom, within the meaning of the law, if general, is incorporated into and becomes a part of every contract to which it is applicable ; if local, of every contract made by parties having knowledge of or bound to know its existence.\u2019 \u201d Also see <em>Hurst v. Lake &amp; Co., </em>146 Or 500, 503, 31 P2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The substance of Mahoney\u2019s direct examination was predicated upon his knowledge gleaned solely from timber contracts relating to timber sales in Morrow county and other counties immediately adjacent thereto and examined in his own practice. In response to a question as to \u201cwhat periods of time are commonly put in these contracts for the removal of timber off of tracts running up to a couple thousand acres\u201d, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>replied: \u201cWhile there has been variance in contracts, some more and some less, 25 years.\u201d He then testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cQ Have you represented owners of timber here that negotiated' these contracts for the sale of their timber to any saw mills in this general area!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cA Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\"Q And have you drawn contracts that provide for 25 year periods for removal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\"><em>\"* </em>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">\"A Yes * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">On cross examination Mahoney admitted that he had no personal knowledge of how much timber there was on the land in 1939 and that he did not know how long it would take to remove it. When asked to \u201cname\u201d or produce some of the \u201csimilar contracts\u201d providing 25 years for removal of the timber, he was able to refer to only four isolated agreements. Bach of the agreements cited was executed subsequent to World War II, i. e., in or about 1948, or nearly nine years after the deeds in controversy. He denied personal knowledge of any others. Only two of the said four agreements mentioned by Mahoney were later offered in evidence, and the others were rejected. His testimony with reference to these two rejected agreements was properly stricken. Eelying on his memory, he also referred vaguely to three other contracts, covering less than 2,000 acres, providing for ten years or less for removal, and otherwise not comparable to the present deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The foregoing, in quoted and summarized form, constitutes Mahoney\u2019s entire contribution on the subject of a \u201creasonable time\u201d for removal of defendant\u2019s timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">To successfully prove custom, the witness after being first qualified should have been asked, in substance, whether he knew of any general custom or usage in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>vicinity of the lands in controversy during the time in question, that is, February 1939, relative to what constituted a reasonable time to remove timber of the kind acquired by the lumber company from lands of the same approximate terrain and situated in the area where said timber was growing and comprised of 2,000 acres, more or less. If the witness answers in the affirmative, he should have stated, as a matter of fact and not of law, what was the custom. <em>Green Mt. L. Co. v. C. &amp; N. R. R., </em>141 Or 188, 192, 16 P2d 1106; 25 CJS 126, Customs and Usages, \u00a7 33b; Lawson, Usages and Customs, \u00a7 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">As succinctly stated in <em>Central Radiator Co. v. Niagara Fire Ins. Co., </em>109 NJ Law 48, 160 Atl 342, and cited with approval in <em>Green Mt. L. Co. v. C. &amp; N. R. R., </em>supra, at p. 192, the rule is \u201c 'If a trade or business custom is to be proved, the first thing to prove is that it exists, i. e., that there is a custom; and if there is one, then what it is.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">On cross examination it would, of course, be proper to inquire of the witness concerning particular instances wherein a given length of time had been used as the measure of a reasonable time for the removal of timber of the amount and kind and from areas like those found in the deeds here. The method of proving custom is analogous to that of proving reputation. <em>Green Mt. L. Co. v. C. &amp; N. R. R., </em>supra, at p. 192; <em>Conner v. Citizens Street R. R. Co., </em>146 Ind 430, 45 NE 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Mahoney did not qualify to answer the questions propounded to him relative to the customs prevailing in 1939; but even if it is assumed he was qualified, he was not asked and did not answer the vital question as to whether he knew of any general custom with respect to the reasonableness of time necessary in 1939 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>to remove timber in kind, amount and location comparable to that acquired or reserved by the lumber company under the Hughes deeds. His testimony was limited exclusively to a few contracts he had seen in his own practice, and these had little or no value for the present purpose. No testimony from Mahoney or any other witness can be found affirming the existence of a custom with respect to the time of removal which would warrant the reception of evidence of particular instances of the custom as exemplified by deeds or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Orville Smith, vice president and general manager of the lumber company, testified that he did not know how much timber was on the land in 1939, but as of the date of trial it would take only one season to remove the remaining timber. He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cQ Mr. Smith, do you know how much timber was logged off the Hughes\u2019 land?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cA I don\u2019t have the figures here, but I could get them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cQ You don\u2019t have any idea what they were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cA No, I couldn\u2019t give them to you, the exact amount. It has been quite sometime ago and I would have to go back to our records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">We interpolate to say that he did not, nor was he asked to, produce such records. His examination continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">\u201cQ Was-it more or less than 15,000,000 feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">\u201cA I would say less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">\u201cQ Less than 15,000,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-14\">\u201cA I believe so, that is as near as I can tell you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">Smith\u2019s testimony strongly indicates that there had been a striking change in the methods of logging between 1939 and 1953. After having testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>logging contractors working for the lumber company and elsewhere in the community used plow horses in their operations in 1939, he was asked by defendant\u2019s counsel on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cQ Is logging still being done by horses today in this country, here in the pine country?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201cA Oh, not today, unless there might be on a rare occasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The foregoing is substantially all of Smith\u2019s testimony on the subject of \u201creasonable time\u201d. His is the only testimony offered by defendant that ventures to say how much timber was removed by the lumber company prior to the cessation of its active operation, which, if more accurate than supplied by Smith, might have been used as a basis for determining what part o.f an ascertained \u201creasonable time\u201d was necessary to complete the removal of the balance of the timber. To say, as did Smith, that they removed \u201cless than 15,-000,000 feet\u201d contributed nothing to the solution of the ultimate problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Three deeds not mentioned by Mahoney were offered in evidence by the defendant and were admitted by the court for the purpose of showing what might customarily be considered a \u201creasonable time\u201d in the vicinity of defendant\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Notwithstanding the absence of sufficient proof of the existence of what was customarily regarded as a reasonable time for removal of the timber, as a condition precedent to evidence of particular examples of the custom, we will give notice to the three deeds for what they may be worth. <em>Green Mt. L. Co. v. C. &amp; N. R. R., </em>supra, at p. 192. We do so because these deeds appear to have been very influential in formulating the court\u2019s judgment, as is evident from the first sentence of the court\u2019s Finding XI reading: \u201cIn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>vicinity, timber contracts and deeds, involving areas of 2,000 acres, frequently provide for extended terms, for instance 15 years, for removal of the timber.\u201d The deeds were marked Exhibits F, Gr and I and will be so referred to hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Exhibit I is a deed from the appellants to respondent\u2019s predecessor dated February 21, 1939, and conveying timber on lands not here involved. The language of this deed is identical to the language found in the deed from A. Percy Hughes to the Bridal Veil Lumber &amp; Box Co., a conveyance of timber involved in the instant suit. It is, therefore, devoid of any value on the. issue of reasonable time or, indeed, upon any other issue in the suit in that no time for removal is directly or indirectly provided for therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Exhibit F, dated May 20, 1940, conveyed \u201call the pine timber\u201d upon 520 acres of land situated in Morrow county near the appellants\u2019 tracts. It allowed 15 years for the removal of the timber. It fails, however, to be comparable to the situation presented by the deeds in this matter in the following respects: (1) the timber conveyed is limited solely to pine timber, whereas the deeds in this matter grant title to \u201call pine and merchantable fir timber\u201d; (2) the area, 520 acres, is only about one fourth of the aggregate area involved here; and (3) although in Morrow county, the timber conveyed by Exhibit F is about 25 or 30 miles from the Hughes land.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Exhibit Gr, a deed dated November 24,1924, involved a reservation of timber upon 4,031.9 acres in the area and permitted the grantor approximately 25 years for removal of the timber \u201cin accordance with the provisions, terms and conditions of a certain contract made and entered into by and between the parties hereto on the 24 day of November 1924\u201d. The contract men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>tioned was not offered. In addition to the absence of the contract, the terms and conditions of which are made a part of Exhibit Gr and without which the probative value of that exhibit for the purposes offered is rendered nugatory, we also observe that (1) this deed was dated November 24, 1924, about 15 years before the transactions had by the Hughes\u2019 with respondent\u2019s predecessor; and (2) it established a time limit for the cutting of timber on twice the amount of acreage owned by the Hughes\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Without pausing to consider the admissibility of the deeds last referred to, I find that the isolated transactions reflected thereby are entitled to no weight and show no prevailing \u201creasonable time\u201d for removal of timber which attains the dignity of custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Respondent, however, warns against disturbing the findings of the lower court, implying that this court must accord to them a higher degree of legal verity than the law actually demands. It points to Finding XI and says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cAll of the testimony was given by witnesses who testified in the presence of the trial judge. Under these circumstances, the Findings of Fact * * * are entitled to great weight. * * * The major part of appellants\u2019 brief voices their disapproval of the conclusions drawn by the trial court from the testimony of the witnesses. The court\u2019s Findings of Fact, however, were based upon substantial evidence and as this court has many times said should not be disturbed. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">This obviously is an overstatement, confusing in part the weight to be given findings of fact made in a law action with the weight to be accorded findings entered in a suit in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The lower court\u2019s finding as to what constitutes a reasonable time is in no sense conclusive or binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>upon this court. OES 17.440 provides that when equity-cases are appealed \u201cthe cause shall he tried anew <em>without reference to such </em>findings.\u201d (Italics mine.) Notwithstanding the apparent limitation of that statutory provision, it has long been settled in this state that when this court finds the evidence conflicting, the findings of the lower court may be considered as persuasive but not conclusive. In the first comprehensive discussion of the weight to be accorded such findings in equity, Mr. Justice Wolverton in <em>Nessley v. Ladd, </em>29 Or 354, 364, 45 P 904 (1896), concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201c* * * But it is the primary duty of this court to try the case anew,\u2014that is, entire, upon the transcript and the evidence accompanying it; and <em>it is only for the purpose of resolving a doubt which may arise from the conflicting and contradictory nature of the evidence that the findings of the referee or the court below are resorted to and become of value, </em>and then it may be said to be a cogent argument that because of the superior advantages accorded them they are more likely to be right than this court could be if their findings should be entirely discarded.\u201d (Italics mine.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">As recently as 1951 <em>Nessley v. Ladd, </em>supra, was cited and approved by us, in <em>Ward v. Town Tavern et al., </em>191 Or 1, 37, 228 P2d 216, and should be deemed to be the law today.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">This court is not bound to speculate on the reasons why both plaintiffs and defendant failed to meet the burden to support their respective theories on the question of reasonable time for removal. This situation probably arises from a misconception of their respective responsibilities in carrying the burden as to whether or not the condition subsequent, which was an incident of defendant\u2019s title, had occurred or had not occurred. This would account for the extended effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>that the defendant needlessly and unsuccessfully made in conjunction with the presentation of its prima facie case by then attempting to show that the time for removal of the timber had not elapsed and that defendant\u2019s rights therein had not been forfeited. Plaintiffs apparently shared the idea that the burden of such a showing rested not on them but on the defendant lumber company because of its anticipatory pleas; and they, therefore, contented themselves with the lesser and insufficient proof which they adduced through Hoffman.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The foregoing conclusions with respect to the insufficiency of evidence on the vital question of what constitutes a \u201creasonable time\u201d renders extensive, if, indeed, any, comment unnecessary as to appellants\u2019 first and third propositions urged as additional reasons for negativing respondent\u2019s claim of interest in the timber. It will be recalled that the first was a contention that all merchantable timber owned by the lumber company had been cut and removed, and the third one was conditioned that if any such timber remained, the lumber company had relinquished its right thereto by reason of the statements it had filed with the county assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Both propositions have been given earnest consideration and no merit is found in either. My views on both are in accord with that part of the circuit court\u2019s Finding VT reading: \u201cOn the two tracts there is a total of 3,347,000 feet of merchantable timber that had been purchased by defendant\u2019s predecessor in 1939, had been paid for in full, and the title to which is now in defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Appellants\u2019 third contention is predicated solely upon six affidavits in evidence. These were originally filed by defendant with the assessor from time to time to disclose to that official that taxable timber had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>removed from areas therein described. The lumber company claims that they were based upon false or inaccurate information supplied by the gypo contractors who logged the areas for the defendant. The lower court so found and accorded them no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The majority refer to these affidavits and speak of their \u201cevidentiary value\u201d, saying they are content that the affiants \u201cknew what they were doing\u201d when they signed them; but that opinion fails to state what \u201cevidentiary value\u201d they have. The only claim that plaintiffs make for these affidavits is found in their brief which reads: \u201cFiling of the timber affidavits and ceasing to pay taxes constituted a relinquishment of all its [defendant\u2019s] timber rights pursuant to the 1939 contract and deeds.\u201d They also say in their brief: \u201c* * * We submit that filing the affidavits and stopping payment of taxes was a clear expression of its right to relinquish its interest under this deed whether the timber was removed or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Although the word \u201crelinquishment\u201d is employed by plaintiffs, it is synonymous with the word \u201cabandonment\u201d. In the law of property, \u201cabandonment\u201d means the relinquishment of all title, possession or claim or virtually throwing the property away. <em>In re Hess' Estate </em>(Sur) 257 NYS 278, 143 Misc 335. Also see <em>Sharkey v. Candiani, </em>48 Or 112, 126, 85 P 219, 7 LRA NS 791, reading: <em>\u201c* * * </em>Abandonment * * * is generally understood to mean the intentional relinquishment of a known right: <em>Oviatt v. Big Four Min. Co., </em>39 Or 118 (65 Pac. 811).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In the absence of a statement elucidating what the majority conceive to be the \u201cevidentiary value\u201d of the timber affidavits, it is a fair assumption that the majority are claiming that they evidence the relinquishment or abandonment of title just as the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>claim they do, for it is clear from the brief that was the purpose for which the affidavits were introduced. Certainly, no other kind of evidentiary value is claimed by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Assuming for the moment, but not conceding, that an abandonment of a title and estate in real property can be accomplished by acts less than the giving of a deed or court action, it is obvious that the affidavits did not accomplish that result. This is true even though one also holds that the affiants are irrevocably bound by the incorrect information supplied by the gypo loggers. The following reasons warrant this conclusion: (1) only one deed in evidence bound the lumber company to pay one third of the taxes levied against the timber on what has been heretofore described as the Hughes tract of 1,160 acres; (2) so far as I can determine from the evidence, no affidavits of cut-off were filed as to 3 forties of the Hughes area and 7 forties of the Pearson tract, thus leaving approximately 400 acres of timberland <em>not </em>\u201cabandoned\u201d, that is, if we accept plaintiffs\u2019 theory of abandonment; and (3) a form of relinquishment by the lumber company of defendant\u2019s rights in the timber conveyed by the deed to the Hughes tract is provided in that instrument in these words: \u201c* * * the grantee [lumber company] * * * may relinquish its interest in the property at any time by giving written thirty days notice to the owners of the above described property * * No notice of this kind was given, nor is it so claimed by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">However, can one actually and legally accomplish an abandonment of title in real property in the manner suggested by plaintiffs and apparently approved by the opinion of the majority? I earnestly submit that it cannot be done. In so saying, one must be mindful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>that in this jurisdiction it is well established that ownership in growing timber is an estate in real property which, in the instant matter, is vested in the lumber company; and as far as I am informed, such a title can be divested only by deed or some action in a court of record. The following will be found in 73 CJS 208, Property, \u00a7 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cMere inaction or indifference of a fee owner will not divest his title. Disclaimer of freehold can be only by deed or in court of record. One cannot divest himself of title to land by mere declarations that he does not own or claim any of it, and a vested title to land cannot be lost by oral admission that it is the property of another. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">1 Am Jur 5, Abandonment, \u00a7 6. We are also so taught by <em>Sharkey v. Candiani, </em>supra, where Mr. Justice Moore says, at p. 126:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * An abandonment results from a mere exercise of the will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">\u201cSo far as it relates to a vested estate in real property an abandonment is ineffectual to transfer the title: City of Philadelphia v. Riddle, 25 Pa. 259.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Also see <em>East Tennessee Iron &amp; Coal Co. v. Wiggin, </em>68 Fed 446, 449, an opinion by Mr. Justice Lurton while on the circuit court of appeals, sixth circuit, concurred in by Mr. Justice Taft, also a member of that court at that time, wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">\u201cPrecisely what is meant by \u2018an abandoned\u2019 legal title is hard to define. If it is the valid legal title, it is inconceivable how it can be abandoned. McCoy\u2019s [the grantee\u2019s] disappearance and long neglect to assert the title which appellants claimed he acquired by his adverse possession did not operate to extinguish or toll it; nothing but a possession adverse to him for the statutory period would have such a consequence. Plaintiffs did not abandon their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>title by neglecting for 40 years to take possession or bring action. If there has not been a devolution of title by operation of an adverse possession, their title is perfect, and their right of recovery would not be affected by a theoretical abandonment predicated alone upon a neglect of their estate. Upon the same ground, it is hard to perceive how McCoy\u2019s title has been lost by mere neglect for a shorter period. Nothing but a subsequent possession adverse to McCoy for the statutory period will affect the title acquired by his own earlier possession adverse to the Wiggin title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is interesting to note that in appellants\u2019 briefs little attention is given to this phase of the case, nor are we cited to one authority in support of their third proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The majority opinion quotes from a finding of the lower court to the effect that \u201cSometime prior to 1949, representatives of the defendant examined the property and discovered that, in addition to those areas not logged at all, a large amount of merchantable timber remained upon the property.\u201d The majority opinion seeks to impeach the correctness of this finding by observing that the last affidavit filed was by one Allen L. Piper, a forester for the lumber company, and stresses the fact that it \u201cwas executed on February 28, 1949, obviously after the time when a representative of the defendant examined the property\u201d, implying it was <em>after </em>and not <em>prior </em>to 1949 as stated in the finding. A reading of the entire affidavit does not justify such a conclusion. The affidavit discloses that in the body of that instrument is a recital to the effect that the timber was removed and logged off the areas described in the printed form of the affidavit \"subsequent to March 1, <em>1949 </em>and between the \u2014 day of-, 19\u2014, and the 31 day of December, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>1948\u201d. (Italics mine.) Only one conclusion can be drawn and that is it refers to timber cut sometime between March 1,1948, the last date of assessment, and December 31,1948, for the reason that it was filed with the clerk on February 28, 1949, subsequent to the 1948 logging and prior to \u201cMarch 1, 1949\u201d. Moreover, although it describes 200 acres, only 160 acres are involved in this controversy. The conclusion attempted to be drawn from the date of its execution, standing alone, is insufficient to east a cloud on the soundness of the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The purpose of the Piper affidavit obviously was to exonerate property described therein from a levy of taxes for the year 1949 as to logs taken from it in 1948. In that respect it follows the overall pattern and purpose of the other five affidavits by indicating the cut made in various areas since the last March 1 assessment date. To give it any other concept would be to render it a futile transaction with no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">It is my opinion that plaintiffs have failed to sustain the burden imposed upon them by the allegations contained in paragraph IY of their complaints, namely, that \u201cDefendant claims some interest or estate in said real property adverse to plaintiffs, but said claim is false and without any right.\u201d That alone justifies the result I feel appropriate in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">To have successfully met the issue raised by defendant\u2019s denial of this allegation and to have overcome the lumber company\u2019s prima facie showing of title in the timber, plaintiffs were bound to prove that a reasonable time for a removal of the timber had long since expired and, as a result, the defendant\u2019s claim of title in any remaining timber was forfeited. For this reason plaintiffs\u2019 complaints should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Defendant, on the other hand, failed to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>that a reasonable time for removal had not elapsed or what was a reasonable time after February 1939 in which to remove the timber. In the absence of such proof, there is no foundation for those portions of paragraphs 3, 4 and 7 of the decree which refer to or depend upon \u201cDecember 31,1955\u201d as the terminal date of defendant\u2019s right of removal; and the decree should he so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">I cling to the opinion that the decree of the lower court should he affirmed as modified in accordance with the suggestions above made.</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-7\">Mr. Justice Tooze joins in this dissent.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AV2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Mahoney &amp; Fanchor, </em>Heppner, and Krause, Evans &amp; Lindsay, Portland, for the petition.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b68-18\"><em>Koerner, Young, McColloch &amp; Desendorf </em>and <em>William J.

Our attention is called to the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>we erred in concluding that the pine reserved in the conveyance was limited to merchantable pine instead of \u201call\u201d pine as unequivocably stated in the deeds. This is true. However, this does not make any difference in the result reached as we are still firmly of the conviction that a reasonable time had elapsed for the removal of both pine and fir timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We are charged with error in \u201cholding that the words \u2018all pine and merchantable fir\u2019 in 1939 meant only that pine and fir which could be logged on a profitable basis.\u201d We did not so hold. Because we relied somewhat on the testimony of witness Hoffman who testified on cross-examination that the timber not removed was not merchantable for the reason that it was unprofitable for defendant to remove it, defendant asserts that we adopted his definition of merchantable timber. He did testify however, as pointed out in our opinion, that all timber that had a commercial value in 1939 had been removed. In <em>Monger v. Dimmick, </em>187 Or 253, 210 P2d 929, cited by defendant in his brief on petition for rehearing, we said that merchantable timber is \u201call timber * * * that had * <em>* * </em>a commercial value in that locality * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">As pointed out in <em>Dahl v. Crain, </em>193 Or 207, 237 P2d 939, it is difficult to define merchantable timber which will fit all occasions in all localities. It has no definite fixed meaning and many factors must be considered in a given case in determining what is or is not merchantable.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">It is next asserted that the \u2018 \u2018 court erred in abandoning its long established equity rule that findings of the trial judge upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed.\u201d We know of no such rule. However, we have often said that where there is a conflict in testimony we should give great weight to the findings of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>judge since he saw and heard the witnesses. We have a duty to perform by trying an equity case de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">It will be remembered that defendant was paying taxes on the timber and in order to remove its obligation the affidavits were executed. Because the officers and directors of the defendant company testified that they were misled when they signed the affidavits does not necessarily establish that fact. The record itself, in our opinion, belies their testimony. Four affidavits were filed with the assessor by P. W. Ma-honey, attorney for and an original incorporator of the defendant company. He was its director and became its secretary in 1942. As to the foundation for his affidavits, we have his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cQ What you know about whether the timber came off or not is from reports to you by employees, is that right? A By employees and independent gypo contractors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Orville Smith, vice-president and general manager of the company, executed one affidavit. He testified that he had done logging himself and that he was through this property any number of times between 1939 and 1951. The other affidavit was made by Allen L. Piper, forester of the company, who executed his affidavit after the defendant admittedly had examined the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">To give credence to their testimony we would have to find defendant\u2019s employees and contractors guilty of fraud and deceit. In addition there would have been another fraud perpetrated on the county in depriving it of its taxes. We are inclined to believe that the testimony of these officers was prompted by a desire to profit because of the skyrocketing of timber prices some four years after it ceased operations. Their memories were obviously faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>It is next argued that on the authority of <em>Monger v. Dimmick, </em>supra, defendant was not limited to the timber that was merchantable in 1939. In that case we quoted from <em>Adams v. Hazen, </em>123 Va 304, 96 SE 741. It has never been the law in Oregon that merchantable timber is that timber which has commercial value \u201cduring the life of the contract.\u201d This clause was inadvertently included in the Monger quotation. <em>Tenny v. Mulvaney, </em>9 Or 405; <em>Parsons v. Boggie, </em>139 Or 469, 11 P2d 280; <em>Rayburn et ux. v. Crawford et ux., </em>187 Or 386, 211 P2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">It is lastly urged that two forty-acre tracts were not logged during the eight years of operations. The testimony discloses that some of the timber which was unremoved was inaccessible on account of being in deep ravines or on high peaks. Whether or not the timber on the two tracts in question was included in the inaccessible timber is not disclosed by the evidence so, considering the evidence in its entirety, it must be assumed that that timber was likewise inaccessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Petition denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-8\">Warner, C.J., and Tooze, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
