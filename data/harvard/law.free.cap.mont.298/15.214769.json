We reverse. \u00b62 Did the District Court err in denying Travis\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained when his grandfather consented to the warrantless search of Travis\u2019s apartment?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b63 On November 25, 1995, the Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Department received reports of two burglaries and thefts. Chief Deputy Sheriff, Merlin Ehlers (Deputy Ehlers) investigated the break-ins, one at the Harrison school, the other at the studio of Michelle Walker in Harrison, Montana. Travis had been at Walker\u2019s studio the day before to deliver wooden doll bases his father had made for her. Walker indicated that while in her studio, Travis had paid an unusual amount of attention to a stereo which was now missing. At the time, Travis also had a pending charge in Gallatin County for the burglary of a Three Forks school and was known to have broken into the Harrison school when he was a student there.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b64 Deputy Ehlers went to the home of Travis\u2019s mother, Jennifer Flesch (Flesch), in Pony, Montana. Flesch told Deputy Ehlers that Travis was living with his grandfather Earl McLees (Earl) in Three Forks, Montana. Deputy Ehlers had known Earl for years and had been to Earl\u2019s home before on personal business. On November 26, 1995, Deputy Ehlers went to Earl\u2019s residence at 55 Frontage Road, in Three Forks, to look for Travis.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b65 Upon arriving at Earl\u2019s residence, Deputy Ehlers asked whether Travis was staying there. Earl informed Deputy Ehlers that Travis was living in the apartment which Earl owned next door at 59 Frontage Road. Earl told Deputy Ehlers that Travis had slept in the apartment the night before but had left that morning. Deputy Ehlers did not have a search warrant but asked Earl if he could look in the apartment for possible evidence of the Harrison school burglary. Earl and Deputy Ehlers went to the front door of the apartment, but found it locked. Because Earl did not have a key to the front door, he and Deputy Ehlers went around to the shop which adjoined the apartment from the rear. The two then entered the apartment through an unlocked door leading from the shop to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b66 Upon entering the apartment, Deputy Ehlers noticed some drug paraphernalia and what he believed to be items taken from the Harrison school. Ehlers then telephoned the Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Office to have them send out an officer from that jurisdiction. Three Forks Marshall, Keith King (Officer King) responded to the scene and entered the apartment. At that time, Officer King and Deputy Ehlers discussed whether they should have a search warrant. Officer King returned to his office in Three Forks where he called the Gallatin County Attorney\u2019s office and received the opinion that based on Offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>cer Ring\u2019s description of the situation, a consent search would be sufficient. During Officer Ring\u2019s absence, Deputy Ehlers stayed at the apartment to secure the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b67 Officer Ring returned to the apartment with a consent-to-search form, which Earl signed. Deputy Ehlers and Officer Ring then searched and photographed the apartment, and seized several items of evidence. A few days later, Deputy Ehlers returned without a warrant, and Earl again allowed him to enter the apartment. A warrant for Travis\u2019s arrest was issued on November 30,1995, and Travis was arrested several months later. Reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress, Travis pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, two counts of theft, and one count of criminal mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in denying Travis\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained when his grandfather consented to the warrantless search of Travis\u2019s apartment?</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b69 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 250, 257, 934 P.2d 176, 180 <em>(overruled in part by State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, 291 Mont. 474, 970 P.2d 556).</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">\u00b610  \u201c[WJarrantless searches conducted inside a home are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, \u2018subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hubbel </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 200, 212, 951 P.2d 971, 978 (citing Katz <em>v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585). \u201cOne such exception is when the search is conducted pursuant to a consent that is freely and voluntarily <em>given.\u201dHubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 212, 951 P.2d at 978 (citing <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2045, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, 860). \u201c[WJhen the prosecution seeks to jus tify a warrantless search by proof of a voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d <em>State v. Sorenson </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 269, 275, 590 P.2d 136, 140 (citing <em>United States v. Matlock </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993, 39 L.Ed.2d. 249-50). The State has the burden of showing that the consent was voluntary. <em>State v. Kim </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 189, 196, 779 P2d 512, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b611 The District Court found that Earl had \u201ccommon authority to consent to a search of the premises ... [and] gave that consent volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>tarily....\u201d Travis argues that Earl did not have sufficient joint control over the apartment at 59 Frontage Road to consent to the search. We agree. As Travis points out, Earl\u2019s residence at 55 Frontage Road and the apartment at 59 Frontage Road are physically separate buildings. Earl lived in his home but did not reside in, and did not have a key to, Travis\u2019s apartment. The record reflects that Earl would sometimes enter the apartment to watch television with his son, Scott McLees (Scott), or perhaps to wake Travis for work. Earl testified that he would knock and announce himself before entering the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b612 In order to let Deputy Ehlers into the apartment, Earl had to take him around to the back of the building, into the attached workshop and through an unlocked back door to the apartment. Travis had been living in the apartment with Scott, his father, for approximately six months and Scott had given him permission to stay there while he was gone; this was an agreement Earl was not involved in. Scott paid no rent to Earl and there was no rental agreement. Scott usually resided in the apartment but was out of the state at the time and had left the back door to the workshop unlocked because no one could find a key to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b613 The State argues that Earl\u2019s consent was valid because no landlord-tenant relationship existed between Earl and Travis; Travis\u2019s living arrangement was with Scott, not Earl, and therefore Earl never relinquished authority or control of the apartment to him. It claims that Travis was a temporary guest in Earl\u2019s apartment, that he paid no rent or utilities, and that he lived out of a duffel bag. The State also maintains that a special relationship between a defendant and the owner of an apartment together with no formal landlord-tenant agreement are \u201cimportant benchmarks\u201d under these circumstances. We note that the cases cited by the State for this proposition are not controlling, and they are distinguishable from the case at bar. None of the cited cases concern one family member renting a separate residence to another, but rather reflect instances where one family member has permitted another to stay in their home as a guest. In all but one case cited by the State, <em>(Adams v. State </em>(Okla. Crim. Ct. App. 1982), 645 P.2d 1028)(defendant staying in sister\u2019s garage apartment), the owner of the home and the defendant lived together in the same residence. In People <em>v. Lucero </em>(Colo. Ct. App. 1985), 720 P.2d 604, also cited by the State, the court relied on the fact that there was no landlord-tenant relationship and no rent paid, referring to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>dant as a \u201ctenant at sufferance.\u201d <em>Lucero </em>at 606. However, as the United States Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Matlock,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">[c]ommon authority is, of course, not to be implied from the mere property interest a third party has in the property. The authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements,... but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171, 94 S.Ct. at 993, 39 L.Ed.2d at 250 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b6 14 In <em>Matlock, </em>the issue before the Supreme Court was whether the third party who had consented to the search of the bedroom where Mat-lock was staying had a relationship to the room sufficient to make her consent valid against Matlock. The Court found that the third party\u2019s consent to search the bedroom was sufficient where; 1) the room bore every evidence that it was also occupied by a woman; 2) she indicated that she and Matlock slept in the bedroom regularly, including that morning; 3) she told police that she and Matlock shared a dresser in the room; and 4) she told police that the women\u2019s clothing in the room was hers. See <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 161-172, 94 S.Ct. at 990-93, 39 L.Ed.2d at 247-50. \u00b6 15 We begin our analysis of whether Earl had authority to consent to the search of the apartment, by noting that Travis claims Earl was coerced into giving his consent. After a review of the record, however, we agree with the District Court that although Earl was possibly intimidated and let Deputy Ehlers into the apartment \u201con a friendly basis,\u201d there is no evidence to suggest his consent was coerced. As a result, we must analyze only whether Earl\u2019s consent to the search was valid at the time he permitted Deputy Ehlers to enter the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b6 16 In determining that Earl had \u201ccommon authority to consent to a search of the premises,\u201d the District Court relied on the fact that Travis did not pay rent or utilities, did not have a rental agreement with Earl, did not furnish the apartment with his own property, and kept his belongings in duffel bags while his father\u2019s personal belongings were in the dresser drawers. Based on these facts, the District Court found that \u201cit is reasonable to conclude that Travis assumed the risk that his grandfather could and would assert his own control over the premises at any time ... Earl ... exercised his authority as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>owner, grandfather, and host to enter the apartment at will regularly for a number of reasons-all known to Travis ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b617  We conclude that the evidence in the record is insufficient to show that Earl had common authority over the apartment. Although Earl was the owner of the apartment, and no rental agreement existed between Travis and Earl, these factors do not create \u201cmutual use of the property,\u201d or \u201cjoint access and control for most purposes,\u201d which would create common authority. Earl testified that he never went to the apartment if Scott was not around. He said he did not have free access and would knock before he went in. Earl was obviously not a cohabitant of the apartment, did not share in its use, and could not consent to a search on that basis. Scott was the regular inhabitant of the apartment, and while he may have had joint authority and control to consent to the search, Earl did not. We conclude that it was not reasonable for the District Court to find that Travis \u201cassumed the risk that Earl could and would assert control over the premises at any time.\u201d The State failed to meet its burden of establishing that Earl had common authority over Travis\u2019s apartment. Unless Earl had other \u201csufficient relationship\u201d to the apartment, his consent was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b618  Earl testified that he, at times, gained access to the apartment in order to visit with Scott or to watch a ball game. The fact that Earl owned the apartment is not dispositive where Travis, who was living in the apartment, had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Assuming Earl had authority to access the apartment for such purposes, it was limited to those activities. <em>See Sorrenson, </em>180 Mont. at 276,590 P.2d 141 (Authority of neighbor to enter defendant\u2019s home to water plants in defendant\u2019s absence was not authority to consent to a search of the home). Earl, therefore, did not possess a \u201csufficient relationship\u201d with the apartment which would give him authority to consent to a search. Therefore, the District Court erroneously concluded that based on these facts, Earl had common authority over the apartment sufficient to consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b619 The State contends that even if Earl did not have authority to give consent, representations made by Earl to the officers at the time of the search support a finding that the officers believed Earl had authority to consent, even if he did not. They maintain that under the doctrine of \u201capparent authority,\u201d a search is valid if consent is given by a person who police reasonably, but mistakenly, believe has joint authority over the premises. This issue was first addressed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>United States Supreme Court in <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 177, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b620 In <em>Rodriguez, </em>Gail Fischer told police that Rodriguez had assaulted her in a certain apartment in Chicago, Illinois. She referred to this apartment as \u201cour apartment\u201d and said that she had clothes and furniture there. She then traveled to the apartment with police, unlocked the door with her key, and gave the officers permission to enter. The police didn\u2019t have an arrest warrant for Rodriguez, or a search warrant for the apartment. Upon entering the apartment, the officers observed drugs and drug paraphernalia and found Rodriguez asleep in the bedroom. There, they discovered more drugs, arrested Rodriguez, and seized the drugs and paraphernalia. After being charged with possession of a controlled substance Rodriguez moved to suppress all evidence seized at the time of his arrest, claiming that Fischer had vacated the apartment several weeks earlier and therefore had no authority to consent to the entry. <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 180, 110 S.Ct. at 2796-97, 111 L.Ed.2d at 155-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b621 Finding that Fischer had no \u201cjoint access or control for most purposes,\u201d the Supreme Court explained what it called the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with respect to what is necessary to satisfy the \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement of the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">[i]t is apparent that in order to satisfy the \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement of the Fourth Amendment, what is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government\u2014 whether the magistrate issuing a warrant, th\u00e9 police officer executing a warrant, or the police officer conducting a search and seizure under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement \u2014 is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.... [Bjecause many situations which confront officers in the course of executing their duties are more or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on their part. But the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK\"><em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 185-86, 110 S.Ct. at 2800, 111 L.Ed.2d at 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b622 The majority then stated that it saw \u201cno reason to depart from this general rule with respect to facts bearing upon the authority to consent to a search,\u201d and set forth a test for determining the constitutional validity of a warrantless search pursuant to the consent exception to the warrant requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>determination of consent to enter must \u201cbe judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment ... \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 \u201d that the consenting party had authority over the premises? ... If not, then the warrantless entry without further inquiry is unlawful unless authority actually exists. But if so, the search is valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq_\"><em>Rodriguez, </em>at 188-89, 110 S.Ct. at 2801, 111 L.Ed.2d at 161 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b623 Although this Court has previously examined the issue of third-party consent, the doctrine of apparent authority as it applies to third-party consent searches has never been substantively addressed in Montana. Travis argues that the warrantless search of the apartment absent Earl\u2019s actual authority to consent violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as well as under Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution. \u201cBecause Montana\u2019s unique constitutional scheme affords citizens broader protection of their right to privacy than does the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, we usually need not consider the Fourth Amendment issue.\u201d <em>Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 211, 951 P.2d at 977. However, because Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution mirrors the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, we analyze most search and seizure questions arising under Article II, Section 11 using traditional Fourth Amendment principles. <em>Siegal, </em>281 Mont. at 264, 934 P.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b624 Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Section 10. Right of privacy. The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Art. II, Sec. 10, Mont. Const.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">Section 11. Searches and seizures. The people shall be secure in their persons, papers, homes and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person to be seized, or without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Art. II, Sec. 11, Mont. Const.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u00b625  To determine whether there has been an unlawful search pursuant to Montana\u2019s Constitution, we look to two factors: (1) whether the person has an actual expectation of privacy that society <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>is willing to recognize as objectively reasonable; and (2) the nature of the state\u2019s intrusion. <em>Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 208, 951 P.2d at 975-76. \u201cAt the risk of belaboring the obvious, private residences are places in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by warrant, and that expectation is plainly one that society is prepared to recognize as justifiable.\u201d <em>State v. Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. 41, 48-49, 950 P.2d 722, 726. \u201cThe fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is to protect the privacy and security of individuals and safeguard the sanctity of the home against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d <em>Dorwart v. Caraway, </em>1998 MT 191, \u00b6 21, 290 Mont. 196, \u00b6 21, 966 P.2d 1121, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b626 The State does not claim that exigent circumstances existed which would have prevented Ehlers from obtaining a search warrant prior to the entry and search of Travis\u2019s apartment. Courts have indicated the rationale behind the warrant requirement;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">[t]he presence of a search warrant serves a high function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police. This was done not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law. The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqF\"><em>Sorenson, </em>180 Mont at 274, 590 P.2d at 140. The primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to \u201cdeter future unlawful police conduct\u201d by making evidence which the State obtains through a search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, inadmissable in criminal proceedings. <em>State v. Pipkin, </em>1998 MT 143, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 240, \u00b6 12, 961 P.2d 733, \u00b6 12. The result is that in the absence of one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement, a search made without a warrant is unlawful and any evidence which results from the search should be suppressed. <em>Pipkin, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b627 In adopting the apparent authority rule in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the Supreme Court explained what the exclusionary rule provides under the Fourth Amendment;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">[w]hat Rodriguez is assured by the trial right of the exclusionary rule, where it applies, is that no evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment will be introduced at his trial unless he consents. What he is assured by the Fourth Amendment itself, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ever, is not that no government search of his house will occur unless he consents; but that no such search will occur that is \u201cunreasonable. ...\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 183-84, 110 S.Ct. at 2799, 111 L.Ed. 2d at 158.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEA\">There are various elements, of course, that can make a search of a person\u2019s house \u201creasonable\u201d - one of which is the consent of the person or his cotenant....

Unlike its federal counterpart, Article II, Section 10 protects against invasions of privacy. Hawai\u2019i, whose constitution also specifically grants the right of privacy to its citizens has declined to follow <em>Rodriguez, </em>based on that constitutional provision. In declining to adopt the doctrine of apparent authority, the Hawai\u2019i Supreme Court stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">[a]llowing warrantless searches of an individual\u2019s home without the consent of someone authorized to give it, absent any exigent circumstances, would fly in the face of this protection. Indeed, an invasion of privacy is no less of an \u201cinvasion\u201d if the governmental officials are \u201creasonable\u201d in their mistaken belief that the third party possesses the authority to consent. This is because, regardless of whether the police acted in good faith, the individual\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d is still invaded when the police search his or her personal belongings without permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\"><em>State v.

Detective Guillermo, who was assigned to continue the investigation, later telephoned Kelly\u2019s mother and told her he wanted to interview Kelly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Daniel and go into the Hauanios\u2019 house to continue the investigation. Kell's mother told Detective Guillermo that the Hauanios were staying at a hotel in Hilo, Hawai\u2019i.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b630 Without the Hauanios\u2019 permission, Kelly\u2019s mother volunteered to take Guillermo to the house herself. She met him there and they entered through a closed door which was not able to be locked. While there Guillermo confiscated a cellophane container filled with cocaine which he found on the floor of the master bedroom. Based on this information alone, the police obtained a warrant to search the Hauanios\u2019 home. While executing the warrant, police found evidence linking the Hauanios to a large cocaine delivery already under investigation. The circuit court granted the Hauanios\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence seized by the police, concluding that the state had not established that Kelly granted her mother the authority to consent to Guillermo\u2019s entry. Because the entry was without consent, the evidence he recovered from the Hauanio house was suppressed. <em>Lopez, </em>896 P.2d at 896. On appeal, the prosecution conceded that Kelly\u2019s mother did not have \u201cactual authority\u201d to consent to Detective Guillermo\u2019s entrance into the house, but argued that she had \u201capparent authority.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>896 P.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b631 The Supreme Comb of Hawai\u2019i declined to adopt the federal concept of apparent authority from <em>Rodriguez </em>stating;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">[o]ur willingness to afford greater protection of individual privacy rights than is provided on the federal level arises from \u201cour view [that] the right to be free of \u2018unreasonable\u2019 searches and seizures under article I, section 5 [which later became article I, section 7] of the Hawai\u2019i Constitution is enforceable by a rule of reason which <em>requires that governmental intrusions into the personal privacy of citizens of this State be no greater in intensity than absolutely necessary. </em>...\" At this point, we simply cannot say that it is \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow third parties to consent to searches of an individual\u2019s personal and private belongings when they are devoid of any authority to do so. Our constitution guarantees more to the citizens of the State of Hawai\u2019i.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\"><em>Lopez, </em>896 P.2d at 901-902 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b632  Article I, section 7 of Hawaii\u2019s Constitution specifically protects against \u201cinvasions of privacy.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>896 P.2d at 897. We agree with the Hawai\u2019i court\u2019s refusal to extend the doctrine of apparent authority based on this right to privacy. In fight of Montana citizens\u2019 similar increased right to privacy under Article II, Sections 10 and 11, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>now hold that for third-party consent to be valid as against the defendant, the consenting party must have actual authority to do so. Because Deputy Ehlers\u2019 search of Travis\u2019s apartment was not consented to by an individual possessing actual authority, the search violated Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution. The evidence seized in that search should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b633 The State argued in the District Court that if Earl\u2019s consent was invalid then the evidence should be admitted under the \u201cindependent source\u201d and \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d rules. The District Court did not rule on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b634 We reverse the judgment of the District Court as to the evidence obtained in the warrantless search of Travis\u2019s apartment and remand to the District Court for a determination of whether the evidence is admissible under the independent source or inevitable discovery rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b635 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, NELSON, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
