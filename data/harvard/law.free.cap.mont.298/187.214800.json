Hall moved for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. Wheelsmith appeals from the District Court\u2019s summary judgment. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b62 The issues presented for review are:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">1. Did the District Court err when it concluded that Wheelsmith\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the hearing referee allowed Hall to testify in person?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">2. Did the doctrine of judicial estoppel preclude Hall from testifying at the hearing that Wheelsmith did not give her a reason for her discharge?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">3. Did the District Court err when it concluded that Wheelsmith\u2019s due process rights were not violated by Hall\u2019s notice of hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\u00b63 Judy Hall was the chief financial officer at Wheelsmith Fabrication, Inc. On April 3, 1997, Wheelsmith\u2019s chief executive officer Ron McAdams discharged Hall. The following day, Hall submitted a claim for benefits to the Department of Labor and Industry, Unemployment Insurance Division (UID).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">\u00b64 On May 30, 1997, the UID denied Hall\u2019s claim. Hall then requested a redetermination, following which, benefits were awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"AHh\">\u00b65 On October 6,1997, after an appeal by Wheelsmith, an appeals referee held an extensive hearing, which produced a 278-page transcript. Hall, who was represented by counsel, testified at the hearing in person and presented one five witness. Wheelsmith was represented by its lawyer and participated in the hearing by telephone. On November 26,1997, the appeals referee issued his decision in favor of Hall. The referee stated the following reasons for his decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The record shows that the employer discharged the claimant without explanation. The employer now contends that claimant was insubordinate and unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-3\">The claimant\u2019s version of the events leading to her discharge are more credible than those of the employer. The facts reveal that the employer decided to discharge the claimant during a discussion two weeks earlier, when the claimant told him she was offended by certain comments and behavior which she believed he had witnessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">On the day he discharged the claimant, the company president was angry and did not directly explain why. By itself, the fact that the employer was angry does not show that the claimant engaged in misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">The employer has not shown that the claimant was discharged for a willful or wanton disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. Therefore, the claimant was discharged for reasons other than misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b66 Wheelsmith appealed to the Board of Labor Appeals based on its contentions that the hearing referee failed to assure fundamental fairness to Wheelsmith, ignored substantial credible evidence in adopting the claimant\u2019s story verbatim, and exceeded the factual issue before him. The Board held a telephonic hearing at which both Wheelsmith and Hall were represented by counsel. The Board affirmed the decision of the appeals referee. The Board stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">All three members of the Board reviewed the entire record including the nine hours of audio tapes of the Referee Hearing held on October 6,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">[A]fter careful and due consideration and finding no error in procedure, fact or law at the previous hearing, the Board does hereby adopt as its own, the Findings of Fact and Decision made by the Appeals Referee....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b67 Wheelsmith appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the District Court where Hall moved for summary judgment. In its order granting summary judgment the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">This Court has carefully reviewed the entire record of the Unemployment Insurance Division and the Board of Labor Appeals and finds that substantial evidence exists to support the Board\u2019s findings and conclusion, that there was no fraud perpetrated upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Board or the plaintiff and the board\u2019s findings are deemed conclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">[A]ll parties were granted an opportunity to be heard, to get their testimony before the board and its relevancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Wheelsmith then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b68 A district court\u2019s review of a decision by the Board of Labor Appeals is not governed by the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Schneeman v. Department of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 254, 257, 848 P.2d 504, 506 <em>(citing City of Billings v. Board of Labor Appeals </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 38, 663 P.2d 1167). The correct standard of review in the instant case is set forth at \u00a7 39-51-2410(5) and (6), MCA, which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">(5) In any judicial proceeding under 39-51-2406 through 39-51-2410, the findings of the board as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive and the jurisdiction of said court shall be confined to questions of law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">(6) An appeal may be taken from the decision of the district court to the supreme court of Montana in the same manner, but not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, as is provided in civil cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Moreover, in <em>Potter v. Montana Department of Labor and Industry </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 476, 853 P.2d 1207, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">[T]he District Court must limit its review of the Board\u2019s findings to a consideration of whether they are supported by substantial evidence, and the same standard applies to this Court. With regard to questions of law, however, our task is to determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-12\"><em>Potter, </em>258 Mont. at 479, 853 P.2d at 1209 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it concluded that Wheelsmith\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the hearing referee allowed Hall to testify in person?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">\u00b610 Wheelsmith contends that its right to due process was violated when the hearing referee permitted Judy Hall to testify in person and present a five witness. Wheelsmith, however, failed to raise this issue at the unemployment insurance hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u00b611 \u201cIt is axiomatic that an appellate court will generally not review any issue not raised in the court below.\u201d 5 Am. Jim. 2d <em>Appellate Review </em>\u00a7 690, at 360 (1995); see <em>also Akhtar v. Van de Wetering </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 205, 209, 642 P.2d 149, 152. The rule applies to both substantive and procedural matters. <em>Day v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276-77, 929 P.2d 864, 866. It is based on the principle that it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for fading to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider. <em>Day, </em>280 Mont. at 277-78, 929 P.2d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">\u00b612 The principle that we will not consider issues which were not raised in the forum which is alleged to have erred applies in the context of unemployment insurance hearings as well. <em>See Schneeman, </em>257 Mont. at 259, 848 P.2d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b613 In this case, Wheelsmith did not raise the issue at the hearing when Hall appeared in person. The hearing referee stated: \u201cMs. Hall is present with me along with her counselor .... They\u2019ve traveled to Helena today to participate at the hearing in person. Mr. Jim Hall is also present. Okay.\u201d Wheelsmith\u2019s attorney did not object; rather, he responded: \u201c[v]ery good.\u201d The hearing referee had no opportunity to rule on the issue because Wheelsmith did not raise it. Because Wheelsmith failed to make a timely objection, we decline to consider whether Wheelsmith\u2019s due process rights were violated when the hearing referee allowed Hall to testify in person and present a live witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b6 14 Did the doctrine of judicial estoppel preclude Hall from testifying at the hearing that Wheelsmith did not give her a reason for her discharge?</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b6 15 Wheelsmith contends that the doctrine of judicial estoppel precluded Hall from testifying that she was not given a reason when Wheelsmith discharged her because she stated in her discharge statement that she was discharged for illness. However, Wheelsmith also failed to raise this issue at the unemployment insurance hearing; and, as with the previous issue, we decline to consider arguments based on the doctrine of judicial estoppel that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>In re Estate of Hill </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 142, 151, 931 P.2d 1320, 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b6 16 Did the District Court err when it concluded that Wheelsmith\u2019s due process rights were not violated by Hall\u2019s notice of hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b617 In the context of unemployment insurance, we employ the traditional due process balancing test set forth in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18. <em>See Bean v. Montana Bd. of Labor Appeals, </em>1998 MT 222, \u00b6 36, 290 Mont. 496, \u00b6 36, 965 P.2d 256, \u00b6 36. In <em>Bean </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">The United States Supreme Court explained in Mathews that \u201c[d]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation <em>demands.\u201dMathews, </em>424 U.S. at 334, 96 S.Ct. at 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18. Therefore, to determine what specific procedures are required to satisfy due process, three factors must be considered: 1) the individual\u2019s private interest affected by official government action; 2) the risk of erroneous deprivation of the interest; and 3) the government\u2019s interest in maintaining fiscal and administrative objectives. <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. at 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\"><em>Bean, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b6 18 Assuming for the purpose of argument that Wheelsmith had an interest pursuant to the first factor, Wheelsmith has failed to show the second factor of the <em>Mathews </em>test. Wheelsmith contends that because Hall failed to provided adequate notice of her factual claims, it was denied due process of law. Wheelsmith argues that it was not notified that Hall would allege at the hearing that she had been notified two weeks prior to April 3,1997, that the company had made the decision to terminate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u00b619  The rules of civil procedure do not apply to unemployment insurance hearings. Rule 24.11.201(3), A.R.M. Unemployment insurance proceedings are governed by administrative rule. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-51-302, MCA. A notice of hearing must contain a \u201ca short and plain statement of the matters asserted.\u201d Section 2-4-601, MCA; Rule 24.11.317(4), A.R.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">\u00b620  In this case, notice of appeal was sent to Wheelsmith\u2019s attorney on September 19,1997. The notice stated that the purpose of the hearing was \u201c[t]o determine if the claimant [Hall] was discharged for misconduct connected with [her] work or directly affecting [her] employment.\u201d This is a short and plain statement, and it clearly gave Wheelsmith notice of the contested issue. Furthermore, Wheelsmith cross-examined Hall at the hearing. Wheelsmith was at no risk of be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ing erroneously deprived of its interest. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err when it concluded that Wheelsmith\u2019s due process rights were not violated by Hall\u2019s notice of hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">\u00b621 We affirm the judgement of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
