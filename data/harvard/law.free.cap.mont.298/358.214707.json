The State of Montana (the State) charged LaMere with deliberate homicide. In response, LaMere argued that he had killed the victim in self-defense. On August 15,1997, LaMere filed a pre-trial Motion to Strike the Jury. LaMere\u2019s motion was subsequently denied by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. On August 22, 1997, the jury found LaMere guilty of mitigated deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u00b62 LaMere appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike the jury panel. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">\u00b63 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that LaMere failed to show that the telephone-dependent summoning procedure utilized in Cascade County prejudiced his substantial rights to a jury drawn and summoned according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">\u00b64 In a pre-trial conference held on August 7, 1997, the District Court directed that the jury for LaMere\u2019s trial be \u201cpulled\u201d by the following day, and that 100 jurors be summoned to appear in court. However, the jury clerk of court never received a written order from the District Court as to the number of jurors to draw for LaMere\u2019s trial. Thus, the clerk utilized computerized random selection to draw 200 names from the list of eligible jurors in Cascade County. Of those possible jurors, 101 were summoned to court by telephone for LaMere\u2019s trial. LaMere objected to the sole use of the telephone by the clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>court to summon prospective jurors and requested a hearing on the matter. A hearing was set for August 18, 1997, the day before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Av8k\">\u00b65 On August 15, 1997, LaMere filed a motion to strike the jury panel and a supporting brief. In this motion, LaMere did not object to the computerized method utilized to randomly draw the names of prospective jurors for his trial, but to the jury clerk\u2019s use of the telephone to summon those prospective jurors into court. LaMere argued that the clerk\u2019s telephone-dependent method of summoning prospective jurors failed to substantially comply with Montana statutes governing the impaneling of a trial jury because the clerk failed to either serve by mail or have the sheriff personally serve those persons drawn for possible jury duty in his trial. LaMere also alleged that his constitutional right to trial by a fair and impartial jury had been violated in that the telephone-dependent method of summoning prospective jurors resulted in an \u201c[arbitrary removal and de facto screening\u201d of the venire when a prospective juror did not receive, answer, or return the clerk\u2019s call.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b66 On the morning of the scheduled hearing, LaMere filed a motion to supplement the record and accompanying brief. LaMere supplemented the record on his motion to strike the jury panel with statistics from the United States Census Bureau showing percentages of persons living below the poverty line in Cascade County, including Native Americans, who are without telephone service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These statistics revealed a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>tial discrepancy regarding the availability of phone service between those persons living above and below the poverty line in Cascade County. LaMere\u2019s statistics showed that, of the 25,731 households in Cascade Comity living above the poverty line, only 3% (741 households) have no phone service. In contrast, of the 4,402 households in Cascade County living below the poverty line, 21% (935 households) have no phone service.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b67 In Cascade County, Native Americans constitute the single largest minority group, outnumbering African Americans, Asian Americans, and other racial or ethnic groups. LaMere\u2019s statistics showed an even more significant statistical disparity in access to telephone service between Anglo American and Native American races living in Cascade County, particularly when factoring in poverty. Of the 904to-tal Native American households in Cascade County living above or below the poverty line, 29% (262 households) have no phone service. Even more dramatically, 51% of Native American households in Cascade County live below the poverty line and, of those 458 households, 44% (203 households) have no phone service. In stark contrast, of the 28,577 total Anglo American households living above or below the poverty line in Cascade County, only 5% (1,379 households) are without phone service. Moreover, 13% of Anglo American households in Cascade County live below the poverty fine and, of those 3,827 households, 19% (719 households) have no phone service.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b68 In his motion to supplement the record, LaMere also introduced the affidavit of Joe Seipel (Seipel), statistician, as an exhibit. After reviewing the telephone-dependent technique used to summon jurors in Cascade County, Seipel opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">The sampling procedures used to [summon] jurors are biased because the methods used exclude people from households that do not have a telephone. Those most likely to be excluded because they have no telephone are below poverty persons (21% below poverty versus 3% above poverty...). This has two ramifications. First, by eliminating from the jury pool households without phones, below poverty households are seven times more likely to be excluded from jury participation (3% above poverty vs. 21% below poverty level without phones). Second, by eliminating from the jury pool households without phones, the ratio of households above or below the poverty [sic] shifts. That is to say, by using some jury notification procedure which intentionally excludes households without phones the percentage possibility of a person from a below poverty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>household being chosen for juiy duty is 4,402/30,133, or 15%. By eliminating those households without phones, the sample shifts in favor of persons from above poverty households to a chance of 3,467/28,457, or 12%. In the converse, persons in above poverty households obtain a corresponding advantage in being selected for jury duty from 85% to 88%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">This bias violates basic sampling theory because it permits a 6% shift from the population sampled. In my opinion, the 6% shift renders invalid the sampling procedure used for jury notification because it is not representative nor is it random....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b69 At the hearing on his motion to strike the jury panel, LaMere examined Lisa Gomez (Gomez), the jury clerk for the District Court. Gomez testified that she is employed by the District Court between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and that the jurors for LaMere\u2019s trial were summoned exclusively by phone calls she made between those working hours. Gomez further testified that she had not mailed a written jury summons to any of the prospective jurors in this case, and that she had not requested that the sheriff personally serve notice of LaMere\u2019s trial on those persons whom she was unable to contact by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b6 10 Utilizing the clerk\u2019s personal notes regarding the 200-person panel drawn for trial, LaMere examined Gomez about those jurors whom she was unable to summon by telephone. This examination showed that seventy eliminations from possible jury service in LaMere\u2019s trial occurred through the use of the \u201c \u2018phone-only\u2019 system\u201d for notifying prospective jurors: (1) twenty-three prospective jurors were not summoned because they had no work or home phone number listed on their juror questionnaire; (2) twelve prospective jurors were not summoned because there was no answer to the clerk\u2019s call; (3) twelve prospective jurors were not summoned because a message left by the clerk on an answering machine or voice mail was not returned; (4) eighteen prospective jurors were not summoned because, after the clerk left a message with an unnamed third person at the juror\u2019s residence or workplace, no response was obtained; (5) four prospective jurors were not summoned because, after speaking with an unnamed third person at the juror\u2019s residence or workplace, the clerk was informed that that juror was out of town on business or vacation and would not return in time for trial; and (6) one prospective juror was not summoned because that juror was hearing impaired and the clerk did not utilize a special telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"A_W\">\u00b611 The District Court denied LaMere\u2019s motion to strike the jury panel. The court found that the telephone summoning procedure was \u201creasonable,\u201d and that the statutory term \u201csummon\u201d did not require the mailing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>personal service of a written jury summons. The court reasoned that the absence of any notice to some of the prospective jurors in LaMere\u2019s trial resulting from the telephone summoning procedure had not created \u201cany prejudice\u201d because LaMere had failed to adduce any \u201cevidence of a systematic exclusion of any racial, gender, social, economic or other group\u201d from the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"AHgn\">\u00b6 12 During the initial questioning of prospective jurors, LaMere renewed his motion to strike the jury panel on the ground of gender bias. Since the first group of prospective jurors to be questioned consisted of twenty women and seven men, LaMere asserted that the telephone-dependent procedure for summoning prospective jurors resulted in an arbitrary three-to-one ratio in favor of women. LaMere argued that he was prejudiced by the gender makeup of the venire because women \u2014 especially retired, white women \u2014 were more likely to be home between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., and because those prospective jurors who had been excusing themselves from possible jury service by not returning the clerk\u2019s telephone calls were mostly men. The District Court again denied LaMere\u2019s motion. LaMere appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err in concluding that LaMere failed to show that the exclusive use of the telephone to summon prospective jurors prejudiced his substantial rights to a jury drawn and summoned according to law?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b614 The District Court\u2019s denial of LaMere\u2019s motion to strike the venire involves a conclusion of law. We review a trial court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 41, 43, 934 P.2d 1037, 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b615 The State concedes at the outset that our recent decision in <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, 292 Mont. 23, 971 P.2d 359, \u201cis controlling\u201d with regard to whether the telephone-dependent method of summoning prospective jurors substantially complies with Montana law. Like the defendant in <em>Robbins, </em>LaMere relies principally upon \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 3-15-505, MCA (1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">The clerk shall serve notice by mail on the persons drawn as jurors and require response thereto by mail as to their qualifications to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>serve as trial jurors. He [or she] may attach to the notice a jury questionnaire and a form for an affidavit claiming an excuse as provided for in 3-15-313. If a person fails to respond to the notice, the clerk shall certify the failure to the sheriff, who shall then serve notice personally on such person and require a response to the notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Section 3-15-505, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b6 16 In <em>Robbins, </em>the defendant challenged the telephone-dependent summoning process utilized in Cascade County as failing to substantially comply with \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), in that it failed to serve prospective jurors with a jury summons. We agreed, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APP\">The clerk, in relying solely upon the telephone to summon jurors, failed to either serve by mail or to serve personally those jurors whose names had been drawn for Robbins\u2019 trial, in violation of \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA. We hold that the District Court erred in impliedly finding substantial compliance with the statutory procedure for summoning jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b617  We hold that the telephone summoning of jurors failed, as in <em>Robbins, </em>to substantially comply with \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997). The plain language of \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), does not permit the clerk to utilize the telephone in summoning a <em>new </em>panel or array of trial jurors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court erred in concluding that the statutes on impaneling a trial jury do not require the mailing or personal service of a written jury summons to prospective jurors. They plainly do, and have long imposed such a requirement. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Clark v. District Court </em>(1930), 86 Mont. 509, 512, 284 P. 266, 267 (citing \u00a7 8910, RCM (1921), a predecessor to \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), under which the sheriff was required to summon jurors drawn for trial either by \u201cwritten notice\u201d through the mail or by \u201cpersonal notice\u201d served upon the person) (analyzing how summoning the persons whose names <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>have been drawn is a mandatory \u201cstep\u201d in properly impaneling an array of trial jurors).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b618 However, in <em>Robbins, </em>we ultimately affirmed the trial court. In so doing, we accepted the State\u2019s contention that under Montana\u2019s harmless error statute, \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, the failure to properly summon jurors had not prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">[T]he State correctly asserts that this Court may not reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying Robbins\u2019 motion to discharge the venire \u201cunless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d Section 46-20-701(1), MCA. In response, Robbins argues that the failure to personally serve and require a response from those jurors whose names had been drawn for jury duty resulted in \u201cthe exclusion from the venire of those persons who could not afford a telephone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Robbins provides this Court with no actual evidence that people of \u201clow economic and social status\u201d were necessarily excluded from the venire, resulting in a jury lacking in impartiality in this case. Robbins\u2019 argument is premised upon an assumption that those persons whom the clerk was unable to contact by telephone were too poor to afford a telephone. However, in the absence of any evidence to support this assumption, one can just as easily assume that these individuals possessed telephones but were not at home when the clerk called; or that they had answering machines but did not return the clerk\u2019s call; or that they possessed a telephone but had an unlisted phone number. An error by a trial court that \u201cdoes not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Section 46-20-701(2), MCA. We hold that Robbins has failed to demonstrate that the District Court order denying his motion to strike the jury panel resulted in actual prejudice affecting his substantial rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\"><em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-53 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u00b619 LaMere, like the defendant in <em>Robbins, </em>relies on a long line of Montana cases holding that a failure to substantially comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>statutory procedures governing jury selection amounts to a denial of a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to trial by a fair and impartial jury, and is therefore <em>per se </em>reversible without any proof of individual prejudice. <em>See generally Solberg v. County of Yellowstone </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 79, 659 P.2d 290; <em>Dvorak v. Huntley Project Irrigation Dist. </em>(1981), 196 Mont. 167, 639 P.2d 62; <em>State v. Deeds </em>(1957), 130 Mont. 503, 305 P.2d 321; <em>State v. Porter </em>(1952), 125 Mont. 503, 242 P.2d 984; <em>State v. Hay </em>(1948), 120 Mont. 573, 194 P.2d 232; <em>State v. Diedtman </em>(1920), 58 Mont. 13,190 P. 117; <em>State v. Miller </em>(1914), 49 Mont. 360, 141 P. 860; <em>State v. Groom </em>(1914), 49 Mont. 354, 141 P. 858; <em>State v. Landry </em>(1903), 29 Mont. 218, 74 P. 418; <em>State v. Tighe </em>(1903), 27 Mont. 327, 71 <em>P. 3; Kennon v. Gilmer </em>(1882), 4 Mont. 433, 2 P. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b620 However, none of the aforementioned cases applying the substantial compliance standard of reversal was decided in the context of Montana\u2019s harmless error statute, \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, as was the recent <em>Robbins </em>decision. Nonetheless, LaMere contends that this Court erred in applying the harmless error standard in <em>Robbins </em>and in requiring, in addition to a substantial failure to comply with statutory law, a showing of prejudice by the defendant in order to sustain a challenge to the jury panel. Thus, to the extent that the decision requires a showing of \u201cactual prejudice\u201d by the defendant, LaMere asks this Court to overrule <em>Robbins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b621 Other than contending that this Court ignored established precedent in deciding <em>Robbins, </em>LaMere provides this Court with no convincing rationale as to why a statutory violation in the procurement of a trial jury should not be amenable to harmless error review pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA. From the beginning of the American Republic until well into the Twentieth Century, American courts generally operated under the Exchequer Rule borrowed from English law that any error in the trial court proceedings, regardless of how trivial, mandated appellate reversal. <em>See </em>Roger J. Traynor, <em>The Riddle of Harmless Error </em>6-8 (1970). However, it is no longer presumed that simply because an error is committed it is prejudicial. The United States Supreme Court has had occasion to comment on this jurisprudential evolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">We have... come a long way from the time when all trial error was presumed prejudicial and reviewing courts were considered \u201c \u2018citadels of technicality.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 759[, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1245, 90 L.Ed. 1557, 1563] (1946), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Kavanagh, Improvement of Administration of Criminal Justice by Exercise of Judicial Power, 11 A.B.A. J. 217,222 (1925). The harmless-error rules... embody the principle that courts should exercise judgment in preference to the automatic reversal for \u201cerror\u201d and ignore errors that do not affect the essential fairness of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX6\"><em>McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood </em>(1984), 464 U.S. 548, 553, 104 S.Ct. 845, 848, 78 L.Ed.2d 663, 669-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b622 Particularly since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s seminal ruling in <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, a rule of automatic reversal has applied to an increasingly limited class of constitutional violations, thus becoming the exception and not the rule of appellate review. We note that none of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements since <em>Chapman </em>has expressly held, at least in the absence of intentional discrimination, that a failure to draw and summon a trial jury according to statutory law is not amenable to harmless error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b623 Indeed, the Court has found constitutional errors to be to be \u201cstructural,\u201d and thus subject to automatic reversal, \u201conly in a very limited class of cases.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 461, 468-69, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549-50, 137 L.Ed.2d 718, 728 (citing <em>Gideon v. Wainright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (total deprivation of the right to counsel); <em>Tumey v. Ohio </em>(1927), 273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (lack of an impartial trial judge); <em>Vasquez v. Hillery </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 254, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (discriminatory exclusion of grand jurors of defendant\u2019s race); <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (denial of the right to self-representation at trial); <em>Waller v. Georgia </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (denial of the right to a public trial); <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 275, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction given to jury)). \u00b624 The State urges this Court to retain Robbins\u2019 requirement of actual prejudice, under which the State contends that LaMere has failed to make a sufficient showing that the statutory violations in this case actually affected the composition of the trial jury or otherwise prejudiced his substantial rights. Thus, the State encourages this Court to affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of LaMere\u2019s motion to strike the venire, and hold that LaMere has failed to demonstrate reversible error pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b625 However, after doing extensive research far beyond that submitted by the parties, we choose to overrule <em>Robbins </em>and return to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>per se </em>rule of reversal for a failure to substantially comply with Montana statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury. In overruling <em>Robbins\u2019 </em>requirement of prejudice, we seek to clarify and refine upon the substantial compliance standard. Our decision today turns upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s contemporary distinction between \u201ctrial error,\u201d to which harmless error review applies, and \u201cstructural error,\u201d to which harmless error review is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b626 As discussed hereafter, an automatic rule of reversal should prevail because errors in the jury selection process are \u201cstructural\u201d in nature and, therefore, affect the very framework within which a trial proceeds. That is, they are errors which indelibly affect the essential fairness of the trial itself. Since such errors precede the introduction of any evidence at trial, the very premise of harmless error review \u2014 that a so-called \u201ctrial error\u201d can be assessed by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial \u2014 is absent. Therefore, to engage in harmless error review of a statutory violation in jury selection merely invites abstract and unguided speculation about the possibility of prejudice in an individual case; it is pure conjecture as to whether a properly selected jury would have decided a case differently than an improperly selected jury actually decided the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b627 In addition to recognizing that the subtle, interpersonal dynamics of the jury system are among life\u2019s sweet imponderables, this Court finds a <em>per se </em>rule of reversal appropriate as a matter of public policy. Montana statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury exist to secure rights deemed fundamental to our system of justice by minimizing and, indeed, preempting the violation of such fundamental rights from the outset of a trial. The substantial compliance standard vindicates not only the rights of the individual defendant, but also the rights of the public in ensuring that the jury system remains inviolate.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>I Introduction: Diversity Begets Impartiality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b628 \u201cOur notions of what a proper jury is have developed in harmony with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government.\u201d <em>Glasser v.

The framers of the constitution strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action.

To minimize violations of the fair cross-section guarantee, the statutory procedures establish objective methods for the random selection of trial jurors in Montana. These objective procedures, by seeking to eliminate as far as possible the vagaries of human subjectivity and arbitrariness from the jury selection process, secure a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to an impartial jury by ensuring that the selection process results in a jury panel or venire consisting of a fair cross-section of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>Ill Jury Selection Errors are Structural in Nature</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b639 Having established that the statutory procedures primarily serve to ensure that jury panels will be selected, drawn, and summoned in a manner that reflects a fair cross-section of the community, we now turn to the question of whether a transgression of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair cross-section guarantee is amenable to harmless error review. Before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless under <em>Chapman, </em>the reviewing \u201ccourt must be able to declare a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828, 17 L.Ed.2d at 710-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b640 In <em>Satterwhite v. Texas </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 249, 108 S.Ct. 1792, 100 L.Ed.2d 284, the U.S. Supreme Court distinguished between those Sixth Amendment transgressions that are subject to harmless error review and those violations that trigger a rule of automatic reversal: \u201cWe have permitted harmless error analysis in both capital and noncapital cases where the evil caused by a Sixth Amendment violation is limited to the <em>erroneous admission of particular evidence at trial\u201d Satterwhite, </em>486 U.S. at 257,108 S.Ct. at 1798,100 L.Ed.2d at 294 (emphasis added). However, some constitutional violations \u201cby their very nature cast so much doubt on the fairness of the trial process that, as a matter of law, they can never be considered harmless. Sixth Amendment <em>violations that pervade the entire proceeding </em>fall within this category.\u201d <em>Satterwhite, </em>486 U.S. at 256,108 S.Ct. at 1797, 100 L.Ed.2d at 293 (emphasis added). Examples include a conflict of interest in representation throughout an entire trial, a total deprivation of counsel throughout an entire proceeding, and the absence of counsel from an arraignment proceeding that affected the entire trial because defenses not asserted were irretrievably lost. <em>See Satterwhite, </em>486 U.S. at 256, 108 S.Ct. at 1797, 100 L.Ed.2d at 293-94 (citing <em>Holloway v.

The question is whether an improperly se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>lected jury is the type of Sixth Amendment violation that pervades the entire trial process (i.e., \u201cstructural\u201d), making any inquiry into harmless error impossible to discern from the record and, thus, purely speculative. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that a violation that undermines the fair cross-section guarantee is \u201cstructural\u201d in nature and, for that reason, not amenable to harmless error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b643 Since the 1967 <em>Chapman </em>decision, the U.

S.Ct. 1246, 1263, 113 L.Ed.2d 302,329. \u201cAccordingly, if the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless-error analysis.\u201d <em>Rose v.

As mentioned previously, only a limited class of constitutional violations \u2014 \"structural errors\" \u2014 are entitled to a presumption of prejudice. <em>See Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 307-10, 111 S.Ct. at 1264-65, 113 L.Ed.2d at 330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b644 The <em>Fulminante </em>Court cited a string of sixteen cases in which constitutional violations have been deemed harmless, including the following categories of violations: (1) unconstitutionally overbroad jury instructions at the sentencing stage of a capital case; (2) admission of evidence at the sentencing stage of a capital case in violation of the Sixth Amendment Counsel Clause; (3) jury instruction containing an erroneous conclusive presumption; (4) jury instruction misstating an element of the offense; (5) jury instruction containing an erroneous rebuttable presumption; (6) erroneous exclusion of defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the circumstances of his or her confession; (7) restriction on a defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness for bias in violation of the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause; (8) denial of a defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial; (9) improper comment on defendant\u2019s silence at trial, in violation of the Fifth Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause; (10) statute improperly forbidding trial court giving a jury instruction on a lesser included offense in a capital case in violation of the Due Process Clause; (11) failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence; (12) admission of identification evidence in violation of the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause; (13) admission of the out-of-court statement of a non-testifying co-defendant in violation of the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause; (14) confession obtained in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Massiah </em>rule; (15) admission of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (16) denial of counsel at a preliminary hearing in violation of the Sixth Amendment Counsel Clause. <em>See Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 306-07, 111 S.Ct. at 1263, 113 L.Ed.2d at 329-30 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b645 The common thread connecting these cases is that each involved what the Court calls \u201ctrial error\u201d \u2014 error which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which can therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of the other evidence introduced at trial to determine whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As can be seen from the foregoing list of trial errors, a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to a fair cross-section has not been determined to be subject to harmless error review by the U.S. Supreme Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b646 In <em>Fulminante, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court set forth three definitions of the \u201ctrial error\u201d/\" structural error\" dichotomy which guide our inquiry. First, in what has been labeled the \u201cevidentiary definition,\u201d the Court stated that a trial error is that \u201cwhich may ... be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented.\u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 307-08, 111 S.Ct. at 1264, 113 L.Ed.2d at 330; David McCord, <em>The \u201cTrial\u201d! \"Structural\" Error Dichotomy: Erroneous, and Not Harmless, </em>45 U. Kan. L. Rev. 1401, 1412 (1997). As suggested earlier, it is impossible to quantitatively assess the prejudicial impact of an improperly impaneled jury in the context of the evidence at trial. Indeed, harmless error review presupposes an \u201cimpartial adjudicator\u201d and then looks to whether the error (typically evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>in nature) would have fundamentally affected the jury\u2019s deliberations, regardless of the other evidence presented at trial. However, it is pure speculation as to whether an improperly selected jury would have viewed the evidence at trial differently than a properly selected jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">It is in the nature of the practices here challenged that proof of actual harm, or lack of harm, is virtually impossible to adduce. For there is no way to determine what jury would have been selected under a constitutionally valid selection system, or how that jury would have decided the case. Consequently, it is necessary to decide on principle which side shall suffer the consequences of unavoidable uncertainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><em>Peters v. Kiff </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 493, 504, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 2169, 33 L.Ed.2d 83, 94-95 (vacating, on due process grounds, the conviction of a white man who was tried by a jury from which black persons were discriminatory excluded). Thus, the first <em>Fulminante </em>definition suggests that a fair cross-section violation would not be amenable to harmless error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b647 Second, in <em>Fulminante, </em>the Court set forth what has been captioned the \u201cdurational definition\u201d of trial error: an error that occurs \u201cduring the presentation of the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 307, 111 S.Ct. at 1264, 113 L.Ed.2d at 330; McCord, <em>The \u201cTrial\u201d! \"Structural\" Error Dichotomy, </em>45 U. Kan. L. Rev. at 1414. Obviously, an error injury selection occurs prior to the presentation of any evidence to the jury and, therefore, cannot be said to be a trial error under the second <em>Fulminante </em>definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b648 Lastly, the Court defined structural error in terms of what has been called the \u201crevived <em>Chapman </em>approach\u201d: a structural defect is an error that \u201caffect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 310, 111 S.Ct. at 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d at 331; McCord, <em>The \u201cTrial\u201d </em>/ <em>\"Structural\" Error Dichotomy, </em>45 U. Kan. L. Rev. at 1415. Again, as alluded to under the second definition above, an improperly selected trial jury constitutes an error which precedes the presentation of any evidence at trial. In short, it is not a trial error, but a structural error which affects the very framework within which the trial proceeds. Since the error predates the admission of any evidence, it is purely speculative to attempt to assess the impact of the error in the context of the evidence presented at trial to determine whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The third <em>Fulminante </em>defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ration clearly supports a <em>per se </em>rule of reversal for a statutory violation that affects the fair cross-section guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b649 In closing, a quote from <em>Gray v. Mississippi </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 648, 107 S.Ct. 2045, 95 L.Ed.2d 622, represents yet another rationale supporting the conclusion that an improperly selected jury constitutes structural error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">Because... the <em>impartiality of the adjudicator goes to the very integrity of the legal system, </em>the <em>Chapman </em>harmless-error analysis cannot apply. We have recognized that \u201csome constitutional rights [are] so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>[, 386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. at 827-28, 17 L.Ed.2d at 710]. <em>The right to an impartial adjudicator, be it judge or jury, is such a right.

A plain language argument can be made that \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, is inapplicable to the right to trial by an impartial jury because that right is fundamental and the statute, by its plain terms, applies only to an error that \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>not affect substantial rights.\u201d As the argument goes, since the right to a jury trial is a substantial, indeed fundamental right, it must not be disregarded under the harmless error statute. This position is, however, unworkable and unsound because it invites the notion that all constitutional rights, being substantial, are not amenable to harmless error review. Such a position would run contrary to the actuality, as illustrated herein, that most constitutional rights have been found to be subject to the harmless error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b652 The distinction between trial and structural error provides a much more cohesive rationale as to why \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, does not apply to certain types of constitutional violations. Under Montana\u2019s harmless error statute, this Court is prohibited from reversing a judgment and verdict \u201cunless <em>the record </em>shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d Section 46-20-701(1), MCA (emphasis added). To warrant reversal, the convicted person\u2019s substantial rights must have been prejudicially affected, \u201cas shown <em>upon the record.\u201d </em>Section 46-20-701(1), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b653  Thus, the harmless error statute is inapplicable to structural errors, such as an error in the jury selection process, because these types of errors cannot be assessed by this Court against \u201cthe record\u201d for \u201cprejudicial\u201d impact. A structural error precedes the trial process and, therefore, cannot be quantitatively weighed against the evidence introduced at trial to determine whether the defendant was prejudiced by the error. That is, the very premise of harmless error review is simply absent. To echo the words of <em>Chapman, </em>this Court cannot say with any degree of certainty that such an error is \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b654 In closing, as this Court has observed of the substantial compliance standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\"><em>The fact that no actual prejudice has been shown is irrelevant. Whether a different verdict would have resulted had the statutory procedures been followed is purely speculative, conjectural and impossible to determine. </em>The District Court went well beyond a mere technical departure from the jury selection statutes and this type of departure necessitates the reversal of the verdict and a retrial with a jury selected in the proper manner. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adg\"><em>Dvorak, </em>196 Mont. at 172, 639 P.2d at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\n<em>V Clarifying the Substantial Compliance Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b655 The question that obviously arises is whether this Court must reverse every case where a violation occurs in the statutory process governing the formation of a trial jury. The answer to this question is negative. Under this Court\u2019s case law, the substantial compliance standard is not an absolute rule; it permits minor deviations from statutory procedure. Such technical deviations do not constitute a <em>substantial </em>failure to comply and, therefore, do not give rise to a presumption of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b656 In clarifying the substantial compliance standard, we take guidance from federal case law developed under the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 (JSSA). <em>See generally </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1861-1878 (1994). Case law developed under the JSSA is instructive because the Act, like Montana law, utilizes a \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d standard for reversal. In order to establish a violation under the JSSA, a defendant must show that the government substantially failed to comply with the methods set forth by statute for the selection of the jury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(a) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b657 \u201cSubstantial failure\u201d has been construed as a violation that contravenes one of two basic principles under the JSSA: (1) random selection of jurors; and (2) determination of juror disqualification, excuses, exemptions, and exclusion on the basis of objective criteria. <em>United States v. Royal </em>(1st Cir. 1999), 174 F.3d 1, 11. The statutes governing the selection of a trial jury in Montana ensure these same basic objectives \u2014 random selection of prospective jurors and determining juror competency and excuses on the basis of objective criteria. A substantial failure to comply encompasses a statutory violation that affects the \u201crandom nature or objectivity of the selection process.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennedy </em>(5th Cir. 1977), 548 F.2d 608, 612, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 865, 98 S.Ct. 199, 54 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), <em>and overruled on other grounds by United States v. Singleterry </em>(5th Cir. 1982), 683 F.2d 122. Similarly, we construe the substantial compliance standard in Montana law as designed to protect the random nature and objectivity of the jury selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b658 In turn, technical violations \u2014 even numerous such violations \u2014 that do not frustrate these goals or result in discrimination and arbitrariness do not constitute a substantial failure to comply. <em>Royal, </em>174 F.3d at 11. The fact that technical statutory violations generally are not reversible has led courts to observe that \u201cCongress ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>left room for <em>harmless error </em>by providing that dismissal should lie only when there was a <em>substantial </em>failure to comply with the Act.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans </em>(5th Cir. 1976), 526 F.2d 701, 705 (first emphasis added); <em>see also </em>H.R. Rep. No. 90-1076 (1968) <em>reprinted in </em>1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1792, 1805.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b659 Similarly, as this Court has put it, \u201cnot every deviation, however slight, from the strict letter of the law in drawing or returning a jury will furnish ground for challenge to the panel. The statute in terms requires that the <em>departure must be a material one.\u201d Groom, </em>49 Mont, at 359,141 P. at 859 (emphasis added). \u201c \u2018Where the disregard for legislative mandates amounts to <em>more than technical irregularity </em>substantial compliance has not been achieved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dvorak, </em>196 Mont. at 171, 639 P.2d at 64 (quoting <em>State v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 174, 180-81, 569 P.2d 383, 389) (emphasis added); <em>accord State v. Moran </em>(1963), 142 Mont. 423, 447, 384 P2d 777, 790 (quoting <em>State v. Huffman </em>(1931), 89 Mont. 194, 198, 296 P 789,790) (\u201c \u2018Prejudice is not presumed from error, and we are commanded ... to \u201cgive judgment without regard to technical errors... which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u2019 \u201d). According to Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-16-112, MCA, a successful challenge to the jury panel can be founded only upon a <em>\u201cmaterial departure </em>from the law\u201d with respect to the manner in which the jury was selected, drawn, or summoned. <em>See </em>Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-16-112, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b660  Therefore, if the statutory violation is \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d \u2014 viewed in terms of the underlying principles of ensuring that jury venires are selected randomly and on the basis of objective criteria \u2014 then it cannot be considered non-prejudicial to the defendant. A departure from the statutory scheme that directly or materially affects the random nature or objectivity of the jury selection process establishes a substantial violation independently of the departure\u2019s consequences in an individual case. Conversely, a mere \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201cimmaterial\u201d violation \u2014 one that does not undermine the objective procedures designed to produce a jury venire consisting of a fair cross-section of the community \u2014 constitutes non-prejudicial error under the substantial compliance standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b661  We determine that <em>Robbins, </em>by holding that telephone summoning of prospective jurors substantially failed to comply with \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), but that the statutory deviation constituted only harmless error, was wrongly decided. In short, the substantial/ technical dichotomy must be read as a harmful/harmless standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>for reversal. Where the defendant shows that there has been a substantial or material deviation from statutory procedures \u2014 a violation that undermines the random nature or objectivity of the selection process \u2014 a presumption of prejudice obtains. A presumption of prejudice applies because, as we have explained, errors in the jury selection process are structural in nature. Having found a substantial failure to comply with the statutory procedures in <em>Robbins, </em>this Court should have found the error to be prejudicial (i.e., not harmless), thus warranting reversal. Therefore, to the extent that <em>Robbins </em>requires a showing of \u201cactual prejudice\u201d by the defendant to sustain a challenge to the jury panel under the substantial compliance standard, it is hereby expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\n<em>VI The Substantial Compliance Standard is Appropriate as a Matter of Public Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b662 The State urges this Court to apply the three-pronged test for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair cross-section guarantee to LaMere\u2019s appeal. <em>See Duren v. Missouri </em>(1979), 439 U.S. 357, 99 S.Ct. 664, 58 L.Ed.2d 579; <em>Taylor v. Louisiana </em>(1975), 419 U.S. 522, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690; <em>see also United States v. Esquivel </em>(9th Cir. 1996), 88 F.3d 722; <em>Kills on Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 901 P.2d 1368; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 194, 864 P.2d 787. The State claims that LaMere\u2019s \u201cgeneral statistics\u201d fail to show the systematic exclusion of any distinctive group in the community and, therefore, fail to satisfy the <em>Duren </em>test. While the State is correct in arguing that LaMere\u2019s statistics do not satisfy the second, statistical prong of the <em>Duren </em>inquiry, the State\u2019s argument would misapply the constitutional test to an alleged statutory violation. LaMere\u2019s challenge arises under the substantial compliance standard, not the Sixth Amendment itself. Although the statutory procedures for jury selection are designed to protect the constitutional, fair cross-section guarantee, the substantial compliance standard and the constitutional test have as their object of inquiry entirely different subject matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b663 To illustrate, under <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Duren, </em>the fair cross-section test is designed to ensure that \u201c \u2018jury wheels, pools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn [do] not systematically exclude distinctive groups in the community and thereby fail to be reasonably representative thereof.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Duren, </em>439 U.S. at 363-64, 99 S.Ct. at 668, 58 L.Ed.2d at 586 (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>419 U.S. at 538, 95 S.Ct. at 702, 42 L.Ed.2d at 703). In order to mount a successful challenge, a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>must show that the underrepresentation of a distinctive group in the community on jury venires is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process itself. <em>Duren, </em>439 U.S. at 364,99 S.Ct. at 668, 58 L.Ed.2d at 587. Such a showing demonstrates that \u201cthe cause of the underrepresentation was <em>systematic </em>\u2014 that <em>is, inherent in the particular jury selection process utilized.\u201d Duren, </em>439 U.S. at 366, 99 S.Ct. at 669, 58 L.Ed.2d at 588 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b664 Therefore, the constitutional, fair cross-section test exists to challenge a <em>\u201cjury-selection system\u201d </em>that systematically excludes an identifiable class of citizens from jury service. <em>Taylor, </em>419 U.S. at 525, 95 S.Ct. at 695, 42 L.Ed.2d at 695 (emphasis added). Here, LaMere\u2019s challenge is premised upon a material failure to comply with the statutory scheme; he is not challenging the jury-selection scheme itself as failing to comport with the Sixth Amendment. As LaMere correctly suggests, it is possible to have substantial compliance with a system for jury selection, statutory or otherwise, that nevertheless fails to satisfy the fair cross-section requirement of the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, <em>Duren </em>is inapposite to the challenge before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar8e\">\u00b665 That a defendant faces a higher burden to sustain a constitutional challenge to the jury selection system itself than when challenging a failure to internally comply with the statutory scheme is immaterial. The substantial compliance standard for reversal implies that the legislative scheme established for jury selection is constitutionally valid. The statutory procedieres protect against, and indeed preempt, violations of fundamental constitutional rights. In light of the presumption of constitutionality underlying the substantial compliance standard, a heightened burden to sustain a constitutional challenge is entirely rational. The statutory system governing jury selection is a prophylactic vehicle for protecting the underlying constitutional rights. However, the particular jury selection procedures employed may, nonetheless, fail to satisfy constitutional requirements. The three-pronged <em>Duren </em>test exists as a safeguard to ensure that the jury selection system itself remains constitutionally valid, and this Court will continue to adhere to <em>Duren </em>where applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b666 The more lenient burden under the substantial compliance standard than under the constitutional standard of <em>Duren </em>is best explained on the grounds of public policy. Under this Court\u2019s case law, no prejudice need be shown where there has been a substantial failure to comply with the statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>because a rule of automatic reversal protects the integrity of the jury system itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">It is not the right of the individual necessarily involved, but rather the entire jury system and the selection procedures which must be protected, and when a showing is timely brought before this [CJourt we would be remiss in our duties if we permitted material deviation or departure from the procedures spelled out by the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><em>State ex rel.

District Court </em>(1959), 136 Mont. 354, 360, 348 P.2d 143, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00b667 The substantial compliance standard is appropriate, in our view, as a matter of public policy. That standard is designed to provide vindication of a right which benefits the public as much or more than the individual defendant. As one commentator has succinctly put it, \u201c[ejrrors that have a societal effect beyond the effect they have on the particular defendant should tend more toward reversibility.\u201d McCord, <em>The \u201cTrial\u201d/ \"Structural\" Error Dichotomy, </em>45 U. Kan. L. Rev. at 1455. Errors infringing upon the right to trial by a fair and impartial jury encroach so fundamentally upon our democratic conception of justice, embodied in the right to a jury trial, that they are errors which should tend towards reversal. For this Court has long recognized \u201cthe insistence with which the people of this country maintain the right of trial by jury.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>86 Mont. at 512, 284 R at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u00b668 The rationale underlying the substantial compliance standard, then, is that any material deviation from statutory procedures designed to ensure that jury selection results in \u201ctrial by a representative group are undermining processes weakening the institution of jury trial, and should be sturdily resisted.\u201d <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 86, 62 S.Ct. at 472, 86 L.Ed. at 707. Encouraging reasonably strict compliance with statutory procedures through the substantial compliance standard ensures that jury duty will be allocated fairly among the Montana citizenry, thus ensuring that the right to a fair and impartial jury will remain inviolate for all.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b669 The substantial compliance standard, in sum, safeguards the fundamental, democratic notion of community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence. <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S. at 156, 88 S.Ct. at 1451, 20 L.Ed.2d at 500. Community participation in the administration of criminal justice is \u201cnot only consistent with our democratic heritage but is also critical to public confidence in the fairness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>419 U.S. at 530, 95 S.Ct. at 698, 42 L.Ed.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<em>VII Conclusion: The Resolution of this Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b670 As stated previously, the fundamental purpose of the jury selection statutes is to provide \u201crandom selection of jurors from the entire panel or array,... thus securing a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Tribby, </em>217 Mont, at 207, 704 P.2d at 416. Although there is no suggestion that the clerk\u2019s methods of randomly drawing the jury panel failed to comply with the law, LaMere has pinpointed precisely where in the statutory process the objective of ensuring \u201crandom selection\u201d was circumvented \u2014 the summoning stage. Of the 200-juror panel randomly drawn, over one-third (70) of the prospective jurors were excluded from possible jury service by virtue of the manner in which the phone-only notification method skewed the random nature and objectivity of the jury selection procedures established by the Montana Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b671  By effectively failing to summon the \u201centire panel or array\u201d drawn for LaMere\u2019s trial, the purpose of juror notification \u2014 to ensure that the randomly drawn pool of prospective jurors appear in court on the slated day of trial as a representative body of the community \u2014 has been totally undermined. That a pool of prospective jurors be a representative body of the community is secured, in part, by the requirement of \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), that persons drawn for jury duty receive a jury summons by mail or personal service and respond thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b672 While we have no reason on the record to question the clerk\u2019s intentions in utilizing the telephone to summon prospective jurors, \u201c[processes which permit human subjectivity to influence the objective, random system often foster biased results. Regardless of the good intentions of the persons in charge of jury selection, their interplay with the system necessarily skews the system ...\u201d <em>Davis, </em>867 F.2d at 1013. Afailure to summon \u201cone or more of the jurors drawn\u201dby the persons in charge of jury selection \u2014 a substantial failure to comply with statutory requirements \u2014 could \u201cdefeat the constitutional guaranty of an impartial jury\u201d and, therefore, is subject to a rule of automatic reversal. <em>See Groom, </em>49 Mont. at 359, 141 P. at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u00b673 Furthermore, telephone summoning not only frustrates the random nature of the selection process, but also undermines the principle of granting juror excuses only on the basis of objective criteria. As LaMere suggests, a phone-dependent summoning procedure con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>stitutes an impermissible, \u201clargely voluntary jury system\u201d; a prospective juror is allowed to excuse himself or herself from possible jury duty simply by failing to return the clerk\u2019s phone call. This we will not countenance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">Jury service brings the citizen into contact with the law, and makes him [or her] a constituent part of legal administration.

Jury duty cannot be lightly shirked, as the telephone summoning method allows, without doing violence to the democratic nature of the jury system. \u201c[T]he broad representative character of the jury should be maintained, partly as assurance of a diffused impartiality and partly because sharing in the administration of justice is a phase of civic responsibility.\u201d <em>Thiel, </em>328 U.S. at 227,66 S.Ct. at 989, 90 L.Ed. at 1188 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b675  We hold that LaMere has demonstrated that the substantial failure to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), materially undermined the purpose of the jury selection statutes to provide for random selection of jurors on the basis of objective criteria.

Indeed, I agree entirely with the first twenty paragraphs of the Court\u2019s opinion and, most importantly, with the first sentence in \u00b6 21.1 disagree strongly with the approach the Court utilizes thereafter in reaching its decision to reverse the District Court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\u00b678 As background, it is appropriate to observe that we decided <em>Robbins </em>on December 8,1998, little more than one year ago. There, we applied the \u201cprejudicial error\u201d standard for reversal set forth in \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, and affirmed the district court, holding that Robbins failed to demonstrate prejudice affecting his substantial rights. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u00b679 In the present case, the Court correctly notes that LaMere requests us to overrule <em>Robbins </em>on the sole basis that we failed to follow established precedent holding failure to substantially comply with statutory procedures governing jury selection <em>per se </em>reversible without any proof of prejudice. The Court also correctly notes that none of those <em>pre-Robbins </em>cases was decided in the context of \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, Montana\u2019s harmless error statute. Finally, and importantly, the Court states that \u201cLaMere provides this Court with no convincing rationale as to why a statutory violation in the procurement of a trial jury should not be amenable to harmless error review pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA.\u201d I could not agree more.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b680 Under that circumstance, it is my view that our duty is to apply \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, and <em>Robbins </em>(with one qualification discussed below), and determine thereunder whether the trial court\u2019s error here was harmless or whether LaMere established prejudice entitling him to a reversal and remand for a new trial. That approach comports with our general jurisprudential practice of deciding cases on the basis of the issues presented by the parties to the District Court and this Court and, following that approach, I would determine on the record before us that LaMere established sufficient prejudice to require a reversal and new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b681 Instead of doing so, the Court launches into a lengthy and scholarly discussion of questions of substantial magnitude which have never before been addressed in Montana. I do not necessarily disagree with many of the principles and much of the legal analysis presented. My concern, though, is that I am confident there are arguments to be made \u2014 arguments which may well be persuasive \u2014 on the other side of the propositions the Court champions. We have neither heard those arguments nor had an opportunity to hear them. They have not been presented to this Court for scrutiny or analysis. It is my view, oft-stated, that \u2014 absent some compelling reason such as a question of whether we have jurisdiction to entertain a case \u2014 we should not depart from the issues and arguments presented by the parties. It is unfair to the trial courts and, at some very basic level, it may well impinge on a party\u2019s due process right to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b682 Given the Court\u2019s recognition that LaMere presents no convincing rationale as to why <em>Robbins </em>and \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, should not be applied, it is incumbent on us to resolve this case accordingly. Perhaps the analysis presented in the Court\u2019s opinion could be presented as a special concurring opinion, sowing the seed for a party to raise it in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>future case. Perhaps the entire \u201cstructural error\u201d versus \u201ctrial error\u201d question should simply be left to a case in which a party argues for it. In sweeping so wide \u2014 and so unnecessarily \u2014 as the Court does here, we ignore the parties and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b683 Perhaps more importantly, the Court has turned its back on the important doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>without any reason whatsoever. <em>Stare decisis </em>means \u201cto stand by things decided.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1414 (7th ed. 1999). It is of fundamental and central importance to the rule of law <em>(Patterson v. McLean Credit Union </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 164, 172, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 2370, 105 L.Ed.2d 132, 147 (citation omitted)), and there is no question but that \u201c[v]ery weighty considerations underlie the principle that courts should not lightly overrule past decisions.\u201d <em>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc. </em>(1970), 398 U.S. 375, 403, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 1789, 26 L.Ed.2d 339, 358. Indeed, we have held that <em>\u201cstare decisis </em>is a fundamental doctrine which reflects our concerns for stability, predictability and equal treatment...\u201d <em>Formicove, Inc. v. Burlington Northern, Inc. </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 189, 194, 673 P.2d 469, 472 (citations omitted). In a case such as this, where the appellant has advanced no compelling rationale under which <em>Robbins </em>and \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, should not be followed, I submit that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>far outweighs any interest the Court may have in examining the \u201cstructural error\u201d versus \u201ctrial error\u201d questions which it has raised and upon which it resolves the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b684 Returning to the proper analysis of the present case, it is my view that <em>Robbins </em>is easily distinguishable. There, Robbins\u2019 jury selection argument was premised on an <em>assumption </em>that persons the clerk was unable to contact by telephone were too poor to afford a telephone and no evidence to support such an assumption was presented. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6 52. We held, as a result, that Robbins failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike the jury panel resulted in \u201cactual prejudice\u201d affecting his substantial rights. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6 53. In this latter regard, it is important to recognize that \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, repeats the concept of error \u201caffecting substantial rights\u201d three times; it uses the term \u201cprejudicial error\u201d twice. Nowhere in the statute does the phrase \u201cactual prejudice\u201d appear and, to that extent, I would modify our holding in <em>Robbins </em>to strike the word \u201cactual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b685 Addressing the issue properly before us in this case, I would conclude that the evidence submitted by LaMere sufficiently established prejudicial error which affected his substantial rights. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>can be no doubt that the proper drawing of a jury panel, whether pursuant to statutory procedures or constitutional imperative, is a substantial right. Nor, in my view, is there doubt in this case that LaMere\u2019s substantial right was prejudiced by the failure to substantially comply with the statutory procedures. Unlike in <em>Robbins, </em>LaMere presented statistics establishing significant disparity in telephone service to residents above and below the poverty line; the evidence also established that the disparity was significantly enhanced when the representative numbers of Anglo Americans and Native Americans in the community were factored in. Moreover, LaMere introduced a statistician\u2019s affidavit opining, <em>inter alia, </em>that the telephonic summoning procedure used in Cascade County resulted in below-poverty households being seven times more likely to be excluded from jury participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b686 I agree that LaMere\u2019s evidence does not establish measurable or quantifiable prejudice. I do not believe, however, that \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, requires evidence meeting such a standard in a jury selection case. I would conclude that LaMere\u2019s evidence established sufficient prejudice to his substantial rights and would reverse the District Court on that basis.</p>\n<judges id=\"b410-5\">JUSTICE REGNIER joins in the foregoing specially concurring opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b410-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the specially concurring opinion of JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
