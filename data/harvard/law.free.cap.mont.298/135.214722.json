On appeal, the Department of Corrections argues that the District Court failed to comport with the applicable DUI sentencing law pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1997). We remand Phelps\u2019s sentence to be modified according to our holding in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\u00b63 1. Does \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1997), permit the District Court to suspend any of Phelps\u2019s imprisonment term?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">\u00b64 2. Does the District Court have statutory authority to award</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Phelps double credit for time served when he completes a treatment program?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">\u00b65 3. Can the District Court order Phelps committed to a prerelease program or intensive supervision?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">\u00b66 The District Court originally sentenced Phelps for his fourth DUI offense, but after it realized that Phelps committed this offense on the day \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1997), became effective the District Court re-sentenced him on December 22,1998, pursuant to the new law. Consequently, the District Court imposed the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajk\">The Defendant is sentenced to 13 months of incarceration with the Department of Corrections, with all time SUSPENDED, except time served, which the Court believes to be 227 days, plus Four Years of probation with the Department of Corrections. He must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>enter and complete an appropriate treatment program. The Court believes inpatient chemical dependency treatment is probably most appropriate. Upon successful completion of treatment and follow up aftercare and relapse prevention, the Court will give him DOUBLE CREDIT for time served in treatment. Once he completes treatment, the Defendant shall enter and complete either a Pre-Release Program or an ISP. The Defendant must report daily to his supervising officer and abide by a 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. curfew until he is accepted into treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b67 The Department of Corrections contends that this sentence does not comport with \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b68 Although the State never raised the issue of whether Phelps\u2019s sentence comports with the new law, this Court may review any sentence imposed in a criminal case if it is alleged that the sentence is illegal or exceeds its statutory mandates. <em>See Petition of Hans, </em>1998 MT 7, \u00b6 36, 288 Mont. 168, \u00b6 36, 958 P.2d 1175, \u00b6 36. Our review is limited to questions of legality and whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by the statute. <em>See Hans, </em>\u00b6 36. This is a question of law, which we review to determine if the District Court\u2019s interpretation is correct. <em>See State v. Long </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 228, 236, 907 P.2d 945, 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\u00b69 Does \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1997), permit the District Court to suspend any of Phelps\u2019s imprisonment term?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b610 Section 61-8-731, MCA (1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">(1) On the fourth or subsequent conviction under 61-8-714 or 61-8-722 for a violation of 61-8-401 or 61-8-406, the person is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">(a) imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months or more than 13 months, <em>the imposition or execution of which may not he suspended, </em>and dining which the person is not eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUOt\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">\u00b611  Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we interpret the statute by its plain meaning. <em>See Howell v. State </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 275, 284, 868 P.2d 568, 573. This statute unambiguously states that the District Court cannot suspend any time of imprisonment; therefore, the District Court must strike the language from Phelps\u2019s sentence regarding the time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u00b6 12 The Department of Corrections suggests that Phelps should instead be sentenced to incarceration for 227 days, which he already has served. This would satisfy the 6-month to 13-month requirement of the statute and, in effect, produce the same result as suspending Phelps\u2019s sentence. However, a determination of this matter is not appropriate on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b613 Does the District Court have statutory authority to award Phelps double credit for time served when he completes a treatment program?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b614 Central to the parties\u2019 disagreement on this issue is whether Phelps\u2019s participation in a treatment program is part of his incarceration or part of probation. As the Department of Corrections points out, the District Court has no statutory authority to award additional credit for the time a defendant serves on probation. It discerns that the only statute which allows the court to give a defendant credit aside from the actual days a defendant serves is \u00a7 46-18-403, MCA, which provides that the court must give a defendant \u201cagainst whom a judgment of imprisonment is rendered... credit for each day of incarceration prior to or after conviction.\u201d Although Phelps does not cite this or any other statute to justify his sentence, he argues that he should be awarded double credit because his participation in a treatment program is part of his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b6 15 Phelps argues that incarceration is defined by more than just a place and that we should consider the surrounding circumstances. On this basis, he informs us that he participated in an inpatient treatment program in which he was transferred pursuant to jail transfer policies from the Cascade County Detention Center to the Montana Chemical Dependency Center and then back to the detention center, where he was given double credit for the time he served and then released. He asserts that he was in effect on inmate status because had he left the Montana Chemical Dependency Center the proper authorities would have been notified and he would have faced an escape charge. His assertion is based on our holdings in <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 86, 910 P.2d 247, <em>State v. Savaria </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 224, 800 P.2d 696, and <em>State v. Whiteshield </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 208, 605 P.2d 189. In each of these cases, however, the defendants were inmates of the Montana State Prison who escaped while temporarily away from the prison, and their incarceration status was not at issue. In these cases, we considered instead whether the defendants should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>be convicted of felony escape or misdemeanor escape pursuant to \u00a7 45-7-306(3), MCA. None of the cases involved an escape from a chemical treatment program. Thus, they do not lend support to Phelps\u2019s assertion that his participation in a treatment program was on inmate status.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b6 16  Given a plain reading of the language of Phelps\u2019s sentence, we conclude that Phelps\u2019s participation in a treatment program was a condition of his probation. Section 61-8-731, MCA (1997), does not grant the District Court authority to mandate that a defendant receive inpatient treatment unless it is a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b617 Phelps does not cite any law that provides the District Court authority to award additional credit for the time he serves on probation. Without specific statutory authority, the District Court does not have power to award him double credit for the time he served in treatment. <em>See State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029. Thus, the District Court must strike this language in Phelps\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b618 Can the District Court order Phelps committed to a prerelease program or intensive supervision?</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u00b619 Here, the pertinent part of Phelps\u2019s sentence reads: \u201cOnce he completes treatment, the Defendant shall enter and complete either a Pre-Release Program or an ISP.\u201d The Department of Corrections argues that the District Court only has statutory authority to commit Phelps to a prerelease program as the initial place of incarceration pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-73 l(2)(a)(v), MCA (1997). Phelps does not argue to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">\u00b620 The parties also agree that the District Court does not have authority to order Phelps to complete intensive supervision (ISP). The Department of Corrections argues that pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-73 l(4)(b), MCA (1997), only it has the power to order all or any portion of the term of probation to be served under intensive supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">\u00b621 Upon our review of the statute, we agree. The District Court cannot require Phelps to be committed to a prerelease program or intensive supervision; thus, it must strike the language noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">\u00b622  In summary, we order the District Court to strike the language in Phelps\u2019s sentence regarding its suspension of his incarceration time, its award of double credit for the time Phelps spends in treatment, and its order to commit Phelps to a prerelease program or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>intensive supervision. The District Court also must take away any double credit Phelps may already have been awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b623 We remand Phelps\u2019s sentence and order the District Court to make the necessary modifications.</p>\n<judges id=\"b160-5\">JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
