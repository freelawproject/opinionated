We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b63 1.

Chisholm </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 240, 855 P.2d 1099 (hereinafter <em>Ihler I):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">\u00b6 10 On May 16, 1988, 12 patients of the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs filed a class action against Curt Chisholm, Director of the Department of Institutions, Carroll South, former Director of the Department of Institutions, Jane Edwards, Superintendent of the Hospital, and the State of Montana (collectively, the Hospital). The Patients sought damages and injunctive relief for civil rights violations under state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">\u00b6 11 The District Court bifurcated the issue of damages from the injunctive portion of the case; the damages issue settled. A bench trial on the injunctive relief began on May 6,1991, and lasted three weeks. During trial, the court heard 35 witnesses, toured the hospital and admitted over 100 exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">\u00b612 In its final order issued September 26,1991, the District Court determined that the Patients primarily had challenged the following three areas of hospital operation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-21\">1. the use of seclusion and restraint against patients;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-22\">2. the condition and treatment of patients at the Xanthopoulus Treatment Facility (the forensic unit); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-23\">3. the adequacy and number of professional staff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u00b613 Although the District Court concluded that the Hospital had made great strides in improving the conditions during the three years after the lawsuit was filed, deficiencies nonetheless remained that had the effect of depriving the Patients of their civil rights. The court concluded that the Hospital was deficient in its use of seclusion and restraint and in keeping patients in the forensic unit long after they should have been transferred to a less restrictive environment. It also concluded that the Hospital had given inadequate treatment and therapy in the forensic unit and employed insufficient numbers of clinical staff. The court then ordered the Hospital to correct the deficiencies and submit a report demonstrating compliance within three months of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b614 Following entry of the District Court\u2019s decision and order, the Patients moved for attorney fees and expenses in the amount of $2,071,856.61 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of1976. On April 20,1992, the court entered an interim order awarding the Patients $415,950.74 for attorney fees and costs. The District Court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the interim order on August 13,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b615 The District Court first determined the reasonable hourly rates for ten attorneys that had represented the Patients during the litigation; the rates ranged from $75 per hour to $110 per hour. In making this determination, the court concluded that the Patients had not established that out-of-state counsel was necessary, and based its rates on Montana standards. The court then found that the Patients had significantly overstaffed the case with counsel, and reduced each attorney\u2019s compensable hours by varying percentages due to duplication and excessive travel time. The District Court also excluded all hours of attorney Mary Gallagher for the period she was employed by the State of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b616 By multiplying the reasonable hourly rates by the reasonable compensable hours, the District Court reached the \u201clodestar\u201d attorney fees amount. The \u201clodestar\u201d expression was adopted by the United States Supreme Court as the correct method for calculating attorney fees under federal fee-shifting statutes; it consists of the multiplication of a reasonable hourly rate by the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation. <em>See Audit Serv., Inc. v. Frontier-West, Inc. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 142, 153, 827 P.2d 1242, 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b617 The District Court then reduced the lodestar amount by 25 percent based on its finding that the Patients did not prevail on many of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the issues in their original complaint and had achieved limited success on the issues narrowed for trial. Lastly, the District Court declined to increase the lodestar by 150 percent for \u201crisk of contingency,\u201d as requested by the Patients. Instead, the court concluded that the Patients had failed to show that no Montana attorneys would have taken the case, but did show that Montana attorneys are at least reluctant to accept civil rights cases without the prospect of an enhanced fee. Based on that conclusion, the District Court increased the lodestar amount by 50 percent for risk of contingency. The court also awarded the Patients their attorney fees incurred in preparing the motion for fees and their costs for the lawsuit. Entry of judgment was filed on September 1, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b618 The Patients then moved to amend the order on attorney fees, contending that the District Court should have allowed the hourly rates of the out-of-state attorneys instead of increasing the lodestar by 50 percent for contingency. In the Hospital\u2019s response to the motion, it also urged the District Court to reconsider its order due to the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>City of Burlington v. Dague </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 557, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed. 2d 449, which held that enhancement of attorney fees awards for contingency was not permitted under federal fee-shifting statutes. The District Court denied the motion to amend without explanation on October 7,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b6 19 The Hospital appealed and the Patients cross-appealed. On appeal, we held that the District Court erred in enhancing the lodestar by 50 percent for contingency risks and remanded with instructions to eliminate this enhancement. We observed that some accounting for the risk of contingency is normally figured into the computation of the lodestar, by either greater hours claimed or higher hourly wages, and could not determine whether the District Court would have reached the same lodestar figure if it had not subsequently enhanced the lodestar to account for contingent risks. Accordingly, we remanded the case to the District Court in order for it to recompute the lodestar. Because of our remand, we declined to address issues raised by the Patients concerning the compensable hours and reasonable hourly rates. <em>Ihler I, </em>259 Mont. at 246, 855 P.2d at 1013. We also affirmed the District Court\u2019s reduction of the lodestar by 25 percent because of the limited success of the Patients on the merits of their claims and reversed the District Court\u2019s denial of Gallagher\u2019s fees incurred by the Patients while Gallagher was employed as an attorney for the Board of Visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u00b620 On remand, the Hospital filed a motion to reassess attorney fees in which it contended that the District Court need only eliminate the 50 percent enhancement for contingency and add Gallagher\u2019s fees to the lodestar in order to comply with our decision in <em>Ihler I. </em>The Patients filed a motion seeking attorney fees incurred on appeal and responded to the Hospital\u2019s motion to reassess attorney fees by requesting that the District Court entirely redetermine the lodestar figure in light of our decision in <em>Ihler I </em>by reassessing reasonable hourly rates and compensable hours and by enhancing the lodestar due to the undesirability of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b621 On September 8,1994, the Patients filed a motion seeking the \u201cundisputed attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d for Gallagher. On September 15, 1994, the District Court issued an interim award of attorney fees in the amount of $89,715, reflecting the amount of Gallagher\u2019s fees not included in its initial lodestar figure. On October 30,1994, the parties entered into a Non-Waiver, Receipt, and Indemnity Agreement by which the Hospital agreed to pay the $89,715 with the stipulation that if the District Court ultimately reduced the Patients\u2019 fee award below the amount the Hospital had already paid, the Patients would refund that amount to the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b622 On June 22, 1998, the District Court issued its Order on Remand. The court eliminated the 50 percent enhancement for contingency and added Gallagher\u2019s fees incurred by the Patients while Gallagher was employed by the Board of Visitors. The court did not reassess the reasonable hourly rates or compensable hours. Finally, the court denied the Patients\u2019 request for attorney fees incurred on appeal. As a result, the Patients\u2019 initial award of $339,304.59 for attorney fees was reduced to $293,485.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b623 On July 14, 1998, the Patients moved to alter or amend the court\u2019s Order on Remand. On September 12,1998, the District Court denied the Patients\u2019 motion. Patients appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b624 We review a District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ihler </em>I, 259 Mont. at 246, 855 P.2d at 1013. A District Court abuses its discretion if its fee award is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact. <em>Barjon v. Dalton </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 132 F.3d 496, 500 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">I. THE LAW OF THE LODESTAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b625 Apartywho prevails in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983isenti-tled to a reasonable attorney fee under \u00a7 1988 unless special circumstances would render an award unjust. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 48. The starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee consists of multiplying a reasonable hourly rate by the number of horns reasonably expended on the litigation. <em>Ihler I, </em>259 Mont. at 243, 855 P.2d at 1011 (citing <em>Audit Serv., </em>252 Mont. at 153, 827 P.2d at 1250). This initial amount has been referred to as the \u201clodestar.\u201d <em>See Viler </em>1, 259 Mont at 243, 855 P.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">A. Reasonable Hourly Rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b626 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying the Patients\u2019 request for out-of-state hourly rates for their out-of-state attorneys?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\u00b627 Under \u00a7 1988, the reasonable hourly rate is calculated according to the \u201cprevailing market rates in the relevant community.\u201d <em>Barjon, </em>132 F.3d at 500 (quoting Blum <em>v. Stenson </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 886, 895, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 1547, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891, 900). Generally, the relevant community is the forum in which the district court sits. <em>Barjon, </em>132 F.3d at 500 (citation omitted). However, in circumstances where it is reasonable to retain attorneys from other communities, the rates in those communities may also be considered. <em>See Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton </em>(4th Cir. 1994), 31 F.3d 169, 175 (reversing district court denial of out-of-forum rates because prevailing party acted reasonably in selecting out-of-forum representation due to complex and politically sensitive nature of issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\u00b628 In their fee application, the Patients sought out-of-state rates for their out-of-state attorneys. The District Court stated that \u201cit was not convinced that out-of-state representation was necessary\u201d because the Patients had neither submitted affidavits from attorneys who had refused to accept the case, nor demonstrated that Montana attorneys were unqualified to handle such a case. Consequently, the court found that the relevant community for purposes of an award of attorney fees was the State of Montana and refused to adjust the hourly rate for the Patients\u2019 out-of-state attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">\u00b629 The Patients contend that the District Court erred by requiring them to prove that resort to out-of-state representation was \u201cnecessary.\u201d The Patients assert that the correct standard is not whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>out-of-state representation was <em>necessary, </em>but whether resort to out-of-state representation was <em>reasonable. </em>The Patients also contend that they submitted sufficient evidence of the reasonableness of seeking out-of-state representation and that this evidence was unrebutted by the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b630 In particular, the Patients point to the affidavits of Allen Smith and Mary Gallagher. Mr. Smith, an attorney employed by the State Mental Disabilities Board of Visitors, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">After discussions with Montana attorneys it was recognized that we would be unable to secure, in Montana, sufficient resources and the legal assistance that was necessary to successfully' litigate this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">... While several Montana attorneys were interested in assisting in this litigation, we were unable to secure \u00e1 commitment from Montana counsel with the available time and the legal expertise necessary for this case. There is no way this litigation could have been initiated and continued without the financial and legal assistance provided by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the Mental Health Law Project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b631 Ms. Gallagher, also employed as an attorney for the Board of Visitors until March 8,1991, and thereafter employed as a private attorney, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">When this litigation commenced... neither myself nor A1 Smith, the Board of Visitors\u2019 co-counsel, were qualified to take on a case of this complexity or magnitude, given our level of legal experience. Our discussions with various attorneys in the state indicated that there was no expertise in the field of mental health law in the state. Litigator Mark Connell was initially contacted and my understanding was that he would be willing to assist at times but he was not willing to be lead counsel on a case of this complexity and he was not experienced in mental health issues. Additionally, Steve Ungar, the then-president of Montana ACLU was unable to procure other counsel in Montana with any experience in this area of law. It was my experience that very few attorneys knew anything at all about the field of mental health law and the issues we were facing. I did not consider anyone in the State to be qualified to take on the case and we therefore contacted the Mental Health Law Project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b632 At the outset, we note that although appellate courts generally review a trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the deferential review inherent in the abuse of discretion standard is inappropriate when the issue is whether a trial court applied the appropriate standard. <em>See Corder v. Gates </em>(9th Cir. 1996), 104 F.3d 247, 249 (\u201cHowever, we review de novo any elements of legal analysis which figure in the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d); <em>Rum Creek, </em>31 F.3d at 174 (deferential review modified when issue is whether district court applied the appropriate criteria); <em>Coleman v. Kaye </em>(3rd Cir. 1996), 87 F.3d 1491, <em>1497, cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1084, 117 S. Ct. 754, 136 L. Ed. 2d 691 (1997) (plenary review when district court fails to apply the appropriate standard); <em>Barjon, </em>132 F.3d at 500 (a fee award which is based on an inaccurate view of the law is an abuse of discretion). \u00b633 Upon a review of relevant case law, it appears that federal appellate courts have articulated two standards to determine whether to award out-of-forum hourly rates. Some courts have asked whether resort to out-of-forum counsel was reasonable. <em>See Rum Creek, </em>31 F.3d at 178-79; <em>National Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Hanson </em>(4th Cir. 1988), 859 F.2d 313, 317-18 (affirming award of out-of-forum rates because prevailing party acted reasonably in selecting out-of-forum attorney when its local counsel was unable to take the case and nearest counsel with requisite experience in complex environmental litigation and willingness to forgo compensation temporarily was from out-of-forum); <em>Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1982), 670 F.2d 760, 769, <em>cert denied, </em>461 U.S. 956, 103 S. Ct. 2428, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1315 (1983) (\u201cPertinent questions where, as here, a courtis fixing a fee to be paid by an opponent are whether services of like quality are truly available in the locality where the services are rendered, and whether the party choosing the attorney from elsewhere acted reasonably in making that choice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b634 Other courts have asked whether in-forum counsel was \u201cunavailable.\u201d <em>See Barjon, </em>132 F.3d at 501-02 (affirming denial of out-of-forum rates; prevailing party did not prove that local counsel was unavailable because the same declarations offered by prevailing party to prove unavailability of local counsel also revealed declarants themselves who had previously represented similar parties); <em>Gates v. Deukmejian </em>(9th Cir. 1992), 987 F.2d 1392, 1405 (affirming award of out-of-forum rates because prevailing party submitted substantial evidence demonstrating that issues were extremely complex and thus required experienced and sophisticated counsel unavailable in the forum).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b635  Regardless of the standards articulated by other courts, \u201cthe primary concern in an attorney fee case is that the fee awarded be <em>reasonable.\u201dHadix v. Johnson </em>(6th Cir. 1995), 65 F.3d 532, 535 (citing <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 893, 104 S. Ct. at 1545). Moreover, the standard of reasonableness is clearly explicit in the language of the statute itself. Under \u00a7 1988, a district court may \u201callow the prevailing party... a <em>reasonable </em>attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court erred. A prevailing party does not have the burden of proving that resort to out-of-forum counsel was <em>\u201cnecessary\u201d-, </em>instead, a prevailing party has the burden of proving that resort to out-of-forum counsel was reasonable. In doing so, a prevailing party is not required to submit affidavits from in-forum attorneys who refused to accept their case. Rather, a party seeking an award of out-of-forum fees must prove that legal services with whatever degree of skill may have been reasonably required by their case were not readily available at a lower charge or rate in the area where the services were to be performed. <em>See Chrapliwy, </em>670 F.2d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b636  We conclude that the Patients submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate that resort to out-of-forum representation was reasonable because adequate representation was not readily available in Montana. In its findings of fact, the District Court acknowledged that this case was complex and lengthy and that the Patients submitted numerous affidavits from attorneys in Montana which demonstrated that they were reluctant to accept civil rights cases such as this one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Patients also submitted affidavits from Smith and Gallagher, the attorneys responsible for deciding to seek out-of-state representation, which indicated that, upon consultation with Montana attorneys, they believed there was not qualified counsel within the State with the time and expertise to devote to their case. Notably, this evidence was not rebutted by the Defendants. Under these circumstances, we do not think there is any reason to reject the numerous affidavits submitted by the Patients which demonstrate the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ableness of seeking out-of-forum counsel. <em>Cf. Hanson, </em>859 F.2d at 318 (noting that defendant did not controvert evidence of reasonableness of seeking out-of-state representation); <em>Brinker v. Guiffrida </em>(3d Cir. 1986), 798 F.2d 661, 668 (\u201cWe note that in statutory fee cases where an opposing party has been afforded the opportunity to raise a material fact issue as to the accuracy of representations as to the hours spent or the necessity for their expenditure and declines to do so, there is ordinarily no reason for a court to disregard the uncontested affidavits of a fee applicant.\u201d); <em>Washington v. Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas </em>(3d Cir. 1996), 89 F.3d 1031, 1036 (\u201cWhere, as here, the plaintiff has met his prima facie burden under the \u2018community market rate\u2019 lodestar test, and the opposing party has not produced contradictory evidence, the district court may not exercise its discretion to adjust the requested rate downward.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b637 Furthermore, we point out that an award of out-of-state attorney fees on remand was implicit in our holding in <em>Ihler I. </em>In <em>Ihler I, </em>we reversed the District Court\u2019s award of a 50 percent enhancement to the lodestar to reflect contingent risks. In remanding the case to the District Court, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">[A]s stated in <em>Dague, </em>some accounting for the risk of contingency is normally figured into the computation of the lodestar, by either greater hours claimed or higher hourly wages. In this case, we cannot determine if the District Court would have reached the same reasonable hourly rates and reasonable compensable hours if it had not subsequently increased the lodestar amount by 50 percent for contingency. On remand, therefore, the District Court should recompute the lodestar amount \u2014 the reasonable hourly rates multiplied by the reasonable compensable horns \u2014 in light of the principles in set forth in <em>Dague.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Ihler I, </em>259 Mont. at 246, 855 P.2d at 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b638 On remand, the District Court noted that it had previously granted an enhancement because the Patients had established that without such an enhancement for contingency they would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the relevant market. However, despite explicitly acknowledging that this fact was not reflected in its initial lodestar determination \u2014 thus justifying the 50 percent enhancement \u2014 the court refused to recalculate the lodestar on remand. In <em>Dague, </em>the Supreme Court stated that enhancements for contingency are inappropriate because one of the factors motivating a contingent enhancement, the difficulty in establishing the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and factual merits of a claim, should be subsumed in the lodestar figure either through a higher number of hours expended to overcome the difficulty, or in the higher hourly rate of an attorney skilled and experienced enough to do so. <em>Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 562, 112 S. Ct. at 2641. We think that given our instruction to recalculate the lodestar in light of <em>Dague, </em>it was clear that the District Court should have accounted for the reluctance of Montana attorneys to accept cases like this one by making an allowance in the lodestar for out-of-state representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b639 We note that the necessity of reducing the protracted costs of what other courts have referred to as the \u201cinevitable attorney\u2019s fee proceeding\u201d militates in favor of granting great deference to a trial court\u2019s fee award. <em>Ustrak v. Fairman </em>(7th Cir. 1988), 851 E2d 983, 986. However, we do not want to prevent Montana citizens from being able to attract counsel with the time and expertise to represent them in actions enforcing their civil rights. <em>See Hadix, </em>65 F.3d at 535 (\u201cA reasonable fee is one that is adequate to attract competent counsel....\u201d). We also believe that under \u00a7 1988 losing defendants should bear the reasonable costs of actions to enforce civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b640  For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand to the District Court for a redetermination of a reasonable hourly rate for attorneys Helen Hershkoff, Len Rubenstein, Ira Burnim, Susan Stefan, and Victor Bolden. In finding the reasonable hourly rate for non-Montana attorneys, the District Court shall determine the historic rate prevailing in the relevant community for similar work performed by attorneys of comparable skill, experience, and reputation based on all the evidence presently in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b641 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in determining the reasonable in-state hourly rate for Montana attorneys?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b642 The Patients requested the following hourly rates for Montana attorneys: between $120 to $150 for James Goetz, $125 for Jeffrey Renz, $85 for Brian Gallik, and $80 for Mary Gallagher (Andrea Olsen\u2019s affidavit does not contain an hourly rate). The District Court awarded the Patients attorney fees at the hourly rate of $75 for Brian Gallik, Andrea Olsen, and Mary Gallagher, and awarded the Patients attorney fees at an hourly rate of $110 for James Goetz and Jeffrey Renz. The District Court stated that its hourly rate determination was based on the rates requested by the Patients\u2019 Montana attorneys, the novelty and complexity of the litigation, the skill and experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of the individual attorneys, and the affidavits of Erik Thueson, Timothy Whalen, and James Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b643 The Patients contend that the District Court abused its discretion in determining reasonable in-state rates. In particular, the Patients contend that the prevailing rate established by the record for the least experienced attorneys such as Mr. Gallik, Ms. Gallagher, and Ms. Olsen was $80 to $95 an hour. The Patients also assert that Mr. Goetz and Mr. Renz should have been awarded their requested hourly rate because it falls within the in-state range.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b644  As mentioned above, reasonable fees under \u00a7 1988 are normally to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community. <em>See Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 895, 104 S. Ct. at 1547. The prevailing market rate is the \u201crate prevailing in the community for similar work performed by attorneys of comparable skill, experience, and reputation.\u201d <em>Barjon, </em>132 F.3d at 502 (quoting <em>Chalmers v. City of Los Angeles </em>(9th Cir. 1986), 796 F.2d 1205, 1210-11). The fee applicant has the burden of producing satisfactory evidence \u2014 in addition to the attorney\u2019s own affidavits \u2014 that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community. <em>See Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 895 n.11, 104 S. Ct. at 1547 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b645  We conclude that the $75 hourly rate the court awarded the Patients for their inexperienced counsel is clearly erroneous. This rate is not consistent with the information upon which the District Court expressly relied nor is it consistent with the relevant evidence in the record. Based on the affidavits upon which the District Court expressly relied in establishing a market rate, the range of the prevailing market rate in Montana was between $80 and $150.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Inexperienced counsel involved in the case requested a rate of between $80 and $85 an hour. The District Court did not cite any evidence which would indicate that the hourly rates requested by inexperienced counsel were unreasonable. In fact, the evidence cited by the court indicates that the rates requested by inexperienced counsel are exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>where one would reasonably expect them to be \u2014 at the very lowest end of the prevailing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b646 Counsel for the Hospital claims that these lower rates can be justified with reference to a bar survey and the rates charged by defense counsel. However, as a matter of logic, neither a general bar survey nor the particular rates charged by defense counsel could, on their own, enable the court to establish the prevailing market rate for plaintiff\u2019s civil rights work. <em>See Trevino v. Gates </em>(9th Cir. 1996), 99 F.3d 911, 925 (reversing district court\u2019s determination of a reasonable hourly rate for prevailing plaintiff because court used defense attorneys\u2019 rates as a starting point); <em>see also Davis v. City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(9th Cir. 1992), 976 F.2d 1536, 1547, <em>vacated in part on reh\u2019g, </em>984 F.2d 345 (9th Cir. 1993) (affirming exclusion of general bar survey as irrelevant to determination of prevailing rate for practitioners in same or similar market)\u2019. Furthermore, the court clearly stated the facts it was relying upon in making its rate determination, making no mention of either the general bar survey or the rates charged by defense attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b647 Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by awarding an hourly rate of $75 to the Patients for the work of Mr. Gallik, Ms. Olsen, and Ms. Gallagher. <em>See, e.g., Coleman, </em>87 F.3d at 1509-10 (observing that a court must rely upon evidence in the record when setting attorney fees). We conclude that the rates requested by the Patients for the work of Mr. Gallik and Ms. Gallagher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>were reasonable hourly rates being that they were at the very lowest end of the range of rates prevailing in Montana and that the rate of $80 is a reasonable hourly rate for Ms. Olsen given her similar level of experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b648 We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding a $110 hourly rate for the work performed by Mr. Goetz and Mr. Renz. These fees are clearly within the range of prevailing market rates for experienced civil rights litigators as established by the affidavits submitted by the Patients and relied upon by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AmJ\">B. Reasonable Hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b649 Whether the District Court abused its discretion by reducing the Patients\u2019 requested hours?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b650 The second factor that a trial court must determine in reaching a lodestar figure is the number of hours reasonably expended by the prevailing party\u2019s attorneys. The Patients contend that their counsel made a good faith effort to exclude inefficient and duplicative hours and that the District Court abused its discretion by reducing their billable hours further without explaining how it arrived at a specific percentage reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b651 The Supreme Court has described the determination of reasonable hours as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed. Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">The district court also should exclude from this initial fee calculation hours that were not \u201creasonably expended.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1011, p.6 (1976). Cases maybe overstaffed, and the skill and experience of lawyers vary widely. Counsel for the prevailing party should make a good faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission. \u201cIn the private sector, \u2018billing judgment\u2019 is an important component in fee setting. It is no less important here. Hours that are not properly billed to one\u2019s client also are not properly billed to one\u2019s adversary pursuant to statutory authority.\u201d <em>Copeland v. Marshall </em>(D.C. Cir. 1980), 641 F.2d 880, 891 (en banc).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-10\"><em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433-34, 103 S. Ct. at 1939-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u00b652 Following the lead of the Supreme Court, other courts have stressed that the familiarity of a trial court with the underlying litigation warrants considerable deference to its findings on such matters as whether the hours claimed by prevailing counsel are redundant. <em>See, e.g., Davis, </em>976 F.2d at 1544 <em>(citing Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 437, 103 S. Ct. at 1941). We agree. Unlike determinations of the prevailing market rate or the relevant community which are capable of a more thorough review because of a trial court\u2019s necessary reliance on facts submitted to it by the parties, a trial court\u2019s determination that the hours claimed by a prevailing party are redundant or inefficient can be based entirely on its personal observations. However, this does not mean that a district court can decide arbitrarily to reduce the hours claimed by a prevailing party. A district court must provide a concise but clear explanation of the lodestar, including a discussion of the factors it relied upon in determining the number of hours reasonably expended and, if it employs a percentage reduction, how it arrived at the chosen percentage. <em>See Stewart v. Gates </em>(9th Cir. 1993), 987 F.2d 1450, 1453 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b653 In determining a reasonable number of hours, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">11. This case was significantly overstaffed by Plaintiffs. For example, at times there were four Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys present at depositions. During the trial Plaintiffs had as many as six attorneys in attendance. One attorney, Andrea Olsen, spent more than 100 hours on post-trial work, which was in addition to the significant number of hours on such work by other members of Plaintiffs\u2019 legal team; although Ms. Olsen\u2019s fee request already reflects a 25 percent reduction in the number of hours, a further reduction is warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">12. The use of out-of-state attorneys also resulted in additional and unnecessary hours. For example, Victor Bolden\u2019s hours include, in addition to travel time for each trip to Montana, the one-hour trip between his home and the New York airport. While travel time is generally compensable, in this case the number of hours was excessive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">13. Two attorneys, James Goetz and Helen Herskoff, played no significant role in this case and their efforts largely duplicated the work of other attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">22. The number of hours spent on [the fee petition] is excessive, particularly in light of Mr. Renz\u2019s skill and experience in this area. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The issues are neither novel nor complex. The court finds that 25 percent of the hours requested were unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b654 We think that this is a sufficiently concise but clear explanation of the District Court\u2019s reason for reducing the Patient\u2019s requested hours. We do not agree with the Patients\u2019 assertion that the District Court should \u201crely upon the plaintiff\u2019s good faith effort [to exercise billing judgment] when it determines the basic fee.\u201d A trial court is required to independently review a submission of billable hours by a prevailing party to determine the number of hours reasonably expended. <em>See Deukmejian, </em>987 E2d at 1401. Furthermore, we note that the Patients have not pointed us to any specific examples where their attorneys exercised billing judgment by reducing the number of hours charged for the categories specifically noted by the District Court, namely, multiple representation at both the depositions and at trial. For example, as the Hospital points out, the Patients billed for two attorneys, Mr. Bolden and Ms. Olsen, for taking notes at trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that the services the Patient\u2019s attorneys provided were inefficient or duplicative is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b655  However, in light of our conclusion that the Patients acted reasonably in seeking out-of-forum representation, we conclude that the District Court erred to the extent that it reduced the hours of out-of-state attorneys solely because they incurred more travel time or other \u201cadditional, unnecessary hours\u201d as compared with what an in-state attorney would have incurred. Because it was reasonable for the Patients to seek out-of-state representation, it was also reasonable for the Patients to incur the extra expenses associated with out-of-state representation, including travel time. We remand to the District Court for a redetermination of its reduction of the hours of out-of-state counsel which were based solely on the fact that those counsel incurred travel time.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">II. GALLAGHER\u2019S FEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b656 Whether the District Court abused its discretion by calculating Ms. Gallagher\u2019s fees at her 1991 hourly rate?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b657 In its findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its interim order, the District Court excluded all of the fees requested by the Patients for attorney Mary Gallagher for the period she was employed by the State of Montana. On appeal, we held that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Gallagher\u2019s fees for the period she was employed by the state. <em>Ihler </em>I, 259 Mont. at 248, 855 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>1014. On remand, the Hospital moved to reassess attorney fees given our decision in <em>Ihler I. </em>In the Hospital\u2019s memorandum in support of their motion to reassess attorney fees, dated August 24, 1993, they contended that Gallagher\u2019s fees should be calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At7\">Gallagher claimed 1,770.4 hours. Of this total, the Court allowed her time expended after April 5,1991, when she left state employment. This time was 175.5 hours. Subtracting the 175.5 hours from the total claimed, 1,770.4 hours, leaves 1,594.9 hours. The Court reduced Gallagher\u2019s hours by 25 percent for duplication. Reducing the 1,594.9 by this percentage leaves 1,196.2 uncompensated hours that should be compensated. The Court authorized Gallagher\u2019s fees at $75.00 per hour, so that the amount authorized for her is 1,196.2 times $75, which equals $89,715.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b658 In response, the Patients requested that the District Court recalculate the entire fee award in light of our decision in <em>Ihler I. </em>As part of their response, the Patients asserted that the District Court\u2019s initial award of Gallagher\u2019s fees at a rate of $75 was erroneous because it was without support in the record. On September 8,1994, the Patients filed a Motion to Award Undisputed Attorneys\u2019 Fees in which it sought Gallagher\u2019s fees in the amount of $89,715. The Patients asserted that <em>Missouri v. Jenkins </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 274, 109 S. Ct. 2463, 105 L. Ed. 2d 229, required the court to use current hourly rates to account for a delay in the payment of an award of attorney fees, but observed that \u201c[t]he court may avoid some of the current rate issue by directing the Defendants to pay the undisputed portion of the fees now, pending the court\u2019s ruling on the outstanding motion\u201d (apparently referring to the Patients\u2019 motion to reassess the entire attorney fees award).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b659 On September 15, 1994, the District Court issued an Order Granting Interim Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees in which it awarded fees to the Patients in the amount of $89,715. The Hospital objected based upon the possibility that the District Court\u2019s reassessment of the total fee award could be less than what the Hospital had already paid to the Patients. On October 30,1994, the Patients and the Hospital entered into an agreement whereby the Hospital agreed to pay the Patients $89,715 conditioned upon the Patients\u2019 refunding of any overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b660 On June 22, 1998, the District Court issued its Order on Remand. In this order, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Mary Gallagher requested compensation for 1770.4 hours. As noted in the earlier findings of fact, this case was significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>overstaffed. The Court finds that a 25 percent reduction should be applied to arrive at a reasonable number of hours for Ms. Gallagher. The initial lodestar amount for her work is thus $99,585 (1327.8 hours at an hourly rate of $75).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The District Court then reduced Gallagher\u2019s fees by an additional 25 percent, representing a reduction for the Patients\u2019 limited success \u2014 a reduction the court made in its order prior to <em>Ihler I </em>and which we affirmed on appeal. This 25 percent reduction was not reflected in the interim award. Consequently, Patients were awarded $74,688.75 for Gallagher\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b661 The Patients filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Order on Remand in which they claimed that the court erred as a matter of law pursuant to <em>Jenkins </em>by not recalculating Gallagher\u2019s fees at her 1998 rate. The Patients submitted the affidavits of Gallagher and Bernadette Franks-Ongoy which contain declarations of Gallagher\u2019s 1998 hilling rate and the Montana Advocacy Program\u2019s 1998 billing rates. The District Court noted that the Patients had received payment for Gallagher\u2019s fees in 1994 and denied the Patients\u2019 request for fees based on Gallagher\u2019s 1998 rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b662 On appeal, the Patients now contend that the District Court should have applied Gallagher\u2019s 1994 rate when it issued its interim award of fees on September 14,1994. The Hospital contends that the Patients never properly presented the issue of whether the District Court should have applied Gallagher\u2019s current or historical rate. The Hospital observes that the Patients never moved the court for an evidentiary hearing and filed no briefs or supporting affidavits regarding the current versus historic rate issue. Instead, the Hospital contends, the Patients waited until an adverse ruling and then attempted to supplement the record with evidence of Gallagher\u2019s 1998 hourly rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b663 The issue of whether the District Court should have calculated Gallagher\u2019s fees at her 1994 rate was never properly raised below. Significantly, the Patients never requested the District Court to award them Gallagher\u2019s fees based on Gallagher\u2019s 1994rate. Furthermore, as the Patients admit, direct evidence of Gallagher\u2019s 1994 rate was never before the court below and, consequently, this evidence is not before us. Gallagher\u2019s affidavit, attached to the Patients\u2019 Motion to Alter or Amend Order on Remand only contains evidence of Gallagher\u2019s 1998 rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b664 The Patients contend that \u201csimple extrapolation and inference [from Gallagher\u2019s 1998 rate] results in a [1994] rate of $100.\u201d How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ever, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by not awarding attorney fees at Gallagher\u2019s 1994 rate when direct evidence of that rate was never presented to the court. As the Patients have observed, a District Court abuses its discretion when its findings are not based on evidence in the record. <em>See, e.g., Rum Creek </em>31 F.3d at 179 (reversing district court\u2019s adjustments to hourly rates because they were without basis in the record). Lastly, we note that <em>Jenkins </em>does not <em>require </em>a trial court award fees at current rates; rather, <em>Jenkins </em>states only that an enhancement for delay is \u201cwithin the contemplation\u201d of \u00a7 1988, and is \u201cnot.. barred\u201d by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Jenkins, </em>491 U.S. at 284, 109 S. Ct. at 2469; <em>see also Barjon, </em>132 F.3d at 503 (affirming denial of compensation for delayed payment). Accordingly, we affirm the award of Gallagher\u2019s fees based on her historic rate. However, pursuant to our holding above under heading IA2, Gallagher\u2019s fees shall be recomputed based on her requested rate of $80.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">III. PREVAILING PARTY ON APPEAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b665 Whether the District Court erred in denying the Patients\u2019 attorney fees incurred on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b666 In <em>Ihler I, </em>we held that the District Court erred by increasing the lodestar by 50 percent and by not including Gallagher\u2019s fees incurred while Gallagher was employed by the State, but we affirmed the District Court\u2019s reduction of the lodestar by 25 percent for lack of success. On remand pursuant to <em>Ihler I, </em>Patients filed a motion for attorney fees and expenses incurred on appeal. The District Court observed that the Patients \u201cdid not prevail on most of the issues raised in the appeal that were decided by the Supreme Court\u201d and denied the Patients\u2019 request for fees and expenses. The Patients claim that the District Court applied the wrong legal standard, or abused its discretion in the application of the correct standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJaV\">\u00b667 A party who successfully prevails on appeal is entitled to attorney fees under \u00a7 1988. <em>Corder, </em>104 F.3d at 249 (citations omitted). However, once again, we note that there seems to be a division of opinion amongst federal appellate courts. In this case, the division concerns what constitutes a prevailing party on appeal. In <em>Corder, </em>a Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the conclusion of the District Court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the plaintiffs did not prevail on appeal because \u201cthe net result of the various appeals was a reduced award for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Corder, </em>104 F.3d at 247. However, in <em>Ustrak, </em>Judge Posner, writing for a Seventh Circuit panel, held that the plaintiff was the prevailing party despite the fact that plaintiffs award was reduced on appeal. Judge Posner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">But is [the plaintiff] really the prevailing party on this appeal? Having persuaded us to cut down the fee award by a third, the [defendant] could be said to be a prevailing party too ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">This is not the correct approach. As the prevailing party in the underlying civil rights action, [the plaintiff] is entitled to reimbursement of fees reasonably incurred, whether they are fees incurred in the original civil rights trial and appeal, fees incurred in proving those fees, or fees incurred in defending the district court\u2019s fee award. Since the reasonableness of a fee is a function in part of the success achieved by the expenditure, lack of success in obtaining fees or in defending a fee award is certainly material in deciding how large the reimbursement should be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Ustrak, </em>851 F.2d at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b668  We agree with the Seventh Circuit that, when the defendant appeals an attorney fee award and the plaintiff incurs expenses in defending against that appeal that are reasonable even though they are not crowned by complete success, ordinarily the plaintiff should be entitled to reimbursement of those fees; the plaintiff had no choice but to incur them. <em>See Ustrak, </em>851 F.2d at 990. Consequently, we conclude that the District Court erred in denying the Patients an award of reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">IV. ENHANCEMENT OF LODESTAR FOR UNDESIRABILITY.</p>\n<p id=\"AG9\">\u00b669 Whether the District Court abused its discretion by not enhancing the lodestar to reflect the undesirability of the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\u00b670 In <em>Ihler I, </em>we concluded that the District Court\u2019s enhancement of the lodestar by 50 percent based on the contingent nature of a statutory award of fees under \u00a7 1988 was prohibited by <em>Dague </em>and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to \u201cdelete this increase.\u201d <em>Ihler </em>I, 259 Mont. at 246, 855 P.2d at 1013. On remand, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">This Court\u2019s upward adjustment to the lodestar was based on <em>D\u2019Emanuele v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>904 F.2d 1379 (9th Cir. 1990), which held that Justice O\u2019Conner\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>483 U.S. 711, [107 S.Ct. 3078, 97 L.Ed.2d 585 (1987), was the correct approach. Under that approach, enhancement was appropriate where a plaintiff established that without such an enhancement, he would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the relevant market. 483 U.S. at 733, [107 S.Ct. 3078]. This Court therefore granted an enhancement solely due to [the] reluctance of Montana attorneys to accept civil rights cases without the prospect of an enhanced fee. However, that approach was specifically rejected <em>in Dague. </em>[505 U.S. At 563-64, 112 S.Ct. At 2641-42], 120 L. Ed. 2d at 457.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b671 The Patients contend that the District Court erred as a matter of law. The Patients assert that the District Court found that civil rights cases are, as a class, generally undesirable to attorneys in Montana and that <em>Dague </em>does not prohibit an enhancement based on undesirability. The Hospital asserts that this factor was already subsumed within the initial lodestar determination and that the Patients did not meet their burden of establishing that civil rights cases are so undesirable as to require an enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b672 Although <em>Dague </em>prohibits an enhancement based on contingent risks, <em>Dague </em>does not prohibit all enhancements to a lodestar figure. <em>See Guam Soc\u2019y of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists v. Ada </em>(9th Cir. 1996), 100 F.3d 691, 697 (affirming an enhancement based on the extreme undesirability of the case, the likelihood that no other local attorney would have accepted the case, and the rare and exceptional nature of the case). However, there is a strong presumption that the lodestar figure represents a reasonable fee. <em>See Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 562, 112 S. Ct. at 2641 (citation omitted). The applicant has the burden of proving that the requested enhancement is \u201cnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 562, 112 S. Ct. at 2641 (quoting <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 898, 104 S. Ct. at 1548).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b673 In <em>Dague, </em>the Supreme Court observed that the risk of loss (and, therefore, the attorney\u2019s contingent risk) is the product of two factors: (1) the relative legal and factual merits of the claim, and (2) the difficulty in establishing those merits. <em>Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 562, 112 S. Ct. at 2641. The Court noted that the difficulty in establishing the merits of a claim is ordinarily reflected in the lodestar \u2014 either in the higher number of hours expended to overcome the difficulty, or in the higher hourly rate of the attorney skilled and experienced enough to do so. <em>Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 562, 112 S. Ct. at 2641. The Court observed that the first factor, the relative legal and factual merits of the claim, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>play no part in the calculation of an award because accounting for it would provide attorneys with the same incentive to bring relatively meritless claims as relatively meritorious ones. <em>See Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 563, 112 S. Ct. at 2642.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b674 In holding that a lodestar fee may not be enhanced for contingent risks, the Court explicitly rejected the approach of the concurrence in <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 711, 107 S. Ct. 3078, 97 L. Ed. 2d 585 (hereinafter <em>Delaware Valley II), </em>that enhancement may be appropriate if. the applicant can establish that without an adjustment for risk the prevailing party would have faced substantial difficulty finding counsel in the local or other relevant market because of the market treatment of similar claims as a class. <em>See Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 563-64, 112 S. Ct. at 2642. The Court observed that the predominate reason that a contingent-fee claimant has difficulty finding counsel in any legal market where the winner\u2019s attorney fees will be paid by the loser is that attorneys view the claimant\u2019s case as too risky. <em>See Dague, </em>505 U.S. at 564, 112 S. Ct. at 2642.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b675 On remand, the District Court noted that its original enhancement had been based solely on reasoning contained in the <em>Delaware Valley II </em>concurrence, which had been expressly rejected by <em>Dague. </em>Accordingly, the Court correctly removed the enhancement from its award on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b676  We cannot conclude that the District Court erred as a matter of law by doing exactly as the law required. <em>Dague </em>explicitly rejected the notion of enhancing an attorney fee award because of the undesirability of a class of claims. Moreover, we note that by holding that the District Court erroneously failed to award reasonable fees at out-of-state rates, this factor \u2014 the reluctance of Montana attorneys to represent these types of claims \u2014 is now subsumed in the lodestar figure. Consequently, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to enhance the lodestar figure for undesirability.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">V. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b677 We remand this case to the District Court with the following instructions. First, the District Court shall recompute the lodestar using reasonable historic out-of-state rates for out-of-state attorneys, and including reasonable hours, such as travel time, which were initially excluded solely on the ground that the Patients resorted to out-of-state representation. These determinations will be based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>evidence already in the record. Second, the District Court shall recompute the lodestar using the rate of $80 an hour for attorneys Olsen and Gallagher and $85 for Gallik. Lastly, the District Court shall award the Patients their reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal <em>inlhlerl, </em>as well as reasonable fees incurred on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AcH\">\u00b678 We appreciate the diligence and care exhibited by the District Court in dealing with this difficult and complex case. As we have stated several times in this opinion, it is our intention that the issues addressed on remand are to be completed by the District Court without the need for additional hearings or testimony.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER and GRAY.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\">. The following remarks of Montana attorneys are fairly representative of the affidavits submitted by the Patients:, attorney Erik Thueson states that \u201c[t]his firm does not accept civil rights cases because it has been our belief that the fees normally awarded would not cover the costs and risks\u201d; attorney John M. Morrison states that there is a \"perception among the Bar that there is no money to be made from a court-awarded fee\u201d; and attorney Kim Ritter states, \u201cI do not accept [civil rights] cases because I do not believe that fee awards are sufficient to fulfill my financial obligations to my family and the members of my firm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">. The court relied on the affidavits of Erik Thueson, Timothy Whalen, and James Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Mr. Thueson stated in his affidavit that he had practiced in Montana for 11 years and that the prevailing hourly rate was between $90 and $150 per hour, with an average of $110. Mr. Thueson further stated that \u201c[i]n a complex case where the opposing party will be responsible for the attorney fees if the claimant prevails, the market would dictate that the fee be at least thrice that of the basic hourly rate\u201d in order to cover the risk of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"AdY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Mr. Whalen, stated in his affidavit that he had practiced in Montana since 1982 and that his usual hourly fee was $80, but that this rate necessitates setting a contingent fee approximately three times his usual hourly rate in order to compensate for loss. Mr. Whalen further stated that he rarely accepted civil rights cases and that he would not accept any case in which the defendant pays the prevailing plaintiff\u2019s attorney fees unless he expected his usual hourly fee award to be multiplied by a factor of three.</p>\n<p id=\"AeM\">Mr. Reynolds stated in his affidavit that he had been in private practice in Helena, Montana since 1979 and that he had taken numerous civil rights cases. Mr. Reynolds stated that his firm charged $70 an hour in order to maintain their availability to persons of low and moderate income. He stated that based on his knowledge this rate was at least $25 per hour lower than other firms having similar experience, visibility and success. He further stated that a \u201cfair and reasonable fee for services rendered, in civil rights cases, by an experienced civil rights attorney with approximately ten to fifteen years experience in Montana is in the range of $100 to $125 an hour, not including enhancements\u201d for the contingent nature of such fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. The Hospital claims that the Patients did not properly raise this issue below. However, we note that the Patients moved for attorney fees incurred on appeal, the Hospital opposed that motion, and the District Court reached a decision on that motion in favor of the Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
