We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b62 The sole issue raised by FMDH on appeal is whether \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA (1997), violates the Montana Constitution by denying parties equal access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b63 This appeal has its genesis in a wrongful discharge action by Haider against FMDH, her former employer. During negotiations, an offer to arbitrate was made by Haider. Upon FMDH\u2019s refusal to arbitrate, the matter was tried before a jury in the District Court. The jury awarded Haider a judgment in the amount of $44,995.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b64 After a subsequent evidentiary hearing, the District Court determined that Haider was the prevailing party and, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA (1997), awarded her $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. Under that statute, a party who makes a valid offer to arbitrate that is not accepted by the other party and who prevails in a subsequent judicial action is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as an element of costs. \u00b65 FMDH filed a notice of appeal on May 10,1999, seeking to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA (1997). On August 5, 1999, FMDH filed its Notice of challenge to the constitutionality of the statute pursuant to Rule 38, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u00b66 Is \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA (1997), unconstitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">\u00b67 Rule 38, M.R.App.P, procedurally governs cases involving constitutional questions where the state is not a party. The newly amended version of the rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">It shall be the duty of a party who challenges the constitutionality of any act of the Montana legislature in any action, suit or proceeding in the supreme court to which neither the state nor any agency or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is a party, to give notice to the supreme court and to the Montana attorney general of the existence of the constitutional issue. <em>This notice </em>shall be in writing, shall specify the section of the code or chapter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the session law to be construed and <em>shall be given contemporaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal or with the filing of an original proceeding in the supreme court. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">Rule 38, M.R.App.P. (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b68 FMDH filed its notice of appeal on May 10,1999, but did not file its notice challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA (1997), until August 5, 1999. Haider contends that since FMDH failed to timely comply with the \u201ccontemporaneous notice\u201d requirement of Rule 38, M.R.App.P., its constitutional challenge is not properly before this Court. We agree. By failing to \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d file its notice of appeal with its notice of the constitutional challenge to \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA (1997), FMDH failed to procedurally comply with an essential condition precedent to perfecting its appeal. Rule 38, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b69 However, FMDH points out that Rule 38, M.R.App.P., was amended by order of this Court on September 9,1997. The effective date for the amendment was October 1,1997. FMDH further points out that the amended rule was not published in the 1997 version of the Montana Code Annotated, upon which FMDH\u2019s counsel relied in preparing this appeal. Thus, FMDH claims that there is an equitable ground for excusing its noncompliance with the newly amended version of Rule 38, M.R.App.R</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b610 FMDH\u2019s equitable argument might be well taken had it, in fact, complied with the prior version of Rule 38, M.R.App.R, upon which it claims to have relied in perfecting this appeal. The prior version of Rule 38, M.R.App.P., was effective through September 30,1997, and provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">It shall be the duty of counsel who challenges the constitutionality of any act of the Montana legislature in any suit or proceeding in the supreme court to which the state of Montana, or any agency thereof, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is not a party, <em>upon the filing of the record to give immediate notice </em>in writing to the court of the existence of said question, specifying the section of the code or the chapter of the session law to be construed. The clerk shall thereupon certify such fact to the attorney general of the state of Montana. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Rule 38, M.R.App.P. (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b611 Thus, the old version of the rule required notice to be filed \u201cimmediately\u201d upon filing of the record on appeal. As Haider indicates, this Court\u2019s case law arising under the old version of Rule 38, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>M.R.App.P., strictly construed the \u201cimmediate notice\u201d requirement. For example, in <em>In re Adoption of C.J.H. </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 52, 803 P.2d 214, we held that a \u201cdelay of twenty days\u201d between the filing of the record and the filing of the notice of constitutional challenge did \u201cnot constitute \u2018immediate\u2019 notice\u201d under the prior version of Rule 38, M.R.App.P. <em>Adoption of C.J.H., </em>246 Mont. at 56, 803 P.2d at 216. Since the immediate notice requirement under the old rule was \u201cmandatory,\u201d a failure to timely notify the attorney general precluded this Court from ruling upon the constitutional issue raised on appeal. <em>See Billings Deaconess Hosp., Inc. v. Angel </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 490, 494-95, 712 P.2d 1323, 1326-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b612  The register of action for this appeal reflects that the District Court record was filed on June 16,1999. However, FMDH\u2019s notice challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA (1997), was not filed until August 5, 1999, nearly two months later. Clearly, FMDH failed to comply with the \u201cimmediate notice\u201d requirement of the prior version of Rule 38, M.R.App.P. Nor, as already noted, has FMDH complied with the \u201ccontemporaneous notice\u201d requirement of the new version of Rule 38, M.R.App.P. We hold that FMDH\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 38, M.R.App.P., precludes this Court from reaching the constitutional challenge. Since FMDH raises only a constitutional challenge before this Court, its appeal is therefore dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b226-8\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AVq\">specially concurs:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b614 I concur in our opinion except as to the Court\u2019s statement in \u00b6 10 that \u201cFMDH\u2019s equitable argument might be well taken had it, in fact, complied with the prior version of Rule 38 ...\u201d Even had FMDH complied with the prior version of Rule 38, this would not, in my opinion, have justified its failure to comply with the version of Rule 38 that had been in effect for some 20 months before it filed its notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">\u00b615 FMDH appears to argue that, until a rule change (and, presumably, any newly adopted rule) is actually published in the Montana Code Annotated, litigants and their attorneys are absolved from complying with the amended rule or new rule. In point of fact, in its reply brief FMDH states that \u201cAppellant should not be penalized for failure to comply with a new rule which was not timely published and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>which attorneys in remote eastern Montana have little access or notice.\u201d This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">\u00b6 16 In the first place, FMDH fails to cite any authority for the proposition that amendments to rules of procedure or new rules are not effective until published in the Montana Code Annotated. <em>See </em>Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P; <em>Johansen v. State, Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 39, \u00b6 24, 955 P.2d 653, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b617 More to the point, however, this Court does not adopt amendments to rules of procedure or new rules of procedure absent adequate notification to the practicing bar prior to the effective date of the amendment or new rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b618 Copies of our September 9,1997 order adopting the amendment to Rule 38, M.R.App.P., (along with an amendment to Rule 24(c), M.R.Civ.P. and a new rule, Rule 24(d), M.R.Civ.P), were sent to, among other persons and officials, each of the Clerks of the District Court; to the Executive Director of the State Bar for publication in <em>The Montana Lawyer-, </em>to West Publishing Company (now West Group) for publication in the <em>Pacific Reporter </em>advance sheets; and to the State Reporter Publishing Company for publication in the <em>State Reporter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b619 Asa result of this dissemination our order was duly published in the October 1997 issue of <em>The Montana Lawyer, </em>Volume 23, No. 2, at 18; in the <em>Pacific Reporter </em>advance sheets, 943 P.2d No. 3, at CXL, Oct. 17, 1997; and in the <em>State Reporter </em>at 54 St.Rep. 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b620 Every active member of the State Bar of Montana \u2014 including those in \u201cremote eastern Montana\u201d \u2014 receives <em>The Montana Lawyer, </em>and, presumably, every practicing lawyer has access to the orders of this Court received by the District Court Clerks and published in the <em>Pacific Reporter </em>advance sheets and <em>State Reporter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b621 Failure to regularly check the very sources where rule amendments and new rules are sent and are published is the fault of no one except the attorney who does not keep current with his or her reading. Under these circumstances, counsel\u2019s claim of lack of notice and FMDH\u2019s appeal to equity rings particularly hollow.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\u00b622 With the exception noted, I otherwise concur in our opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"AkZ\">JUSTICE GRAY concurs in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
