On appeal Dunnette contends that the District Court violated the double jeopardy clause of the Montana Constitution when it sentenced him to ten years for the offense of criminal endangerment, a felony, \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, and to an additional two years under the weapons enhancement statute, \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, for the use of a weapon in committing the underlying offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\u00b62 On September 10,1998, the State charged Dunnette, by information, with the charge of criminal endangerment, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA. Dunnette pleaded not guilty and, following a jury trial on March 8 and 9,1999, the jury found Dunnette guilty of the offense of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">\u00b63 The court sentenced Dunnette on May 7,1999, to ten years in the Montana State Prison with eight years suspended, upon various conditions. The court also sentenced Dunnette to two years in the Montana State Prison with none suspended pursuant to the weapons enhancement statute, \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, for use of a weapon during the commission of the offense. This additional sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the sentence on the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">\u00b64 Dunnette\u2019s conviction arose out of an incident on July 14,1998, in Gallatin County. Basically, Thomas and Susan Wade (the Wades) were traveling northbound on their motorcycle on U.S. Highway 191. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The Wades had to stop for construction and were behind various motor vehicles, including Dunnette\u2019s. A flag person at the scene directed the Wades to drive to the head of the line. This apparently angered Dunnette and when the Wades and Dunnette finally cleared the construction zone Dunnette began following the Wades very closely in a confrontational manner. Dunnette gave the Wades \u201cthe finger.\u201d The Wades were stopped by another construction flag person and Dunnette pulled up behind them extremely close.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b65 When the Wades and Dunnette again cleared the construction area, Dunnette followed them very close. Dunnette passed the Wades and again gave them the finger. The Wades returned the gesture and motioned Dunnette to pull off the road. Dunnette pulled in front of the Wades with barely enough clearance, again gave the Wades the finger, and then stuck his hand out the window and shot pepper spray toward the Wades. The pepper spray struck the windshield of the Wades\u2019 motorcycle and hit both of the Wades in the face. The Wades\u2019 eyes began to burn and water. Susan began to cough, gasp for air, and felt nauseous.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b66 The Wades were able to accelerate, however, and obtain the license plate number of Dunnette\u2019s vehicle. After the Wades notified the authorities, Dunnette was ultimately stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b67 Did the District Court violate the double jeopardy provisions of the Montana Constitution when it sentenced Dunnette for the offense of criminal endangerment and then enhanced his sentence under the weapons enhancement statute for the use of a weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b68 This Court reviews a criminal sentence only for legality (i.e., whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by the statute). <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b69 Citing our decision in <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312, Dunnette argues that in imposing the weapons enhancement, the District Court punished him twice for the act charged in the Information. Dunnette reasons that the Information stated that he committed the offense of criminal endangerment when he engaged in aggressive tactics toward the Wades while driving his pickup on U.S. Highway 191 in Gallatin County, in that he followed the Wades too closely in his truck, that he used his vehicle to cut in front of the Wades too closely, and that he shot them with pepper spray. Dunnette thus concludes that it was impossible for him to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>mit the offense as charged without using the weapons \u2014 either his vehicle or the pepper spray. He concludes that the \u201cunderlying offense\u201d required proof of the use of a weapon and that the enhancement of his sentence, therefore, violated the double jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b610 We recently addressed this same argument in <em>State v. Keith, </em>2000 MT 23, [298 Mont. 165], 995 P.2d 966. In that case, Keith was convicted of felony criminal endangerment under circumstances that involved her firing a handgun inside an apartment. The fourth shot fired by Keith went through a desk and into a wall of the adjoining apartment. <em>Keith, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b611 Keith advanced the same argument as Dunnette. Citing <em>Guillaume, </em>Keith contended that since her conviction for criminal endangerment was based on her conduct of firing a gun, she should not have been given an additional sentence for the use of that gun because that would require punishing her twice for the same offense. <em>Keith, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b612 We rejected Keith\u2019s argument citing our decision in <em>Guillaume. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">This Court agreed with Guillaume and held that the application of the weapon enhancement statute to felony convictions where the underlying offense requires proof of use of a weapon violates the double jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 16. We further explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMg\">The only factor raising Guillaume\u2019s charge from misdemeanor assault to felony assault was his use of a weapon. We interpret this distinction between the two offenses, and the different penalties imposed by each offense, as the legislature\u2019s way of punishing a criminal defendant for use of a weapon in committing an assault. Thus, when the weapon enhancement statute was applied to Guillaume\u2019s felony assault conviction, Guillaume was subjected to double punishment for use of a weapon: once when the charge was elevated from misdemeanor assault to felony assault, and again when the weapon enhancement statute was applied. We agree with Guillaume that this form of double punishment is exactly what double jeopardy was intended to prohibit. <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-9\"><em>Keith, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u00b613  The offense of criminal endangerment is committed when a person knowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another. Section 45-5-207(1), MCA. We held in <em>Keith </em>that the statute defining criminal endangerment does not require proof of the use of a weapon, nor did the use of a weapon raise Keith\u2019s crime from a misdemeanor to a felony as in <em>Guillaume. Keith, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b614 The same result obtains in the case at bar. Dunnette was convicted of criminal endangerment. The statute defining this offense does not require proof of the use of a weapon, nor did the use of a weapon raise Dunnette\u2019s crime from a misdemeanor to a felony as in <em>Guillaume. </em>Moreover, as we stated in <em>Keith, </em>if we were to accept Dunnette\u2019s argument, there would be a double jeopardy violation every time a court applied the weapons enhancement statute to a felony offense. <em>Keith, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b615  The fact that Dunnette used the weapon when he committed the offense of criminal endangerment and was thus sentenced to an additional term under the weapons enhancement statute did not result in multiple punishments for the same offense because the offense of criminal endangerment, by its own terms, does not specifically increase a defendant\u2019s punishment for the use of a weapon. <em>Keith, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"AlT\">\u00b616  Accordingly, as we did in <em>Keith, </em>we hold that the application of the weapons enhancement statute to Dunnette\u2019s conviction for criminal endangerment did not subject Dunnette to double punishments in violation of the double jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
