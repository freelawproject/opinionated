Merritt, George H. Tilton and Robert A. Hollister, composing the firm of William J. Merritt &amp; Co., as contractors, and the Seventy-third Street Building Company and Franklin E. Robinson, as owners of forty-one houses on Seventy-third street and West End avenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-11\">The Seventy-third Street Building Company applied to this court for leave to file a bond of $3,500 executed by William J. Merritt, as principal, and Franklin E. Robinson and Albert E. Scott as sureties in discharge of said lien. The bond was at first drawn in the form : \u201cThat, we, William J. Merritt, of the city of New York, in the county and state of New York, as principal, and,\u201d but. afterwards was amended, by leave and order of the court, so as to read: \u201c That we, William J. Merritt, of the city of New York, in the county and state of New York (successor to the late firm of William J. Merritt &amp; Co.), and,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-12\">The plaintiffs made objections to the said bond, but the-court at special term ordered that the bond, as amended, be deemed sufficient as to form and as to the parties, executing it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-13\"><em>Alan D.

The statute requires the bond to be .conditioned for the payment \u2022of any judgment which may be rendered against the property. The bond reads: \u201cNow the condition of this obligation is such that if the said William J. Merritt, his heirs or legal representatives, shall pay any judgment that may be rendered against said property in any proceeding to enforce the foregoing lien,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-10\"><em>A.

The first is whether any party interested in discharging a mechanics\u2019 lien may become the principal of a bond given for that purpose, or whether the owner of the property must in all cases, unite in the bond as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">This depends upon the construction to be given to the sixth subdivision of section 24, Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, 1885, which is as follows: \u201cBy the owner of the premises, person or persons, firm or firms, corporations or associations against whom or which the notice of lien is filed, executing' with two or more sufficient sureties, a bond to the clerk,\u201d etc. The appellant contends that after the word \u201c premises,\u201d we should insert the conjunction \u201cand\u201d before \u201c person.\u2019 This would render it necessary that the owner of the premises should, in all cases be a principal in the bond. I think this was not the intention of the legislature. The grammatical construction of the sentence does not warrant our inserting this word. A comma is placed after the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201c premises,\u201d and another after the word \u201c filed,\u201d and under the well known rules of construction, to ascertain the meaning, we may eliminate what is between those commas, and read it as though there were no intermediate words. Doing this, we find that the lien, may be discharged \u201c by the owner of the premises * * * executing with two or more suf'ficient sureties, * * * a bond to the clerk,\u201d etc. So it is apparent that the other persons interested in discharging the lien by a bond, need not unite with him. But if that is so, it follows, as a matter of course, that the other \u201cperson or persons,\u201d etc., interested in the removing of the lien, may do so by themselves becoming principals, with\u00f3ut the owner-uniting with them. This view is sustained by the fifth subdivision of the same section, which says that the lien maybe discharged by \u201cthe owner of the property\u201d * * * affected by any notice of lien filed under this act or the \u201cperson or persons,\u201d etc., \u201c may, at anytime after the filing of the_ notice, serve a notice,\u201d etc. \u2019 Here the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d is actually inserted. It was doubtless the intention of the legislature to give the same opportunity to either the owner or contractor in the sixth subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">This view is further sustained by the third subdivision of the same section, in regard to discharging a lien by making a deposit, and under that subdivision it has been held that where the deposit has been made by the contractor, the lien must be discharged as to the owner. <em>Schaettler </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>4 Daly, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In no case, if the owner complies in all respects with the terms of his agreement with the contractor, is either he -or his land liable to the payment of mechanics\u2019 liens, and, therefore, it is only reasonable to suppose that the legislature did not intend to require him to make himself liable-beyond the clear intent of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The second question arises under the following facts: The contractors for the work under which the plaintiff claims a lien, were William J. Merritt &amp; Co., composed of William J. Merritt, Robert A. Hollister and George H. Tilton. Before the filing of the bond, Hollister and Tilton, had withdrawn from the firm, and Merritt became its successor. He alone executed the bond as principal, describing himself as \u201csuccessor to the late firm of William J. Merritt &amp; Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The appellant contends that Hollister and Tilton should both have united in the execution of the bond. However-this might have been, had the firm been composed of the-same persons at the time of giving the bond, I do not think it was necessary for the persons who had withdrawn from , the firm to unite with Merritt in the bond at the time it was-given. He then was the sole party in interest as far as the contract was concerned, or the moneys due under it. As-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>successor to the firm, he could bind the firmfin all respects, by his acts; his release of a firm debt would have been good; any act done by him to collect a firm debt would, have been binding upon the other members of the firm. And, besides, the discharge of the lien by the giving of the _ bond does not relieve either Hollister or Tilton from any ' money judgment that may eventually be recovered against-the original contractors. The persons who did not unite in the bond will be as much bound by that judgment as Merritt is himself, and they are just as much security for the money judgment now as they would have been had they united in the giving of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">I think, therefore, this point is not well taken, and that the orders should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
