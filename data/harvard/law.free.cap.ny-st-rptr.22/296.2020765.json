Beach, was a stockholder owning twenty-five shares of its stock of the par value of $100 per share, which was not fully paid for; that the plaintiff is a judgment creditor of the said corporation, which is indebted to her in the sum of $145.04 for services rendered by plaintiff to said'corporation as a ballet dancer in its business as an opera company; that said services were rendered as a laborer and servant by a female employee thereof whereby \u25a0* * * any stockholder is personally liable therefor under the general act of 1848, and also under section 37 of chapter 611 of the Laws of 1875, to an amount equal to the par value of his stock until the full capital is paid in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-14\">To this complaint the defendant demurred on the ground \u201cthat the same does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-15\">Tlie city court sustained the demurrer and awarded judgment in favor of the defendant for the costs, rendering the following opinion:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Me Ad am, Ch. J.\u2014\u201cThe facts of this case are almost similar to those in <em>Bichar\u00e1s </em>v. <em>Coe. </em>except that the plaintiff in the present action declares upon a judgment against the corporation, but the complaint fails to allege that am execution has been duly issued thereon and returned unsatisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">\u201c This omission is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action for the reasons assigned in the <em>Coe Case.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">\u201cThere is no provision in the act of 1875, chapter 611,. making a stockholder liable for debts due to laborers, servants or apprentices, for services performed to the corporation, and the allegations of the complaint attempting to bring the plaintiff\u2019s claim within the category merit no comment, and may be regarded as surplusage. The provisions of the manufacturing act of 1848 (chap. 40, \u00a7 18), which the pleader evidently had in mind, because they refer to these subjects, do not in any manner affect corporations created under the act of 1875, but even under these-provisions of the manufacturing act of 1848, the stockholder cannot be sued until the legal remedies of the creditor have been exhausted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">\u201cThe demurrer to the complaint must, therefore, be sustained, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">The plaintiff then appealed to the general term of the city court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court, from, which the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">This appeal presents the single question whether a credit- or\u2019s action against a stockholder, to enforce the <em>statutory liability </em>imposed by section 37 of chapter 611 of the Laws of 1875, can be brought without alleging the return of an execution against the company unsatisfied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-10\">' <em>William W.

If either of them has violated the injunction by bringing on the argument of the appeal, he is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">Since the first argument of this case the court of appeals have decided the matter in controversy in <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Coe </em>(110 N. Y., 109; 16 N. Y. State Rep., 866) adversely to the respondent, and the judgment must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">But as this decision is made after the appeal had been taken from the city court, we think the respondent should; have liberty to answer over, on payment of the costs <em>.of </em>the appeal to this court only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
