Three aspects of these documents are particularly confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">First, it is unclear whether the commission also found claimant able to return to his former position of employment. While the commission\u2019s order specified that maximum medical improvement had occurred, it also noted that claimant\u2019s disability was \u201cnot \u2018total.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Second, the record is insufficient to enable us to determine whether Dr. Fallon\u2019s recommended lifting restriction was consistent with claimant\u2019s former duties so as to permit him to return to work. If an ability to work was not a secondary basis for the commission\u2019s denial of compensation, the commission\u2019s order, as it reads, does not allow us to eliminate this consideration as immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Finally, Dr. Fallon\u2019s indication that claimant is \u201cNot TT,\u201d coupled with a lack of explanation for that statement, renders the statement ambiguous. As we recognized in <em>State ex rel. Pleban v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 406, 678 N.E.2d 562, the phrase \u201cnot at TT,\u201d standing alone, can denote either an ability to work or maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Accordingly, we vacate the commission\u2019s order and return the cause to it for further consideration and amended order, and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-13\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and F.E.

I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals because \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the finding that Mr. Hall\u2019s allowed condition has become permanent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-16\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
