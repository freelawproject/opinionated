Absent from this list is evidence from the commission\u2019s rehabilitation division, which includes reports from Drs. Tecklenburg and Bensonhaver. This omission implies that the commission did not examine this evidence. <em>State ex rel. Fultz v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 327, 631 N.E.2d 1057. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The commission does not dispute this conclusion, arguing instead that its failure is excused by what it considers to be the nonprobative character of this evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Contrary to the commission\u2019s representation, the rehabilitation evidence is very relevant to the present inquiry. Both Drs. Tecklenburg and Bensonhaver state that claimant\u2019s allowed psychiatric condition produces symptoms that negatively affect claimant\u2019s ability to work or retrain \u2014 key factors in a permanent total disability determination. The commission was, therefore, required to include this evidence in its deliberations and cannot attempt to excuse its failure to do so by belatedly citing perceived deficiencies that were never mentioned in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, the commission\u2019s order is vacated, and the cause is returned to it for further consideration and amended order consistent with our decision in <em>Fultz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b680-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
