On June 6, 1990, Kathy Thompson filed a bankruptcy petition and consequently her interest in her personal injury claim was limited to her claimed exemption. Despite the limitation on Kathy Thompson\u2019s recovery and despite the fact that the Thompsons failed to advance the requested costs and expenses, once having filed the case, respondent should not have taken unilateral action to dismiss it. Instead, respondent should have asked the trial court for permission to withdraw as counsel. We therefore adopt the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the board, and respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
