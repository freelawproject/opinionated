The panel had the opportunity to view the demeanor and sincerity of the applicant and to examine extensively those who were monitoring his progress. The panel was in a better position than we to determine whether and when the applicant should be permitted to sit for the bar examination. I would adopt the recommendation of the board and allow applicant after further evaluation and investigation to apply to sit for the February 1998 bar examination.</p>\n<judges id=\"b249-10\">F.E.
