Subject-matter jurisdiction may not be waived or bestowed upon a court by the parties to the case. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 40, 46, 652 N.E.2d 196, 200. It may be raised <em>sua sponte </em>by an appellate court. <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 82, 84, 661 N.E.2d 728, 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Appeals as a matter of right may be taken to the Supreme Court in cases originating in courts of appeals, including actions involving extraordinary writs. Section 2(B)(2)(a)\u00ae, Article IV, Ohio Constitution. R.C. 2505.03 limits the appellate jurisdiction of any court, including the Supreme Court, to the review of final orders, judgments, or decrees. <em>Wright, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 84, 661 N.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>731. R.C. 2505.02 defines a \u201cfinal order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial\u201d as \u201c[a]n order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial * *</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The two categories of final orders that might apply to the court of appeals\u2019 order are (1) orders that affect a substantial right in an action which in effect determine the action and prevent a judgment, and (2) orders that affect a substantial right made in a special proceeding. R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Both of these categories require that the order affect a substantial right in order to be final and appealable. A \u201csubstantial right\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2505.02 is a legal right enforced and protected by law. <em>State ex rel. Hughes v. Celeste </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 429, 430, 619 N.E.2d 412, 414; <em>Noble v. Colwell </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 540 N.E.2d 1381, 1383. Here, the court of appeals\u2019 order granting extraordinary relief in mandamus affects substantial rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The court of appeals\u2019 order was not made in a special proceeding, as required by the second category of final orders under R.C. 2505.02. Orders that are entered in actions that were recognized at common law or equity and were not specially created by statute are not orders entered in special proceedings pursuant to R.C. 2505.02. <em>Polikoff v. Adam </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 100, 616 N.E.2d 213, syllabus, overruling <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 253, 21 O.O.3d 158, 423 N.E.2d 452. Since both class action suits and complaints for writs of mandamus were recognized at common law, orders entered in either action are not made in a special proceeding under R.C. 2505.02. See, <em>e.g., Blumenthal v. Medina Supply Co. </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 473, 475, 654 N.E.2d 368, 369, citing <em>Hansberry v. Lee </em>(1940), 311 U.S. 32, 61 S.Ct. 115, 85 L.Ed. 22 (\u201cClass action suits were known at common law.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Moyer v. Baldwin </em>(1908), 77 Ohio St. 532, 538, 83 N.E. 907, 908 (\u201cThe jurisdiction in mandamus that is conferred by the [Ohio] Constitution is the common-law jurisdiction as it then was exercised in this state * * *.\u201d); <em>Shoff v. Shoff </em>(July 27, 1995), Franklin App. No. 95APF01-8, unreported, 1995 WL 450249.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Therefore, the dispositive jurisdictional issue is whether the court of appeals\u2019 entry determined the action and prevented a judgment, as required by the first category of R.C. 2505.02 final orders. The court of appeals ruled that CMHA was hable for prior service vacation credit, including back vacation time from the date the mandamus action was filed, but did not specify an amount of damages. Instead, the court of appeals provided a procedure to implement its order: notification of individual class members, application by class members to verify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and establish prior qualifying service with appropriate documentation and vacation policies provided by CMHA, and resolution of disputes between any individual class member and CMHA by a court-appointed commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Generally, orders determining liability in the plaintiffs\u2019 or relators\u2019 favor and deferring the issue of damages are not final\u2019appealable orders under R.C. 2505.02 because they do not determine the action or prevent a judgment. <em>State ex rel A &amp; D Ltd. Partnership v. Keefe </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 50, 53, 671 N.E.2d 13, 15-16; see, also, <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos. v. BPS Co. </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App.3d 3, 4 OBR 23, 446 N.E.2d 181. This general rule is similar to that applied in federal cases to determine whether an order entered by a federal court is final and appealable under Section 1291, Title 28, U.S.Code. See, <em>e.g., Parks v. Pavkovie </em>(C.A.7, 1985), 753 F.2d 1397.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Courts have recognized an exception to the foregoing general rule. Under this exception, a judgment not completely determining damages is a final appealable order where the computation of damages is mechanical and unlikely to produce a second appeal because only a ministerial task similar to assessing costs remains. See, <em>e.g., Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 472, 479-480, 100 S.Ct. 745, 750, 62 L.Ed.2d 676, 682-683, fn. 5; <em>McMunn v. Hertz Equip. Rental Corp. v. Eichleay Corp. </em>(C.A.7, 1986), 791 F.2d 88, 90; <em>U.S.A. v. Brook Contracting Corp. </em>(C.A.3, 1985), 759 F.2d 320, 323; <em>Pledger v. Bosnick </em>(1991), 306 Ark. 45, 811 S.W.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">This exception is inapplicable here. For example, in <em>Boeing, </em>444 U.S. at 476, 100 S.Ct. at 748, 62 L.Ed.2d at 680, fn. 1, the federal district court entered judgment in favor of the certified class for the principal sum of $3,289,359 plus statutory interest. Although the amount due the individual class members had not been ascertained, \u201c[n]othing in the court\u2019s order made Boeing\u2019s liability for this amount contingent upon the presentation of individual claims.\u201d <em>Id., </em>444 U.S. at 480, 100 S.Ct. at 750, 62 L.Ed.2d at 682, fn. 5. The Supreme Court of the United States determined that the judgment awarding the class a fixed recovery was final and appealable. <em>Id., </em>444 U.S. at 480, 100 S.Ct. at 750, 62 L.Ed.2d at 683, fn. 5. In contrast, the entry here did not fix CMHA\u2019s total liability to the certified class.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Similarly, unlike other cases applying the exception, it is not evident that only a ministerial task similar to executing a judgment or assessing costs remains for the court of appeals. See <em>Parks, McMunn, </em>and <em>Pledger. </em>In fact, the court of appeals\u2019 entry envisions the possibility of disputes concerning alleged class members\u2019 individual claims by providing a dispute resolution procedure and appointing a commissioner. Subsequent appeals from orders resolving these disputes are not necessarily unlikely. Further, the court of appeals has not yet considered evidence regarding CMHA\u2019s vacation policies. See <em>State ex rel. N. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Olmsted, Fire Fighters Assn. v. N. Olmsted </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 530, 534-535, 597 N.E.2d 136, 140 (Court of appeals erred in not evaluating employee\u2019s prior state service under city\u2019s vacation accrual policy to determine whether prior state service satisfied policy\u2019s conditions for vacation eligibility.).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals\u2019 entry issuing a writ of mandamus neither determined the action nor prevented a judgment. The entry consequently is not a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02, and we lack the requisite jurisdiction to consider the merits of this appeal and cross-appeal. Accordingly, the appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">\n<em>Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b743-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
