(2) Does the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis satisfy the mandates of <em>Noll? </em>and (3) Did the court below err in returning the cause for consideration of claimant\u2019s memory loss? For the following reasons, we answer each question affirmatively. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Claimant does not \u2014 and cannot credibly \u2014 dispute his medical ability to do sedentary work. The commission relied on Drs. Hoover, McCloud, and Dillahunt, all of whom certified a capacity for such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">The commission\u2019s order also satisfies <em>Noll. </em>Claimant\u2019s high school education and specialized electronics training present a favorable nonmedical profile. These two factors prompted the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant had \u201cthe intellectual capacity and sufficient qualifications for successful training and eventual employment in the sedentary workforce.\u201d This is a reasonable conclusion; it is not an abuse of discretion and meets the <em>Noll </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">As another <em>Noll </em>flaw, claimant assails the commission\u2019s cursory mention of his age. While the commission did not \u201cdiscuss\u201d this factor, that flaw, in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>instance, should not be deemed fatal. Claimant was fifty-seven when permanent total disability compensation was denied. While not a vocational asset, claimant\u2019s age is also not an insurmountable barrier to re-employment. If claimant\u2019s other vocational factors were all negative, further consideration of his age would be appropriate, since age could be outcome-determinative \u2014 the last straw that could compel a different result. All of claimant\u2019s other vocational factors are, however, positive. A claimant may not be granted permanent total disability compensation due solely to his age. Therefore, even in the absence of detailed discussion on the effects of claimant\u2019s age, the commission\u2019s explanation satisfies <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Although the court of appeals\u2019 opinion seems to correspond with the above analysis, the court returned the case, citing the commission\u2019s failure to discuss claimant\u2019s alleged memory loss. This decision is erroneous and is reversed for the following reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Dr. Dillahunt was a reviewing physician, not an examining physician, and a nonexamining physician must accept the findings of those who personally examined the claimant. <em>State ex rel. Wallace v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 55, 59, 11 O.O.3d 216, 219, 386 N.E.2d 1109, 1112; <em>State ex rel. Hughes v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 71, 73-74, 26 OBR 61, 63, 498 N.E.2d 459, 461-162. Our review of the record reveals that no examining physician found claimant to have any memory loss. In fact, Dr. Dillahunt expressly accepted the factual findings of examining physicians Drs. DeRosa and Hoover, both of whom found claimant\u2019s memory and recall to be adequate. This inconsistency affects the credibility of the various reports. Since the commission weighs and evaluates the evidence, <em>State ex rel. Teece v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 165, 169, 22 O.O.3d 400, 403, 429 N.E.2d 433, 436, a reviewing court may not disturb the commission\u2019s decision either to disregard Dr. Dillahunt\u2019s unfounded statement or to credit instead the findings of Drs. DeRosa and Hoover. Dr. Dillahunt\u2019s opinion regarding memory loss constitutes a rejection of the essentially contrary findings of claimant\u2019s examiners, which disqualifies the opinion from evidentiary consideration. It cannot, therefore, be a basis for return.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the commission\u2019s decision denying permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-9\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b666-10\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
