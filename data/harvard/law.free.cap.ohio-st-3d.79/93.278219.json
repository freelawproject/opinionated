Sterner </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 164, 167, 672 N.E.2d 633, 635, and cases cited therein. However, in imposing a sanction, we consider not only the duty violated, but also the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the actual injury caused, and whether mitigating factors exist. In this case, we note respondent\u2019s personal and emotional problems that existed at the time of these infractions and the steps respondent has since taken to recover from her involvement with alcohol and drugs. We also note that respondent began a timely, good-faith effort to make restitution before disciplinary proceedings were commenced. Therefore, we agree with the board\u2019s recommendation and order that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for two years.

I would suspend the respondent indefinitely. The lengthy course of her disciplinary violation, her criminal convictions, and her abuse of cocaine deserve a longer suspension and proof of long-term rehabilitation before readmittance to the bar is merited.
