Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245? and (2) Is Jackson eligible for PTD under <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666? For the reasons that follow, we hold that the commission failed to sufficiently explain how Jackson\u2019s age and prior work experience combined with his education to permit employment, but that Jackson has not established his permanent and total disability. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment as to the commission\u2019s compliance with <em>Noll, </em>but we reject Jackson\u2019s claim for relief under <em>Gay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><em>Noll </em>Compliance</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">If the commission fails to cite evidence of record showing that a claimant\u2019s permanent medical impairment is only partial, <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, or to adequately explain how the claimant\u2019s nonmedical characteristics, including age, education, experience, etc., combine with the impairment to permit sustained remunerative employment, <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946; <em>Noll, supra, </em>its order denying PTD is an abuse of discretion, and a writ of mandamus must issue to correct the abuse. <em>Gay, supra; State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 658 N.E.2d 1055. But the commission is also the exclusive evaluator of evidentiary weight and disability. Thus, when some evidence for the commission\u2019s decision exists, the decision must be upheld even if contradicted by other evidence a reviewing court considers more persuasive. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 658 N.E.2d at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The court of appeals correctly found some evidence for the commission\u2019s finding that Jackson was only partially impaired due to his allowed conditions and still physically able to work with restrictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While Jackson relies on his physician\u2019s and vocational expert\u2019s reports, Dr. Jerry McCloud reported in June 1993 that Jackson was permanently but not totally impaired based on his two allowed conditions and able to work with restrictions:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cIt is my opinion that the medical evidence would indicate that the claimant is capable of work activities. He is not capable of his 1990 employment. The changes are permanent and he has reached a level of maximum medical improvement and in [the second claim] demonstrates a permanent partial impairment of 45% related to the loss of active lumbar and cervical reserve and those changes in his left shoulder. This estimation is compatible with recommendations made in the Third Edition of the AMA Guidelines on Physical Impairment. There is 0% impairment in [the first claim]. Future requests for ongoing conservative treatment or other forms of conservative measures should not be approved as they will not be of lasting benefit to the claimant. He does have soft tissue injuries which are approaching three years of age and these will not respond in a positive fashion to ongoing or persistent conservative treatments nor significantly alter his future clinical prospects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">With respect to the commission\u2019s explanation of how Jackson\u2019s nonmedical characteristics did not foreclose employment, the court of appeals\u2019 referee found:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u201c[T]he commission stated that it considered claimant\u2019s age of fifty-seven, G.E.D., and work experience as a construction laborer and concluded that those factors, particularly the G.E.D., combined with the physical ability to perform some work within certain restrictions, do not prevent relator from performing sustained remunerative employment. The commission\u2019s explanation, although brief, suggests that the commission considered relator\u2019s age and education to be assets to reemployment, thereby providing adequate reasoning for the decision. See <em>State ex rel. Murray v. Mosler Safe Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 330 [617 N.E.2d 1118].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Adopting this finding, the court of appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\u201cAlthough the commission\u2019s explanation of its reasoning is indeed brief, it is clear that the commission considered relator\u2019s \u2018relatively high level of education\u2019 as a dispositive factor in determining relator\u2019s employability within the restrictions listed by Dr[.] McCloud * * *. While a more detailed explanation of the commission\u2019s reasoning would be preferable, we are not prepared to say that the explanation is too brief to meet the requirements of <em>Noll, supra. </em>Moreover, this court is not at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the commission simply because it may disagree on the impact of relator\u2019s nonmedical disability factors. <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. McGraw Edison Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 92 [609 N.E.2d 164], Accordingly, relator\u2019s objection is overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Jackson complains that the commission merely reported his age and work history without meaningful discussion. He cites <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 458, 619 N.E.2d 1018, 1022, which recognized that \u201c[s]pecific recitation [of nonmedical factors], without more, is only slightly better than that the old boilerplate language assailed in <em>Noll.\u201d </em>Absent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>requisite explanation, \u201c[t]hese factors are susceptible [of] both positive or negative interpretations depending on the reviewer, and, therefore, mere recitation gives no insight into the commission\u2019s reasoning.\u201d <em>Id. Waddle </em>thus directed the commission to specify in its orders whether nonmedical factors were considered an asset or detriment to employment and warned that noncomplying orders would result in a writ requiring an adequate explanation. Thus, in <em>State ex rel. Pierce v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 673 N.E.2d 1304, 1306, we rejected as insufficient a commission order denying PTD because it (1) merely acknowledged a claimant\u2019s age (sixty-two) and education (tenth grade with G.E.D.) and (2) failed to specify what marketable skills a former ironworker had or could develop to obtain sedentary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The commission does not defend its silence on the marketability of any skills or abilities generated by Jackson\u2019s prior work experience, but it insists that it treated Jackson\u2019s age as an employment asset and observed that he had \u201clast worked less than [three] years ago.\u201d The commission may have inferred from Jackson\u2019s recent employment that age was not an appreciable barrier for him in the job market, but this is pure speculation. <em>Waddle </em>disapproved of orders requiring such conjecture, admonishing the commission to \u201csay so\u201d if it views one or more nonmedical factors as employment assets. <em>Id., </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 458, 619 N.E.2d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The court of appeals concluded that the commission considered Jackson\u2019s G.E.D. dispositive on the issue of his ability to be rehired. <em>Waddle </em>and <em>Pierce, </em>however, hold that the commission must do more \u2014 it must also specify the extent to which age and employment history may impede or promote a claimant\u2019s reemployment prospects. Thus, contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 judgment, the commission\u2019s order in this case is too cursory to withstand scrutiny under <em>Noll, supra. State ex rel. Bruner v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 243, 245, 673 N.E.2d 1278, 1280 (mandamus issued to require the commission to adequately explain how claimant\u2019s experience in window washing and maintenance promoted reemployment in sedentary or light duty job).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Jackson also complains that the commission did not properly credit the report of his vocational expert, citing <em>State ex rel. Hopkins v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 36, 635 N.E.2d 1257. Jackson argues, and rightly so, that <em>Hopkins </em>holds that the commission abuses its discretion by disregarding, as it did here, the only vocational report in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 635 N.E.2d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\"><em>Hopkins, </em>however, is contrary to established authority that the commission, as the exclusive evaluator of disability, is not bound to accept vocational evidence, even if uncontradicted. Rather, upon a determination of claimant\u2019s permanent partial impairment, the commission\u2019s charge is to review the evidence of the claimant\u2019s age, education, work history, and other relevant nonmedical character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>istics and to decide for itself from that evidence whether the claimant is realistically foreclosed from sustained remunerative employment. The commission may credit offered vocational evidence, but expert opinion is not critical or even necessary, because the commission <em>is </em>the expert on this issue. Thus, in <em>State ex rel. Singleton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 117, 118, 642 N.E.2d 359, 361, another case in which the commission rejected the sole vocational report in the record, we explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s challenge rests on the erroneous belief that the commission was bound by [the vocational expert\u2019s assessment of claimant\u2019s claim for permanent and total disability]. Part of the commission\u2019s authority to weigh and evaluate evidence, however, is the freedom to reject it as unpersuasive. Particularly as to vocational \u00e1ssessments, \u2018[t]o bind the commission to a rehabilitation report\u2019s conclusion makes the rehabilitation division, not the commission, the ultimate evaluator of disability, contrary to [Stephenson] <em>supra].\u2019 State ex rel. Ellis v. McGraw Edison Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 609 N.E.2d 164, 166.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\"><em>Singleton, </em>being the more recent and consistent statement of the law, requires the conclusion that the commission had authority to reject Jackson\u2019s vocational expert\u2019s report. Thus, we concur in the court of appeals\u2019 finding that the commission permissibly rejected Jackson\u2019s vocational evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"><em>Gay </em>Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\"><em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm, supra, </em>permits a reviewing court to award PTD where the commission has failed to comply with the specificity requirements of <em>Noll, supra, </em>and the record shows that a commission decision denying PTD would necessarily be an abuse of discretion. <em>Pass, supra, </em>74 Ohio St:3d at 376, 658 N.E.2d at 1058. However, if the record is insufficient or the claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors are split between favorable and unfavorable considerations, reviewing courts should order the commission to comply with <em>Noll </em>regardless of whether the commission ultimately grants or denies PTD. <em>State ex rel. Ranomer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 134, 137, 642 N.E.2d 373, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">For the reasons already discussed, Jackson has failed to establish his eligibility for <em>Gay </em>relief. While the commission did not specify how Jackson\u2019s age and employment history combined with his medical condition and restrictions and his education to make him employable, it did assess his education level to be a marketable asset. As at least one nonmedical factor suggests Jackson\u2019s capacity for employment, this record does not compel the conclusion that Jackson is inevitably permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Having found that the commission did not comply with <em>Noll, </em>but that Jackson is not entitled to relief under <em>Gay, </em>we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>grant a limited writ ordering the commission to review Jackson\u2019s application further and issue an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-5\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b468-6\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b468-7\">Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\">. The parties do not mention it, but the commission\u2019s order identifies only the first of Jackson\u2019s two allowed conditions, which suggests that it did not consider the second. To deny PTD without considering all relevant allowed conditions is an abuse of discretion for which mandamus is the remedy. <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 339, 533 N.E.2d 720. Here, however, the commission relied on reports from Drs. Kaffen and McCloud, both of whom took into account Jackson\u2019s two injuries. This reliance tends to confirm the commission\u2019s appreciation of both claims. Thus, in <em>State ex rel. Zollner v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 276, 611 N.E.2d 830, we preserved a commission order with the same defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b468-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">dissenting. The appropriate standard for this court\u2019s review is to determine whether there is \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support the stated basis for the commission\u2019s decision. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Because the record below contains \u201csome evidence\u201d in support of the commission\u2019s decision, I would affirm the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-9\">Cook, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
