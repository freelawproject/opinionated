Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\"><em>Mitchell </em>and <em>Noll </em>require that in any order granting or denying benefits, the commission specifically state what evidence it has relied on, and briefly explain the reasoning or basis for its decision. The purpose for requiring such evidentiary identification and explanation is so that \u201cmeaningful review can be accomplished.\u201d <em>Noll, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 206, 567 N.E.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">However, we find that the order is ambiguous and should be returned for clarification because it prevents this court from conducting a meaningful review. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. DeMint v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 550 N.E.2d 174, 176; <em>State ex rel. Osco Industries v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 167, 168, 539 N.E.2d 1128, 1130; <em>State ex rel. Ingold v. Ormet Corp. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 353, 530 N.E.2d 920; <em>State ex rel. Frigidaire Div., Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 105, 518 N.E.2d 1194, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The critical portion of the June 24, 1993 order explains that TTD compensation was denied \u201cfor the reason that there is a lack of evidence in the record of an impairment from the allowed condition which is sufficient to preclude the claimant from performing the duties of his former position of employment, as so evidenced by the reports of Dr. Martin * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">This language is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations: (1) \u201cthere is a lack of evidence in the record\u201d to support the contrary conclusion that claimant\u2019s siderosis prevents him' from returning to work; or (2) \u201cas so evidenced by the reports of Dr. Martin,\u201d claimant\u2019s medical history discloses no physical or physiologic impairment resulting from his siderosis that would preclude his return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Indeed, the parties\u2019 arguments are respectively tied to these interpretations. From the claimant\u2019s perspective, the order should be read according to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>interpretation set forth above. Read this way, the order constitutes an abuse of discretion because the record contains a supplemental report by Dr. Joseph F. Tomashefski, Jr., dated October 25, 1989, which specifically opines, \u201cwithin reasonable medical certainty, that Mr. Buttolph\u2019s siderosis was the most important cause of his pulmonary dysfunction and inability to return to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">From appellants\u2019 perspective, the order should be read according to the second interpretation set forth above. Under this interpretation, the issue becomes whether the commission is required to explain its reasons for choosing one medical opinion over another, or for rejecting the other opinion. However, in order to address this issue, it must first be determined whether the commission did in fact choose one opinion over another, or whether it has simply failed to recognize that the record contained a contrary opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It is obvious that neither issue can be addressed \u2014 indeed, we cannot even know which issue is presented \u2014 until we know what the order says. Thus, there can be no meaningful review until the ambiguity is clarified by the commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The referee purported to resolve the ambiguity by striking part of the order as \u201cless than artful.\u201d However, all ambiguous statements are \u201cless than artful\u201d; otherwise, they would not be ambiguous. We cannot simply rewrite the statement to achieve the interpretation we desire by striking the offending language as \u201cless than artful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Claimant also contends that the cause should be returned for further consideration because the commission\u2019s June 24 order fails to list all medical evidence proffered for consideration. According to claimant, <em>State ex rel. Fultz v. Indus. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 327, 631 N.E.2d 1057, requires that \u201call of the medical evidence in the record * * * be considered and noted in the Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Although the commission is required to consider all evidence properly before it, it is not required to list each piece of evidence that it considered in its order. Under <em>Mitchell, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 483-484, 6 OBR at 534, 453 N.E.2d at 724, the commission is required to enumerate in its order <em>\u201conly </em>that evidence which has been <em>relied upon </em>to reach their conclusion * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See, also, <em>Noll, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 204, 567 N.E.2d at 247. There is no requirement that the commission list all evidence <em>considered. </em>See <em>DeMint, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 20, 550 N.E.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Nor does <em>Fultz </em>impose such a requirement. <em>Fultz </em>holds, in effect, merely that if the commission unnecessarily endeavors to enumerate the evidence <em>considered, </em>it must appear from its order that <em>all </em>evidence was given consideration. Thus, if the commission lists only the evidence <em>relied upon, </em>without any attempt to enumerate the evidence <em>considered, Fultz </em>does not apply. See <em>State ex rel. Lovell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 250, 252-253, 658 N.E.2d 284, 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the commission\u2019s June 24, 1993 order listed only the evidence relied upon. No effort was made to list the evidence considered. Thus, <em>Fultz </em>is inapplicable, and claimant\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Last, the commission argues that the court of appeals erred in applying <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, to a TTD case. We agree. This court has specifically explained that \u201cnon-medical factors such as age, education, and work experience, * * * have no place in a determination of TTD.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Baker Material Handling Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 202, 212, 631 N.E.2d 138, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">However, a simple reading of the court of appeals\u2019 decision reveals that no critical issue was decided entirely on the basis of <em>Stephenson. </em>Thus, the error is entirely harmless, as it has no determinative effect on the outcome or the reasons underlying the appellate court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\">. In fact, the commission\u2019s explanation of its own order is ambiguous. The commission, in its brief, explains that:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u201cThe Commission\u2019s order clearly indicates specific reliance on the reports of Dr. Martin who opined that Appellee:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">\u201c \u2018has no apparent physical or physiologic impairment from the pathologically diagnosed condition of pulmonary siderosis. He does have a moderate degree of airway obstruction which is not from siderosis.\u2019 \u201d Here the commission\u2019s explanation of its June 24 order comports with the second interpretation set forth <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">However, the commission immediately goes on to finish its explanation, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">\u201cIt is clear that the Commission, in utilizing the \u2018former position of employment\u2019 test found in <em>[State ex rel.] Ramirez [v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586], sought medical evidence in the record of an impairment from the allowed condition (siderosis) which prohibits a return to the former position of employment. They found a \u2018lack of evidence\u2019 in this regard, stated as much in the order and accordingly denied benefits because siderosis does not prevent the Appellee from performing the duties of his former position of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">Here, the commission very clearly explains its June 24 order as meaning that no evidence existed in the record to support a conclusion that claimant\u2019s siderosis was work-preelusive, <em>i.e., </em>the first interpretation set forth <em>supra. </em>This explanation undermines its entire position on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">Accordingly, in attempting to explain that its June 24 order is not ambiguous, the commission\u2019s conclusions remain unclear. This serves to highlight the need for clarification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
