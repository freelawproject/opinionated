I do not interpret this \u201cremand\u201d as an order to <em>grant </em>the claimant her award. Rather, I interpret it as an order to the court to <em>apply </em>the new standards in <em>Lewis v. Trimble </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 231, 680 N.E.2d 1207, to this fact pattern to determine whether claimant knew or should have known of her condition. However, I would also caution the trial court to factor in her doctor\u2019s apparent refusal to refer her for psychiatric care after she specifically requested it and the effect that refusal had upon her delay in diagnosis. It is possible that the doctor\u2019s refusal to refer claimant negated any threshold of the \u201cknew or should have known\u201d scienter on her part, given the trust one puts in one\u2019s own physician.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
