Since we find that the OEPA and its counsel were reasonable in their position that OEPA\u2019s communications with its in-house counsel were privileged, and because the public benefit gained by the success of Olander\u2019s mandamus action was not significant enough to itself merit an award of attorney fees, we find that the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in declining to award attorney fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The award of attorney fees in a public records case is not automatic. R.C. 149.43(C) allows a court to use its discretion in awarding such fees. <em>State ex rel. Fox v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. Sys. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443. In granting or denying attorney fees, the court should consider the reasonableness of the government\u2019s failure to comply with the public records request and the degree to which the public will benefit from release of the records in question. <em>State ex rel. Warren Newspapers, Inc. v. Hutson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 619, 626, 640 N.E.2d 174, 180. We find that both factors support the decision of the court of appeals in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">This court found in <em>State ex rel. Thomas v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 245, 249, 643 N.E.2d 126, 130, that \u201c[rjecords of communications between attorneys and their state-government clients pertaining to the attorneys\u2019 legal advice are excepted from disclosure under R.C. 149.43(A)(1), since the release of these records is prohibited by state law.\u201d In <em>Thomas, </em>the attorney whose communications were at issue was employed by Ohio State University\u2019s Office of Legal Affairs. This court did not have to rule on the issue of whether the attorney\u2019s in-house position affected the attorney-client privilege, since the attorney had been approved as an Assistant Attorney General by the Attorney General\u2019s Office. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 643 N.E.2d at 130. That was done pursuant to a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d between OSU and the Attorney General, which allowed OSU to employ attorneys to carry out university business -with the condition that the Attorney General approve the appointments and, in turn, appoint those persons Assistant Attorneys General. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the state of the law after <em>Thomas </em>was that this court had spoken strongly in favor of the privilege between attorneys and their state agency clients; the issue of whether that privilege extends to attorneys not appointed as Assistant Attorneys General remained unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Thus, respondents\u2019 claim of privilege in this particular case was reasonably grounded in the law. As this court noted it <em>Hutson, </em>attorney fees are regarded as punitive. <em>Id., </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 626, 640 N.E.2d at 180. Certainly, courts should not be in the practice of punishing parties for taking a rational stance on an unsettled legal issue. We therefore find that the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award Olander attorney fees on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The second factor to consider when deciding whether to award attorney fees in a public records case is the degree to which the public benefits from the release of the records. We find that the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion by finding that benefit to be minimal in this case. In <em>Hutson, </em>this court awarded attorney fees where the relator\u2019s mandamus action increased the period allowed for the inspection of records at the Warren Police Department from three hours per day to eight hours per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Public benefit may be derived from more than just an expansion of the hours the public has access to public records. Public benefit may also result from a satisfaction of the public\u2019s right to know. In <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Whalen </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 99, 554 N.E.2d 1321, a commercial television station sought the release of police records relating to the shooting of a suspect. The station sought the records \u201cso that complete and accurate news reports can be broadcast and reported to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 554 N.E.2d at 1322. This court described the public benefit in that case as \u201cmanifest\u201d and granted the relator\u2019s request for attorney fees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 145, 647 N.E.2d 1374, 1379, this court found that the relator \u201cdemonstrated a sufficient public benefit\u201d in the release of personal background and investigation reports of police recruits to merit an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The release of records in the present case confers its benefits mostly on Olander in his personal battle against a former employer. The public benefit lies more with the exposure of the OEPA\u2019s seeming repudiation of R.C. 109.02 than it does with expanded access to public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Therefore, since the OEPA refused Olander\u2019s disputed public records requests in good faith, and because the public benefit of releasing those records, if any, is not great enough to support an award of attorney fees on its own, we find that the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney fees to Olander in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-9\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b376-10\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E.

Once again a majority applies the wrong test in determining the issue of entitlement to attorney fees for a plaintiff who succeeds in an R.C. 149.43 public records case. The statute does <em>not </em>say an award is discretionary. The statute does <em>not </em>say that a court \u201cshould consider the reasonableness of the government\u2019s failure to comply\u201d with the law. The statute does <em>not </em>say that a court should consider \u201cthe degree to which the public will benefit from release of the records in question.\u201d The history of the statute and the confirmation of the policy and rule as so clearly and concisely set forth by Justice Francis E. Sweeney in <em>State ex rel. Pennington v. Gundler </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 171, 175-178, 661 N.E.2d 1049, 1052-1054 (F.E. Sweeney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), should have, by this late date, laid the issue to rest. \u201cHope springs eternal in the human breast.\u201d Pope, Essay on Man. The longer we keep giving encouragement (by not awarding attorney fees) to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>who choose to ignore the public records law, the more we will see violations of the law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-5\">Resnick and F.E.
