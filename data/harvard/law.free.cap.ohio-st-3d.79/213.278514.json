It challenges instead the amount payable. Wage loss is contingent on a post-injury earnings reduction. At issue is the amount from which claimant\u2019s wages as a host floater is to be deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Wage-loss compensation is not mentioned in R.C. 4123.61, the \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d statute. Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(5), however, defines \u201cwage loss\u201d as \u201cthe difference between the employee\u2019s present earnings and the greater of the employee\u2019s full weekly wage or average weekly wage.\u201d The commission followed this formula here.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Sanese\u2019s argument suggests that claimant\u2019s actions \u2014 specifically those that precipitated his demotion \u2014 break the causal relationship between the claimant\u2019s injury and the amount of wage loss claimed, and necessitate a departure from this formula. We find the analysis in <em>State ex rel. Watts v. Schottenstein Stores Corp. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 118, 623 N.E.2d 1202, persuasive here. There, we declined to elevate employee conduct to a preeminent factor in determining eligibility for wage-loss compensation. We held that employee conduct was not an automatic bar to wage-loss compensation based upon our overriding concern of furthering the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which is to compensate workers for injuries suffered in their employment. Thus, while the commission could deny wage-loss compensation based on a claimant\u2019s actions, it was not compelled to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">We find that this same logic applies to calculating the amount of wage-loss compensation as well. Consequently, the commission did not abuse its discretion in choosing claimant\u2019s wages as a route supervisor as the amount from which to deduct claimant\u2019s reduced earnings as a host floater.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-14\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
