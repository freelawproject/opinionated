Konoff seeks to compel the common pleas court to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Findings of fact and conclusions of law are mandatory if the trial court dismisses a petition for postconviction relief. R.C. 2953.21(C); <em>State v. Lester </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 51, 70 O.O.2d 150, 322 N.E.2d 656, paragraph two of the syllabus. Mandamus will lie to compel a trial court to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law when it dismisses a petition for postconviction relief. <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Court of Common Pleas of Coshocton Cty. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 46, 23 OBR 122, 491 N.E.2d 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The rationale for requiring findings of fact and conclusions of law is to apprise the petitioner of the reasons for the trial court\u2019s judgment and to permit meaningful appellate review. <em>State v. Mapson </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 1 OBR 240, 242, 438 N.E.2d 910, 912. If the entry of the trial court sufficiently apprises the petitioner of the reasons for the judgment and permits meaningful appellate review, a writ of mandamus will not be issued to compel findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 19-20, 530 N.E.2d 1330, 1330-1331. Here, as the court of appeals concluded, the trial court entry was sufficiently adequate to apprise both Konoff and the court of appeals of the rationale for denying Konoffs petition. See, <em>e.g., State v. Lawson </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 307, 312-313, 659 N.E.2d 362, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-14\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
