Appellant has filed an untimely appeal of the court of appeals\u2019 decision affirming the trial court\u2019s order revoking his probation, and a motion for delayed appeal. This appeal involves a civil, post-conviction matter and not an appeal of a felony case to which the provisions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>delayed appeal in S.Ct.Prae.R. II(2)(A)(4), apply. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"A0u\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that the motion for delayed appeal be, and hereby is, stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that, in that appellant failed to perfect an appeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prae.R. II(2)(A)(1), this case be, and hereby is, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
