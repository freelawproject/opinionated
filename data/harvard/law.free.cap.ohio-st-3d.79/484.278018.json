For the reasons to follow, we find that the commission did not abuse its discretion and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Claimant initially asserts that there is no evidence supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant is medically capable of sedentary work. She argues that Dr. Rammohan\u2019s report is so internally inconsistent as to require its disqualification under <em>State ex rel. Lopez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 445, 633 N.E.2d 528. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Claimant initially suggests that Dr. Rammohan\u2019s findings dictate a higher impairment percentage than the thirty-seven percent impairment he assessed. Claimant\u2019s assertion, however, would require us to second-guess the medical expertise of Dr. Rammohan, which we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Claimant\u2019s reliance on <em>Lopez </em>is also misplaced. In Lopez, we determined that the commission could not reasonably rely on a physician\u2019s report that, despite a fifty percent impairment rating, found the claimant capable of heavy foundry labor. The present situation is not analogous. Rather than a high degree of impairment, the present claimant\u2019s impairment is more moderate at thirty-seven percent. The present claimant, moreover, was not released to heavy employment, which would arguably be inconsistent with her level of impairment. Instead, she was limited to sedentary work. No comparable inconsistency, therefore, exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Claimant also alleges inconsistencies in Dr. Rammohan\u2019s discussion of claimant\u2019s cancer and in his assessment of capability for sedentary employment despite claimant\u2019s use of a wheelchair. As to the former, we find any alleged inconsistencies to be irrelevant to the central question before us \u2014 whether claimant\u2019s allowed conditions prevent sustained remunerative employment. As to the latter, we do not find sedentary employment to be irreconcilable with claimant\u2019s occasional use of a wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">We find that Dr. Rammohan\u2019s report is evidence supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant can do sedentary work. Our analysis, therefore, turns to claimant\u2019s second proposition of law \u2014 that the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis does not satisfy <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. We find this argument to be unpersuasive as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that claimant\u2019s age, education and work experience made her amenable to retraining or re-employment. <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. McGraw Edison Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 92, 609 N.E.2d 164. While it would have been preferable for the commission to have discussed how claimant\u2019s work history contributed to its conclusion, this deficiency does not compel vacation of the order, given the sufficiency of claimant\u2019s other cited nonmedical factors to explain the commission\u2019s conclusion. Thus, the commission\u2019s analysis, while brief, meets <em>Noll\u2019s </em>minimum criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The judgment of the court of appeals is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b683-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>F.E.
