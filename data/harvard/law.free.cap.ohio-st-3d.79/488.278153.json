In each of these four instances, respondent received a retainer and then neglected the legal matter entrusted to him. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Sigall </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 14 OBR 320, 321, 470 N.E.2d 886, 888, we found that such a practice was \u201ctantamount to theft of that fee from the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">When we have found repeated failures to carry out entrusted legal matters, we have imposed the sanction of an indefinite suspension from the practice of law. <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Anderson </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 209, 580 N.E.2d 1095. We believe that this sanction is especially fitting in situations such as this where neglect of a legal matter is coupled with a failure to cooperate in the ensuing disciplinary investigation. Cf. <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Blankenship </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 586, 660 N.E.2d 1141; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Leibold </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 128, 559 N.E.2d 749. We have imposed an indefinite suspension even where an attorney who exhibited a pattern of neglect of client matters finally cooperated with the investigation by the grievance committee. <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Snyder </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 57, 676 N.E.2d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Here, respondent completely neglected his clients\u2019 interests and totally failed to cooperate with disciplinary investigations; hence, we impose an indefinite suspension. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b686-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
