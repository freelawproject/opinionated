Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we have carefully reviewed all issues raised. However, we summarily reject several of these arguments on the grounds that they either were not preserved, involve settled issues, or our independent review cures the error, if any. (Propositions of Law Four, Five, Nine, Eleven, Thirteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Twenty, Twenty-one, Twenty-two, Twenty-three, Twenty-four, Twenty-five [b].) See, <em>e.g., State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus; <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 643 N.E.2d 524; <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 658 N.Ed.2d 754. We address, in opinion form, only those matters that merit discussion. We also independently assess the evidence relating to the death sentence, balance the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and review the proportionality of the sentence to sentences imposed in similar cases. For the following reasons, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and uphold the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">TESTIMONY OF TABATHA HENNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Appellant presents several propositions of law dealing with the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s chief witness, his wife Tabatha Henness. He claims that Tabatha\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>testimony was incompetent (Proposition of Law One), that it violated the statutory marital privilege (Proposition of Law Two), that he had no opportunity to effectively cross-examine her (Proposition of Law Fourteen), and that the testimony contained hearsay (Proposition of Law Three).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">1. <em>Competence to Testify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Appellant contends that his wife Tabatha was not competent as a witness, since her election to testify was not intelligently made. According to Evid.R. 601(B)(2), \u201c[e]very person is competent to be a witness except: * * * [a] spouse testifying against the other spouse charged with a crime except when * * * [t]he testifying spouse elects to testify.\u201d Recently, we construed this rule in <em>State v. Adamson </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 431, 650 N.E.2d 875, syllabus, and held that the testifying spouse \u201cremains incompetent * * * until she makes a deliberate choice to testify, with knowledge of her right to refuse. The trial court must take an active role in determining competency, and must make an affirmative determination on the record that the spouse has elected to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The court engaged in the following colloquy during its voir dire of Tabatha:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u201c[THE COURT]: The other exception that permits a spouse to testify against her husband * * * is if they elect to do so. You have a right, therefore, not to elect to testify against your husband in this case * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u201cNow, the purpose of my asking these questions * * * is to make sure you understand your right under that rule * * *, you have [the] right to elect not to testify or to testify. Do you understand that rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, I understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Now, the state * * * intends to call you as their next witness if you elect to testify in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Additionally, Tabatha testified that she understood the rule, knew what \u201cvoluntarily\u201d meant, and was testifying voluntarily. She said defense counsel had previously told her she could elect whether or not to testify. She did not fear punishment for not testifying, and she denied having told counsel otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\"><em>Adamson, </em>a case decided after the trial of this case, requires \u201can affirmative determination on the record that the spouse has elected to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. However, <em>Adamson </em>is distinguishable. There, the court never considered the applicability of Evid.R. 601. <em>Id., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 431-432, 650 N.E.2d at 876. Here, counsel raised the issue, the court specifically explained Tabatha\u2019s rights to her, and she expressly affirmed that she was testifying voluntarily. Thus, our review of the record indicates that Tabatha\u2019s election was voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Despite the record regarding Tabatha\u2019s election, appellant further argues that Tabatha\u2019s later conduct indicates that she did not understand her rights under Evid.R. 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Tabatha\u2019s direct examination concluded on the afternoon of November 22, 1993. She was scheduled to return the next day for cross-examination, but she did not appear. Instead, without the prosecution\u2019s knowledge, she fled to Texas. Tabatha did not return until November 29, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Upon her return, Tabatha was again voir dired. She stated that she failed to appear for cross-examination because she was \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cstressed-out,\u201d and that \u201cit is hard for me to testify against my husband.\u201d She also stated that her decision to return and give testimony was made, in part, because the prosecutor told her that she could be arrested on a bench warrant if she did not return. Tabatha never stated that she did not wish to testify or that she desired to revoke her election.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Evid.R. 601(B)(2) states that a spouse is incompetent except when she \u201celects to testify.\u201d Thus, the decisive event is the spouse\u2019s election to testify, which triggers the exception, and not any event (such as an attempted revocation) subsequent to that election. The rule does not say that a competent spouse can become incompetent by changing her mind. The word \u201celect\u201d implies a choice between inconsistent alternatives. Thus, a spouse cannot \u201celect\u201d both to testify and not to testify in the same case. Moreover, strong policy reasons militate against interpreting Evid.R. 601 to allow revocation. In the search for the truth, exceptions to the allowance of relevant evidence should be construed narrowly. Further, since a defendant has a constitutional right to cross-examine a witness, a defendant\u2019s spouse could force a mistrial by testifying for the state, then refusing cross-examination. We reject appellant\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">2. <em>Marital Privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">R.C. 2945.42 creates a privilege for spousal acts and communications:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u201c * * * Husband or wife shall not testify concerning a communication made by one to the other, or act done by either in the presence of the other, during coverture, unless the communication was made or act done in the known presence or hearing of a third party competent to be a witness * *</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">In his second proposition of law, appellant claims that \u201cthe vast majority of the testimony of Tabatha\u201d breached this privilege. Despite his wide-sweeping claim, appellant points to only two incidents for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">a. On March 20, 1992, at Bob Curtis\u2019s house, Tabatha answered a phone call from \u201cDick,\u201d who wanted to speak with appellant. After speaking with \u201cDick,\u201d appellant said, \u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d and he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Tabatha testified that Curtis was in the kitchen, which was downstairs. According to Tabatha, Curtis\u2019s house was smaller than the courtroom in which this case was tried, and \u201canything said downstairs can be heard * * * all over the house * * * downstairs.\u201d Though the record is not clear, it appears that the phone was downstairs. Thus, it could be found that the conversation took place within Curtis\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">b. Tabatha testified that she advised appellant to tell Fair \u201cwhat happened.\u201d Appellant first said that \u201che d[id]n\u2019t think he should,\u201d but then told Fair \u201cthat he shot somebody, * * * and the guy died and that is whose car he had.\u201d According to Tabatha, Fair was in the car with her and appellant when this conversation occurred. She testified that Fair \u201ccouldn\u2019t hear me,\u201d but he was still present. She then testified to what appellant told Fair, which clearly was not privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Appellant did not specifically object to the above testimony. However, he made \u201ca continuing objection\u201d to testimony regarding acts not done in the presence of a third party. At times, a continuing objection is enough to preserve error. <em>Brady v. Stafford </em>(1926), 115 Ohio St. 67, 152 N.E. 188, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, it was not sufficient in this case. The existence of the marital privilege turns on the specific circumstances surrounding each allegedly privileged communication, <em>e.g., </em>whether a third party was present. Thus, appellant had to object specifically so the circumstances could be determined. This proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">3. <em>Effective Cross-Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In his fourteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to declare a mistrial following Tabatha\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Appellant argues that the \u201cextended delay\u201d between direct and cross-examination diminished the jury\u2019s recall of Tabatha\u2019s direct testimony, rendering cross-examination of her less effective. This argument is speculative. In fact, at trial, defense counsel argued the opposite, claiming prejudice because the jury had a week to \u201cchew on and think about her direct testimony.\u201d Moreover, any prejudice stemming from \u201cdiminished recall\u201d could be easily corrected; the defense could cross-examine in such a way as to remind the jury how Tabatha had testified on direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Appellant also cites the \u201ccoercive nature of [Tabatha\u2019s] situation\u201d \u2014 that the prosecution paid for her flight back to Ohio, and prosecutors picked her up at the airport and stayed with her at the hotel. We find nothing wrong with the prosecutors\u2019 taking proper steps to ensure that Tabatha would not flee again.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Appellant also alleges that the prosecutors \u201ccoached\u201d Tabatha. One of the prosecutors admitted he told Tabatha that defense counsel would ask about her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>prior record, and he (the prosecutor) \u201cgave her a chance to look at her prior record so that she could intelligently answer his questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">We find no reversible error. No general rule absolutely forbids attorney-witness contact between direct and cross-examination. <em>Perry v. Leeke </em>(1989), 488 U.S. 272, 288-289, 109 S.Ct. 594, 604, 102 L.Ed.2d 624, 639 (dissenting opinion); <em>United States v. DeJongh </em>(C.A.1, 1991), 937 F.2d 1, 3. Trial courts may forbid such contact, and often do so, see <em>Perry, </em>488 U.S. at 281-282, 109 S.Ct. at 600-601, 102 L.Ed.2d at 634, but here, the court did not. Such contact may create an appearance of impropriety, cf. <em>State v. Fields </em>(Aug. 9, 1993), Jefferson App. No. 92-J-20, unreported, 1993 WL 307625, but does not necessarily prevent a fair trial. Cf. <em>Price v. Cleveland Clinic Found. </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 301, 306, 515 N.E.2d 931, 936-937.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Here, the trial court found the contact nonprejudicial; it merely gave Tabatha \u201can opportunity to review [her] record so she could speak truthfully and honestly about that record.\u201d The defense was free to cross-examine Tabatha on these issues. \u201cThe opposing counsel in an adversary system is not without weapons to cope with \u2018coached\u2019 witnesses.\u201d <em>Geders v. United States </em>(1976), 425 U.S. 80, 89, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 1336, 47 L.Ed.2d 592, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Appellant also asserts that the court erroneously restricted his cross-examination of Tabatha. On cross-examination, the defense asked why she fled. Tabatha answered that she was \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cstressed\u201d because it was hard to testify against her husband. The defense wanted to ask her about other cases where she had failed to appear in court, to show that she was being untruthful about why she left the state. The trial court refused to permit such an inquiry. This ruling was proper. Counsel said he wanted \u201cto show that this is a person who manipulates the court system.\u201d In other words, he wanted to use Tabatha\u2019s \u201cother acts\u201d to prove her bad character to show that her behavior here conformed to that character. This would have violated Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">On redirect, Tabatha testified that part of the reason that she fled was because during her direct examination, appellant was looking at her and mouthing \u201cI love you\u201d and similar words. On recross, defense counsel asked her, \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything to me about that when I was questioning you why you didn\u2019t show up, did you?\u201d The state objected that the question was misleading because the defense had not asked Tabatha why she was stressed. The trial court sustained the objection. Appellant claims this ruling was prejudicial. While the ruling was questionable, it was not unreasonable and, thus, did not amount to an abuse of discretion. We overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">4. <em>Hearsay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Tabatha testified that the person who phoned appellant on March 20 said, \u201cThis is. Dick.\u201d In appellant\u2019s third proposition of law, he contends the caller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>statement was hearsay. We agree. At trial, the state argued that it was not offering this out-of-court assertion to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u2014 that the caller\u2019s name was \u201cDick.\u201d Yet, we find that the name the caller used was relevant for no other purpose. However, we find no prejudice. Appellant claims that, without this hearsay, the state could not have shown that appellant and Myers were together on March 20. This is not true. Tabatha testified that she saw appellant leave the residence with a person whom she knew as \u201cDick.\u201d She identified Myers\u2019s car as the car she saw that morning. Appellant returned without Myers, yet with Myers\u2019s car and property. The fact that someone named \u201cDick\u201d phoned appellant adds only weak support to the already strong evidence that appellant was with Myers on March 20. This proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">OTHER ACTS/CHARACTER EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Tabatha and Fair testified about their activities with appellant the day of the murder and the days following the murder, which included taking drugs, forging checks, and using stolen credit cards. In his sixth proposition of law, appellant argues that this was \u201ccharacter evidence,\u201d barred by Evid.R. 404(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We find this evidence was relevant for non-character purposes. Appellant\u2019s drug addiction and use show his need for money and, hence, his motive to steal and kill. His use of stolen checks and credit cards shows he possessed Myers\u2019s property the day after Myers disappeared, proving robbery and linking appellant to Myers\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">We also reject appellant\u2019s assertion that his use of the checks and credit cards was inadmissible because he had pled guilty to the forgery counts before trial. Since he deferred sentencing on these crimes until the conclusion of this trial, he argues \u201cevidence of this plea of guilt should not have been introduced.\u201d Here, the state introduced evidence of the forgeries, not appellant\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">GRAND JURY DISCLOSURE</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">In his seventh proposition of law, appellant argues that he was entitled to a transcript of Roland Fair\u2019s grand jury testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Grand jury proceedings in felony cases must be recorded pursuant to Crim.R. 22, and if the defendant demonstrates a particularized need that outweighs the reasons for grand jury secrecy, Crim.R. 6(E) gives him or her the right to inspect all relevant portions of that testimony. <em>State v. Benge </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 136, 144-145, 661 N.E.2d 1019, 1028; <em>State v. Grewell </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 4, 543 N.E.2d 93; <em>State v. Greer </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 20 O.O.3d 157, 420 N.E.2d 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>As to particularized need, appellant claims that Fair\u2019s testimony has credibility problems because Fair\u2019s bond was reduced after his grand jury appearance. Appellant asserts that \u201cthe prosecution [got] what it want[ed], and then release[d] Fair through a favorable bond.\u201d We fail to understand appellant\u2019s argument. If Fair\u2019s release was a reward for pro-prosecution grand jury testimony, why would that lead one to suppose his grand jury testimony differed materially from his pro-prosecution trial testimony? Thus, appellant\u2019s claim that Fair\u2019s grand jury testimony may have differed from his trial testimony is mere speculation, insufficient to show particularized need. See <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 337, 638 N.E.2d 1023, 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Appellant also argues that the issue of secrecy was moot. Fair\u2019s participation in these crimes led to his indictment for forgery. Under Crim.R. 16(B)(l)(a)(iii), the state disclosed Fair\u2019s own grand jury testimony to him. Thus, appellant argues that, because the state had disclosed the testimony, it was no longer secret. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Fair\u2019s testimony was never a secret from Fair himself. Thus, giving him a transcript of it did not decrease its secrecy. Information disclosed to a defendant under Crim.R. 16 does not thereby become a public record. <em>State ex rel. WHIO-TV-7 v. Lowe </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 350, 673 N.E.2d 1360. Hence, the testimony remained secret. This proposition fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">INTERROGATION TAPES</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In his eighth proposition of law, appellant claims that his April 14, 1992 statement to the police should have been suppressed because he had invoked his right to counsel during a prior interview which took place on April 8, 1992. Appellant believes that the police violated his rights by initiating a subsequent interrogation outside the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Appellant was interviewed by Columbus police detectives on April 8, 1992. This interrogation was recorded on videotape. Prior to questioning, appellant\u2019s rights were explained to him and he waived his right to counsel by executing a standard waiver form. Appellant was then questioned about the forgeries. Over the course of approximately three hours, appellant freely answered questions. Sometime during the interrogation, the detectives began questioning appellant about the murder. At this point, appellant stated, \u201cI think I need a lawyer because if I tell everything I know, how do I know I\u2019m not going to wind up with a complicity charge?\u201d When the videotape was played to the jury, the tape was turned off just before this statement was made. At this interview, appellant insinuated that Fair may have been responsible for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The second statement, recorded on audiotape, was made on April 14, 1992, after appellant had telephoned his friend, Teresa Thomas, from jail telling her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>that if the police came back he would talk to them. Prior to recording this statement, the police read appellant his constitutional rights. During this interrogation, appellant stated that a gang of Cubans, not Fair, was responsible for the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">If a suspect in a criminal investigation requests counsel at any time during questioning, he is not subject to further interrogation until a lawyer is provided or the suspect reinitiates the interrogation. <em>Arizona v. Roberson </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 675, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 100 L.Ed.2d 704; <em>Edwards v. Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477, 484-485, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, 386. However, the invocation of the right to counsel requires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney. <em>Davis v. United States </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2355, 129 L.Ed.2d 362, 371. If the statement is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable police officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to counsel, the cessation of questioning is not required. <em>Id. </em>As its rationale for such a rule of law, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u201cWe recognize that requiring a clear assertion of the right to counsel might disadvantage some suspects who \u2014 because of fear, intimidation, lack of linguistic skills, or a variety of other reasons \u2014 will not clearly articulate their right to counsel although they actually want to have a lawyer present. But the primary protection afforded suspects subject to custodial interrogation is the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves. \u2018[F]ull comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney [is] sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.\u2019 A suspect who knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to counsel after having that right explained to him has indicated his willingness to deal with the police unassisted. Although <em>Edwards </em>provides an additional protection \u2014 if a suspect subsequently requests an attorney, questioning must cease \u2014 it is one that must be affirmatively invoked by the suspect.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 460-461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356, 129 L.Ed.2d at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The court in <em>Davis </em>then concluded that the statement \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer\u201d was insufficient to require that questioning cease. Like the court of appeals, we find that appellant\u2019s statement \u201cI think I need a lawyer * * * \u201d is just as ambiguous as the statement made by the defendant in <em>Davis. </em>Thus, appellant\u2019s prior written waiver was still effective when the officers resumed their interrogation of him on April 14, 1992. Under these circumstances, the question whether the subsequent interrogation was initiated by appellant, through a third party (his friend Thomas), or police is irrelevant. We overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>OUTSIDE CONTACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In proposition of law nineteen, appellant contends that the trial court inadequately investigated the allegation that a friend of the victim\u2019s communicated with jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Defense counsel Bodiker informed the judge that he had heard from some friends of appellant\u2019s that a person claiming to be a friend of the victim had spoken to jurors during a recess and praised his character. Bodiker also had witnessed someone talking to a juror, but he did not hear what was said. Bodiker moved for a mistrial and also asked that \u201cgeneral inquiry be made of the jurors as to whether anybody talked to them about the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The prosecutor identified Myers\u2019s friend as James Montgomery. After Bodiker told the prosecutor about the incident, the prosecutor warned Montgomery not to talk to the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The trial court assembled the jury and, as a whole, asked them if anyone had \u201ctried to engage you in conversation about this case.\u201d Juror Clark responded. The court then individually questioned her at sidebar. She stated that someone had approached her and asked the defendant\u2019s name, the lawyers\u2019 names, and \u201cwhat kind of case it was, and what was going on.\u201d The juror told him she was not at liberty to discuss the case and she then walked away. She told the court she could be fair despite the incident. The court tentatively overruled the motion for mistrial but agreed to hear defense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Later in the trial, outside the presence of the jury, the defense produced two witnesses. The first witness, Tamla Newman, was appellant\u2019s friend. She testified that Montgomery approached her and asked her if she was a juror or if she knew any jurors. She stated that Montgomery told her that Myers \u201cwas like a father to him,\u201d and he said that he had gone to the murder scene with some of the jurors. She also saw Montgomery in the courthouse cafeteria four or five feet from the jurors, but she \u201ccouldn\u2019t swear\u201d that he was talking to any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The second witness, Newman\u2019s companion, testified that she saw Montgomery in the cafeteria. He \u201clooked like\u201d he was talking to some people at another table wearing juror badges. However, the witness was not sure that they were jurors in this case. She did not pay much attention and did not hear what Montgomery had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The prosecution called Montgomery. Montgomery admitted asking someone, \u201c[A]re you a juror?\u201d When the juror answered \u201cYes,\u201d Montgomery stated he said nothing more. He testified that he had gone to the murder scene before the trial began, but he did not tell anyone that he had gone with the jury. Montgomery also testified that he did not knowingly speak to or see any jurors in the cafeteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Finally, the court let the jury see Montgomery, and asked the jury if \u201cMr. Montgomery ever approach[ed] any of you * * * and tr[ied] to engage you in any conversation about the trial?\u201d No juror responded. The judge asked juror Clark if it was Montgomery who had spoken to her. She answered in the negative. The court then said:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u201cAs I understand it then, none of you recognize Mr. Montgomery, and * * * he never approached any of you in any way to discuss or try and engage you in any conversation with this trial?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Again, no juror responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Appellant faults the court for failing to question each juror individually. However, he did not ask the court to do so. Moreover, the scope of voir dire is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, <em>State v. Webb, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 338, 638 N.E.2d at 1035, and we find no abuse of this discretion. Apparently one juror failed to report his or her contact with Montgomery. But Montgomery asked only if he or she was a juror. The juror may have forgotten this brief, innocuous contact. Under these circumstances, the court could reasonably decline to interrogate the other eleven jurors individually. We overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">In his tenth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from the case before the mitigation hearing. However, \u201c[t]o discharge a court-appointed attorney, the defendant must show a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship of such magnitude as to jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 286, 525 N.E.2d 792, paragraph four of the syllabus. The term of art \u201cactual conflict\u201d refers not to a personality conflict but to a conflict of interest. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 696. The Sixth Amendment does not guarantee \u201crapport\u201d or a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d between client and counsel. <em>Morris v. Sloppy </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 1, 13-14, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1617, 75 L.Ed.2d 610, 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Appellant argues that \u201cpersonal differences\u201d between him and one of his attorneys prevented his attorneys from adequately preparing for the penalty phase and presenting mitigating evidence. At trial, appellant claimed counsel had pursued strategies against his wishes, lied to him, given bad advice, and violated the attorney-client privilege. Appellant called his lawyers \u201cthese clowns\u201d and said he did not trust them. Attorney Bodiker agreed that \u201chostility and tension\u201d existed between counsel and client.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Appellant claims that it was because of these differences that his counsel presented so little mitigation. However, counsel investigated and prepared for the penalty phase. Bodiker stated, \u201cWe did investigate and * * * do the things that we feel would be appropriate, and we did interview witnesses and we did talk to professional experts.\u201d However, appellant rejected those efforts. A defendant may decide what evidence, if any, to present at a mitigation hearing and may decide to present no evidence at all, even against the advice of his counsel. <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel had filed a list of many witnesses, which included several members of appellant\u2019s family that they intended to call at the mitigation hearing. The court asked appellant if he wanted to call these witnesses. Appellant stated he did not wish to do so. Hence, we dismiss, as unfounded, appellant\u2019s assertion that he did not know he could call these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">This case is unlike <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 87, 24 OBR 282, 494 N.E.2d 1061, where this court found that the failure to investigate resulted in the dearth of mitigation evidence. Here, defense counsel presented less evidence than they had discovered by investigation because appellant limited the evidence he would allow them to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In sum, it is clear that hostility existed between appellant and attorney Bodiker even before the mitigation trial. However, at no time did this personality conflict erode Bodiker\u2019s representation of appellant to the point of rendering it ineffective. This proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">In Proposition of Law Twenty-five (a), appellant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support conviction. He bases this claim on the incorrect premise that Tabatha\u2019s testimony was inadmissible. As previously discussed in this opinion, this contention is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">We find the evidence sufficient in all respects. On the morning of March 20, Tabatha saw appellant with Myers. Appellant admitted that he was with Myers on this day. This was the last day that Myers was seen alive. Appellant returned later that day driving Myers\u2019s car. He was alone and had Myers\u2019s credit cards and checks. Appellant pled guilty to the forgery charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Tabatha and Fair saw appellant with a wedding ring that did not fit him. Appellant told them that it had belonged to Myers. Myers\u2019s left ring finger was severed. Appellant told Fair that he had shot someone. Myers had been shot. Appellant told Fair that the body was in the Nelson Road area. The body was discovered in an abandoned water purification plant on Nelson Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Myers had been shot with a .25 caliber weapon, probably a semiautomatic. Appellant owned either a .22 or .25 caliber semiautomatic handgun, which he sold a few weeks after the murder. Appellant was observed washing a butterfly knife which had a dark stain on it. Appellant admitted the knife belonged to him. Myers was cut with a weapon consistent with a butterfly knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The state also proved prior calculation and design. The jury could infer that appellant brought a knife and loaded gun with him to the murder scene; it is unlikely that he found these weapons in an abandoned building. Myers was tied up, forced to kneel, his neck was slashed, and he was shot twice from behind and three times from the front.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We find that the evidence is sufficient to prove aggravated murder on counts one, two, and three, kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and both felony-murder death specifications, all beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In his twelfth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred by admitting his criminal record in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">In 1982, appellant was convicted of burglary, grand theft, and two counts of passing bad checks. In 1984, appellant was convicted of receiving stolen property. In 1987, appellant was convicted of escape from a halfway house. In his unsworn statement, appellant told the jury that he had been to prison three times. The state then sought to introduce appellant\u2019s prior convictions, arguing that he had drawn a misleading picture of his criminal history. After the court overruled appellant\u2019s objection, appellant stipulated to the convictions without conceding admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">In <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph three of the syllabus, this court ruled that a prosecutor, in the penalty phase of a capital case, may rebut false or incomplete statements regarding the defendant\u2019s criminal record. This right is limited, however, to those instances where the defense offers a specific assertion, by a mitigation witness or by defendant, that misrepresents the defendant\u2019s prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Appellant did not misrepresent his past. He merely made the statement that he had been to prison three times, and this was true. To allow the state to rebut this statement is contrary to the holding of <em>DePew.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">In <em>DePew, </em>this court also recognized that \u201cthe purpose of an unsworn statement is to avoid cross-examination, particularly about one\u2019s prior criminal record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 528 N.E.2d at 555. It is only when the defendant falsely claims in his unsworn statement that he has little or no prior criminal history that a prosecutor can be permitted to demonstrate this inaccuracy. <em>Id. </em>Clearly, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>was not the case here. However, we find this error to be harmless. Appellant admitted he was incarcerated on three separate occasions; his criminal record supports his statement. We reject this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05, we independently weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and determine whether appellant\u2019s death sentence is disproportionate to sentences in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant murdered Myers while committing aggravated robbery and kidnapping, and that appellant was the principal offender. The facts show that the victim was taken to a secluded area where he was bound and gagged. He was then knifed and brutally shot to death. Sometime later, Myers\u2019s finger was severed so that appellant could steal his wedding band. Appellant used checks, credit cards, and a vehicle stolen from Myers in ord\u00e9r to obtain money to buy drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In mitigation, appellant called his cellmate, two former cellmates, and two jail officers to testify about his character and conduct in the Franklin County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Appellant\u2019s cellmates testified that they never saw him threaten or assault others. All three depicted him as a peacemaker and protector of smaller or weaker inmates. They testified that appellant was a religious man and that he had counseled others on religious matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">One officer testified that appellant had been disciplined only once for fighting during his pretrial incarceration. For this conduct, appellant had received a warning because he was protecting a newer, weaker inmate from having his food tray stolen, and the inmate was not the aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Another jail officer testified that appellant informed on a fellow prisoner who had a sharpened piece of glass or plastic in his cell. The officer testified that jailhouse informants risk their lives by informing, but sometimes inform \u201cto look good.\u201d He also testified that a \u201cpecking order\u201d exists in jail, and an experienced inmate can run his cell if he can impress the younger inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Appellant also raised residual doubt. A homicide detective and a forensic pathologist testified that Myers\u2019s hands were not tested to see if he had fired a gun. However, the detective testified that such tests are done only when a suspect is arrested immediately after a shooting. The lapse of time between the murder and the discovery of the body would have made these tests worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Another detective testified that he had questioned Tabatha some years earlier in connection with a suspected homicide. The detective had heard that Tabatha was claiming to know about a woman being beaten, murdered, and mutilated by Cuban drug dealers. Checking the story out, the detective found evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>violence where the murder supposedly occurred, but no body was ever discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">A fingerprint examiner testified that he did not find appellant\u2019s fingerprints in Myers\u2019s car or the abandoned building. He did find a few prints belonging to Tabatha in and on the car. However, this evidence is of little value because appellant admitted taking the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In his unsworn statement, appellant claimed he went to the abandoned building on March 20 to steal electrical motors. He denied killing Myers, but cryptically admitted that \u201cwhat happened was because of me, people I was involved with.\u201d He said, \u201cit is my fault the man died. He wouldn\u2019t have been there. Nobody else * * * would have been there.\u201d Appellant claimed he ran from the building when he \u201cheard the shots that finished [Myers] off.\u201d He admitted stealing Myers\u2019s car, wallet, and checks, but claimed he came back later to take the car, and found the wallet and checkbook in the glove compartment. Appellant said he was \u201csorry for what happened, but by no means was Richard [Myers] a saint.\u201d He also claimed that \u201c[in] one week\u2019s time, I stopped two muggings up in the Short North.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Appellant\u2019s attempts to establish residual doubt are unpersuasive. His good record in pretrial confinement is a mitigating factor, but is entitled to little weight. His criminal record is significant and, thus, fails to qualify as a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5). The evidence proved him to be the principal offender, and his vague allegations about \u201cpeople I was involved with\u201d do not refute that evidence or establish a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(6). No other mitigating factors apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Finally, R.C. 2929.05(A) requires us to consider whether the sentence imposed in this case was excessive or disproportionate to the sentence imposed in other similar cases. <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 123, 31 OBR 273, 283, 509 N.E.2d 383, 394. In doing so, we find that this court has often upheld death sentences for aggravated murder coupled with aggravated robbery and kidnapping. See, <em>e.g., State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 530-531, 605 N.E.2d 70, 85; <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 28-29, 535 N.E.2d 1351, 1363. Indeed, it has frequently upheld death sentences based solely on a specification of murder during kidnapping, and has also upheld the imposition of death stemming solely from murder in the commission of aggravated robbery. <em>State v. Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 92, 26 OBR 79, 497 N.E.2d 55. In <em>Roe, </em>the defense presented far stronger mitigation than that presented by appellant. <em>Id., </em>41 Ohio St.3d at 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>535 N.E.2d at 1351. Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, Pfeifer, Cook
