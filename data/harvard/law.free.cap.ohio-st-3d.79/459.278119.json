Thus, the sole issue before this court is whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that Liggins and Williams were \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d as is required in order to convict appellee of a violation of R.C. 2919.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">R.C. 2919.25 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201c(B) No person shall recklessly cause serious physical harm to a family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\u201c(C) No person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member to believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\"><em>U </em>* * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">\u201c(E) As used in this section * * * of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">\u201c(1) \u2018Family or household member\u2019 means any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">\u201c(a) Any of the following who is residing or has resided with the offender:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">\u201c(i) A spouse, a person living as a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">\u201c(ii) A parent or a child of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">\u201c(iii) A parent or a child of a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">\u201c(b) The natural parent of any child of whom the offender is the other natural parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">\u201c(2) \u2018Person living as a spouse\u2019 means a person who is living or has lived with the offender in a common law marital relationship, who otherwise is cohabiting with the offender, or who otherwise has cohabited with the offender within one year prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">Liggins and Williams do not contend that they are married, have ever been married, or have lived together in a common-law marriage. Thus, to convict Williams for domestic violence under R.C. 2919.25, the prosecution must prove that Liggins is a \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d of Williams by showing that she (1) resides or has resided with Williams (R.C. 2919.25[E][l][a]), and (2) \u201cotherwise is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>cohabiting with [Williams], or * * * otherwise has cohabited with [Williams].\u201d R.C. 2919.25(E)(l)(a)(iii) and 2919.25(E)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">This court has never defined \u201ccohabitation,\u201d and the courts of appeals throughout Ohio have adopted various definitions. Williams notes that regardless of the definition of \u201ccohabitation,\u201d the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d necessarily includes a person \u201cwho is residing or has resided with the offender,\u201d R.C. 2919.25(E)(1)(a), and urges this court to adopt a narrow definition of \u201creside\u201d which would limit \u201cfamily or household members\u201d to those who actually share one residential address. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Words and phrases in a statute must be read in context of the whole statute. <em>Commerce &amp; Industry Ins. Co. v. Toledo </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 96, 102, 543 N.E.2d 1188, 1196. As we stated in <em>Felton v. Felton </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 34, 679 N.E.2d 672, \u201cThe General Assembly enacted the domestic violence statutes specifically to criminalize those activities commonly known as domestic violence and to authorize a court to issue protection orders designed to ensure the safety and protection of a complainant in a domestic violence case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 679 N.E.2d at 674, citing Ohio Legislative Service Commission, Summary of 1978 Enactments, June-December (1979), at 9-14; Legislative Service Commission Analysis of Sub. H.B. No. 835 as reported by Senate Judiciary .Committee (1978), at 2 and 7 (Comment A); Legislative Service Commission Analysis of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 835 as enacted (1978), at 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In contrast to \u201cstranger\u201d violence, domestic violence arises out of the <em>relationship </em>between the perpetrator and the victim. Social science studies show that the rate of violence in dating relationships is at least the same as, if not greater than, that of couples who maintain one address. Klein &amp; Orloff, Providing Legal Protection for Battered Women: An Analysis of State Statutes and Case Law (1993), 21 Hofstra L.Rev. 801, 836-837. The article summarizes those studies:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u201cSocial science research that documents violence in dating relationships supports offering broader civil protection order coverage to dating partners and adolescents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A study of teen dating violence found that roughly one in four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>students experienced actual violence, either as victims or as perpetrators.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A 1985 survey at a midwestern university found higher rates of violence in dating relationships than between married couples.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another study reported that 32% of domestic violence offenders are boyfriends or ex-boyfriends.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u201d (Footnotes renumbered.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">As these studies show, the offense of domestic violence arises out of the relationship itself, not the fact that the parties happen to share one address. As the court in <em>Holmes v. Wilson </em>(Nov. 9, 1994), Del.Fam.Ct., New Castle Cty. No. CN94-08637, 1994 WL 872663, unreported, at 1, stated, \u201cDomestic violence is an unusual outgrowth of an intimate relationship between a man and a woman. It has certain inherent characteristics which place the victim in a position of being extremely susceptible to violence at any given time and/or place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The General Assembly recognized the special nature of domestic violence when it drafted the domestic violence statutes. The provision allowing for the filing of a motion for a temporary protection order, R.C. 2919.26, provides that such a motion may be filed upon the filing of a complaint alleging a violation of R.C. 2919.25 (domestic violence) or any of the assault offenses if that assault involved a \u201cfamily or household member.\u201d R.C. 2919.26(A)(1). Clearly, the General Assembly believed that an assault involving a family or household member deserves further protection than an assault on a stranger. Therefore, we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>offense of domestic violence, as expressed in R.C. 2919.25(E)(1)(a) and related statutes, arises out of the relationship of the parties rather than their exact living circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Additionally, the wide-ranging definitions of \u201ccohabitant\u201d and \u201cfamily or household member\u201d in the context of domestic violence developed by various courts of appeals and trial courts in Ohio, as well as courts in other states, reflect this view that domestic violence arises out of the nature of the relationship itself, rather than the exact living circumstances of the victim and perpetrator. See, <em>e.g., State v. Miller </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (Sexual relations are not necessarily a requirement for cohabitation \u2014 living together with some regularity of functioning as husband and wife is sufficient.); <em>State v.

See, also, Comment, Criminal Protection Orders in Domestic Violence Cases: Getting Rid of Rats With Snakes (1996), 50 U. Miami L.Rev. 919, 926-927; Note, Michigan\u2019s Domestic Violence Laws: A Critique and Proposals for Reform (1995), 42 Wayne L.Rev. 227, 244; Suarez, Teenage Dating Violence: The Need for Expanded Awareness and Legislation (1994), 82 Cal.L.Rev. 423, 435; Klein <em>&amp; </em>Orloff, at 836-837. But, see, <em>State v. Hadinger </em>(1991), 61 Ohio App.3d 820, 573 N.E.2d 1191 (Cohabitation requires \u201cliving together,\u201d regardless of whether parties are of the opposite or the same gender.); <em>State v. Allen </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 116, 536 N.E.2d 1195, motion to certify record overruled (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 724, 533 N.E.2d 1063 (Common-law marriage-type of relationship is essential to a finding of cohabitation. Short period of living together without mutual support and without regarding the situation as a husband/wife situation is not cohabitation.); <em>State v. Linner </em>(M.C. 1996), 77 Ohio Misc.2d 22, 665 N.E.2d 1180 (\u201cCohabiting\u201d is generally defined as living together and functioning as a husband and a wife and includes homosexual couples.).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Having considered the above definitions of \u201ccohabitant\u201d and \u201cfamily or household member,\u201d we conclude that the essential elements of \u201ccohabitation\u201d are (1) sharing of familial or financial responsibilities and (2) consortium. R.C. 2919.25(E)(2) and related statutes. Possible factors establishing shared familial or financial responsibilities might include provisions for shelter, food, clothing, utilities, and/or commingled assets. Factors that might establish consortium include mutual respect, fidelity, affection, society, cooperation, solace, comfort, aid of each other, friendship, and conjugal relations. These factors are unique to each case and how much weight, if any, to give to each of these factors must be decided on a case-by-case basis by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>both Liggins and Williams testified that the inception of the violence was a fight over money problems. Based on this testimony, the court could have reasonably concluded that a relationship existed wherein the two commingled their assets, thus sharing certain familial or financial responsibilities. Liggins further testified that the two spent most of their nights together at Williams\u2019s residence, and that at one time she thought she might be pregnant with his child. Their relationship thus was based upon society and conjugal relations, and therefore included consortium. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in finding that Liggins and Williams were cohabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>We reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment on the issue of whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that Liggins and Williams were \u201cfamily or household members.\u201d Because we do not address the issue of Williams\u2019s right to counsel, the cause is remanded to the trial court for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-6\">Douglas, F.E.
