At issue is whether they needed to be. The commission and court of appeals answered this question in the negative. Both found that the hopper bin was not a \u201cconfined space,\u201d rendering Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-22(A) inapplicable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The interpretation of a specific safety requirement rests with the commission. <em>State ex rel. Jeep Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 83, 537 N.E.2d 215. Because it is a penalty against the employer, \u201cit must be strictly construed, and all reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the safety standard are to be construed against its applicability to the employer.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216, 1219. Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(B)(28) defines a \u201cconfined space\u201d as \u201can enclosure not intended for continuous employee occupancy, having limited means of ingress and egress and poor natural ventilation and which may contain hazardous contaminants or be oxygen deficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In this case, there is \u201csome evidence\u201d \u2014 indeed all the evidence establishes' \u2014 \u25a0 that the hopper was completely open on the top. This large opening, in the commission\u2019s view, provided sufficient natural ventilation to remove the machine from the ambit of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(B)(28). This finding was within the commission\u2019s discretion and is, alone, sufficient to render Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-22(A) inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
