We also adopt the recommendation of the board that applicant not be allowed to take the Ohio Bar Examination. Furthermore, we order that Nerren be forever precluded from reapplying for the privilege of practicing law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
