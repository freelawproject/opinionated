Appellants claim that the board did not substantially comply with R.C. 3317.14 during this period because it did not file the tutors\u2019 salary schedules it had adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">R.C. 3317.14 requires that each board of education participating in funds distributed under R.C. Chapter 3317 \u201cshall annually adopt a teachers\u2019 salary schedule with provision for increments based upon training and years of service.\u201d R.C. 3317.14 further requires that the adopted teachers\u2019 salary schedule in effect on October 15 of each year \u201cshall be filed with the superintendent of public instruction\u201d and that a copy of the schedule shall also be filed with the \u201ceducational service center superintendent, who thereupon shall certify to the treasurer of such local district the correct salary to be paid to each teacher in accordance with the adopted schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In <em>State ex rel. Chavis v. Sycamore City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 26, 32-33, 641 N.E.2d 188, 194-195, we held that tutors were entitled to be paid in accordance with teachers\u2019 salary schedules contained in collective bargaining agreements because they were filed and adopted in substantial compliance with R.C. 3317.14 when the teachers\u2019 salary schedules were the only adopted schedules containing provisions for \u201cincrements based upon training and years of service,\u201d and the schedules were filed with the Department of Education instead of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Appellants contend that under <em>Chavis, </em>they are entitled to be compensated in accordance with the negotiated salary schedules for classroom teachers because the tutors\u2019 salary schedules adopted by the board were not filed with either the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department of Education. Appellants\u2019 contention lacks merit for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">First, we recently rejected a similar contention in <em>State ex rel. Kabert v. Shaker Hts. City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 37, 676 N.E.2d 101. We noted that the adopted salary schedules contained provisions for increments based upon training and years of service and substantially complied with both R.C. 3317.13 and 3317.14, even though they were not filed because, among other reasons, \u201cR.C. 3317.14 does not condition payment under teachers\u2019 salary schedules adopted by the board on the act of filing.\u201d 78 Ohio St.3d at 42, 676 N.E.2d at 106. As in <em>Kabert, </em>the salary schedules adopted here for tutors on and after August 1989 contained increments based upon training and years of service and substantially complied with R.C. 3317.13 and 3317.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Second, the evident purpose of the filing requirement has been satisfied in this case. R.C. 3317.14 indicates that the primary rationale for the filing requirement is to ensure that teachers are being paid in accordance with the adopted salary schedule. Here, appellants presented no evidence that the board\u2019s failure to file tutors\u2019 salary schedules, which were based on the R.C. 3317.13(C) minimum teachers\u2019 salary schedule, ever resulted in appellants\u2019 not being paid in accordance with the duly adopted tutors\u2019 salary schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Third, as noted by the court of appeals, \u201cSince August, 1989, the Board indisputably adopted the additional salary schedule, entered into contracts and paid its teacher-tutors accordingly, contributed to the State Teachers Retirement System, and received its partial reimbursement from the state based upon the adopted, but not physically filed, teachers\u2019 salary schedule.\u201d Therefore, the state had notice of the amounts being paid appellants and reimbursed the board accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Finally, as the court of appeals further held, nothing in R.C. 3317.14 prevents a board of education from adopting more than one teachers\u2019 salary schedule as long as no teacher is paid less than the R.C. 3317.13(C) minimum salary and the schedules provide for increments based on training and years of service. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Burch v. Sheffield-Sheffield Lake City School Dist Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 216, 219, 661 N.E.2d 1086, 1089. Therefore, the board could properly recognize differences in certification requirements and duties between tutors and classroom teachers and adopt different salary schedules for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals correctly held that appellants were not entitled to be compensated pursuant to the negotiated classroom teachers\u2019 salary schedules rather than the duly adopted tutors\u2019 salary schedules for the period between August 1989 and the 1993-1994 school year. Appellants\u2019 first proposition of law is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\n<em>Learning Assistants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Appellants assert in their second proposition of law that they are entitled to be paid as classroom teachers for their services as learning assistants. R.C. 3319.30 precludes persons from receiving teachers\u2019 compensation where they have not obtained an appropriate certificate of qualification for the position as provided for by R.C. 3319.22. See <em>Chavis, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 30-32, 641 N.E.2d at 193-194. Consequently, these appellants are not entitled to the compensation given to classroom teachers, since they were not properly certificated. <em>Id.; </em>see, also, <em>State ex rel. Ekey v. Rocky River Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 530, 674 N.E.2d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Second, the court of appeals determined that appellants\u2019 activities established that they were educational aides rather than teachers when they worked as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>learning assistants. Former R.C. 3319.088 defined \u201ceducational aide\u201d as \u201cany nonteaching employee in a school district who directly assists a teacher * * * by performing duties for which a [teaching] certificate * * * is not required.\u201d (137 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1532.) Educational aides must have permits. R.C. 3319.088. They must be under the supervision or direction of a teacher, and they may not be used in place of classroom teachers. R.C. 3319.088.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Appellants do not dispute that persons with teaching certificates are not entitled to teachers\u2019 compensation for work performed as educational aides under R.C. 3319.088. See, <em>e.g., </em>Baker &amp; Carey, Baker\u2019s Ohio School Law 1996-97 Ed. (1996) 403-404, Section 8.04 (\u201cA person who acquires teacher certification while employed as an aide does not thereby become a teacher or become entitled to teacher-level pay.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. White v. Marion City Bd. of Edn. </em>(June 27, 1989), Marion App. No. 9-87-48, unreported, 1989 WL 71125 (\u201cR.C. 3319.088 prohibits a teacher\u2019s aide 'from being employed or being used in place of a teacher. Appellant argues that the corollary to the prohibition in R.C. 3319.088 is that there is a mandate to pay a teacher\u2019s rate of pay for teacher-related work. A reading of R.C. 3319.088 does not indicate that a teacher cannot be employed as a teacher\u2019s aide. In addition, while R.C. 3319.088 prohibits an aide from performing the duties of a teacher, it does not prescribe the remedy requested by the appellant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Instead, appellants contend that the court of appeals erred in determining that they acted as educational aides rather than teachers when they were employed as learning assistants. Appellants cite portions of testimony from appellees\u2019 witnesses to support appellants\u2019 claim that they acted as teachers in their learning assistant positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In essence, appellants request that we render a <em>de novo </em>determination of this evidentiary issue. Generally, an appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of a trial court where competent, credible evidence exists to support the judgment. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 411, 461 N.E.2d 1273, 1276. The court of appeals appointed a commissioner who held an evidentiary hearing concerning appellants\u2019 employment as learning assistants. Since the court of appeals, through its commissioner, was able to \u201cview the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice inflections, and use these observations in weighing the credibility of the proffered testimony,\u201d this court should defer to the court of appeals\u2019 determination if it is supported by competent, credible evidence. 10 Ohio St.3d at 80, 10 OBR at 410, 461 N.E.2d at 1276. There is no reason to exercise our discretionary, plenary authority in extraordinary writ actions to consider the evidence <em>de novo </em>in this appeal. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Natalina Food Co. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 562 N.E.2d 1383, 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Here, as the court of appeals determined, its conclusion that learning assistants employed by the board were educational aides rather than teachers is supported by \u201coverwhelming evidence.\u201d The evidence established that the board patterned the learning-assistant position after the R.C. 3319.088 definition of \u201ceducational aide,\u201d and that learning assistants\u2019 duties are significantly different from those performed by either classroom teachers or special education tutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Therefore, appellants are not entitled to be paid as classroom teachers for work they performed as learning assistants. Appellants\u2019 second proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The court of appeals thus properly held that appellants are not entitled to additional compensation as special education tutors or learning assistants after August 1989. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals granting appellants only a limited writ of mandamus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
