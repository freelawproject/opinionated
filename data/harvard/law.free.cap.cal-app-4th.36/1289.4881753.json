In its special verdict, the jury found that Myers had terminated Badih\u2019s employment because she was pregnant. On appeal, Myers contends that the judgment must be reversed because there is no fundamental public policy prohibiting discrimination on the basis of pregnancy by employers who are not subject to the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.). We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">On June 25, 1990, Badih filed a complaint against Myers alleging, among other things, that Myers had discriminated against her on the basis of race and pregnancy. The complaint also alleged that Badih had attempted to file a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing but that the department had refused to accept the complaint because Myers employed less than five people.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">At trial, Badih gave the following testimony: In January 1987, Badih, a recent immigrant from the West African nation of Sierra Leone, began working as a medical assistant in the offices of Myers, a medical doctor. About nine months later, she started dating Constantine Kalaveras. Myers, who disapproved of interracial relationships, referred to Kalaveras as \u201cthe White guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">In December 1988, Badih married Kalaveras. When Badih told Myers about the marriage, \u201c[h]e slapped on the table, stood up, and started yelling and hollering about what a mistake I\u2019ve made, how much I\u2019m going to regret this, and how disappointed he is in me, that he\u2019s never seen an African that . . . came to this country and started, you know, doing things I did, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>know, hanging\u2014marrying my husband and all that, having a White boyfriend and finally marrying him. [*][] And he gave me long lectures how marriages like that don\u2019t last and how they end up in tragedy and it\u2019s very bad, especially if children[] get involved and all that, and [he] just [got] so upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">On September 6, 1989, Badih told Myers that she was pregnant. According to Badih, Myers replied, \u201c T just can\u2019t believe you. I just don\u2019t know what to say to you anymore. It seems like everything I ever told you just went right in vain. [Fjirst you introduce me to this White guy, and then you marry him, and then you\u2019re having his baby. What\u2019s next? I can\u2019t take this anymore. If you told me you were going to get married and have babies, I wouldn\u2019t have hired you in the first place. I need an office girl when I need her, not a person that has responsibilities the way you do now. And ... I am just so sorry, but I don\u2019t think I can take this anymore. You\u2019re going to have to go.\u2019 \u201d Badih asked Myers whether he was serious. He told her that he was and that her last day would be September 15. On September 13, Myers threatened to call security if Badih did not leave immediately. Badih complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Myers denied that he had fired Badih because she was pregnant. According to Myers, Badih quit her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Following its deliberations, the jury found that Myers had not terminated Badih\u2019s employment on the basis of race but that he had terminated her employment on the basis of pregnancy. The jury awarded $20,226 in damages to Badih. The trial court subsequently granted Badih\u2019s motion for attorney fees. Myers has filed timely notices of appeal from both the judgment and the attorney fees order.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">A. <em>Wrongful Discharge in Contravention of Public Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">The principles governing a cause of action for wrongful discharge in contravention of public policy are well established. \u201cAn action in tort seeking damages for discharge from employment in contravention of public policy is an exception to the general rule, now codified in Labor Code section 2922, that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an employment is terminable at will.\u201d <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 129 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074], fn. omitted.) An employee is entitled to maintain such a tort action \u201cwhere an employer\u2019s discharge of [the] employee contravenes the dictates of fundamental public policy. [Citations.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number><em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 89 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373].) \u201c[C]ourts in wrongful discharge actions may not declare public policy without a basis in either constitutional or statutory provisions.\u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1095 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Myers contends that the judgment must be reversed because he is not subject to the FEHA, which he asserts contains the only constitutional or statutory provisions prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of pregnancy. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12926, subd. (o), 12940, 12945.) Myers relies on the California Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 121. In <em>Jennings, </em>an age discrimination case, the court considered \u201cwhether an employee to whom [FEHA] remedies are not available because her employer does not regularly employ five or more persons [(see <em>ante, </em>fn. 1)] may, nonetheless, maintain a common law tort action for damages for wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy stated in [the FEHA].\u201d (8 Cal.4th at p. 124.) The court concluded that the \u201cexemption of small employers from the FEHA ban on age discrimination was enacted simultaneously to, and is inseparable from, the legislative statement of policy. For that reason, <em>and because no other statute or constir tutional provision bars age discrimination, </em>. . . there presently exists no \u2018fundamental policy\u2019 which precludes age discrimination by a small employer. Thus, there is no independent basis for an action for tortious discharge in violation of policy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125, italics added.) Badih argues that <em>Jennings </em>is distinguishable on the ground that pregnancy discrimination in employment is a form of sex discrimination and, as such, is prohibited not only by the FEHA but also by article I, section 8 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The question of whether pregnancy discrimination in employment is a form of sex discrimination is not without controversy. In <em>Geduldig </em>v. <em>Aiello </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 484 [41 L.Ed.2d 256, 94 S.Ct. 2485], the United States Supreme Court, in the context of the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, concluded that \u201c[w]hile it is true that only women can become pregnant, it does not follow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification .... Normal pregnancy is an objectively identifiable physical condition with unique characteristics. Absent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>pregnancy from the coverage of legislation such as this on any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any other physical condition. [&lt;][] The lack of identity between the excluded disability [pregnancy] and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The program divides potential recipients into two groups\u2014pregnant women and non-pregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 496-497, fn. 20 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 265].) In <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1976) 429 U.S. 125, 133-140 [50 L.Ed.2d 343, 352-357, 97 S.Ct. 401], the court extended the reasoning of <em>Geduldig </em>to employment discrimination cases brought under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 United States Code section 2000e et seq. (Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Both the California Legislature and the United States Congress reacted swiftly to the <em>Gilbert </em>decision. In 1978, the California Legislature amended the Fair Employment Practices Act (later recodified as the FEHA) to add a provision specifically prohibiting pregnancy discrimination in employment. (See former Lab. Code, \u00a7 1420.35, now Gov. Code, \u00a7 12945; see generally, <em>Review of Selected 1978 California Legislation </em>(1978) 10 Pacific L.J. 463-464.) The provision states that it \u201cshall not be construed to affect any other provision of law relating to sex discrimination or pregnancy.\u201d (Former Lab. Code, \u00a7 1420.35, subd. (d), now Gov. Code, \u00a7 12945, subd. (d).) Also in 1978, the United States Congress amended Title VII to provide that \u201c[t]he terms \u2018because of sex\u2019 or \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k).) \u201cWhen Congress amended Title VII in 1978, it unambiguously expressed its disapproval of both the holding and the reasoning of the Court in the <em>Gilbert </em>decision.\u201d <em>(Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock </em>v. <em>EEOC </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 669, 678 [77 L.Ed.2d 89, 99, 103 S.Ct. 2622]; see also <em>California Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 272, 284-285 [93 L.Ed.2d 613, 625-626, 107 S.Ct. 683]; <em>Johnson Controls, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 517, 534-535 [267 Cal.Rptr. 158].)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The California Fair Employment and Housing Commission (Commission), which performs rulemaking and adjudicatory functions under the FEHA, has also concluded that pregnancy discrimination in employment is a form of sex discrimination. California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 7291.2, subdivision (d), promulgated in 1980, provides that \u201c[discrimination because of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions constitutes sex discrimination under Government Code section 12940,\u201d an FEHA provision prohibiting, among other things, sex discrimination in employment. The Commission\u2019s precedential decisions are in accord. (See <em>Dept. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number><em>Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>Save Mart </em>(1992) No. 92-01, FEHC Precedential Decs. 1992-1993, CEB 1, p. 8; <em>Dept. Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>Globe Battery </em>(1987) No. 87-19, FEHC Precedential Decs. 1986-1987, CEB 9, p. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In 1990, the California Legislature codified the Commission\u2019s understanding, amending the FEHA to provide that \u201c \u2018[s]ex\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.\u201d (See Gov. Code, former \u00a7 12926, subd. (j), now \u00a7 12926, subd. (o).) The amendment expressly states that it \u201cdoes not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, existing law.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 15, \u00a7 3, No. 1 Deering\u2019s Adv. Legis. Service, p. 88.) Simultaneously, the Legislature amended Government Code section 12945, the FEHA provision prohibiting pregnancy discrimination in employment. The amendment states that section 12945 \u201cshall not be construed ... in any way to diminish the coverage of pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth under any other provisions of [the FEHA], including subdivision (a) of [Government Code] Section 12940,\u201d which, as noted above, prohibits sex discrimination in employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">With this background in mind, we turn to the question at hand\u2014namely, whether pregnancy discrimination is a form of sex discrimination under article I, section 8 of the California Constitution. The only court to have addressed this question directly is a federal district court, which answered it affirmatively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>Merrell </em>v. <em>All Seasons Resorts, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1989) 720 F.Supp. 815.) We agree with that court\u2019s conclusion. With the exception of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s roundly disapproved decision in <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>429 U.S. 125, the statutes, regulations, and decisions discussed above strongly support the notion that pregnancy discrimination in employment should be treated as a form of sex discrimination. Although much of this authority arises in the context of the FEHA and Title VII, there is no reason why a different <em>definition </em>of sex discrimination should be applied in the context of article I, section 8. (See <em>Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 73, fn. 4 and p. 90 [relying on FEHA regulations and precedential decisions to conclude that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination under article I, section 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>In short, we. conclude that pregnancy discrimination is a form of sex discrimination under article I, section 8 of the California Constitution. Since article I, section 8 expresses a fundamental public policy against sex discrimination in employment <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 90-91), Badih was properly allowed to maintain her cause of action for wrongful discharge in contravention of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">B.-E<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">HI.

The parties agree that Myers does not regularly employ five or more persons and, hence, is not subject to the FEHA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">California Constitution, article I, section 8, provides as follows: \u201cA person may not be disqualified from entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment because of sex, race, creed, color, or national or ethnic origin.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In <em>Arriaga </em>v. <em>Loma Linda University </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1556 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 619], the Fourth District declined to consider the question of whether pregnancy discrimination is a form of sex discrimination under article I, section 8 of the California Constitution because the plaintiff had abandoned her article I, section 8 cause of action. (10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1559-1560, fn. 3 and p. 1561, fn. 5.) Other California decisions, although not addressing the question directly, suggest that it should be answered affirmatively.
