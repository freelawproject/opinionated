Warren, appeals from the judgment of the trial court ordering his continued commitment to the psychiatric security review board (board) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593. The acquittee claims that (1) the court did not apply the proper legal principles to the state\u2019s petition for an order of continued commitment, (2) the court improperly denied his motion to strike the board\u2019s report and (3) the evidence did not support the court\u2019s findings. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In 1971, the acquittee shot and killed his neighbor during an argument, and the state charged the acquittee with murder in the first degree. After a trial in 1974, a jury found him not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. The court committed him to the custody of the commissioner of mental health for a period of time not to exceed twenty-five years. On July 1, 1985, by operation of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-602, he was committed to the jurisdiction of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Before the acquittee\u2019s maximum term of confinement was to expire on May 24, 1999, the state filed a petition for an order for his continued commitment. The acquittee voluntarily extended his commitment until the time of the hearing on the state\u2019s petition. On September 20, 2001, the court granted the state\u2019s petition, thereby extending the commitment by three years. This court affirmed the judgment in <em>State </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>77 Conn. App. 564, 824 A.2d 849, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 907, 831 A.2d 253 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">On March 17, 2004, the state filed another petition for an order for the acquittee\u2019s continued commitment. The state represented in the petition that \u201creasonable cause exists to believe the acquittee remains mentally ill to the extent that his discharge at the expiration of his maximum term of commitment [on September 19, 2004] would constitute a danger to himself or others.\u201d The state also submitted a report generated by the board recommending that the court grant the state\u2019s petition for an order extending commitment by a term not to exceed five years. At the hearing on the state\u2019s petition, the state presented the testimony of Patrick K. Fox, a consulting forensic psychiatrist employed by the department of mental health and addiction services\u2019 division of forensic services. Fox testified that in his capacity at Connecticut Valley Hospital, he regularly has evaluated the acquittee\u2019s mental status. Fox testified concerning his evaluation of and conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>regarding the acquittee\u2019s mental status. The state also presented a December 23, 2004 report, prepared by Fox and his colleagues in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 17a-586, concerning the acquittee\u2019s mental status. The acquittee presented the testimony of Vladimir Coric, a psychiatrist who performed an independent evaluation of the acquittee\u2019s mental status. Coric testified concerning his method of evaluating the acquittee as well as his opinion concerning the acquittee\u2019s mental status. The acquittee also presented a \u201cvoluntary admission application,\u201d signed by him, as evidence that he intended to remain committed voluntarily for some time in the event that the court denied the state\u2019s petition. Following a hearing, the court granted the state\u2019s petition and continued the acquittee\u2019s commitment for a period not to exceed two years. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The acquittee first claims that the court did not apply the proper legal principles to the state\u2019s petition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The court made several findings concerning the acquittee\u2019s mental status. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that he had psychiatric disabilities that are reflected in the fact that he had \u201ccontinued difficulty managing his anger,\u201d \u201cremains mistrustful and suspicious of the motives of others,\u201d and \u201ccontinues to display [a] chronic, pervasive level [of] irritability and an increased sensitivity to perceive[d] slights.\u201d The court found by clear and convincing evidence that he had a mental illness that required inpatient treatment and supervision and that without such treatment and supervision, \u201che would pose a danger to himself or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">After the court orally rendered its decision, a transcript of which it subsequently signed and filed in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1, the acquittee asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the court to articulate, inter alia, whether it applied in its legal analysis \u201cthe definition of dangerousness set forth in [General Statutes \u00a7] 17a-495 (b) or the definition of dangerousness set forth in [General Statutes \u00a7] 17a-580 and <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>265 Conn. 697, 704-12, 830 A.2d 212 (2003).\u201d The court granted the motion to articulate and stated that it had applied the definition set forth in <em>March. </em>The court also stated that the state\u2019s burden of proof was the same as the burden of proof in a \u201ccivil commitment hearing.\u201d The court stated: \u201c[T]he state, for a continued commitment of an acquittee beyond his current definite period of commitment . . . bears the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the acquittee is currently mentally ill and a danger to himself or others, or is gravely disabled.\u201d The court further stated that the fact that the acquittee was a committed patient at the time of the hearing did not significantly affect its analysis. Rather, the court explained that the observations of the acquittee\u2019s conduct, wherever such observations occurred, affected its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The acquittee claims that the court \u201cerroneously applied the less stringent dangerousness standard set forth in . . . <em>March . . . </em>which applies to early discharge hearings.\u201d The acquittee claims that, in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 645 A.2d 965 (1994), the court should have applied \u201cthe civil commitment dangerousness standard\u201d in this continued commitmentproceeding. The issue is one of law, over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. See <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>96 Conn. App. 369, 375, 900 A.2d 548 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Our analysis begins with the controlling legislative enactments. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c) provides: \u201cIf reasonable cause exists to believe that the acquittee remains a person with psychiatric disabilities or mentally retarded to the extent that his discharge at the expiration of his maximum term of commitment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>constitute a danger to himself or others, the state\u2019s attorney, at least one hundred thirty-five days prior to such expiration, may petition the court for an order of continued commitment of the acquittee.\u201d \u201c \u2018Danger to himself or others\u2019 includes danger to the property of others . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We examine the standard of dangerousness set forth in <em>March, </em>as the court indicated that it applied this standard in reaching its decision. The acquittee in <em>March </em>appealed from the denial of her application, brought under \u00a7 17a-593 (a), for discharge from the jurisdiction of the board. <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 699. Among the claims raised by the acquittee on appeal was that the court \u201cfailed to apply the civil commitment standards for defining mental illness and dangerousness as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-495 in determining whether [she] was a person with \u2018psychiatric disabilities\u2019 who posed \u2018a danger to herself or others\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>supra, 699-700. The court rejected the claim, holding that the definition of dangerousness codified in \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies applied. Id., 709. The court stated: \u201cSection 17a-581-2 (a) (6) . . . defines \u201c \u2018[d]anger to self or to others,\u2019 \u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (5), as \u2018the risk of imminent physical injury to others or self,\u2019 including \u2018the risk of loss or destruction of the property of others.\u2019 The defendant\u2019s claim that the court should have used the more stringent standard reflected in the definition of dangerousness contained in the civil commitment statute is, therefore, unpersuasive because the regulation approved by our legislature expressly states the manner in which the board must construe dangerousness when deciding whether to grant or deny an acquittee\u2019s application for discharge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>supra, 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>By contrast, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 400, the acquittee appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment ordering his continued commitment to the board. The acquittee raised, inter alia, a constitutional challenge to the burden of proof to which the court held the state with regard to its petition for an order of continued commitment under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c). <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 419. In its analysis, our Supreme Court distinguished between two types of proceedings to which \u00a7 17a-593 applies, those related to a state\u2019s petition for continued commitment and those related to an acquittee\u2019s application for discharge from custody. Id., 420-21. The court agreed with the acquittee that it was improper for the trial court to have assigned him the burden of proving that \u201che is no longer insane or dangerous in proceedings brought [by the state] to renew his commitment after expiration of the maximum term of his initial commitment.\u201d Id., 419. The court reasoned that \u201c\u00a7 17a-593 (c) impliedly places a burden on the state to establish the need for continued commitment\u201d; id., 421; while \u201c[\u00a7 17a-593 (f)] expressly requires the <em>acquittee </em>to bear the burden of establishing his right to a <em>discharge </em>by a preponderance of the evidence before expiration of the maximum period of commitment . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 420-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Finding constitutional merit to the acquittee\u2019s claim, the <em>Metz </em>court concluded that the \u201cpresumption of dangerousness initially accompanying an acquittee\u201d does not continue past the maximum period of commitment authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1) (A). <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 425. The court further stated: \u201c[W]e conclude that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) impliedly imposes the same burden on the state at a hearing for the continued commitment of an acquittee beyond his current definite period of commitment as is imposed in a civil commitment hearing under [General Statutes] \u00a7 17a-498 (c); namely, to show by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>evidence that the acquittee is currently mentally ill and dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">As a preliminary matter, we disagree with the acquittee here insofar as he argues that <em>Metz </em>required the court to apply a standard of dangerousness different from the one defined in <em>March. </em>The acquittee makes much of the fact that <em>March </em>was an appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of an acquittee\u2019s application for discharge from the jurisdiction of the board and that <em>Metz, </em>like the present case, was an appeal from a trial court\u2019s order of continued commitment. We interpret <em>March </em>to stand unambiguously for the proposition that \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies defines the term \u201c[d] anger to self or to others\u201d as it appears in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (5). This was the relevant issue resolved in <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>supra, 265 Conn. <em>709. </em>Section 17a-580, a definitional section, applies to \u00a7 17a-593 (c), the legislative enactment on which the state based its petition for an order of continued confinement in the present case. The fact that \u00a7 17a-580 (5) likewise applies to actions concerning an acquittee\u2019s application for discharge from the jurisdiction of the board does not, in any way, lessen our reliance on <em>March </em>insofar' as it defines the statutory term at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The acquittee argues that <em>Metz </em>\u201cunequivocally\u201d required the court to apply the civil commitment standard of dangerousness, not the standard of dangerousness defined in <em>March. </em>We observe that <em>Metz </em>did not address the definition codified in \u00a7 17a-580 (5). That issue was resolved in <em>March. </em>At issue in <em>Metz </em>was the state\u2019s burden of proof in continued commitment proceedings, specifically, whether the presumption that an acquittee is dangerous should continue beyond the maximum period of commitment authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1) (A). We disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>acquittee that the court\u2019s holding in <em>Metz, </em>as relevant, went beyond this narrow issue. The court stated that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) imposed the same burden on the state as is imposed in a civil commitment hearing under \u00a7 17a-498 (c). Logically, we view the court\u2019s reference to civil commitment proceedings in <em>Metz </em>in its proper context; the court in <em>Metz </em>held that, as is the case in civil commitment proceedings, the presumption of dangerousness does not apply in proceedings for continued commitment. Simply put, we rely on the holding in <em>March </em>concerning the proper definition of \u00a7 17a-580 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">More importantly, to the extent that the acquittee argues that different standards of dangerousness apply to proceedings for continued commitment as opposed to civil commitment proceedings, the Supreme Court has resolved this issue to the contrary in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>277 Conn. 378, 890 A.2d 559 (2006). In <em>Harris, </em>the acquittee appealed from the trial court\u2019s granting of the state\u2019s petition for an order of continued confinement. Id., 380. Among several issues raised by the acquittee on appeal was that the trial court improperly had denied his motion to strike a report the board submitted to the court. Id. The acquittee claimed that the report was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial, in part because \u201cthe board applied the incorrect legal standard of dangerousness to the acquittee . . . .\u201d Id., 387. Specifically, the acquittee claimed that the board improperly applied the definition of dangerousness set forth in \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies rather than the definition applicable to civil commitment proceedings that is codified in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-495 (b). <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 388. Our Supreme Court rejected the acquittee\u2019s claim, holding that there was \u201cno legally significant difference between the definitions of dangerousness employed in board and civil commitment hearings.\u201d Id. The court also stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the trial court was required to apply the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d burden of proof to the case as a whole. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In the present case, the court stated that it applied the definition of dangerousness approved in <em>March, </em>which is based on the definition of dangerousness set forth in \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The court explicitly stated that it required the state to prove its case by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d On the basis of our Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>March </em>and <em>Harris, </em>we conclude that the court applied the proper legal principles in ruling on the state\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The acquittee next raises a multifaceted challenge to the court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike the board\u2019s report. The state filed the board\u2019s report in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (d). As he did before the trial court, the acquittee claims that (1) the report was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, (2) the report contained inadmissible hearsay, (3) the report constituted inadmissible \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d in violation of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), and (4) the admission of the report violated his procedural due process right to cross-examine adverse witnesses as well as his right to fundamental fairness. We will address each facet of the acquittee\u2019s claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The acquittee first claims that the report was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. The acquittee argues that, in reaching its recommendation for his continued commitment, the board applied \u201cthe less stringent dangerousness standard\u201d set forth in \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which, he argues, did not apply to the state\u2019s petition for continued confinement. The acquittee also argues that because the board\u2019s primary concern is the protection of society rather than his liberty interest, the board \u201cnecessarily undertook a flawed application of the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof\u2019 and was biased in favor of his continued commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u201cIt is well established that this court affords great deference to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. . . . The trial court\u2019s rulings on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the [appellant] of substantial prejudice or injustice. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">\u201cA party is entitled to offer any relevant evidence to aid the trier of fact in its determination, as long as the evidence is not unfairly prejudicial. . . . Relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. . . . [E]vidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the conclusion [for which it is offered], even to a slight degree. . . . [T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>fact that evidence is susceptible of different explanations or would support various inferences does not affect its admissibility, although it obviously bears upon its weight. So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u201cHowever, relevant evidence may be excluded if the court determines that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice .... Of course, [a] 11 adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the [party against whom it is offered] but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slade, 97 </em>Conn. App. 404, 409-10, 905 A.2d 689, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 931, 909 A.2d 959 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In part I, we held that the court properly applied to the state\u2019s petition the definition of dangerousness set forth in the board\u2019s regulations. On the basis of that analysis, we likewise conclude that the board properly relied on this same definition in preparing its report concerning the acquittee\u2019s mental state and dangerousness. The acquittee has not demonstrated that the board\u2019s report was either irrelevant or unduly prejudicial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 17a-584 provides in relevant part that the board\u2019s \u201cprimary concern is the protection of society . . . .\u201d The acquittee argues that because the court\u2019s predominant interest under the clear and convincing evidence standard should be his liberty, the board\u2019s application of the clear and convincing evidence standard in its report rendered its report irrelevant with regard to the issues before the court. The acquittee also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>claims that in light of the board\u2019s statutory mandate, the board was biased in favor of his continued commitment and, therefore, the report was unduly prejudicial. Our Supreme Court rejected a similar claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 389-91, and its analysis is instructive in the present case. Relying on the rationale of <em>Harris </em>and our thorough review of the board\u2019s report, we conclude that the report was clearly relevant because it contained a comprehensive expert assessment of the acquittee\u2019s mental state. See id., 390. Even if we were to assume that the board\u2019s report was biased in the manner that the acquittee suggests, we would conclude that such bias did not affect the admissibility of the report but was a matter concerning the weight the fact finder should afford it. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Further, we are not persuaded that the report was unduly prejudicial. \u201c[T]here are situations where the potential prejudicial effect of relevant evidence would suggest its exclusion. These are: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the [party against whom the evidence is offered], having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 391. The report did not concern distracting side issues or facts likely to arouse improper feelings within the fact finder. Further, because the report was prepared and submitted to the court in accordance with \u00a7 17a-593 (d), there is no basis to suspect that the acquittee did not anticipate it at the time of the hearing. The acquittee argues that the report was unduly prejudicial solely because the board\u2019s primary interest is the protection of society; this ground does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>not lead us to conclude that the report was unduly prejudicial. See id., 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The acquittee next claims that the court should have granted his motion to strike the report because it contained inadmissible hearsay. The acquittee argues that the report was submitted to prove the truth of the matters asserted within it, namely, that he was mentally ill, that he posed a danger to himself or to others and that in light of the applicable board regulations, his mental state required that the court grant the state\u2019s petition for an order of continued commitment. The acquittee argues that no exception to the hearsay rule applies to the report. The acquittee also argues that the report was before the court improperly because it \u201csets forth a legal conclusion on the ultimate issue that is submitted in the form of documentary evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 17a-581 created the board, an autonomous administrative body within the department of mental health and addiction services. Among the board\u2019s statutorily prescribed duties, the board plays a clearly defined role in matters, such as the present case, in which the state petitions the court for an order of continued commitment. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall forward . . . any petition for continued commitment of the acquittee to the board. The board shall, within ninety days of its receipt of the . . . petition, file a report with the court, and send a copy thereof to the state\u2019s attorney and counsel for the acquittee, setting forth its findings and conclusions as to whether the acquittee is a person who should be discharged. The board may hold a hearing or take other action appropriate to assist it in preparing its report.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (f) provides in relevant part: \u201cAfter receipt of the board\u2019s report and any separate examination reports, the court shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>promptly commence a hearing on the . . . petition for continued commitment. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Although it is by no means required to do so, the court, in its role as finder of fact in matters brought under \u00a7 17a-593, may properly credit the board\u2019s opinions and rely on its findings. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 712. \u201c[U]nder the acquittee statutory scheme, the board has general and specific familiarity with all acquittees beginning with their initial commitment and, therefore, is better equipped than courts to monitor their commitment. By placing oversight of these individuals in a single administrative agency, such as the board, which is comprised of laypersons and experts in relevant areas, including psychiatry, psychology, probation, and victim advocacy, the legislature reasonably could have believed that the board, with its expertise and familiarity with the mental status of each acquittee, would be better equipped than a court to monitor the individuals\u2019 recommitment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 536, 847 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The foregoing authorities reflect that the legislature imposed a duty on the board to submit its report to the court when a petition for continued commitment has been filed by the state. The acquittee challenges the report for containing an assessment of his mental state and a recommendation that the court grant the petition. The board\u2019s expert evaluation concerning these matters, however, is precisely what the legislature required the board to provide to the court. The legislature clearly has determined that the board\u2019s assessment is significant and necessary to the court\u2019s analysis in, among other cases, continued commitment actions. The acquittee has not challenged the validity of the legislative enactment requiring that the board prepare a report and submit it to the court. The report at issue fell within the requirements of this enactment. On the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>evidentiary objection raised, we will not reverse the court\u2019s denial of the acquittee\u2019s motion to strike.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The acquittee next claims that the board\u2019s report was inadmissible because it constituted \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 50-54 (holding that admission of testimonial hearsay in criminal cases violates sixth amendment\u2019s confrontation clause unless witness is unavailable and defendant had prior opportunity for cross-examination). The trial court rejected this claim, reasoning that the continued commitment proceeding was \u201cnot a criminal proceeding\u201d and, thus, did not implicate the principles enunciated in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 392-94, our Supreme Court rejected an acquittee\u2019s claim that the admission of a report prepared by the board in a continued commitment proceeding violated the principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Crawford. </em>The court concluded that \u201ccontinued commitment proceedings are not criminal prosecutions and, therefore, the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment does not apply and did not preclude the report\u2019s admission . . . .\u201d Id., 394. On the basis of the reasoning and holding in Harris, we reject the acquittee\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The acquittee also claims that even if sixth amendment protections did not apply to the recommitment proceeding, the admission of the report violated his \u201cprocedural due process right of cross-examination and right to fundamental fairness.\u201d The acquittee argues that his liberty interest was at stake, that the report contained the opinions of experts who did not testify and who were not subject to cross-examination, and that the expert opinion at issue addressed \u201cthe ultimate legal issue\u201d in the proceeding. The state contends that the acquittee was afforded constitutionally adequate due process by means of the procedures used in the proceeding. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The court rejected the acquittee\u2019s procedural due process claim. The issue of whether the admission of the report violated the acquittee\u2019s procedural due process rights is a question of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">\u201c[D]ue process is inherently fact-bound because due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. . . . The constitutional requirement of procedural due process thus invokes a balancing process that cannot take place in a factual vacuum. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court [has] set forth three factors [which our Supreme Court has followed] to consider when analyzing whether an individual is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>constitutionally entitled to a particular judicial or administrative procedure: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).... Due process analysis requires balancing the government\u2019s interest in existing procedures against the risk of erroneous deprivation of a private interest inherent in those procedures. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u201cThe fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard . . . [which] must be at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. . . . [T]hese principles require that a [party] have timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for [the proposed action], and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 395-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">With regard to the first <em>Mathews </em>factor, we recognize that the procedures that governed the acquittee\u2019s recommitment affected the acquittee\u2019s interest in liberty, a universally recognized and significant private interest. See id., 397; <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 524. With regard to the third <em>Mathews </em>factor, we recognize the state has a substantial interest \u201cin confining individuals who, as a result of mental illness, pose a potential danger to themselves or others.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 524. Mindful of these substantial interests, we turn to an analysis of the second <em>Mathews </em>factor, asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>whether the procedures used posed a risk of an erroneous deprivation of the acquittee\u2019s liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The record reveals that the state initiated this action by filing a petition with the Superior Court for the acquittee\u2019s continued commitment. The board thereafter held a conference during which it evaluated the acquittee\u2019s mental status in accordance with \u00a7 17a-593 (d), which provides in relevant part that the board \u201cmay hold a hearing or take other action appropriate to assist it in preparing its report.\u201d The report submitted by the board reflects that the board based its opinions on information provided to the board by the acquittee\u2019s treatment providers at Connecticut Valley Hospital, where the acquittee is confined. After the board submitted its report, the acquittee\u2019s public defender filed notice of his intent to perform a separate examination of the acquittee, as provided for in \u00a7 17a-593 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In January, 2005, the court held an evidentiary hearing during which both parties presented evidence. As discussed previously, the state presented testimony from Fox, a board certified forensic psychiatrist who treated the acquittee at Connecticut Valley Hospital, as well as a report prepared by Fox and his colleagues in accordance with \u00a7 17a-586. Through his public defender, the acquittee presented the testimony of Coric, the psychiatrist who performed an independent evaluation of the acquittee\u2019s mental status. Coric opined that the acquittee was not a danger to himself or to others and that his discharge, while receiving treatment, was advisable. In addition to presenting expert testimony that conflicted with that presented by the state, the record reflects that at the recommitment hearing, the acquittee\u2019s public defender both had the opportunity to and did vigorously cross-examine Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Our review of the procedures employed in this case reveals that they did not pose a risk of an erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>deprivation of the acquittee\u2019s liberty. The board\u2019s report was not subject to deferential treatment by the court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 398. As we held in part I, the court held the state to its proper burden, which was to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the acquittee is currently mentally ill and dangerous to himself or others or that he is gravely disabled. The acquittee availed himself of his opportunity to present to the trial court an independent, and favorable, assessment of his mental status and dangerousness. Further, through his public defender, the acquittee availed himself of his right to cross-examine the state\u2019s expert at the recommitment hearing. The procedures used included adequate notice and statutory safeguards. The procedures also permitted the acquittee to be heard and to challenge the state\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The acquittee argues specifically that his procedural due process rights were violated in that members of the board rendered opinions in the report and \u201c[were] not subject to cross-examination.\u201d The acquittee couches his claim in terms of his procedural due process right to cross-examination. Obviously, the acquittee could not, in the customary sense, cross-examine witnesses who were not called to testify by his adversary, the state. In the context of a recommitment hearing, the submission of the board\u2019s report is required by statute. The state is not required either to rely on the report in presenting its case or to call the report\u2019s authors, the relevant members of the board, to testify. Further, there is no requirement that any of the report\u2019s authors be present to testify as to the determinations in the report.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a purely practical matter, procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>due process in this context does not entail a right to cross-examine the members of the board if the state does not call such persons to testify. Rather, in this context, procedural due process concerns focus on whether the procedures used afforded the acquittee an opportunity to challenge the content of the report in accordance with our rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">As we already have discussed, the procedures used afforded the acquittee an opportunity to present to the court an independent assessment of his mental status and dangerousness, thereby challenging the contrary opinions expressed in the report. The state, to some degree, relied on the report, and the acquittee had an opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the state and an opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses called by the state. The acquittee also had a right to subpoena witnesses, including the members of the board, for the purpose of challenging the facts and opinions set forth in the report or to impeach its authors. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-4 et seq. The fact that the acquittee did not call any board members to testify reflects a tactical decision on his part rather than the existence of any procedural obstacle that prohibited him from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Accordingly, we are persuaded that the procedures used in this case adequately diluted any risk of an erroneous deprivation of the acquittee\u2019s liberty and that the acquittee was provided with constitutionally adequate procedural due process. In light of the opportunity that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the acquittee had to challenge the matters and opinions contained in the report, which was not unduly prejudicial, we likewise conclude that he also has failed to demonstrate that the admission of the board\u2019s report was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Finally, the acquittee claims that the evidence did not support the court\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence that he was a danger to himself or to others to the extent justifying his continued commitment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The court stated: \u201c[The acquittee] has a continued difficulty managing his anger and remains mistrustful and suspicious of the motives of others. He continues to display [a] chronic, pervasive level [of] irritability and an increased sensitivity to perceive [d] slights. He needs his current structure, treatment and intervention. His axis I personality changes and substance abuse factor and his axis II antisocial personality disorder still exist. Therefore, this court does find, by clear and convincing evidence, that [the acquittee] has a mental illness and continues to require inpatient treatment and supervision for that illness and without [such treatment and supervision] he would pose a danger to himself or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">\u201cThe determination as to whether an acquittee is currently mentally ill to the extent that he would pose a danger to himself or the community if discharged is a question of fact and, therefore, our review of this finding is governed by the clearly erroneous standard. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Corr, </em>87 Conn. App. 717, 722, 867 A.2d 124, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 929, 873 A.2d 998 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The acquittee does not appear to challenge the court\u2019s findings with regard to the existence or extent of his psychiatric disability. The evidence before the court established the extent of the acquittee\u2019s mental illness; Coric, the psychiatrist called to testify by the acquittee, testified that the acquittee has a chronic mental illness that requires lifelong treatment. The acquittee takes issue with the court\u2019s finding that his disability causes him to be dangerous to the extent that recommitment is warranted. Specifically, the acquittee argues that the evidence did not reflect that he had engaged in any acts of physical aggression since the time of his first recommitment and that there was evidence that he \u201ccan transition into the community over time as a voluntary committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The acquittee accurately argues that there was no evidence that he engaged in any acts of physical aggression since the time of his first recommitment. This fact, however, does not detract from the court\u2019s assessment of his dangerousness. The court had before it evidence that the acquittee had a long history of mental illness characterized by anger, aggression and paranoia. It is undisputed that these same symptoms, directly related to his incapacity to manage anger, were reflected in the acquittee\u2019s conduct in 1971 for which he was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The board represented that the acquittee had made \u201csome clinical gains\u201d since the time of his first recommitment and that he was \u201c[a]n active and cooperative participant in treatment groups . . . .\u201d The board also represented that the acquittee acknowledged that alcohol was a factor in his criminal conduct and that he has expressed a commitment to refrain from alcohol or drug use. Both Fox and Coric discussed the fact that the acquittee had made progress in his treatment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>acquittee has also recognized the need for treatment for his mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Despite evidence of some progression in the acquittee\u2019s treatment, there was overwhelming evidence before the court that the symptoms related to the acquittee\u2019s mental illness persisted to a significant degree at the time of the hearing. The board detailed the fact that the acquittee often exhibited \u201can undertone of suspiciousness and mistrust\u201d toward those with whom he came in contact, as well as the fact that the acquittee frequently \u201cmisperceives the intentions of others.\u201d The board noted that in response to such events as the sequence in which hospital staff dispenses medications to patients and the type of snacks offered by the hospital dietary service, the acquittee responds angrily in a way that \u201cis typically in excess of that which one would expect from the general population.\u201d The board recounted other instances of the acquittee\u2019s frequent conflicts with hospital staff over trivial matters. In one instance, the acquittee approached a staff nurse with \u201chis face red\u201d and spoke to her in a loud and angry voice. In another instance, the acquittee accused a nurse of removing a quilt from his bed and thereafter accused hospital staff of conspiring against him. The board cited these incidents as examples of how the acquittee typically misinterprets social cues, mistakenly infers a malicious intent on behalf of other persons and adopts \u201ca persistent stance of being the subject of mistreatment.\u201d The board further stated that these instances, which occur regularly, involve the acquittee exhibiting anger as a result of his incapacity to perceive accurately the intentions of others as well as his incapacity to control his angry response, which ranges \u201cfrom mild irritation to frank rage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The board represented the following in its report: \u201c[The acquittee\u2019s] level of functioning and perceiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the world around him remains paranoid. His misinterpretation of social situations and the invocation of intentionality into the actions of others where it clearly does not exist remain. [The acquittee\u2019s] limited coping mechanisms to deal with these suspicious and paranoid beliefs and limited capacity to modulate the strong emotions that he consequently experiences causes him to remain a risk to others. These distorted beliefs are exactly the same behavioral patterns that led to the crime for which he was acquitted, placing him under the jurisdiction of the [b]oard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Fox testified that in the absence of the acquittee\u2019s current treatment structure, the acquittee remained a danger to himself or to others. Fox testified that instances of the acquittee\u2019s frustration and anger have not diminished despite the fact that the acquittee has had an improved capacity to learn to resolve such difficulties on his own. Importantly, Fox testified that there is a continued need for hospital staff to intervene in order to assist the acquittee in halting the progression of his anger. Fox recounted his knowledge of recent incidents in which the acquittee has expressed an unreasonable degree of anger over benign or trivial matters. As Fox testified, during these incidents the acquittee has exhibited \u201ca reddened face, glaring eyes, speaking in a loud tone or pointing his finger such that the people who are witnessing this are describing feeling threatened or concerned.\u201d Fox testified that the acquittee required medication and treatment to assist him in recognizing and stopping the escalation of angry feelings. Fox testified that serious questions remained as to whether the acquittee possessed the ability to suppress his anger absent intervention from others and whether it was probable that the acquittee could become violent absent supervision \u201cin the community.\u201d Fox further testified that transitioning the acquittee into the community was a necessary goal of hospital staff and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>his caretakers were working on a plan to help him with such a transition at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u201cIn reaching its difficult decision [as to an acquittee\u2019s dangerousness], the court may and should consider the entire record available to it, including the [acquittee\u2019s] history of mental illness, his present and past diagnoses, his past violent behavior, the nature of the offense for which he was prosecuted, the need for continued medication and therapy, and the prospects for supervision if released.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Putnoki, </em>200 Conn. 208, 221, 510 A.2d 1329 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Although the record does not reveal any acts of physical aggression since the time of the acquittee\u2019s first recommitment, we conclude that the record reveals that the acquittee continues to exhibit symptoms from which a court could draw the conclusion that he is dangerous to the extent that continued commitment is warranted. \u201c[T]he determination of dangerousness in the context of a mental status hearing reflects a societal rather than a medical judgment, in which the rights and needs of the [acquittee] must be balanced against the security interests of society.\u201d Id., 221. Although expert medical testimony may be helpful to the court, the issue is one to be resolved by the court rather than by medical professionals; the court is called on to evaluate evidence of an acquittee\u2019s mental state to distinguish between the potentially dangerous and the harmless individual, giving \u201cpriority to the public safety ramifications of releasing from confinement an individual who has already shown a propensity for violence.\u201d Id., 220-21. There is no bright line test for evaluating dangerousness and predicting an acquittee\u2019s future behavior, and our courts have recognized that the definition of dangerousness is \u201cnecessarily vague . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Here, the court was presented with evidence concerning the acquittee\u2019s interactions with others. This evidence demonstrated that the acquittee has significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>problems in perceiving accurately the world around him. These problems typically lead to his exhibiting strong emotions, responses characterized by rage and anger, in response to trivial problems. The acquittee exhibited this type of conduct when he shot and killed a neighbor during a dispute over the neighbor\u2019s use of fireworks, the conduct for which he was acquitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 566. The court, mindful of its legal obligation to consider public safety, reasonably concluded that serious questions remained concerning the acquittee\u2019s ability to interact with others in a safe and reasonable manner. Specifically, the evidence raised serious questions concerning the acquittee\u2019s ability to manage on his own the symptoms of his mental illness, which includes his anger. The evidence demonstrated that the acquittee responds adequately to treatment, specifically, anger management treatment, in the hospital setting. In light of the evidence and expert opinion before the court, however, this fact did not legally or logically require a conclusion that such treatment during a court-imposed term of recommitment was no longer necessary for the acquittee\u2019s well-being or to protect society. On the basis of the evidence, the court reasonably concluded that the acquittee posed a danger to himself or to others such that continued commitment was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Further, the acquittee\u2019s argument that the evidence reflected that he could transition into the community \u201cover time as a voluntary committee\u201d is not persuasive. Fox testified that it remained a treatment goal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the acquittee be transitioned into the community. Fox testified that medical personnel were working with the acquittee, both to assist him in developing strategies to reduce his anger and to develop a plan to place him back into the community while under the monitoring and treatment of the board. Fox did not opine that the acquittee was a person who should be discharged to live in the community. Coric, to the contrary, testified that the acquittee was \u201cready to be transitioned into the community\u201d in a gradual manner. Coric opined that if the acquittee took his medications and received the appropriate treatment, he would not pose a danger to himself or to others. There also was evidence before the court that the acquittee had signed a voluntary commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Certainly, the court was free to reject Coric\u2019s testimony and reach its own conclusion concerning the acquittee\u2019s readiness to be discharged and whether the acquittee posed a danger to himself or to others. Even if we assume arguendo that the acquittee was prepared to remain committed voluntarily for a period of time and that there was <em>some </em>chance that he could be transitioned into the community successfully, while receiving treatment for his mental illness, these facts would not have any bearing on the court\u2019s reasonable conclusion that he posed a significant danger to himself or to the community such that recommitment was warranted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> At oral argument before this court, the acquittee, while acknowledging our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Harris, </em>also argued that the fact that the trial court appeared to believe that there was a substantive difference between the definition of dangerousness employed in board and civil commitment proceedings itself suggested that the court misapplied the law. We already have determined that the definition that the court expressly relied on was legally proper. In light of the relevant holding in <em>Harris, </em>as well as our review of the court\u2019s ruling and subsequent articulation, we are not persuaded by this aspect of the acquittee\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> The acquittee also characterizes the report as improper because it \u201csets forth a legal conclusion on the ultimate issue\u201d that, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, he has a mental illness that requires inpatient treatment and supervision, and that without such care, he poses a danger to himself or to others. The report was not inadmissible on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">First, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (d) requires the board to \u201c[set] forth its findings and conclusions as to whether the acquittee is a person who should be discharged. . . .\u201d This enactment expressly requires the board to submit a legal conclusion to the court. Second, even were this not the case, our rules of evidence do not always prohibit an expert witness from giving an opinion that embraces an ultimate issue. Such an opinion is admissible \u201cwhere the trier of fact needs expert assistance in deciding the issue.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-3 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Such is the case here; our decisional law characterizes as difficult the task of the trial court in evaluating an acquittee\u2019s mental state and evaluating his dangerousness. \u201cIt is, of course, not easy to predict future behavior. . . . Predictions of future dangerousness are difficult for both psychiatrists and the courts to make because of the inherent vagueness of the concept itself, and such determinations must be dealt with by trial courts to a considerable extent on a case-by-case basis.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>69 Conn. App. 666, 678, 798 A.2d 974 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-5\"> In contrast, when a trial court orders a competency evaluation of a criminal defendant, our law requires the examiner or examiners to prepare a written report and submit the report to the court, which causes the report to be delivered to the parties. General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (d). General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (e) further provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall hold a hearing as to the competency of the defendant no later than ten days after the court receives the written report. Any evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>competency, including the written report, may be introduced at the hearing by either the defendant or the state. <em>If the written report is introduced, at least one of the examiners shall be present to testify as to the determinations in the report </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) As this enactment reflects, the legislature has, in somewhat analogous circumstances, required that the author of a report submitted to the court be present for examination.

Nevertheless, an \u201cacquittee\u2019s past violent behavior and the nature of the offense of which he was acquitted are not irrelevant factors in determining current dangerousness.\u201d <em>State v.
