General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (a) provides: \u201cNo employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Here, the employer voluntarily agreed, at an informal hearing held pursuant to the act, to accommodate the employee\u2019s need for physical therapy following a work-related injury but later discharged the employee, stating that the physician\u2019s note substantiating her medical need for continued physical therapy did not conform to the parameters of the agreement. The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner concluded that the employer\u2019s stated reason for discharging the employee was a pretext for a discriminatory discharge. We affirm the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The plaintiff, Mary K. Moran, claims that she was discharged by the defendant, Media News Group, Inc., in violation of \u00a7 31-290a after she made use of an informal hearing to request a workplace accommodation to which the defendant\u2019s agent agreed. The commissioner concluded, largely on the basis of credibility determinations, that the defendant wrongfully discharged the plaintiff for exercising her right to reasonable and necessary medical care. The defendant appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the decision, claiming that the commissioner improperly (1) found that (a) \u00a7 31-290a required the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>provide the plaintiff with a workplace accommodation, (b) the plaintiff was exercising her right to medical care by requesting an accommodation, (c) the plaintiff should have been told that she was expected to report to the main office when her request for an accommodation was denied and (d) a violation of \u00a7 31-290a occurred, \u201cwhen the only evidence was that the [defendant] restored [the plaintiff] to her former position,\u201d (2) refused to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to correct and (3) awarded damages on an assumption rather than on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The following facts, as found by Commissioner Michelle D. Truglia,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> form the basis of the defendant\u2019s claim. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant, which publishes The Connecticut Post (newspaper). On February 8, 2002, the plaintiff suffered a trimalleolar fracture-dislocation of her left ankle at work. At the time, the plaintiff was the newspaper\u2019s New Haven County editor, having been employed by the defendant for twenty-seven years. She performed her duties in the defendant\u2019s main office in Bridgeport (newsroom), where she was responsible for covering news in the lower Naugatuck Valley and greater Milford areas and supervising six reporters. The defendant also had satellite offices in Derby (Derby bureau) and Milford.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The plaintiffs recovery was slow, and she was absent from the newsroom for twelve weeks. After each appointment with her physician, the plaintiff reported the progress of her recovery to her supervisor, Michael Daly, who was the newspaper\u2019s managing editor. The plaintiff received a letter dated April 24, 2002, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Sharon Ferguson, the defendant\u2019s human resource manager, informing her that she had exhausted all of her medical leave<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that she must return to work or her employment would be terminated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although she continued to receive physical therapy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff returned to work, full-time without restrictions, on May 2, 2002.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the month of May, 2002, the defendant permitted the plaintiff to perform her duties in the Derby bureau one day a week, as a partial accommodation of her physical therapy appointments in Shelton.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On May 30,2002, an informal hearing was held before Commissioner Robin L. Wilson, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-297a. The subject of the informal hearing was to determine whether the defendant would permit the plaintiff to increase the number of days that she performed her duties in the Derby bureau from one to two to accommodate her physical therapy schedule. Timothy Bishop, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and Ferguson attended the informal hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Commissioner Wilson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>notes indicate that an agreement was reached by the parties, to wit, \u201c[the plaintiff] to work up to two days out of the [Derby bureau] upon submission of medical substantiation of continued restrictions and need for physical therapy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The agreement limited the accommodation to six weeks duration. Nothing in Commissioner Wilson\u2019s notes, or other portions of the record of the informal hearing, indicates that the defendant objected in any way to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Believing that an agreement had been reached at the informal hearing, the plaintiff reported the agreement to Daly and her assistant editor, Edward Crowder, and obtained medical substantiation (note) from Mark E. Wilchinsky, her treating orthopaedic surgeon. The May 30,2002 note stated: \u201cIn order for the patient to recover, she will need to work in the proximity to the location where she gets [physical therapy three times a week] (Derby).\u201d Although the note stated that the plaintiff needed physical therapy three times a week for an unspecified period of time, the plaintiff acknowledged that the defendant had agreed to permit her to work in the Derby bureau only two days a week for six weeks. When she received the note, the plaintiff attempted to explain to Ferguson the discrepancy between it and the agreement, but she was denied the opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">On June 4, 2002, Ferguson and Frank Keegan, editor of the newspaper, met with the plaintiff. At the meeting, Keegan handed the plaintiff a memorandum (termination memo), which informed her that that day was her last day of employment. The termination memo referred to the note that stated that the plaintiff needed to work in proximity to her physical therapist and that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>required physical therapy three times a week. The stated basis <em>of </em>her discharge was the note\u2019s failure to indicate when she could return to work in the newsroom.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The termination memo made no mention of the agreement reached at the informal hearing to limit the plaintiffs request to six weeks. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was permitted to resume her normal duties at the newsroom after her request for an accommodation was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The plaintiff filed a claim with the workers\u2019 compensation commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a (b) (2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A formal hearing on the plaintiffs claim of unlawful discrimination was held on August 13 and November 5, 2003, and February 4, 2004, before Commissioner Truglia, who issued a finding and award dated August 5, 2004, concluding that the plaintiff had been discharged wrongfully under \u00a7 31-290a for exercising her right to reasonable and necessary medical care. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>appealed. On December 1, 2004, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Thereafter, the commissioner opened the record on July 21, 2005, to hear evidence as to the plaintiffs claim for damages. In a finding dated February 17, 2006, the commissioner awarded the plaintiff damages of $165,726.48, reinstatement to a position of similar seniority, responsibility, salary, work hours and conditions to that which she had at the time her employment was terminated, as well as attorney\u2019s fees of $55,242.16. The defendant filed the present appeal. Additional facts will be discussed as we consider the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The defendant has raised four claims that the commissioner\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. It claims that the commissioner improperly found that (a) \u00a7 31-290a required it to provide the plaintiff with a workplace accommodation, (b) the plaintiff was exercising her right to medical care by requesting an accommodation, (c) the plaintiff should have been told that she was expected to report to the newsroom when her request for an accommodation was denied and (d) the defendant violated \u00a7 31-290a because \u201cthe only evidence was that the [defendant] restored the plaintiff to her former position.\u201d We conclude that the commissioner\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">We first determine our standard of review. \u201cCases involving claims of discriminatory retaliation brought pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a . . . are employment discrimination actions, which are usually filed as plenary civil actions in the Superior Court.\u201d <em>Mele </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>270 Conn. 751, 766, 855 A.2d 196 (2004). Our Supreme Court has looked to federal case law to determine \u201cwhat standard of review was appropriate in an employment discrimination case, when such cases present mixed questions of both law and fact.\u201d Id., 767; see <em>Brittell </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Dept. of Correction, </em>247 Conn. 148, 164-65, 717 A.2d 1254 (1998) (discussing relevant federal case law). It \u201cconcluded that under the fact-bound nature of determinations regarding what actions, as a matter of law, may constitute employment discrimination, a clearly erroneous standard was most appropriate. . . . Under such a standard, [a] finding ... is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mele </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 767. Under this standard, an appellate court \u201cdoes not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Valdes </em>v. <em>Yankee Casting Co., </em>94 Conn. App. 140, 145, 891 A.2d 994 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Claims of employment discrimination are evaluated under the burden shifting analysis set forth in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 53-54, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). <em>See Mele v. Hartford, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 766. \u201cSection 31-290a (a) prohibits an employer from discharging or otherwise discriminating against an employee because the employee had filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised her rights under the act.\u201d Id., 767. \u201cThe plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. ... In order to meet this burden, the plaintiff must present evidence that gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. ... If the plaintiff meets this initial burden, the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence of a legitimate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. ... If the defendant carries this burden of production, the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted, and the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity. . . . The plaintiff then must satisfy her burden of persuading the factfinder that she was the victim of discrimination either directly by persuading the [fact finder] . . . that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 768. The plaintiff, however, bears the ultimate burden of proving that the defendant intentionally discriminated against her. Id., 768-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u201cUnder the <em>[Ford] </em>burden-shifting analysis, establishing a prima facie case of discrimination creates a presumption that the defendant acted illegally. ... To establish a presumption is to say that a finding of the predicate fact (here the prima facie case) produces a required conclusion in the absence of explanation .... To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under \u00a7 31-290a, the plaintiff must show that she was exercising a right afforded her under the act and that the defendant discriminated against her for exercising that right.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u201c[T]he plaintiff must show a causal connection between exercising her rights under the act and the alleged discrimination she suffered. Implicit in this requirement is a showing that the defendant knew or was otherwise aware that the plaintiff had exercised her rights under the act. See <em>Cifra </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>252 F.3d 205, 216 (2d Cir. 2001) (to establish prima facie case of discrimination, the plaintiff must first present sufficient evidence . . . that is, evidence sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find [1] that she engaged in protected [activity] ... [2] that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>employer was aware of this activity, [3] that the employer took adverse action against the plaintiff, and [4] that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action, i.e., that a retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment action).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mele </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 776.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The defendant first claims that the commissioner improperly found that the act required it to provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>plaintiff with a workplace accommodation. We do not agree that the commissioner found that the defendant was required to provide a workplace accommodation for the plaintiff. On the basis of our review, we have concluded that the defendant improperly terminated the plaintiffs employment because she made use of an informal hearing, as provided under \u00a7 31-297a of the act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to request an accommodation for her physical therapy needs and that the defendant voluntarily entered into the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. At the formal hearing, Bishop testified that an agreement had been reached at the informal hearing consistent with Commissioner Wilson\u2019s notes that the plaintiff could work in the Derby bureau two days a week for six weeks; Ferguson, however, denied that an agreement had been reached. According to Ferguson, she returned to the newsroom after the informal hearing and discussed the plaintiffs request for an accommodation with Keegan and Robert Laska, president of the defendant and publisher of the newspaper. Laska testified that he could not recall the discussion. The commissioner found that Keegan was not in the newsroom that day. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>had no substantive discussions with Ferguson or Keegan between the time of the informal hearing and the date Keegan terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The commissioner concluded that as the defendant\u2019s human resource manager and its representative at the informal hearing, Ferguson had an obligation to report the six week accommodation agreement to Keegan before termination of the plaintiffs employment was considered. The commissioner also concluded that the termination memo that was handed to the plaintiff at the June 4, 2002 meeting indicated that Keegan\u2019s principal concern was the open-ended nature of the plaintiffs need for physical therapy. Ferguson was privy to the termination memo and knew that the stated basis of the termination was inconsistent with the agreement, which provided that the plaintiff could work in the Derby bureau two days a week for six weeks. The commissioner concluded, therefore, that Ferguson either deliberately failed to report that the agreement was limited to six weeks or that Keegan deliberately ignored the six week limitation when he wrote the termination memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The commissioner further concluded that there was no credible evidence that the plaintiff posed her request for an accommodation as an ultimatum. Also, the commissioner concluded that if the defendant denied the plaintiffs request, the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation that she would be allowed to return to her regular duties in the newsroom. Instead, she was given a prepared termination memo and five checks representing salary and back pay. An open-ended need for physical therapy, which both Keegan and Ferguson knew or should have known was inconsistent with the agreement, was in the commissioner\u2019s view a pretext to terminate the plaintiffs employment simply for making use of an informal hearing to request an accommodation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to attend physical therapy. The commissioner concluded that the plaintiff was attempting to pursue \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d medical care under the provisions of the act at the time of the termination of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The defendant argues that it had no duty to accommodate the plaintiffs request to perform her duties in the Derby bureau two days a week for six weeks. We agree. \u201cThe act . . . does not afford an employee the general right to be afforded reasonable accommodations for her physical disabilities.\u201d Id., 772.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cNo provision of the act affords an employee the right to have specific office space, proximal parking or exemption from work tasks. Whether the plaintiff had physician-ordered restrictions does not affect this conclusion.\u201d Id., 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The defendant relies on <em>Mele </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 751, to support its claim that it did not terminate the plaintiffs employment for a discriminatory reason. The facts of <em>Mele, </em>however, are not the facts of this case. The plaintiff in <em>Mele </em>filed a \u00a7 31-290a claim, asserting that her direct supervisors had discriminated against her for exercising her rights under the act. Due to the alleged discrimination, she claimed that she was forced to take an mpaid leave of absence from her job as a guidance comselor for the defendant\u2019s board of education. Id., 755. In reversing the decision of the commissioner in that case, our Supreme Court made clear that the \u201cact is not a general reasonable accommodations piece of legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 772. Furthermore, on the facts of the case, our Supreme Court concluded that the accommodations the plaintiff requested were made as a matter of her employment, i.e., transfer to another school, paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>sabbatical, sick time, and not pursuant to the benefits to which she was entitled under the act. Id., 771-74. She never invoked the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-313. <em>Mele </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 773. Furthermore, her supervisors were unaware that she had received benefits under the act years before. Id., 761-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The facts of this case are more like those in <em>Cable </em>v. <em>Bic Corp., </em>79 Conn. App. 178, 830 A.2d 279 (2003), aff'd, 270 Conn. 433, 854 A.2d 1057 (2004). In <em>Cable, </em>the plaintiff had been employed by the defendant corporation for thirty-two years and had sustained several work-related injuries; id., 179-80; and the parties had entered into several voluntary agreements related to compensation and disabilities to the plaintiffs hands. After the plaintiffs fourth surgery in March, 2000, she returned to light duty work, but the position later was eliminated and combined with another one that the employer declined to give to her. In January, 2001, the plaintiff worked as an ink inspector after the employer made some minor modifications to the position to accommodate her disabilities, but she was unable to attain the rapidity the employer wanted. The employer never gave the plaintiff a written warning about her performance and laid her off. Id., 180-81. The commissioner\u2019s award stated that the plaintiff was \u201centitled to reinstatement of employment because her separation from work was a discriminatory discharge under [\u00a7 31-290a].\u201d Id., 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The plaintiffs supervisor had stated that she was willing to give the plaintiff additional time to increase her speed and understood the issues surrounding the plaintiffs hand injuries. Id., 189. The employer had told the plaintiff that she would have an eight week training period for the ink inspector position but laid her off after only eighteen days of training for failing to attain the necessary rapidity in performance. The dismissal occurred despite management\u2019s understanding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>plaintiff would not be able to attain top speed during her training period. Id., 189-90. The employer\u2019s discharging the plaintiff after making an agreement with her is roughly comparable to the defendant\u2019s reaching a voluntary agreement with the plaintiff in this case and then discharging her.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We conclude that <em>Cable </em>v. <em>Bic Corp., </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 178, supports the proposition that an employer voluntarily may enter into an accommodation agreement with an employee receiving benefits under the act. If the employer, however, terminates the employment for a reason the commissioner finds discriminatory under \u00a7 31-290a, the commissioner\u2019s decision may be affirmed if it is in accord with the burden shifting analysis of <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 216 Conn. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The fact that the act does not require an employer to accommodate an employee\u2019s needs is not the key to this appeal. The commissioner found that an informal hearing was held to determine whether the defendant would permit the plaintiff to increase the number of days that she performed her duties in the Derby bureau. See <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Max Services, Inc., </em>42 Conn. App. 147, 173 n.18, 679 A.2d 37 (statutory vehicle concerning informal hearings that concerns agreements between parties), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 915, 682 A.2d 1005 (1996).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>also found, pursuant to Commissioner Wilson\u2019s notes and Bishop\u2019s credible testimony, that Ferguson agreed to the accommodation on behalf of the defendant. If Laska and Keegan did not want to ratify the agreement, that was their prerogative, but, as the commissioner concluded, rather than discharging the plaintiff, they simply should have denied her request and told her to report to the newsroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We also are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that Commissioner Wilson had no business entertaining the plaintiffs request at the informal hearing. Commissioner Truglia found that the subject of the informal hearing was \u201cwhether or not the employer would be willing to allow the [plaintiff] to increase the number of days she worked in the [Derby bureau], from one to two days, to accommodate her physical therapy schedule.\u201d The defendant has not identified anything in the record that even suggests that it objected to the issue being considered at the informal hearing. All of the evidence and the findings of the commissioner indicate that the defendant willingly participated in the informal hearing and reached an agreement with the plaintiff. With respect to trials in the Superior Court, the appellate courts of this state have made it clear that a party cannot take a path at trial and change tactics on appeal. Furthermore, no party has the right to induce or invite error, if any, on the part of the trier of fact and seek reversal on appeal. See <em>Falkenstein </em>v. <em>Falkenstein, </em>84 Conn. App. 495, 505, 854 A.2d 749, cert. denied, 271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Conn. 928, 859 A.2d 581 (2004).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We think that that equitable rule should apply to informal and formal proceedings before a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner. A party may not attend an informal hearing, fail to object to an issue being addressed, voluntarily enter into an agreement and later claim that the commissioner should never have entertained the issue that led to an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Furthermore, the defendant has overlooked the significance of Commissioner Truglia\u2019s finding that the parties had reached an agreement at the informal hearing. The issue significant to the commissioner was not that the defendant failed to abide by the agreement but that Ferguson denied that an agreement had been reached. The commissioner\u2019s finding and award turned on the credibility of the individuals who testified at the formal hearing. Ferguson\u2019s denying that an agreement had been reached was the foundation of the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that Ferguson knew that the open-ended physical therapy note was contrary to the agreement. Ferguson declined to discuss the note with the plaintiff as requested. The commissioner found that because Ferguson knew that the plaintiffs request for an accommodation was not open-ended, Keegan\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiffs employment as stated in the termination memo was a pretext for dismissing the plaintiff. Because she found that Ferguson and Keegan lacked credibility, the commissioner also found that the defendant\u2019s explanation for dismissing the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>was \u201cunworthy of belief and that a discriminatory reason under [\u00a7] 31-290a, more likely than not, motivated the [defendant] in terminating the [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Our review of the record persuades us that the commissioner\u2019s finding and award concludes by implication<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that the defendant could have refused the plaintiffs request for an accommodation and told her to report to the newsroom the next day, but that it could not discharge her because the note did not conform to the parameters of the agreement it voluntarily made with the plaintiff at an informal hearing. For the foregoing reasons, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, we conclude that the commissioner did not find that the defendant was required to provide the plaintiff with a workplace accommodation. The plaintiff availed herself of an informal hearing, which she was entitled to do under the act, to reach an agreement with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the commissioner improperly found that the plaintiff was exercising her right to medical care. The defendant does not challenge that the plaintiff needed further physical therapy to recover from her compensable injury. As the defendant argues, the plaintiff testified that she did not have to work in the Derby bureau to attend physical therapy, but it was closer to her physical therapist and its layout was more accessible given her limited mobility. Although the plaintiff was not entitled to the requested accommodation under the act, the plaintiff thought she had nothing to lose by asking. After all, the defendant had permitted her to work in Derby one day a week during May, 2002. If the defendant did not want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to grant the plaintiffs request, the commissioner concluded, the plaintiff \u201cshould have been told that she was expected to report the next day to the [newsroom].\u201d We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the commissioner improperly found that the defendant should have told the plaintiff to report to the newsroom after it denied her request to spend two days a week in the Derby bureau. The defendant argues that the commissioner was acting as a \u201csuper personnel department\u201d and \u201csecond-guess [ing]\u201d the defendant\u2019s business decisions. See <em>Alfano </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>294 F.3d 365, 377 (2d Cir. 2002). We disagree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of the commissioner\u2019s finding. The commissioner\u2019s finding that the defendant should have told the plaintiff to report to the newsroom merely acknowledges the defendant\u2019s right to deny the plaintiffs request for accommodation under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The defendant again has misconstrued the commissioner\u2019s finding. The commissioner did not find that the defendant\u2019s failure to grant the plaintiffs request to work in the Derby bureau two days a week was wrongful. The commissioner found that it was wrongful for the defendant to terminate the plaintiffs employment for pretextual reasons after a voluntary agreement had been reached during an informal hearing. The commissioner made findings concerning the quality of communication among the editors and the quality of the newspaper when the plaintiff was in the Derby bureau because those were the reasons Keegan said the plaintiff could not work in Derby two days a week. The commissioner found no evidence to support Keegan\u2019s claims and concluded that those reasons were false. Instead of telling the plaintiff that she had to work in the newsroom rather than in the Derby bureau, Keegan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>discharged her. The commissioner concluded and found that Keegan\u2019s discharge of the plaintiff was motivated by a discriminatory animus. On the basis of our review of the record, we cannot say that the commissioner\u2019s finding that the defendant should have told the plaintiff to return to the newsroom after denying her request was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the commissioner improperly found that it had violated \u00a7 31-290a \u201cwhen the only evidence was that the [defendant] restored [the plaintiff] to her former position.\u201d The defendant\u2019s contention is that it permitted the plaintiff to return to the newsroom at the beginning of May, 2002, and that the plaintiff created a problem by taking the position that she could not report to the newsroom on a full-time basis, a position allegedly substantiated by the note. We conclude that the defendant again has misconstrued the commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusion. At the informal hearing, pursuant to Commissioner Wilson\u2019s notes, the plaintiffs counsel and Ferguson agreed that on two days a week for six weeks the plaintiff could fulfill her responsibilities to the defendant from the Derby bureau. Commissioner Truglia found on the basis of testimony from Daly and Crowder that the plaintiff was able to perform her duties from the Derby bureau and that communication and the quality of the newspaper did not suffer. See footnote 11. Neither Keegan nor Laska could cite any evidence to the contrary. The commissioner did not believe Keegan\u2019s explanation for discharging the plaintiff. The termination memo stated that the plaintiff was being dismissed because the note indicated that the plaintiff required physical therapy three times a week for an indeterminate period of time. Ferguson knew that the note was contrary to the agreement reached at the informal hearing, but she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>failed to discuss the matter with the plaintiff. We therefore conclude that the commissioner\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the commissioner improperly failed \u201cto grant its motion to correct.\u201d On August 13,2004, the defendant filed a motion requesting that the commissioner correct fifteen of her findings and conclusions. In its appellate brief, the defendant\u2019s claim is set forth in two brief paragraphs containing no legal analysis as to why the commissioner\u2019s failure to grant the motion to correct was improper. We decline to review this claim as it is inadequately briefed. See <em>Rivnak </em>v. Rivnak, 99 Conn. App. 326, 332 n.4, 913 A.2d 1096 (2007) (\u201c[a]nalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Furthermore, in the first paragraph of its argument, the defendant stated, <em>\u201cthe motion to correct was never acted upon.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We disagree. Page twenty-seven of the record is a copy of the commissioner\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the commissioner improperly based her award on an assumption as to the plaintiffs rate of compensation, rather than on the evidence. In making this claim, the defendant contends that the parties stipulated that the plaintiffs position as New Haven County editor would have been eliminated in Keegan\u2019s reorganization<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but that there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>have been an opening in the new position of Milford assistant metro editor. The plaintiff countered that the parties did not stipulate to that fact. On the basis of our review of the transcript containing the facts to which the parties stipulated, we find no stipulation that the plaintiffs position would have been eliminated, \u201cbut that there would have been an opening in the new position of Milford assistant metro editor.\u201d Furthermore, our review of the record and the commissioner\u2019s damages award demonstrates that the award was based on the evidence of the plaintiffs salary at the time the defendant terminated her employment. The claim therefore is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> With respect to claims raised under General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a, \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner may appeal the decision to the Appellate Court.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> Commissioner Truglia made fifty-eight findings of fact and drew thirty-three conclusions in her finding and award.

On rebuttal, Keegan testified that communications between the plaintiff and the other editors and between the plaintiff and him were severely hampered by the plaintiffs absence from the newsroom. Keegan also testified that the quality of the newspaper suffered when the plaintiff worked in the Derby bureau, but he never shared his concerns with anyone. Keegan testified further that since arriving at the newspaper in the fall of 2001, he wanted to reorganize the newsroom to increase efficiency. The commissioner concluded that the defendant had met its burden on rebuttal by offering testimonial evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for dismissing the plaintiff. Nevertheless, the commissioner found the defendant\u2019s evidence \u201cunworthy of belief and that a discriminatory reason under \u00a7 31-290a, more likely than not, motivated\u201d the defendant to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Daly and Crowder testified \u201cin direct contravention\u201d of the testimony given by their superior, Keegan. The commissioner concluded that it \u201ctook great courage\u201d on the part of Daly and Crowder to do so, and for that reason, their testimony was persuasive. She concluded that there was \u201c[n]o credible evidence whatsoever\u201d that the quality of the newspaper suffered when the plaintiff performed her responsibilities in the Derby bureau. The telephone was the lifeblood of her work. Although Keegan testified that he wanted to increase the newspaper\u2019s efficiency, he never communicated his plans to anyone. After the plaintiff was discharged, no other positions were eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Robert Laska, president of the defendant and publisher of the newspaper, also testified at the formal hearing. The commissioner found that regardless of the subject he was asked to corroborate, \u201chis testimony was deliberately evasive, vague and evidenced a publisher so detached from daily personnel decisions as to render his testimony virtually useless.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s testimony was \u201cso riddled with inconsistencies as to render her testimony beyond credibility on the pivotal issues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-297a provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n any informal hearing held by the commissioner ... in regard to <em>compensation </em>under the provisions of this chapter, any recommendations made by the commissioner ... at the informal hearing shall be reduced to writing and, if the parties accept such recommendations, the recommendations shall be as binding upon both parties as an award by the commissioner . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u201c \u2018Compensation\u2019 means <em>benefits or payments </em>mandated by the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, indemnity, medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service required under section 31-294d and any type of payment for disability, whether for total or partial disability of a permanent or temporary nature, death benefit, funeral expense, payments made under the provision of section 31-284b, 31-293a or 31-310, or any adjustment in benefits or payments required by this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)
