All parties now appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>from the judgment of the trial court. In AC 27040, the defendant, Robert Hinz, claims that the court improperly (1) found him negligent due to his failure to pass port to port in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 15-131, (2) found him negligent due to his failure to sound his horn, (3) applied certain federal inland navigation rules, (4) declined to apply the doctrine of error in extremis and (5) denied his motion for a judgment of dismissal. In AC 27041, the plaintiffs, Richard W. Michalski and Maija Andross, contend that the court failed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 in awarding costs. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The underlying facts are largely undisputed. On the evening of July 9, 2001, the plaintiffs fished at various locations on Candlewood Lake aboard a nineteen foot motorboat. That same evening, the defendant celebrated his fiftieth birthday with family and friends, culminating with a jaunt aboard his twenty-four foot sailboat. As the defendant operated his vessel under motor due to calm skies, a terrible end to that evening approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">At approximately 11:30 p.m., the sailboat proceeded in a northerly direction on the lake. At that time, the plaintiffs, who had been fishing at a location to the north of the sailing vessel, set off for another location. They headed in a southerly direction, traveling approximately twenty miles per hour. The two vessels were on a collision course.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Less than thirty seconds passed between the time that the defendant and his guests first glimpsed the motorboat and impact. When the defendant saw the motorboat, he took evasive maneuvers, first steering his vessel to starboard in an effort to pass the motorboat on his port side. Seconds later, the defendant abruptly changed course, turning the vessel to port in an attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>to pass the motorboat on his starboard side, to no avail. The vessels collided head on.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In the wake of those events, litigation ensued. The plaintiffs brought an action sounding in negligence and recklessness against the defendant concerning the events of July 9, 2001, as set forth in an amended complaint filed April 8, 2005. In response, the defendant filed an answer and special defenses that alleged, inter alia, that the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence proximately caused the collision. Following a trial, the court found the defendant negligent in failing to pass port to port and in failing to sound his horn. The court further found the plaintiffs negligent in traveling at an unsafe speed and in failing to maintain a proper lookout. The court found no recklessness on the part of any party. It apportioned liability equally between the defendant and the plaintiffs. The court awarded Michalski a total of $12,850 in damages, reduced by 50 percent to $6425, against the defendant. The court awarded Andross a total of $83,382 in damages, reduced by 50 percent to $41,691, against the defendant. The court further ordered that \u201c [e]ach party shall bear their own costs and expenses.\u201d The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to assess costs, which the court denied. The defendant thereafter filed a motion for review with this court, which we granted, ordering an articulation. In response, the court issued a \u201cSupplemental Memorandum of Decision in Response to Order for Articulation.\u201d These consolidated appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">AC 27040</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The defendant first claims that the court\u2019s finding that he failed to pass port to port in violation of \u00a7 15-131 improperly served as a basis for its finding of negligence on his part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint neither pleaded that statute nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>contained such a factual allegation, the court\u2019s finding improperly figured into its negligence determination. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Because the interpretation of pleadings presents an issue of law, our review is plenary. <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>PCRE, LLC, </em>68 Conn. App. 727, 746, 793 A.2d 1118 (2002). \u201cIt is fundamental in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allegations of [its] complaint.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 496, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994). More than one century ago, our Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]hen the facts upon which the court in any case founds its judgment are not averred in the pleadings, they cannot be made the basis for a recovery.\u201d <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Koepke, </em>71 Conn. 77, 79, 40 A. 1053 (1898). The vitality of that bedrock principle of Connecticut practice is unquestionable. See, e.g., <em>Lundberg </em>v. <em>Kovacs, </em>172 Conn. 229, 233, 374 A.2d 201 (1977); <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 718, 721, 89 A.2d 213 (1952); <em>Monetary Funding Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pluchino, </em>87 Conn. App. 401, 414, 867 A.2d 841 (2005); <em>Criscuolo </em>v. <em>Mauro Motors, Inc., </em>58 Conn. App. 537, 545, 754 A.2d 810 (2000); <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>39 Conn. App. 143, 149, 664 A.2d 312 (1995); <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Hollauer, </em>1 Conn. App. 693, 695, 475 A.2d 326 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged several grounds for its claims of negligence. It was silent as to the defendant\u2019s failure to pass port to port. In addition, although Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) requires in relevant part that \u201c[w]hen any claim made in a complaint ... is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not identify \u00a7 15-131. Although our courts repeatedly have recognized that the rule embodied in Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 is directory and not mandatory; see, e.g., <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>225 Conn. 217, 221 n.7, 622 A.2d 551 (1993); <em>Fleet National Bank </em>v. <em>Lahm, </em>86 Conn. App. 403, 405 n.3, 861 A.2d 545 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 904, 868 A.2d 744 (2005); notice is the critical consideration in such instances. As this court has observed, \u201c[a]s long as the defendant is sufficiently apprised of the nature of the action . . . the failure to comply with the directive of Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) will not bar recovery.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>66 Conn. App. 669, 676, 785 A.2d 1181 (2001), aff'd, 263 Conn. 22, 818 A.2d 37 (2003). In <em>Spears, </em>the plaintiffs failed to plead the protections of General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n in their complaint. <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 676. Because the plaintiffs relied on that statute in their memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in oral argument before the trial court, we concluded that the defendants were sufficiently apprised of the nature of the action. Id. By contrast, the plaintiffs in the present case never alleged a violation of \u00a7 15-131 at any stage of the proceedings. On that record, we cannot conclude that the defendant was sufficiently apprised that \u00a7 15-131 was at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In the present case, the plaintiffs made no factual allegation concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to pass port to port in their negligence claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>may rely only on what they have alleged, the plaintiffs may not recover for any negligence resulting from the defendant\u2019s failure to pass port to port.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The plaintiffs do not dispute that pleading deficiency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, they claim an immaterial variance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA variance is a departure of the proof from the facts as alleged. Not every variance, however, is a fatal one since immaterial variances are disregarded under our practice. Practice Book \u00a7 [10-62] .... Only material variances, those which disclose a departure from the allegations in some matter essential to the charge or claim, warrant the reversal of a judgment. . . . A variance is material only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>if the defendant is prejudiced by it.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>DeMilo &amp; Co., </em>233 Conn. 254, 275-76, 659 A.2d 148 (1995). To be material, a variance must relate to the cause of action alleged. <em>LaFaive </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>2 Conn. App. 58, 61, 476 A.2d 626, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 801, 477 A.2d 1021 (1984). \u201c[A] variance which alters the basic nature of a complainant\u2019s cause of action cannot be condoned.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 63, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). The critical inquiry is whetherthe opposing party was on notice of the variance. See <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 463, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990) (where defendant had sufficient notice of claims not specifically alleged, no material variance between pleadings and proof), on remand, 24 Conn. App. 377, 588 A.2d 656 (1991), rev\u2019d, 222 Conn. 233, 610 A.2d 574 (1992); see also <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 496 (pleadings must provide sufficient notice of facts claimed and issues to be tried and not surprise or prejudice opposing party).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The plaintiffs misunderstand the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal. The defendant is not alleging a variance between the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings and their proof offered at trial. Rather, he alleges that the court, in rendering judgment, did so on a ground never claimed by the plaintiffs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u201cA cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>259 Conn. 114, 129, 788 A.2d 83 (2002). The pertinent question before us is whether, at any time prior to the court\u2019s judgment, the defendant was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>notice that his failure to pass port to port was claimed by the plaintiffs as a basis for their negligence count.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We already have noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings do not contain such an allegation. Moreover, a review of the trial transcripts reveals that at no time did the plaintiffs either claim a violation of \u00a7 15-131 or inform the court or the defendant that they were pursuing such an allegation. Unhindered by that deficiency, on June 7, 2005, the court nevertheless found, inter alia, that \u201cthe defendant was negligent in that he failed to pass [the] oncoming boat on the port to port side . . . .\u201d The defendant thereafter filed a timely motion for review with this court, which sought the following articulation: \u201cWhat were the factual justification(s) and legal basis for finding [the defendant] negligent/liable for failing to pass . . . Michalski\u2019s vessel port to port <em>when the plaintiffs never [pleaded\\ or asserted such a cause of action in either [their] original complaint or in the amended complaint [they] filed during the trials </em>(Emphasis added.) This court subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s motion for review and further granted the relief requested therein. Accordingly, we ordered the trial court to \u201carticulate the basis for its finding that the defendant was negligent in that he failed to pass the oncoming boat on the port to port side . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In response, the court issued a \u201cSupplemental Memorandum of Decision in Response to Order for Articulation,\u201d in which it stated: \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 15-131 and the rules for operating vessels, including the Connecticut Boater\u2019s Guide require that boats shall pass port to port. . . . The testimony of the defendant was that he knew of the requirements of proper passage and that he failed to do so. It was further testified by the defendant that he started to pass port to port and then decided to change course to the left to pass on the starboard side. . . . [I]f the defendant had maintained his course and passed port to port, the accident could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>avoided. His decision to change course and pass on the starboard side was [a] basis of the finding of the court that the defendant was negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Although the court may well be correct that the defendant failed to comply with \u00a7 15-131 and that that failure contributed to the collision, the court\u2019s supplemental memorandum of decision never addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to allege that statutory violation as a basis for their negligence action in the complaint or at trial. It is telling that although the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint during trial, it contained no allegation concerning the failure to pass port to port. Even more remarkable is the fact that, in their May 17, 2005 objection to the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion for judgment of dismissal and/or directed verdict, \u201d the plaintiffs stated that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs, in their case-in-chief, have presented evidence at trial to demonstrate that the defendant was negligent and/or reckless for the following violations . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That objection was silent as to \u00a7 15-131 or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>failure to pass port to port. Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 June 3, 2005 posttrial brief stated that \u201c[t]he evidence produced at trial proves that the defendant was negligent and reckless in that he failed to have his navigation lights on when underway; he failed to keep a proper lookout; and he failed to give the appropriate sound signal (horn) when required.\u201d To now contend that they alleged a violation of \u00a7 15-131 in the face of those pleadings is, at best, disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">At their essence, both Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) and our law on variances concern notice. See <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 463. As we recently observed, \u201c[t]he concept of notice concerns notions of fundamental fairness, affording parties the opportunity to be apprised when their interests are implicated in a given matter.\u201d <em>Twenty-Four Merrill Street Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>96 Conn. App. 616, 622, 902 A.2d 24 (2006). Our thorough review of the record convinces us that the defendant was never provided the requisite notice in the present case. The plaintiffs failed to allege a violation of \u00a7 15-131 in either their original complaint, their amended complaint, their May 17, 2005 objection to the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of dismissal or their June 3, 2005 posttrial brief. Moreover, they never referenced a violation of that statute at any time during trial. It therefore was improper for the court to find the defendant negligent for failing to comply with that statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The defendant also contests the court\u2019s finding that he was negligent in failing to sound his horn. He maintains that he was not obligated to sound his horn under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Connecticut law. Our review of that question of law is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>278 Conn. 428, 453, 899 A.2d 563 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The statutory scheme set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 15-121 et seq. governs boating in our state. Section 15-121 (a) charges the commissioner of the department of environmental protection (commissioner) with responsibility for boating in Connecticut and vests in the commissioner \u201cexclusive jurisdiction of all waters of the state . . . .\u201d Section \u00a7 15-121 (b) (11) authorizes the commissioner to adopt regulations for the safe operation of vessels. In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 15-138 requires the commissioner to publish a boater\u2019s guide annually.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The 2001 Connecticut Boater\u2019s Guide was admitted as plaintiffs\u2019 exhibit two. Page eighty-seven of that publication states that \u201c[a]ll vessels are required to exchange sound signals when their paths will lead them into any close quarters situation.\u201d It further provides that \u201c[w]hen two vessels are approaching on reciprocal courses in a head on or nearly so situation, both vessels should exchange a one blast signal . . . .\u201d At trial, the defendant\u2019s expert testified that the federal inland navigation rules; see 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001 et seq.; contain a similar requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the court expressly predicated its decision on both Connecticut boating regulations and the federal inland navigation rules. Those regulations plainly indicate that the defendant was obligated to sound his horn amidst the events of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>July 9, 2001. At trial, the defendant testified that, when on Candlewood Lake, \u201cI don\u2019t use the horn when I pass other vessels port to port. . . . Even though the rules say so.\u201d He further testified that he failed to sound his horn on the evening of July 9, 2001. On that record, the court properly found that the defendant was negligent in failing to sound his horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">As our Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[t]he conclusion of negligence is necessarily one of fact . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>168 Conn. 431, 434, 362 A.2d 857 (1975); see also <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Healey Car &amp; Truck Leasing, Inc., </em>41 Conn. App. 347, 349, 675 A.2d 919 (negligence ordinarily question of fact), cert. granted on other grounds, 238 Conn. 901, 677 A.2d 1375 (1996) (appeal dismissed December 18, 1996); <em>DeMotses </em>v. <em>Leonard Schwartz Nissan, Inc., </em>22 Conn. App. 464, 467, 578 A.2d 144 (1990) (negligence \u201cgenerally a question of fact, not law\u201d). Accordingly, the court\u2019s finding of negligence will be upheld unless it is clearly erroneous. See <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Star Steel Structures, Inc., </em>96 Conn. App. 142, 151, 900 A.2d 42, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 914, 908 A.2d 539 (2006). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence ... we give great deference to its findings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reiner, Reiner &amp; Bendett, P.C. </em>v. <em>Cadle Co., </em>278 Conn. 92, 107, 897 A.2d 58 (2006). The record demonstrates that the defendant failed to sound his horn on the evening of July 9, 2001, in violation of Connecticut boating regulations. In light of the foregoing, the court\u2019s finding of negligence on his part was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The defendant next contends that the court improperly applied the federal inland navigation rules; see 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001 et seq.; in the present case. That claim merits little discussion. At trial, it was the defendant who introduced those rules into evidence. The defendant further offered the expert testimony of Captain Joseph Ahlstrom of the State University of New York Maritime College. The court specifically asked Ahlstrom whether those rules applied on Candlewood Lake; he answered in the affirmative. On appeal, the defendant has provided this court with no authority to conclude otherwise. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>90 Conn. App. 445, 454 n.9, 878 A.2d 374 (substantive analytical discussion and citation of authorities prerequisites to adequate briefing), cert. denied, 276 Conn. 914, 888 A.2d 86 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Moreover, that claim is an academic one in light of the fact that the court also predicated its decision on Connecticut boating regulations. Even if the defendant had provided this court with authority for his proposition that the federal inland navigation rules do not apply on Candlewood Lake, he could not benefit from that argument in light of the court\u2019s finding that he violated a boating regulation of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The defendant also alleges that the court improperly declined to apply the doctrine of error in extremis. That doctrine, articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>The Blue Jacket, </em>144 U.S. 371, 12 S. Ct. 711, 36 L. Ed. 469 (1892), provides that \u201cwhere one ship has, by wrong manoeuvres, placed another ship in a position of extreme danger, that other ship will not be held to blame if she has done something wrong, and has not been manoeuvred with perfect skill and presence of mind.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 392. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>defendant refers to the court\u2019s findings that the plaintiffs were negligent in traveling at an unsafe speed and in failing to maintain a proper lookout and posits that those actions bring his conduct within the purview of error in extremis. His claim is problematic for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">First, as the court noted in its supplemental memorandum of decision, the issue of error in extremis was \u201cnot raised at trial or raised in the trial briefs . . . .\u201d The court therefore was not bound to afford it consideration. Practice Book \u00a7 5-2 provides: \u201cAny party intending to raise any question of law which may be the subject of an appeal must either state the question distinctly to the judicial authority in a written trial brief under Section 5-1 or state the question distinctly to the judicial authority on the record before such party\u2019s closing argument and within sufficient time to give the opposing counsel an opportunity to discuss the question. If the party fails to do this, the judicial authority will be under no obligation to decide the question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Second, even if we were to consider the defendant\u2019s claim, he still could not prevail. Although no Connecticut appellate court has discussed the doctrine of error in extremis, we find persuasive the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>M/V Morgan, </em>375 F.3d 563 (7th Cir. 2004). That court explained that \u201c[t]he party relying on the in extremis doctrine must be completely free from fault prior to the emergency occurrence. ... It does not excuse a vessel making a wrong maneuver in extremis where the imminence of the peril was occasioned by the fault or negligence of those in charge of the vessel, or might have been avoided by earlier precautions which it was bound to take. . . . Further, applicability of the doctrine does not prevent a finding of liability, it merely requires courts to judge a captain\u2019s reactions more leniently because of the crisis situation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577. Here, the court found that the defendant was negligent in failing to sound his horn. The failure to sound a horn is an earlier precaution that the defendant was bound to take under Connecticut law. Had the defendant complied with that precautionary requirement, the collision might have been avoided. As such, the doctrine of error in extremis is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of dismissal. \u201cIn Connecticut, a directed verdict may be rendered only where, on the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the trier of fact could not reasonably reach any other conclusion than that embodied in the verdict as directed.\u201d <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment </em>Commission, 158 Conn. 364, 380, 260 A.2d 596 (1969). \u201cDirected verdicts . . . are historically not favored .... We review a trial court\u2019s decision to direct a verdict for the defendant by considering all of the evidence, including reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. ... A verdict may be directed where the decisive question is one of law or where the claim is that there is insufficient evidence to sustain a favorable verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Silano </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>85 Conn. App. 450, 452-53, 857 A.2d 439 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The defendant argues that the plaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case of negligence without the aid of expert testimony. We disagree. Expert testimony is required only when a disputed matter is \u201cmanifestly beyond the ken of the average trier of fact, be it judge or jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 245, 541 A.2d 96 (1988). The issues before the court involved boating regulations and the defendant\u2019s compliance therewith. As discussed in part II, our boating regulations require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the sounding of a horn when two vessels are approaching in a head-on situation. Whether the defendant in fact complied with that precautionary requirement is a relatively straightforward inquiry that is not manifestly beyond the ken of the average trier of fact, as is the question of whether the defendant complied with \u00a7 15-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim suffers a further infirmity. On April 8, 2005, the plaintiffs rested their case and the defendant commenced his defense. The defendant on that day elicited the expert testimony of Captain Ahlstrom. On April 25, 2005, the defendant filed his motion for a judgment of dismissal based solely on the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to introduce expert testimony. At that stage of the proceedings, however, the court already had before it expert testimony regarding the central issues in dispute. The defendant cannot now complain of the court\u2019s reliance on that testimony. See Sears, <em>Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>241 Conn. 749, 756, 699 A.2d 81 (1997). As our Supreme Court noted, \u201cby introducing evidence, the defendant undertakes a risk that the testimony of defense witnesses will fill an evidentiary gap in the [plaintiffs] case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 757. In light of the foregoing, the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">AC 27041</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">In their separate appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court failed to comply with \u00a7 52-257 in awarding costs. In rendering judgment, the court ordered that \u201c[e]ach party shall bear their own costs and expenses.\u201d The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to assess costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>which the court denied. From that judgment, the plaintiffs now appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Section 52-257 provides that the prevailing party shall receive certain sums in civil actions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such sums are mandatory rather than discretionary. As our Supreme Court stated in <em>Fengler </em>v. <em>Northwest Connecticut Homes, Inc., </em>215 Conn. 286, 291, 575 A.2d 696 (1990), \u201c[a]n examination of General Statutes \u00a7 52-257, entitled \u2018[f]ees of parties in civil actions,\u2019 reveals that most of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the awards are automatic assessments, not involving the discretion of the court.\u201d The plaintiffs were the prevailing party in the present civil action, together-receiving an award of damages of almost $50,000 against the defendant. That they did not prevail on all of their claims is of no moment. As we recently explained, \u201c[a] party need not prevail on all issues to justify a full award of costs, and it has been held that if the prevailing party obtains judgment on even a fraction of the claims advanced, or is awarded only nominal damages, the party may nevertheless be regarded as the prevailing party and thus entitled to an award of costs.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>91 Conn. App. 619, 631, 882 A.2d 98, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 924, 925, 888 A.2d 92 (2005). The court wrongly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to assess costs in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The judgment is reversed only as to the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for costs and the case is remanded for further proceedings regarding the award of costs. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 15-131 (1) provides: \u201cWhen vessels approach each other end on, or nearly so, each shall pass on the port side of the other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>except that, if the courses of such vessels are so far to the starboard of each other as not to be considered approaching end on and altering course would create a hazard, each shall keep out of the way of the other and pass on the starboard side of the other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ad4\"> Our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim makes it unnecessary to address his corollary contention that the court\u2019s finding that he failed to pass port to port was clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint averred the following factual bases for its negligence counts: \u201ca.

It seems incongruous to us, however, that the defendant could have intentionally waived any objection to a factual allegation that the plaintiffs never presented to the trial court. As such, the defendant cannot be said to have waived his objection thereto.
