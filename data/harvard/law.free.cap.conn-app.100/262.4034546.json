We agree with the defendant that there is insufficient evidence to support an exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (7) or (13) and, therefore, reverse in part the judgment of the trial court. As a result of our holding, we do not reach the other issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The following facts and procedural history provide the necessary background to resolve the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>appeal. In February, 1990, the six parcels of property located at 503 Wire Mill Road, Stamford, were donated as a gift to New Era Foundation for International Development, Inc. (foundation), a New York not-for-profit corporation. The foundation was an affiliate of the assembly, a charitable religious trust with headquarters in Illinois. In 1990, the foundation applied for tax exempt status pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (7) for all six parcels of the real property at Wire Mill Road. Tax exempt status, pursuant to the charitable exemption allowed under \u00a7 12-81 (7), was granted for the parcel containing the main house and the parcel containing the caretaker house. The other four parcels, which were unimproved, were not granted tax exempt status. In February, 1992, the foundation dissolved and transferred the property to an Illinois not-for-profit title holding corporation, known as NSA Properties, Inc. (NSA). NSA was organized to hold title to real property for the benefit of the assembly, which, as a trust, could not own real property. NSA is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 (c) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In September, 1993, NSA requested a tax exemption, again pursuant to the charitable exemption in \u00a7 12-81 (7). According to testimony from both the defendant and the assembly, there was no request for a religious exemption. The assessor for the defendant, in response to NSA\u2019s request for a tax exemption, went to the property and determined that the property did not merit an exemption. NSA brought an action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> challenging what it claimed was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>illegal assessment by the assessor. An action, pursuant to \u00a7 12-119, is brought directly to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On October 14, 1994, the assembly was reorganized as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation with the same name. At this time, NSA was merged with the assembly, and the assembly was substituted as the plaintiff. The assembly is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 (c) (3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In its complaint, NSA claimed that the six parcels of real property were exempt from taxation. While the action was pending, the parties reached an agreement granting an exemption to the parcel of land that contained the main house. The case was tried before an attorney trial referee (referee). The parties stipulated that the only issue to be determined was whether the five parcels were entitled to tax exempt status for the period of October 1, 1993, to November, 2001.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The referee issued a report in which he concluded that the five remaining parcels were tax exempt. The defendant filed an objection to the acceptance of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The court accepted the factual findings in the referee\u2019s report. The court summarized those factual findings as follows: (1) the assembly is a religious organization practicing the Baha\u2019i faith, (2) the parcel with the main house had been found by the defendant to be tax exempt, and the controversy was centered around the use of the other parcels, (3) the assembly received no rents, income or profits from any of the parcels, (4) the four unimproved parcels were used by the church members as \u201cpart of their educational and spiritual purposes,\u201d and (5) the caretaker\u2019s cottage had a library and was used for \u201cgatherings, study and education . . . .\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[t]he attorney trial referee concluded that all five parcels comprising the subject property were exempt from taxation pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (7) and (13) because they were all being used as incidental to the assembly\u2019s charitable or religious purposes [or both]. Accordingly, the referee recommended that judgment enter in favor of the [assembly].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">As to the referee\u2019s conclusions of law, the court rejected the conclusion pertaining to the unimproved par cels of land. The court concluded that the four unimproved lots were not tax exempt as a matter of law, citing <em>Grace N\u2019 Vessels of Christ Ministries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>53 Conn. App. 866, 872, 733 A.2d 283 (1999) (unimproved lot not exempt from taxation where there is neither building or other improvement used for charitable purposes, nor plans for improvements). The court did, however, adopt the referee\u2019s conclusion of law as to the parcel of land with the caretaker\u2019s cottage that the parcel was exempt from taxation pursuant to \u00a7 12-81. The defendant filed this appeal from the court\u2019s judgment in favor of the assembly. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s conclusion in a tax appeal pursuant to the well established clearly erroneous standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>review. Under this deferential standard, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. Rather, we focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, to determine whether it is legally correct and factually supported.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>262 Conn. 11, 23, 807 A.2d 955 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u201cThe general rule of construction in taxation cases is that provisions granting a tax exemption are to be construed strictly against the party claiming the exemption.\u201d <em>Loomis Institute </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>234 Conn. 169, 176, 661 A.2d 1001 (1995). \u201cExemptions, no matter how meritorious, are of grace, and must be strictly construed. They embrace only what is strictly within their terms. ... It is also well settled that the burden of proving entitlement to a claimed tax exemption rests upon the party claiming the exemption.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>H.O.R.S.E. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>258 Conn. 553, 560, 783 A.2d 993 (2001). We strictly construe such statutory exemptions because \u201c[exemption from taxation is the equivalent of an appropriation of public funds [where] the burden of the tax is lifted from the back of the potential taxpayer who is exempted and shifted to the backs of others. . . . The owners of tax-exempt property in the community derive the same benefits from government as other property owners but pay no property taxes for those benefits.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Church of Christ </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>206 Conn. 711, 718-19, 539 A.2d 573 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The defendant first argues that there was insufficient evidence to support an exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (7). Specifically, the defendant argues that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>no finding that the property was used exclusively for exempt purposes and that there was insufficient evidence to support such a finding. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Charitable organizations, although exempt from federal and state income taxes, must pay local property taxes unless their property is used \u201cexclusively for scientific, educational, literary, historical or charitable purposes . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-81 (7). Pursuant to that statute, real property is eligible for a tax exemption (1) if its owner is \u201corganized exclusively for scientific, educational, literary, historical or charitable purposes\u201d and (2) if its property is used \u201cexclusively for carrying out one or more of such purposes . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-81 (7). There is no dispute in this case about the first condition. The defendant maintains, however, that there is neither a factual finding nor evidence to support the requirement for tax exemption that the property be used exclusively for charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cwhether property is used exclusively for carrying out an educational purpose is necessarily governed by the specific facts in the individual case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loomis Institute </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 177. The fact bound standard that governs the exclusivity of use of property for educational purposes also governs the exclusivity of use of property for charitable purposes. See <em>H.O.R.S.E. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In the present case, it appears that the court sidestepped the exclusivity requirement when it adopted the referee\u2019s conclusions as factual findings. Specifically, the court stated that \u201cthe cottage was used as a residence for the caretakers, but the referee found as a fact that the caretaker\u2019s cottage was used for charitable and religious purposes as well.\u201d The court, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Red Top, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>181 Conn. 343, 354, 435 A.2d 364 (1980), went on to state that \u201c[t]his finding cannot be reversed because it is well established that \u2018[w]hether the property for which an exemption is claimed is used exclusively for one of the required purposes must be determined from the facts.\u2019 \u201d The court then concluded that \u201c[t]he factual finding by the attorney trial referee that the caretaker\u2019s cottage was used for tax exempt purposes has sufficient support in the record to warrant acceptance of his recommendations in this regard.\u201d In this case, however, the factual findings do not address the exclusive use of the property, only the incidental use of the property. Furthermore, a diligent review of the record reveals that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of exclusive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">As we previously stated, it is well settled that the plaintiff has the burden of establishing its right to an exemption. To determine whether a plaintiff has met its burden of proof, the court must examine \u201cthe manner and means [that the charity has adopted] for the accomplishment of [its charitable] purposes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>H.O.R.S.E. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 563. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he extent to which an organization uses its property for purposes not directly related to its charitable purpose ... is relevant to the determination of whether the organization\u2019s property is entitled to tax-exempt status under \u00a7 12-81 (7).\u201d Id., 563-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendant argues that the underlying facts found by the referee and adopted by the court are insufficient to support the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the parcel containing the caretaker\u2019s cottage should be tax exempt. The court found that \u201cthe issue is whether there is evidence in the record to support the attorney trial referee\u2019s findings of fact that the subject premises were used for charitable or religious purposes [or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>both].\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court found that \u201cthe transcript reveals that meetings, including study groups, prayers and religious feasts and services, took place ... in the carriage house. The caretaker testified that it was advantageous to hold meetings in the . . . cottage because the library was upstairs where there were reference books and materials which were used \u2018if we had an issue that we had to go to the writings to work out.\u2019 In addition, the caretakers were responsible for security on the thirteen acres, as well as maintenance of the premises.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Significantly, there was no reference to a finding, nor is there any evidence in the record to support a finding, that the caretaker\u2019s presence on the premises was essential to the assembly\u2019s achievement of its mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">This case is similar to <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>83 Conn. App. 124, 847 A.2d 1110, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 914, 853 A.2d 528 (2004), in which a request for an exemption was denied. The organization in <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc., </em>like the assembly in this case, was a charitable organization. Id., 127. In <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc., </em>the organization used the Milford property as its main office for many years. Id. The executive director and her husband lived on the property. Id. The property was used daily for planning the organization\u2019s many activities, which were conducted elsewhere. Id. The executive director earned out her duties on behalf of the organization by making arrangements for numerous off-site activities and maintaining office equipment and supplies at the site. Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The organization\u2019s physical use of the property was limited. The board of directors met at the property four to six times a year; subcommittees and planning groups occasionally, although not regularly, met there; rarely, the president of the board and invited speakers stayed overnight; and a library was located on the premises and was available to visitors. Id., 128. The organization benefited from the fact that the executive director and her husband lived on the premises, as they were available at odd hours and on the weekends. Id. In addition, the executive director\u2019s husband maintained the grounds. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In assessing the merits of the claim in <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc., </em>that the property was exempt from property tax, we concluded that the trial court improperly had found that the organization was entitled to an exemption because there was no finding or evidence to support that the continuing presence of the executive director on the property was essential to the organization\u2019s achievement of its mission. In <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc., </em>we distinguished cases in which the property in question was determined to be tax exempt even though a person resided on the premises. The distinguishing factor was that having residents on the property was essential to carrying out the charitable purpose of the organization. See <em>Loomis Institute </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 169 (because faculty members\u2019 immediate presence essential to education of school\u2019s boarding students, school held to be entitled to tax exemption); <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>160 Conn. 370, 279 A.2d 561 (1971) (housing for residents and interns in immediate vicinity of hospital essential to fulfill hospital\u2019s duty to its patients). Furthermore, in <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc., </em>we concluded that \u201ceven if the trial court had found that the executive director was required to reside at the plaintiffs property, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tax exemption because the cited cases pertain to tax exemptions for educational institutions. As a matter of law, such organizations have an affirmative right to tax exemptions that other charitable organizations do not enjoy.\u201d <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 133. The caretaker in our case is similar <em>to </em>the executive director in <em>Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc., </em>because there is no evidence that the caretaker\u2019s presence was required for the assembly\u2019s achievement of its mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">There is, however, evidence that it was advantageous occasionally to hold meetings at the caretaker\u2019s cottage. Thus, we must decide whether a charitable organization seeking tax exemption satisfies its burden of proof of exclusive use by demonstrating that it is advantageous to have a resident caretaker. The taxpayer has not cited, and we have not found, any case holding that mere advantageousness is a defining characteristic of an exclusively charitable use of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In the absence of precedential support for the assembly\u2019s claimed entitlement to tax relief, we return to the underlying principle that the assembly bore the burden of establishing the fact that its property was used exclusively for charitable purposes. There was no finding by the referee, and the evidence does not support, that the assembly proved the existence of a compelling connection between its charitable purposes and the use of its property as the residence for a caretaker. We conclude that because no evidence was introduced to support a finding of exclusive use, the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the assembly was entitled to a property tax exemption under the circumstances of this case was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The defendant next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support an exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (13). Furthermore, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>conclusion that the parcel was tax exempt pursuant to any of the religious exemptions was not proper because the assembly did not request a religious exemption in its original application for an exemption submitted to the assessor. Although we conclude that the exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (13) was properly before the court, we agree that there was insufficient evidence to support a tax exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The referee found that the assembly was exempt from taxation pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (13), and the court adopted that finding. This section provides an exemption for houses of worship \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of section 12-88, houses of religious worship, the land on which they stand . . . owned by, or held in trust for the use of, any religious organization . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-81 (13). The defendant, however, claims that a religious exemption for the assembly\u2019s property was not properly before the court because NSA did not request a religious exemption on its tax exempt application. Although the transcript supports the defendant\u2019s claim that the exemption was not claimed in the 1993 application for exemption submitted by NSA to the assessor, the application for exemption from the assessor is irrelevant. See <em>Faith Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>192 Conn. 434, 437, 472 A.2d 16, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The assembly\u2019s appeal from the actions of the assessor was brought pursuant to \u00a7 12-119. In actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 12-119, the question before the court is whether the city has levied an illegal tax. <em>E. Ingraham Co. </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>146 Conn. 403, 407, 151 A.2d 700 (1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 929, 80 S. Ct. 367, 4 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1960). Levying a tax on property exempt from taxation would be an illegal exaction. See <em>Crescent Beach Assn. </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>170 Conn. 66, 363 A.2d 1045 (1976). The burden of proving an exemption from taxation rests on the taxpayer. <em>Modugno </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>174 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Conn. 419, 422, 389 A.2d 745 (1978). In an action brought under \u00a7 12-119, that burden would have to be satisfied before the trial court. Whether the taxpayer was required to claim the exemption before the assessor would have no evidential significance in the \u00a7 12-119 proceeding. It is the pleading before the court that is relevant. The assembly\u2019s \u00a7 12-119 appeal claimed exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-81. The defendant never requested a more complete or particular statement of the allegations against it. As such, the assembly could introduce evidence to the trier of fact to establish any exemption under \u00a7 12-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Although the assembly could introduce evidence to the trier of fact, in this case, it failed in its burden of proof. Any finding that the caretaker\u2019s cottage was a house of worship by the referee is clearly erroneous because the evidence proves the contrary. In fact, the assembly\u2019s own witnesses testified that there are only two houses of worship in the Baha\u2019i faith, one in Willamette, Illinois, and one in Israel. Further evidence reveals that in the Baha\u2019i faith, the followers gather together every nineteen days in followers\u2019 homes. Occasionally, and only when the caretakers are at home, the meetings are held at the caretakers\u2019 cottage. Occasional meetings, at the caretakers\u2019 convenience, do not make a home a house of worship. See <em>Woodstock </em>v. <em>The Retreat, Inc., </em>125 Conn. 52, 57, 3 A.2d 232 (1938) (purpose of statutory provision exempting houses of worship from taxation was to exempt ordinary church edifices, owned and used in usual way for religious worship); see <em>also Masonic Building Assn. of Stamford, Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>119 Conn. 53, 174 A. 301 (1934). The assembly has failed to establish that its property was exempt pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (13) because it did not provide evidence that the caretaker\u2019s cottage was a \u201chouse of worship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The assembly has not established its entitlement to a tax exemption pursuant to either \u00a7 12-81 (7) or (13). There was insufficient evidence to support the conclusions of the court. Accordingly, the court\u2019s judgment in favor of the assembly regarding the caretaker parcel cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The judgment is reversed as to the parcel containing the caretaker\u2019s cottage and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant as to that parcel. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\"> On December 22, 1997, the court granted a motion to substitute the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha\u2019i of the United States as the party plaintiff.
