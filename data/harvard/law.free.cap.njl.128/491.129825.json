A second count alleges that the manner in which the city hall was maintained constituted a nuisance which was the direct cause of the plaintiff\u2019s fall and injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The appellant\u2019s brief says that the municipality maintains its \u201cwater office\u201d in the city hall at Newark, New Jersey; that the appellant went to the city hall for the purpose of paying a water bill; that when she was on the city hall premises for said purpose she-fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The municipality moved to strike the complaint, relying upon the statute (N. <em>J. S. A. </em>40:9-2) which provides as follows: \u201cNo municipality or county shall be liable for injury to a person from the use of any public grounds, buildings or structures, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Appellant disputes applicability of this statute and says the case of <em>Fay </em>v. <em>City of </em>Trenton, 126 <em>N. J. L. </em>52, is controlling. This authority is not pertinent. There the plaintiff was injured by stepping on the lid of a water meter box located on the <em>public </em>highway, which tilted under her weight and caused her injury. The pleaded facts in the instant case are quite different. Plaintiff here went to the city hall to pay a water bill and fell somewhere on the premises. The complaint does not state where or how. The allegation in the second count of the complaint \u2014 that the careless manner in which the city hall was kept amounted to a nuisance \u2014 adds nothing to the value of the pleading. Assuming for argument that the plaintiff would have a cause of action if she suffered injury through the negligent maintenance of the office for transacting the business of the water department \u2014 certainly her right in this direction cannot be extended to cover injuries suffered elsewhere in the building separate and apart from the municipal water department. This case, we think, is controlled by the principle enunciated in <em>Bisbing </em>v. <em>Asbury </em>Park, 80 <em>N. J. L. </em>416 (at <em>pp. </em>423, 424).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
