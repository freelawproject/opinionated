He had been employed by prosecutor, in the stated capacity, since 1909. He never complained of poor health. On the contrary, he appeared to be enjoying good health. He was a good and regular worker and was a cheerful person.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">On March 7th, 1938, a \u201cclear,\u201d \u201cvery cold\u201d and \u201cfreezing\u201d day, Anthony Ciecwirz (hereafter referred to as Anthony), together with fellow workmen, was engaged in the work of digging a trench around prosecutor\u2019s main gas pipe line (hereafter referred to as pipe line) located at prosecutor\u2019s yard in Harrison, New Jersey, for the purpose of locating and repairing a leak which had developed in that pipe line. The digging was done with a,pick and shovel. One workman, working at the bottom of,the trench, would loosen the soil with his pick, and then shovel np the loosened soil to the top of the pipe line. Another workman would then remove the soil so deposited on the pipe line to the surface of the ground. Because of the leakage of the gas, the workmen would alternate their respective positions in the trench at intervals, variously estimated, ranging between three and thirty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Between 10:00 and 11:00 <em>A. </em>sr., on March 7th, 1938, the digging of the trench had progressed to a point where it was about eight feet deep and about four feet wide, and the distance from the bottom of the trench to the top of the pipe line where the soil was first deposited was about four feet. At the time stated, Anthony was working at the bottom of the trench and Ered Hoffstadt was working on top of the pipe line. As both were so working, Hoffstadt heard' Anthony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>make some exclamation (\u201coh, boy\u201d), and saw Anthony collapse and fall face downward on the bottom of the trench, the shovel underneath him.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Hoffstadt promptly got down to Anthony. He \u201cshook him\u201d but got no answer. He turned Anthony around and saw that his face was \u201cstrained\u201d and that he was \u201cbreathing heavily.\u201d Hoffstadt with the help of another workman (Thomas McGeachen) then took Anthony, who remained unconscious, out of the trench. Hoffstadt called the foreman and both erroneously believing that Anthony had been overtaken by the gas fumes, the foreman instructed Hoffstadt to get the artificial respirator. As Hoffstadt was running to carry out instructions, he heard some one say \u201cit\u2019s all right.\u201d He immediately returned to the place where Anthony, lying on' a plank which had been placed on the ground, was being subjected to artificial respiration. Hoffstadt testified that Anthony\u2019s appearance was \u201cvery funny\u201d and that \u201cthe man [Anthony] started to turn blue, blue is the color he turned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Dr. John Pavio, employed by prosecutor, apparently was the first physician on the scene. He said he got there between 10 :00 and 10:30 o\u2019clock arid that Anthony had already been pronounced dead although there is nothing to indicate who made that pronouncement. At all events, Dr. Pavio examined Anthony and gave him an injection of \u201cchoramid\u201d without avail. The sergeant of the local police department came to the scene at 12:15 p. m., in response to a call that a man had been overcome by gas. With the permission of the doctor the prone method of respiration, which was in progress, was continued. Anthony never regained consciousness and at 12:15 or 12:30 p. m., was again pronounced dead by Dr. Pavio, but the artificial respiration was continued for several hours thereafter. The death certificate states that the cause of death is \u201csyncope, due to cardiac disease, probably myocardial in nature * * No autopsy was performed. A blood test was made for the purpose of determining whether there was sufficient carbon monoxide gas in the system to cause death and the result was in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">In the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau it was determined that Anthony was engaged in \u201claborious work\u201d particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>for a man of his age and that the \u201cexertion of the work superimposed upon his existing heart condition brought about his death at the time and place at which it occurred, and * * * accordingly he died as the result of an accident within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d Compare <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. 554; affirmed, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>832; <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Janssen Dairy Corp., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>494; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>409; <em>Azarowicz </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Beef Co., </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>89; 191 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>683. Additionally it was determined in the Bureau that Anthony\u2019s employment was one of the contributing causes without which the accident would not have happened and that the accident was one of the contributing causes without which the injury or death would not have resulted <em>(Ciocca </em>v. <em>National Sugar Refining Co., </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>329 ; 13 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>130), and that prosecutor had knowledge of the accident on the day of its occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On appeal to the Hudson County Court of Common Pleas, that court affirmed the Bureau. A writ of <em>certiorari </em>was allowed prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The gravamen of prosecutor\u2019s argument here, as it was below, is that respondent failed to establish by \u201ca preponderance of probabilities\u201d <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>Gilbert Machine Works, Inc., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>533, 538; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>213; <em>Calicchio </em>v. <em>Jersey City Stock Yards Co., </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>112; 14 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>465; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Jersey Central Power and Light Co., </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>71, 73; 21 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>311) that the employment was one of the contributing causes without which the death of respondent\u2019s husband would not have happened. <em>Bollinger </em>v. <em>Wagaraw Building Supply Co., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>512, 520; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>396, 401; <em>Ciocca </em>v. <em>National Sugar Refining Co., supra; Molnar </em>v. <em>American Smelting Co., </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>118, 120; 21 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>213, 214; 128 <em>N. J. L. </em>11; 24 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>392. That argument is based on the premise that the probabilities were as consistent \u201cwith sudden death overtaking decedent at any time or any place, and (the fact) that (death) did happen while (Anthony) was at work, on his job, was merely coincidental.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The preponderance of probabilities do not, in our opinion, support the argument made.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The expert medical testimony is, as us\u00fcal, in conflict. It is altogether clear that Anthony did not die as the result of carbon monoxide poisoning. Eor had he so died, the appearance of his body would have been, as testified to by Assistant County Physician Dr. Hernandez, \u201ca cherry-red-pink-cherry red pink\u201d instead of blue. There is no dispute on this score. It is equally clear that Anthony died of a heart condition and that his having been subjected to artificial respiration completely removed whatever chance, if any, he had to survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Drs. Sutton, Pascall and Pavio, employed by prosecutor, testified for it. A general statement of the substance of their testimony will suffice. Drs. Sutton and Pascall were of the opinion that death was due to a \u201csudden\u201d and \u201cacute cardiac condition.\u201d Dr. Pavio was of the opinion that death was due to a \u201cmyocardial insufficiency.\u201d The three doctors were of the opinion that there was no causal relationship between Anthony\u2019s work and his death and that his death was not the result of any exertion which his work superimposed upon a pre-existing heart condition. Drs. Sutton and Pavio were further of the opinion that Anthony\u2019s death could have occurred from causes free from exertion, for examples, while he \u201cslept,\u201d while \u201cturning in bed,\u201d while \u201csitting in\u201d or \u201cgetting out\u201d of a chair, or while \u201creading a newspaper.\u201d Thus prosecutor contends that \u201cwhatever this man had been doing at the time of the seizure the end result would have been the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">If death could have happened under the suppositious circumstances it could likewise have happened, as it did, while Anthony was engaged in the laborious and strenuous work of shoveling up soil. Dr. Sutton so admitted although Dr. Pascall was unwilling to \u201cgo quite so far.\u201d Dr. Pavio concedes that \u201crest\u201d and not \u201cheavy laborious work\u201d is the proper treatment for one who as Anthony, according to the doctor\u2019s opinion, suffered from \u201cmyocardial insufficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We need hardly labor the point that we are not primarily concerned with suppositious circumstances under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Anthony could have died. Our primary concern is solely whether, under the circumstances here exhibited, respondent had properly established, by \u201ca preponderance of probabilities,\u201d her claimed right to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Drs. Yaguda and Oleott testified for respondent. Here again we shall make but brief reference to the substance of their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Dr. Yaguda was of the opinion that Anthony was afflicted with a heart condition although it was not discovered until after his death, a not uncommon experience. lie was strongly of the opinion that men who have normal hearts do not die of \u201cheart deaths\u201d without a pre-existing heart condition unless there is a direct traumatic injury to the heart such as a \u201cbullet through the heart,\u201d Or a \u201ccrushing wound tearing the heart,\u201d or the like. In his opinion the laborious work clone by Anthony at the time of his attack, the suddenness with which death followed, the fact that when Anthony was taken out of the trench he was \u201ccyanotic\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d rather than \u201cashen\u201d in color, which would have been his color had he been stricken with a sudden attack of \u201cacute coronary occlusion,\u201d as claimed by prosecutor, the elimination, by clearly distinguishable symptoms, of all other probable causes of death, all established that the \u201ceffort\u201d expended by Anthony, as distinguished by the doctor from an \u201cextra strain,\u201d \u201cbrought on acute heart failure\u201d and that, therefore, there was a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the work Anthony was doing at the time and his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Dr. Oleott testified that, in his opinion, under all the circumstances exhibited, \u201cthe exertion of the work precipitated the final catastrophe of a pre-existing heart;\u201d and \u201cthat (the work of shoveling up of the soil) was the final precipitating cause of the heart failure, the exertion of the moment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">However the work Anthony was doing be characterized, whether it be as \u201ceffort expended\u201d or \u201cextra strain\u201d or \u201cexertion of the moment,\u201d so long as there was, as here, a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between his work (shoveling up of soil from a deep trench in an atmosphere of escaping gas) and his death, then his death was the result of an accident arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and in the conrse of his employment. <em>Cf. Molnar </em>v. <em>American Smelting Co. (Court of Errors and Appeals), supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In fine, onr careful consideration of the proofs adduced, and all proper inferences dedncible therefrom, satisfies ns, and we find, as did the two lower tribunals, that the respondent had properly established, factually and legally, her claimed right to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
