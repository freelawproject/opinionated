MABEL C. APPLEGATE, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b648-4\">Submitted January 20, 1942 \u2014</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APV\">Decided August 4, 1942.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b648-8\">Before Brogan, Chief Justice, and Justices Case and Heher.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-9\">Eor the appellant, <em>Cecil W. Rotzell.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-10\">Eor the respondents, <em>Robert A. Lederer.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b648-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b648-12\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnU\">This is an action in tort for negligence arising out of a collision of motor vehicles. Defendant interposed a counter-claim. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant on the complaint, and in favor of the plaintiff on the counter-claim. Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">Thereafter, on plaintiff\u2019s motion, the verdict was vacated and a new trial granted on the ground of the existence of newly-discovered evidence. Defendant thereupon appealed from the order so made; and it is affirmed that what is denominated \u201cnewly-discovered\u201d evidence is not such in fact and in law, and the action thus taken is therefore a palpable abuse of discretion. The retrial has not been had.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">The challenged order does not take the category of a final judgment, and it is therefore not appealable. An appeal lies only from a final judgment. R. <em>S. </em>1937, 2:27-349. <em>Vide Kople </em>v. <em>Zalon, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>422; <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Illingsworth, </em>90 <em>Id. </em>490; <em>Benz </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>630; <em>Sonzogni </em>v. Sansevere, 6 <em>Id. </em>675; <em>Cox </em>v. Rosenvinge, 4 <em>Id. </em>949.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">The appeal is accordingly dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
