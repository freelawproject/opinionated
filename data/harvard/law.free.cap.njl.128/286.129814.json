L. </em>1906, <em>p. </em>526, now <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-120.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The facts which give rise to the challenge are free from substantial dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Prosecutor is engaged in the retail business of selling fuel oils, graded as numbers 2, 5 and 6. Its place of business is in the Town of Kearny, New Jersey, where it maintains its storage tanks, garages, trucks, tank wagons and equipment. It makes deliveries of its products to its customers in some 250 municipalities embraced within the territory \u201cfrom the Raritan River up to the New York State line.\u201d It uses between six and twenty of its trucks or tank wagons, depending upon the season of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Prosecutor neither maintains an office, nor keeps its products, nor its equipment in the City of Jersey City. The only times its trucks and tank wagons are in Jersey City are when they are used for the purpose of making deliveries of oil to prosecutor\u2019s customers in Jersey City and when the trucks and tank wagons are used for transporting oil through the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In the course of its business prosecutor admittedly did use, as charged, one of its tank wagons for the \u201ctransportation of oil\u201d (grade number 6), to one of its customers in the City of Jersey City without having first secured a permit, as allegedly required, lor so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Let us briefly analyze the legislation (state and local) upon which the complaint, proofs and conviction were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\"><em>State Legislation: </em>Chapter 249, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1906, <em>p. </em>526 (\u201cAn act to create the office of inspector of combustibles and fire risks in cities of the first class and to define the duties thereof\u201d), now <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-120, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Paragraph 1 provides for the creation of an office in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>fire department of cities of the first class to be known as the inspector of combustibles and fire risks (hereinafter referred to as inspector), for the appointment of a qualified person to such office, and defines the powers and duties of such officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Paragraph 3 provides that the inspector, and those acting under and for him, shall have the power and authority to enter \u201cany house, store, factory or other building, and upon any lot, yard or land situated within the limits thereof\u201d within the time therein prescribed, \u201cto examine the same, the contents thereof or the purposes for which it is being used * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Paragraph 3 provides that the inspector \u201cshall keep a record of such inspections, statements and reports\u201d (authorized under paragraph 3), keep and complete a record of all \u201chouses, stores, factories and other buildings,\u201d the \u201cconstruction\u201d thereof, the \u201cuse\u201d to which the same is put, the \u201cnature\u201d of the business there conducted, the \u201ccontents\u201d thereof, the \u201clocation\u201d of any \u201ccombustibles or explosive materials\u201d therein, or which may be on the \u201cpremises\u201d surrounding, adjacent or connected therewith, and the \u201cmode, manner or method of storing or keeping the same * *</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Paragraph 4 provides that \u201cno person * * * or corporation shall have, keep, cause or permit to be kept, <em>in any building or in or on any property situated </em>(italics ours) in any city of the first class any gunpowder, * * * or blast oil * * * petroleum (either crude or refined) * * * without first obtaining from the inspector * * * a permit so to do;\u201d it further provides that the inspector shall have the \u201cpower and authority\u201d and it shall be his duty to enforce or assist in enforcing \u201cany and all ordinances\u201d of the city relating to \u201cfires, explosives and combustibles\u201d and to report to authorities all violations, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Paragraph 5 provides that the penalty for violating any provisions of the act, or any of the terms of any permit issued in conformity therewith shall be a fine of $35 for the first offense and $35 for every day thereafter so long as the violation continues or exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Paragraph 6 provides that all inconsistent acts therewith are repealed but contains the saving clause that this act shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>not be construed to diminish or affect any o! the powers, authority or responsibilities of any other board, body or official of any city.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><em>Local Legisla lion: </em>The City of Jersey City, one of the two cities of the first class in this state, on April 3d, 1907, adopted a comprehensive set of rules and regulations concerning, among other things, the transportation of inflammable and volatile oils.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Paragraph 16 of chapter 3 (Transportation) of part 6, provides that: \u201cThe owner or driver of any tank wagon shall secure a permit from the inspector covering the use of same, and the application for this permit shall state the name of the owner, the size of the .tank, the oil storage station at which the tank wagon will ordinarily be filled, its individual number, and the location of the premises provided for the storage of the tank wagon at n ight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Section 1 of part 10 provides for penalties in exactly the same words as set down in paragraph 5 of the act of 1906, <em>supra, N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Section 2 of part 10 provides \u201cThe inspector shall * * * prevent the continuance of any such violation by seizing any prohibited article upon the premises and <em>by dosing up such \u2022premises * </em>* *\u201d (italics ours).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Section 3 of part 10 (penalties) provides: \u201cPor the purpose of paying the expenses for permits under these rules and regulations, any person, firm, or corporation, applying for a permit shall pay a fee of fifty cents (50 cents), and wherever by these rules and regulations, a survey is necessary, any person, firm, or corporation applying for a permit shall pay a fee of five dollars ($5.00).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">We are clearly of the opinion that the conviction cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">1. It is conceded that the act and the rules and regulations based thereon are penal in character. <em>Cf. Marter </em>v. <em>Repp, </em>80 <em>N. J. L. </em>530, 532; 77 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>1030; <em>affirmed, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>531; 81 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>1134. It is rudimentary that in a summary proceeding on a penal statute or ordinance nothing is presumed or intended in favor of the complaint and conviction thereon. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>48, 51; 181 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Atl. </em>Rep. 706; <em>affirmed, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>466; 5 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>697. The city was obliged to prove the charge as made. It was necessarily obliged to sustain its power to pass the regulation allegedly violated. In the discharge of its stated obligations, the city made it abundantly clear that it did not claim to have the \u201cinherent authority,\u201d nor the legislative \u201cauthority\u201d under the Home Rule Act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>ch. </em>152, <em>p. </em>319, now <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:42-l, <em>et seq.), </em>to pass that regulation. It based its authority solely upon the provisions of the act of 1906, <em>supra, N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-120. It adheres to its stated position below. Additionally, however, it now invokes, by virtue of the saving clause (paragraph 6, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1906, <em>supra, N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-125) and the provisions concerning the construction of the Home Rule Act <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>40:42-3) a provision of its charter, namely, section 121, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1871, <em>pp. </em>1095, 1145, as further authority for the.passage of the regulation charged to have been violated. Passing over the merit, if any, of this added claim of authority <em>(Cf. Harrington\u2019s Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>610; 75 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>943), it is not of the character that can be considered when it is raised here for the first time. <em>Cf. Kluczek </em>v. <em>State, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>105, 107; 178 <em>Atl. </em>Rep. 632. The. question, moreover, is not whether the city might have invoked other statutory power for the passage of its rules and regulations' in issue. That question is not before us. Rather is the question whether the act that was invoked supports the charge as made, and the conviction under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On its stated theory, the city argues that neither the inflammability nor volatility of the oil transported is the test for the need to obtain the required permit, that since the oil transported was concededly a petroleum product, and that since \u201cpetroleum\u201d is one of the inhibited products enumerated in paragraph 4 of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1906, <em>supra (N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-123), the required permit was necessary for the transportation of oil into or through the city. That argument is rested upon the premise that when prosecutor had the oil in its tank wagon while in the city' \u2014 although for the limited time of making a delivery \u2014 the tank wagon came, in the light of the general language of the act, within the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of paragraph 4 of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1906, <em>supra; N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-123, \u2022which so far as is pertinent, as we have shown, reads: \u201cNo person * * * or corporation shall have, keep * * * [Petroleum] in any building <em>or in or on any property </em>in any city of the first class * <em>* </em>We cannot agree. It is the long settled rule <em>(eiusdem generis) </em>in the construction of statutes that when general words (\u201cin or on any property\u201d) follow specifically named things of a particular class (\u201cin or on any building\u201d), the general words must be understood (unless there is some indication to tile contrary and there is no such indication) as limited to things of the same class, or at least of the same general character. <em>Livermore </em>v. <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders of Camden, </em>31 <em>N. J. L. </em>507, 511, 512. <em>Cf. Curtis &amp; Hill, &amp;c., Co. </em>v. <em>State Highway Commission, </em>91 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>421 (at <em>pp. </em>429, <em>et </em>seq.); 111 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>116. A reading of the entire act impels the conclusion that the general phrase \u201cin or on any other property\u201d refers to real property. Paragraph 3 of the act <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-122) refers to \u201chouses, stores, factories and other buildings and premises\u201d and paragraph 4 of the act <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>40:174-122) as already observed refers to any \u201cbuilding.\u201d A tank -wagon is not comprehended by the stated language. Nor is it contemplated by the language in section 2 (Penalties) of the rides and regulations which reads, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cby closing up such premises.\u201d The act, moreover, is entirely silent as to the transportation of the inhibited products. We share the view that as to the transportation of the oil, as charged, the act exhibits a <em>\u201ccasus omissus\" </em>which of course we cannot supply by judicial construction. <em>Cf. Public Service Co-ordinated Transport </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>97, 103, 104; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>550. No construction of a statute, however liberal, can justify judicial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">2. Even were we to assume, however, that the City of Jersey City has power <em>(Cf. N. J. S. A. </em>40 :48-1, <em>et seq., </em>and 40:48-8), other than the power asserted to pass regulatory measures, as distinguished from revenue measures, concerning the transportation of inflammable and volatile oils into and through its territorial limits, our result would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>There were no proofs that the grades of oil sold by prosecutor, numbers 2, 5 and 6, were inflammable or volatile. There was, however, proof by the president of prosecutor that the \u201caccredited test\u201d for inflammability of \u201cpetroleum products\u201d is at a \u201cflash point below 80,\u201d that the flash point of its number 2 oil is \u201canywhere from 140 to 200,\u201d that the flash point of its number 5 oil is \u201canywhere from 140 to 200,\u201d that the flash point of its number 6 oil is \u201canywhere from 160 to 200\u201d and may even be \u201cas high as 300,\u201d that the oil bums when \u201cartificially atomized\u201d or \u201cvaporized through heat\u201d and that its tank wagons carried no such appliances. In other words he testified that the oil products sold by prosecutor were \u201cnot volatile,\u201d \u201cnot explosive unless atomized.\u201d His testimony is assailed on the ground that he was not a scientifically trained chemist. True he was not a scientifically trained chemist but he was a practical chemist. Pie had been in the oil business for over sixteen years, he was a member of the National Bureau of Euel Oil Specification (United States Department of Commerce); he was-the president of the New Jersey Euel Oil Distributors Association. He was indeed qualified, from practical experience, to give opinion testimony. <em>Wheeler &amp; Wilson </em>v. <em>Buckhout, </em>60 <em>N. J. L. </em>102; 36 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>772; <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>790; 67 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>295; <em>Fenias </em>v. <em>Reichenstein, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>196; 11 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>(2d) 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">3. The penalty provision of the local legislation is fatally defective. Contrary <em>to N. J. S. </em>A. 40:49-5 it deprives the magistrate of his discretion to impose a lesser penalty than the prescribed maximum. <em>Pfister Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>15 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>71; 188 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>727. The fact that the ordinance (rules and regulations) antedates <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:49-5 does not, irrespective of the provisions of <em>N. </em>J. <em>S. A. </em>40:49-3, negative the limitations contained in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:49-5. <em>LaForgia </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>10 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>657; 160 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>502; <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>319; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>225.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In light of the result reached, it is unnecessary further to discuss the other points argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
