He was a veteran.of the last war, and the holder of a Firemen\u2019s Exempt Certificate. He worked in that capacity (meter repair man) until September 1st, 1938, when a rather anomalous thing, to say the least, happened. By private arrangement, he effected a trade of his status with one Salvatore Scazzaro who then occupied the status of an operator at the plant receiving $175 a month. Apparently the reason for the change was that a meter repair man worked 5% days a week (he did not work on a Saturday afternoon nor on a Sunday), while an operator then worked seven days a week, and Scazzaro did not like to work on Sundays. Notice of the trade was given to the governing body of the City of Garfield. Thereafter the prosecutor was included on the payroll of the city as an operator and was paid accordingly. Prosecutor continued in \u2019his traded status until November* 28th, 1941, when the Water Commission notified him that it had adopted a resolution discharging him (without charges or hearing) effective December 15th, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Prosecutor then sought and obtained a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Prosecutor contends that as a war veteran and as the holder of an exempt fireman\u2019s certificate his discharge was improper because it was not for \u201cgood cause shown after a fair and impartial hearing\u201d and because he was discharged for \u201cpolitical reasons.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>38:16-1 (Veterans Act) and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:47-60 (Exempt Firemen\u2019s Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">While there is some proof to support the suggestion made for prosecutor that he was discharged for political reasons, and while there is also some proof to support the suggestion made for respondents that prosecutor was discharged because he occasionally came to work while intoxicated, we do not find it necessary, under the circumstances, to consider either suggestion. For, it is conceded that the \u201csole question\u201d for decision in the case at bar is whether prosecutor in his \u201ccapacity\u201d as an \u201coperator\u201d held a \u201cposition\u201d within the meaning of the War Veteran and Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Acts. In other words, does the \u201cnature\u201d of the \u201cduties performed by prosecutor\u201d as an \u201coperator\u201d indicate that he held a \u201cposition\u201d within the moaning of the aforestated acts ? Our answer is in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">1. The determinative characteristics of a position are that they are analogous to the duties of an office in that the duties pertaining thereto are \u201ccontinuous and permanent,\u201d especially pertaining to the position assumed <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>Jersey City, 51 N. J. L. </em>240, 242; 17 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>112), or are \u201cpermanent and certain.\u201d <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Board of Health, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>200, 201; 82 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>528.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On the day of prosecutor\u2019s appointment as a repair man, the Water Commission adopted rules and regulations relating to \u201coperators\u201d and \u201cmeter repair men.\u201d By these rules it was provided that the Water Commission designate three operators whose duties were to be in charge of the operation of all \u201cwater pumps\u201d and \u201cchlorine machines\u201d and the maintenance of them; and that the operators be on duty twenty-four hours a day, each operator devoting eight hours each day, anti that meter repair men be in charge of the \u201cinstallation, repairs and maintenance of all meters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">While it is true that prosecutor as an \u201coperator\u201d was obliged, in addition to his general duties, as defined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Water Commission, to keep a record of the electricity, water and chlorine consumed, &amp;c., it is also true that his duties embraced a \u201cgreat * * * variety of work.\u201d He was, as the proofs show and as pointed out for respondents, further obliged to, and did, clean, oil and polish machines, keep the inside and outside of the buildings clean, cut the grass and hedges, take care of the lawn, wash windows, polish brass, oil pumps, grease the shed pumps, clean and sweep toilets, carry ashes and coal, keep the picnic grounds clean, dig up trees, <em>&amp;c., </em>and to do such' other things as directed, from time to time, by the superintendent of the plant. Such duties can hardly be said to satisfy the determinative characteristics incident to a position. Such duties are more in accord with those of an employee, a general handyman. ' For was an operator regarded as the holder of a position. Eor, if so, then, irrespective of the reason given for the private arrangement between Scazzaro and prosecutor, it is difficult to understand Scazzaro\u2019s right to appoint prosecutor to that position, or the approval thereof bjr the governing body.\u2019 It is interesting to observe that an examination of the record in a recent case against the same Water Commission <em>(Merrihew </em>v. <em>Water Plant Commission, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>538; 1 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>(2d) 71), discloses that two of the five applicants for rules to show cause why a writ of <em>certiorari </em>should not issue -to review their discharge, were operators, and two were meter repair men, but all conceded that they \u201cwere mere employees\u201d and the case was decided, accordingly. <em>Id. </em>(at <em>p. </em>539\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We are of the opinion, and so hold, that prosecutor was not the holder of a position within the meaning of the statutes relied upon and our decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">2. But even if the duties of prosecutor be considered as characteristic of those incident to a position, our result would be the same. The governing body of the City of Garfield, of course, had the legislative powers to provide and supply water to the municipality and its inhabitants for public and private use (chapter 135, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1899 <em>pp. </em>283, 304, \u00a7 53, saved from repeal, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :170-1); <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:62-47 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:62-62. In the exercise of these powers, it could, as it did, create, by ordinanc\u00e9, such a board (Water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Commission) as it deemed necessary or convenient for accomplishing the stated purposes (providing and supplying water), elect the personnel of the water commission, and prescribe their duties. In so doing, it exercised its non-delegable, legislative powers. But assuming that the governing body of the City of Garfield, in pursuance of its non-delegable, legislative powers, could have created by ordinance the position of operator here in question, the answer is that it did not in fact create any such position.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Thus nothing that the Water Commission did in acknowledging the status of operators, nor in prescribing their duties, could alter the established principle that a position in a municipality can be created in no other manner than by a valid municipal ordinance. There is no such ordinance and, therefore, there is no such position as operator in the water department of the City of Garfield. <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>595; 189 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>914; <em>affirmed, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>27; 194 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>159; <em>Margerum </em>v. <em>Princeton, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>36, 38; 198 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>385.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Prosecutor\u2019s dismissal was proper. The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
