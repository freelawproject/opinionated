(superseded by chapter 5 of the Laws of 1940) was taxable for the years 1939 and 1940 under <em>R. S. </em>1937, 54:4-1, <em>et seq. </em>We resolve it in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><em>R. S. </em>54:4-2 ordained that, \u201cExcept as otherwise provided as to particular corporations, all property, real and personal, of a corporation shall be taxed the same as the real and personal property of an individual.\u201d Section 1 of the act of 1938, <em>supra, </em>decreed that the utilities therein specified \u201cshall be subject to taxation only as in\u201d that act directed. Section 5 provided that the \u201cfranchise and the <em>property\" </em>of such corporations \u201cshall not be subject to taxation of any kind or nature except as\u201d laid down in that statute, and that the \u201ctaxes\u201d to be imposed \u201cshall be in lieu of <em>all other taxes </em>against any corporation subject\u201d to its provisions, \u201cits <em>property, </em>franchises or its gross receipts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Section 6 of the last cited statute levied \u201cexcise taxes\u201d for the \u201cprivilege of exercising its franchises and using the public streets, highways, roads or other public places in this state,\u201d computed (a) at a specified rate \u201cof such proportion of the gross receipts\u201d of the corporation \u201cfrom its business over, on, in, through or from the whole of its lines or mains as the length of the lines or mains in this state, located along, in or over\u201d the public streets \u201cbears to the whole length of its lines or mains,\u201d and (b) \u201cat the same rate as the average rate of taxation in this state as fixed for the current year by the State Tax Commissioner under\u201d <em>R. S. </em>54:24-1, <em>et seq., </em>\u201cupon the gross receipts\u201d of the corporation, as therein defined,' from the business derived from its \u201clines or mains\u201d in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">It would seem that the legislative design was the substitution of these excises for the local direct tax on all property not expressly made subject to such taxation by that statute. But defendants note that section 2 (c) defined the term \u201cpersonal property\u201d as including \u201call personal property except electric and gas appliances to be used for the consumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>gas or electricity and held for resale and not for the purpose of production, transmission or distribution of gas or electric energy, and except the by-products of gas manufacture held for resale and not for the purpose of production, transmission or distribution of gas or electric energy, <em>and except intangible personal </em>propertyand the argument is made that the statute \u201cdoes not purport to exempt any property other than the tangible property actually devoted to the utility purposes and the franchises;\u201d that it \u201cnowhere expressly exempts intangible property (or for that matter, tangible property not used in the utility business);\u201d and that the \u201cbasis for the calculation of the tax is the income from tangibles used in the utility business and the basis for distribution is the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Apart from the fact that in practice it would be a matter of great difficulty thus to segregate the property \u201cnot used in the utility business\u201d (in the sense that it made no contribution whatever to the gross receipts), the act evinces no such legislative purpose; nor does it, when considered as a whole, reveal an intention to render intangible personal property taxable under the General Tax Act. Section 3 directed that the \u201creal estate,\u201d as therein defined, \u201cand the electric and gas appliances\u201d and \u201cby-product's of gas manufacture\u201d held for resale and not for the purposes of production, transmission or distribution of gas or electric energy, owned or held by the corporation, \u201cbe assessed and taxed at local rates in the manner provided by law for the taxation of similar property owned by other corporations or individuals, * * *.\u201d Intangible personal property is not comprehended in any of these classifications. By section 2 (b), \u201crailways, tracks, ties, lines, wires, cables, poles, pipes, conduits, bridges, viaducts, machinery, apparatus and equipment, notwithstanding any attachment thereof to lands and buildings,\u201d are excluded from the category of \u201creal estate\u201d taxable under the General Tax Act, but are included 'within the definition of \u201cpersonal property.\u201d Thus it is that intangible personal property was not taxable under general laws in view of the provision of section 5 of the act of 1938, <em>supra, </em>that the taxes to be imposed were \u201cin lieu of all other taxes\u201d against the corporation, \u201cits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>property, franchises or its gross receipts, \u201cand of the direction of section 1 that such corporations, \u201ctheir property and franchises,\u201d were subject to taxation <em>only </em>as provided in that act. It is significant that sections 1 and 5 used the all-embracive word \u201cproperty\u201d without any modification of its normal connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The term \u201cpersonal property\u201d was used only in section 8, providing that \u201cfor the purpose of securing a fair and equitable apportionment of the excise taxes\u201d levied by the act, \u201cupon a uniform basis among the several municipalities entitled thereto,\u201d the State Tax Commissioner shall \u201cestablish a valuation * * * of the <em>personal </em>property, <em>as herein </em>defined, of each taxpayer subject to taxation under this act, located in any municipality of this state, separating the value of such property located in, on or over public streets, highways, roads or other public places, and the value of such property not so located;\u201d in section 10, directing an apportionment of the tax levied under section 6 (a) \u201cto the various municipalities in the proportion the value as herein defined * * * of the <em>personal properly as herein defined </em>of such taxpayer located in, on or over any public street, highway, road or other public place in each such municipality bears to the total value of such property of such taxpayer located in, on or over any public street, highway, road or other public place in this state;\u201d and in section 11, likewise providing for an apportionment on a similar basis of the taxes levied under section 6 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Evidently, the object was to eliminate intangible personal property as a factor in the apportionment formula in order to secure what the legislature deemed to be a fair and equitable distribution o^ the excises. The allotment was to be based upon the value of all personal property, including railways, tracks, ties, lines, wares, and so on, but excluding electric and gas appliances and the by-products of gas manufactur\u00e9 held for resale and not for the purpose of production, transmission or distribution of gas or electric energy, and intangible personal property, since the inclusion of these items would make for unfairness in the distribution of a tax that wras intended to be a substitute, in part at least, for the local direct tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>It is reasonable to assume that the intangible personal property of such a corporation is concerned with the conduct of its business, and therefore that it has contributed in some substantial measure to the <em>quantum </em>of the gross receipts from its Hues or maims; at least, that assumption seems to have been indulged by the legislature. The fact that there may be intangibles not so classable, and thus inequality in the distribution of the tax burden, does not call for a different consi ruction. That is a matter for the legislature; it does not nullify the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">This brings us to the fundamental question raised; Is the act of 1938, <em>supra, </em>as so construed, unconstitutional \u201cin so far as it purports to exempt the property of these utilities other than the franchise?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Conceding that \u201cproperty devoted to utility purposes may be separately classified for the purpose of taxation,\u201d defendants maintain that \u201cthe object of such classification is to obtain an assessment at true value, and to impose (not avoid) a fair distribution of the cost of government upon such properties;\u201d and that utility property \u201cmay be separately classified for the purpose of imposing a tax,\u201d but \u201cthe tax, when imposed, must be predicated on true value.\u201d There is invoked the principle that exemption from taxation must be based upon a <em>quid pro quo; </em>and it is said that the \u201cproperty of this prosecutor\u201d cannot be \u201cexempted from taxation,\u201d since \u201cthe utility is organized for the profit of its shareholders,\u201d and \u201cits property is devoted to their gain, and not to the gain of the public.\u201d The' further contention is made that \u201cif the fact that an excise tax is paid b}7 the owner justifies an exemption, then the legislature may accordingly exempt all property used by the doctor, lawjrer, and hairpin manufacturer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">But this reasoning evinces a misapprehension of the principles which have received the approval of the Court of Errors and Appeals. The excises thus imposed do not take the classification of a \u201cproperty tax;\u201d and the constitutional mandate for generality and uniformity is therefore not applicable. This has long been settled law. <em>State Board of Assessors </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co., </em>48 <em>N. J. L. </em>146; <em>Jersey City </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>126 <em>Id. </em>353.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>What has been done here does not constitute an exemption in the true, unqualified sense, but rather the substitution of a gross receipts tax for the lpcal direct tax. It is the exclusion of a class that is otherwise taxed. <em>Public Service Co-ordinated Transport </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>97. The case of <em>Salem, and Pennsgrove Traction Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and </em>Assessment, 97 <em>Id. </em>386; <em>affirmed, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>570, is directly in point, and is therefore controlling. It treats of taxes of the class levied under section 6 (b) of the act of 1938, <em>supra. </em>It was contended that such \u201ca tax upon gross receipts is not a tax according to true value, as required by the constitution;\u201d and the holding was that it was a license rather than a property tax,' imposed by the state as a condition precedent to the exercise of special privileges in the streets. Mr. Justice Trenchard declared: \u201cThe act discloses a legislative intent to substitute in place of the personal property tax an additional franchise tax in the nature of a license tax, based upon gross receipts, for the use of the streets. It is within the province of the legislature to exempt certain classes of corporations from personal property taxation, and treat them as a separate class by themselves, and, as long as those of that class are taxed according to uniform rules, no exception can be taken to that method. Public utilities, by reason of the peculiar nature of their business, form a separate and distinct class in themselves, and, as such, can be used as a proper classification for the purpose of taxation without violating the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">It is denied that this adjudication is conclusive. What is termed a pronouncement that the \u201cexemption was proper\u201d is dismissed as <em>\"dictum;\u201d </em>and it is said that \u201cthe circumstances were unfavorable for a proper presentation and consideration of that important question,\u201d since \u201cthe attack was made by the utilitjr, which contended that the tax was invalid because it was a tax on property and not based on the true value of the property.\u201d We deem what was thus said to have been essential to.the determination of the case in hand, and it therefore has the force of an adjudication binding upon us. The argument is one to be addressed to our court of last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Tims it is that there was no jurisdiction in the Monmouth County Board of Taxation to entertain the proceedings instituted by tax collector of the defendant municipality for-the assessment of prosecutor\u2019s intangible personal property for the purposes of taxation for the years in question; and the orders denying prosecutor\u2019s motions to dismiss the proceedings are therefore reversed, and the causes are remanded to the end that the complaints be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
