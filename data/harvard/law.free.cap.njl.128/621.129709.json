S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 688) to recover damages for the pecuniary loss sustained by the next of kin. Negligence in the management and operation of the vessel was alleged. There was a nonsuit on the ground that the evidence, as to negligence did not create an issue for the determination of the jury; and the plaintiff appeals from the consequent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">On a prior trial of the issue, there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. This court reversed the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>on the ground that there was error in the denial of defendant\u2019s motions for a nonsuit and a directed verdict. 120 <em>N. J. L. </em>414. The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court, but rested it upon error in the charge. 122 <em>Id. </em>26. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We are of the view that the nonsuit was proper. It is not maintained that the deceased fell overboard as the result of defendant\u2019s negligence. The contention made here is that there was negligence in \u201cthe unskillful maneuvering of the vessel creating a swell around the drowning man and pulling the life preserver out of his reach, which life preserver was on a rope fastened to the boat,\u201d contrary to the cited statute (46 <em>U. S. C. </em>A., \u00a7 481), and also in the fact that \u201cthe line attached to the life preserver was too short.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">There was no evidence tending to show negligence in the \u201cmaneuvering\u201d of the boat. On the contrary, the proofs reveal that the crew exerted themselves to the utmost to rescue the deceased. The movement of the boat was in large measure due to the action of the tide after it came into close proximity to the deceased and the power had been turned off to facilitate the work of rescue. There was no tangible basis in the evidence for a finding that the lifebuoy used in the attempted rescue was \u201cpermanently secured in any way,\u201d in violation of the cited statute. The deckhand who threw the buoy into the water \u201cstepped on the end\u201d of the attached rope, obviously for the purpose of retaining control of the buoy. The buoy came within a few feet of the deceased, but, due to exhaustion, he could not reach it. Another deckhand went overboard when the buoy was thrown, but the deceased sank before he could reach him.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">While there was evidence that the line attached to the buoy was \u201cabout thirteen or fourteen fathoms,\u201d the statute provided (46 <em>U. 8. G. A., </em>\u00a7 -481) that where two buoys only are carried, \u201cone- shall be fitted with a lifeline at least fifteen fathoms in length,\u201d and there was no evidence that the other buoy was not so equipped. Moreover, the proofs show that the length of the line was in no sense the proximate cause of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
