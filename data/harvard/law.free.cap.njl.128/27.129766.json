H. T.

He was 58\u00bd years old- He had arterio-sclerosis heart disease. While engaged in overtime and extra heavy exertion, he died of coronary occlusion with thrombosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The proofs show that this could have been caused by the extra strain under which he was working that day. We, too, find as a fact that there was a causal relation between the extra heavy exertion occasioned by decedent\u2019s work and his death. The case clearly falls within the rule laid down in <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. v. Kelly, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Janssen Dairy Co., </em>122 <em>Id. </em>494; <em>Ciocca </em>v. <em>National Sugar Refining Co., </em>124 <em>Id. </em>329; <em>Molnar </em>v. <em>American Smelting Co., </em>127 <em>Id. </em>118; <em>affirmed, </em>128 <em>Id. </em>11.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The writ is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
