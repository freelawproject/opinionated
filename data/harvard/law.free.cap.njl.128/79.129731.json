The jury empanelled to try the issue returned a verdict for the tenant; and the landlord appeals from the consequent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>It is assigned for error that the trial judge denied the landlord\u2019s motion for the direction of a verdict in his favor on the ground, generally, that there was an utter lack of proof of the pleaded contractual duty to repair'. The assignment is not well-grounded. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">These are the essential facts: Defendant purchased the premises \u2014 a single family dwelling house \u2014 in June, 1939. Tlaihtiff was then in possession under a tenancy from month to month created by contract with the prior owner. There was evidence tending to show that immediately after defendant took title to the lands, he and the plaintiff conferred respecting a continuance of the tenancy; that plaintiff informed defendant that the house was \u201cin very bad condition,\u201d and she would not continue the tenancy unless it was \u201cfixed up;\u201d that defendant agreed\u2019that if plaintiff would \u201cstay in this house\u201d at the stipulated monthly rental, he would \u201cfix this house, paint it inside, orxtside, fix the sidewalks * * and that plaintiff unconditionally accepted the proposal, and continued in possession of the premises on those terms until the mishap occurred. Sometime in the 3rear 1939, a small portion of the ceiling of one of the bedrooms fell. Plaintiff called the matter to the attention of defendant; and, after an inspection, the latter said: \u201cNever mind that. I will fix it.\u201d He did not do so; and, on March 16th, 1940, the remainder of the ceiling fell and,caused the injury for which this action was brought. Defendant had been a building contractor for some fourteen years; and he admitted that the fall of the ceiling was due to the fact that \u201cthe keys had parted from the lath,\u201d and that an inspection would have disclosed the parting of the keys to one of his experience. He conceded that \u201cfrom the very outset\u201d- \u2014 -\u201cfrom the very day that she made the agreement with\u201d him \u201cto stay as a tenant\u201d \u2014 plaintiff \u201chad complained many times\u201d about the condition of the house, and had asked him to make all needed repairs; and that \u201con the occasion\u201d when \u201cshe agreed to continue in possession\u201d of the lands as his tenant, \u201cshe had asked\u201d him \u201cto fix up plaster work where there were cracks on the walls and ceilings of the house in different places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Thus it is that there was a substantial basis in the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>for tlie jury\u2019s finding that, under the tenancy contract between plaintiff and defendant, the latter obligated himself to repair the premises, and that plaintiff\u2019s injury was the natural and proximate result of his default in the performance of the undertaking. Compare <em>Granato </em>v. <em>Howard Savings Institution, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>94; <em>Folley </em>v. <em>United Building and Loan Association, </em>117 <em>Id. </em>54; <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Krinick, </em>116 <em>Id. </em>597; <em>Harenburg </em>v. August, 119 <em>Id. </em>83; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fenster, </em>103 <em>Id. </em>566.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">There is no occasion to determine whether a continuing duty to keep the premises in repair arose out of the agreement thus made. It suffices that the contract laid upon the landlord the duty of making such repairs to the structure as were then necessary, and thus invested him with full control thereof, and 'that the evidence gives rise to the inference that lie did not exercise reasonable care in the discharge of the obligation. It was fairly deducible that if the duty so measured had been satisfied, the injury would not have been sustained. The condition of disrepair which produced the harm is comprehended in defendant\u2019s undertaking to \u201cfix\u201d the \u201chouse,\u201d exacted by plaintiff as a condition to the continuance of the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">But the contention is made that there was no consideration for this jrromise, and it therefore takes the category of a <em>\u25a0nudum pactum. </em>This is grounded in the hypothesis that \u201cthe mere acquisition by\u201d defendant \u201cof the property did not constitute a new letting.\u201d The point is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The tenant was not bound to continue the tenancy; it was terminable on a month\u2019s notice; and the consideration for the landlord\u2019s promise to make such repairs as were then necessary, if it be so narrowed, was the continuance of the tenancy. Compare <em>Coast National Bank </em>v. Bloom, 113 <em>N. J. L. </em>597; <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>117 <em>Id. </em>23; <em>affirmed. Id. </em>426.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">And the question of the voluntary assumption of the risk was peculiarly one for the jury. After a portion of the ceiling had fallen, the tenant was assured by the landlord that he would make the needed repairs; and she continued in possession on the assumption that the landlord\u2019s contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>undertaking, then reiterated, would be fulfilled. In the circumstances, it was for the triers of the facts to determine whether the tenant appreciated and voluntarily assumed the risk of danger. The parties were not on the same footing. Defendant was skilled in construction work, and understood the hazard, while plaintiff was without such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
