The female plaintiff seeks recovery of compensation for personal injuries; and her husband sued <em>per quod, </em>and also for damages to his automobile, which was in collision with defendant\u2019s. The defendant counter-claimed for recompense for alleged physical hurts and injury to his vehicle. A jury was empanelled to try the issue; and there was a verdict of \u201cno cause for action\u201d as to plaintiffs, and for damages to defendant on the counter-claim. Plaintiffs appeal from the consequent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">The grounds of appeal are all insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">The first, second and third argued are (1) that the jury, \u201cin arriving at their verdict, guessed damages for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ant;\u201d (2) that there was \u201cno legal or competent evidence to support the award of damages to the defendant;\u201d and (3) that there was \u201cno warrant in law for the return of a verdict against plaintiff Florence Fleming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">None of these assignments specifies judicial action respecting which error is predicated. <em>Abbe </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>212; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>108 <em>Id. </em>538; <em>Press </em>v. <em>Klink, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>475; <em>Renner </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>116 <em>Id. </em>240; <em>Zlotnik </em>v. <em>Northwestern National Insurance Co., </em>116 <em>Id. </em>107.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The fourth reason is that the trial judge erred \u201cin permitting defendant to testify touching a credit allowed to him upon the automobile which he alleged was damaged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Where a ruling on evidence is involved, it is requisite that the ground of appeal state the name of the witness and the questions or answers objected to and ruled upon by the trial judge. <em>State Highway Commission </em>v. <em>Zyk, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>156; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Keegan, supra; Carlisle </em>v. <em>Winant, </em>110 <em>Id. </em>333; <em>Feldman </em>v. <em>Jacob Branfman &amp; Son, Inc., </em>111 <em>Id. </em>37; <em>Diamond Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Feldstein, </em>112 <em>Id. </em>514.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The next and last assignment argued is that the trial judge erred \u201cin refusing plaintiffs\u2019 request to charge that there was no evidence of joint enterprise between plaintiffs; or control of the automobile of Albert H. Fleming by Florence Fleming; and that no negligence of the driver of such automobile could be attributed to plaintiff Florence Fleming.\u201d The request follows: \u201cNot being on a joint enterprise, if both drivers were negligent, the negligence of either driver may not be attributed to Mrs. Fleming and she might recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The rule is that an assignment grounded in the refusal to charge a request should embody the \u201cactual language\u201d of the request. \u201cFor certainty and convenience\u201d the request should bo \u201cquoted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blaine, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>325; <em>Slathos </em>v. <em>Bunevich, </em>107 <em>Id. </em>269; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Keegan, supra; Cornish </em>v. <em>Jenks, Gwynne &amp; Co., </em>109 <em>Id. </em>87. The specification does not conform to this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The appeal is accordingly dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
