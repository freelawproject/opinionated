A number of reasons are urged in support of the application, only one of which we need consider. According to the determination of facts, there was before the Bureau a stipulation that petitioner had received \u201c25% partial permanent, or 125 weeks plus 10 teeth, or a total of $2,199.45.\u201d The Deputy Commissioner made an award \u201cthat judgment final be and the same is hereby entered in favor of the petitioner and against the respondent for 40% partial permanent or 200 weeks, at $13.33 a week, less 25% or 125 weeks heretofore paid, leaving a balance of 75 weeks still due and owing, which, at $13.33 a week, amounts to $995.75.\u201d If the award of 25% is all that the stipulation contemplated as payment for partial permanent disability, then the Bureau\u2019s finding that there was $995.75 due and unpaid is correct, but obviously the total paid for partial permanent was $2,199.45, which is more than the 125 weeks represented by 25%.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">It is clear that there are questions calling for determination and therefore a writ of <em>certiorari </em>will be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
