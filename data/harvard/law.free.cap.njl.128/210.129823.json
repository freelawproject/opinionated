J. L. </em>422. A finality would eventuate from a judgment resulting from the new trial granted. <em>Gaffney </em>v. Illingsworth, 90 <em>Id. </em>490.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">(2) The general rule is that an application to set aside a verdict and to award a new trial is addressed to the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>discretion o\u00a3 the trial court. An error cannot be urged against such exercise of that discretion. This is subject only to the modification stated by the Court of Errors and Appeals in the recent case of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, Inc., et al., </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>46. The instant case does not come within that exception. A review of the testimony brought the trial judge to the conclusion that the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and was the result of mistake or prejudice. There i's nothing in this result to shock either reason or justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Inasmuch as the order under review is not appealable, the appeal will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
