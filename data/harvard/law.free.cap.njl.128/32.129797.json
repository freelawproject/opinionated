Defects are alleged in the complaint in that it recites that the sanitary code was passed by the Township Committee December <em>9th, </em>1930, when in fact it was adopted on that day by the Board of Health. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>26 :3-64. The variation is immaterial. Prosecutor knew of the provisions of the code. He sought a permit, could not get it and went on with the violation. The defect could have been cured by amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">2. Defects in the form of the conviction. It follows the statutory form, except in this \u201cand sentenced him to pay a fine of $100 and $6.25 costs of court or 90 days in the County Jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Section 17 of the code is as follows: \u201cAny person or persons violating any provisions of this Code shall be liable to a penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars and not more than one hundred dollars, the amount in each case to be determined by the trial judge, unless otherwise provided for herein.\u201d Such penalty conforms with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>26:3-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">The recorder imposing the sentence was authorized so to do by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>26:3-77 as follows: \u201cThe district court, justice of the peace, police justice or recorder shall, if judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ment is rendered for the plaintiff, forthwith issue execution against the goods and chattels and person of the defendant, and may, unless an appeal is granted, cause a defendant who refuses or neglects to pay the amount of the judgment rendered against him and all costs and charges incident thereto, to be committed to the county jail for a period not exceeding ninety days.\u201d That such is the fact appears from the commitment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The magistrate in imposing the sentence was, in short, saying to the defendant, as he could under the statute say, you are liable to pay a penalty of $100 and costs, and you shall stand committed till it is paid. Such is not an alternative sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
