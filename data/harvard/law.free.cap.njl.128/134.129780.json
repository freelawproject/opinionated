Plaintiff deposited $100 on account with defendants\u2019 attorneys, and the present suit is to recover back that $100. Plaintiff had judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The agreement provided that Dorman was to procure for plaintiff, Dick, a lease of the concession, obviously in writing, to \u201cbe prepared by Fast &amp; Fast, attorneys of said landlord in the form usually prepared for such concessions, a copy of said form having been presented to the party of the second part and he having approved the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The question of fact, already alluded to, was whether, when the lease was presented to plaintiff to sign, it was \u201cin the form\u201d which had been presented to plaintiff and approved by him. The plaintiff testified that the lease presented varied from that form, in that such lease contained the clause quoted in our former opinion (foot of page 62), and that no such clause was in the form submitted to him when he signed the contract of purchase. Most of the argument, and part of the written decision of the District Court, revolve around the question whether the said clause conferred on the prospective landlord certain powers to regulate the plaintiff\u2019s business; and the trial court so held. But we deem this immaterial to the decision of the appeal. The plaintiff was entitled to a lease in the form that he had inspected and approved. If the clause in question was not in the form approved, plaintiff was entitled to reject the lease containing that clause, and have his money back. If, on the contrary, it was in the form so inspected and approved, he was not entitled to reject the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>lease except for some other possible variance, as to which no claim was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">* <em>Exhibit </em>D-3, listed in the clerk\u2019s docket as \u201cLease Sample,\u201d is a four-page printed form of lease, described in the state of the case settled by the court, as \u201ca copy of said proposed lease.\u201d A large part of the printed matter is erased, but a clause numbered 5 near the foot of the first page reads that \u201cthe tenant will at all times comply with and carry out the rules and policies of the Market as laid down in the operation and conduct of the same by the Lessor.\u201d But this is not stated to be the document \u201cpresented to the party of the Second part\u201d at the time he signed the contract. So the question of fact remains, whether the \u201crules and policies\u201d clause was in the \u201cform\u201d presented to and approved by the plaintiff. As to this, we have no finding of fact by the trial court. On this point the state of the case, settled by the judge, reads as follows: \u201cThe plaintiff testified that the form of lease presented to him on the signing of <em>Exhibit </em>IP-1\u2019 and referred to therein, did not contain any provision giving the defendant the right to control plaintiff\u2019s selling prices and neither the defendant nor his attorney denied said statement.\u201d But we have no finding in that regard, and the decision proceeds on other grounds which we deem irrelevant to the true issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In this situation <em>R. S. </em>2:32-212 seems plainly applicable. It reads as follows: \u201cUpon an allegation of diminution of the record or the failure to return truly any fact or facts by a judge of a district court, the supreme court or a justice thereof at chambers, may, in term or in vacation, rule the judge of the district court to certify as to a fact or alleged fact claimed to be material and not found in the case as agreed or settled and sent up.\u201d The trial court will be ruled to certify whether or not \u201cthe form presented to\u201d the plaintiff and \u201capproved\u201d by him contained the clause in question. If yea, the judgment will be reversed; if nay, the judgment under review will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
