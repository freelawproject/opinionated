Tippett.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b240-14\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEu\">The question at issue is whether the death of prosecutrix\u2019 husband is reasonabty attributable to an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment with the defendant corporation, and therefore compensable under <em>R. S. </em>1937, 34:15-7, <em>fit seq: </em>The Deputy Commissioner found that the <em>onus probandi </em>had been sustained, but the Essex Court of Common Pleas ruled otherwise and dismissed the petition. We concur in the latter view.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">Concededly, the deceased employee met with an accident on October 30th, 1936, in the pursuit of his employment as a stevedore. While pulling a handtrucb up a gangplank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>leading from a moored boat to defendant\u2019s freight house, his head struck a beam extending across the top of the building entrance, and he thereby suffered a laceration of the scalp in the occipital region, lie was immediately taken to a hospital for <em>treatment. </em>The wound was cleansed and sutured, and he returned to his employment within an hour or two and resumed his usual duties. He worked the remainder of the day, and daily thereafter, ten hours per day, until the ensuing November 13th, when he was found prostrate on the deck of a boat whither his labors had called him. Death occurred shortly thereafter. There is no evidence of another industrial mishap on the day of his death. The contention is that the cause of death was a fracture of the base of the skull suffered in the accident adverted to. But it is in this respect that the proofs are deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The widow and a neighbor testified that, from the time of the injury until death occurred, the deceased complained of headaches and manifested what a medico-chirurgical witness, Dr. Haskell, in response to a hypothetical question, characterized as objective symptoms of a \u201cfracture in the anterior fossa of the base of the skull\u201d (and, possibly, a fracture of the inner plate also) and \u201cinjury to the right cerebrum of the brain below the capsule, with a hemorrhage,\u201d warranting the conclusion that death came from an \u201cepileptic seizure\u201d ensuing from neglect of the fracture by the attending physician, who was in the service of the defendant employer. The manifestations thus testified to were, in brief, \u201cdark streaks of blood\u201d on the victim\u2019s handkerchief after the blowing of his nose, \u201cdragging\u201d of his left leg, twitching of the face, insomnia, loss of appetite, listlessness, apparent pain, and oral \u201cfoaming\u201d during the fatal attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Yet these phenomena were not observed by the attending physician, Dr. Gluckman, who treated the deceased on alternate days until the sutures were removed on the fifth day, nor by any of his fellow employees. The patient was not heard by them to complain of headaches. This physician found no injury to the skull bone: and he \u201ccould definitely say there wasn\u2019t\u201d an \u201cinternal hemorrhage; the man had_ no complaints referable to the brain, skull, or any of the under-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tying tissues; * * * there was no evidence of any cerebral concussion.\u201d He looked for such. He inquired whether the patient had \u201chad any headaches; his eyes and eye grounds were examined; he was given an equilibratory test, knee jerks were equal.\u201d There was \u201ca complete recovery.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">And Dr. Haskell assumed, in arriving at his opinion, that the deceased had \u201cconstantly bled from the nose,\u201d which he termed a \u201cpositive sign\u201d of a skull fracture, and that he had \u201chad a terrible wallop with a big beam \u2014 he hit *his head against the beam.\u201d It was shown that, after the accident, the deceased continued along the1 gangplank with the truck; and this the witness explained thus: \u201cHe could not drop because he was holding his hands against handle bars and that would prevent him from dropping on the floor, otherwise he would.\u201d Yet his subsequent behavior would seem to suggest a much less grievous injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">But there was definite proof of the cause of death at variance with the deductions of this witness. An autopsy performed by Dr. Berardinelli, an assistant to the medical examiner of the County of Essex, at the direction of his superior, revealed what he considered conclusive evidence that death resulted from a \u201cspontaneous rupture of an aortic aneuiysm.\u201d An aneurysm is a sac formed by the dilatation of the walls of an artery due to local degeneration or injury of the inner coats of the vessel, and filled with blood \u2014 in this instance, a condition specific and not traumatic in origin. A contributory cause of death was hemoperieardium, <em>i. e., </em>the filling of the pericardial cavity with blood flowing from the ruptured aneurysm, and the clotting of the blood content. The condition was chronic. It was a \u201claminated clotting.\u201d This aneurysm was of long standing \u2014 \u201cfor years.\u201d Syphilis is the usual but not the sole cause of the condition. This witness\u2019 examination of the skull also disclosed a \u201clineal wound still covered with fresh dried scab \u2014 three inches long.\u201d It was a \u201cscalp wound, in scalp tissue.\u201d There was no indication 'whatever of a skull fracture or a cerebral hemorrhage. The matters testified to by the widow would not lead him to a different result. \u201cFoaming at the mouth\u201d signified an epileptic seizure to Dr. Haskell; to .this witness it meant \u201cterminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>edema of the lungs.\u201d Dr. Haskell agreed that it \u201ctakes years to form ail aneurysm;\u201d but he insisted that the bursting of the aneurysm was not the canse of the deceased\u2019s death, terming it a \u201cmere coincidence.\u201d It was his view that the rupture was due to \u201cincreased pressure in\u201d the aneurysm produced by the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In these circumstances, it is a fair and reasonable presumption that the cause of death was a breaking of the aortic aneurysm, nnassociated with the physical consequences of the industrial accident. Such an aneurysm is inoperable and otherwise incurable, and ordinarily terminates life by rupture. There is no basis in the proofs for the inference that there was a traumatic aggravation of the pre-existing diseased condition, and the accident was therefore the causative agent of the breach. Prosecutrix\u2019 expert did not venture that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Even if tlie evidence were in equipoise, prosecutrix could not prevail. To warrant a recovery, it is essential that the evidence preponderate in favor of the tendered hypothesis. That must he a rational inference, <em>i. e., </em>such as is based upon a preponderance of the probabilities according to the common experience of mankind. It is required to be a probable or more probable hypothesis with reference to the possibility of other hypotheses. This is the accepted standard of persuasion governing the triers of the facts. The law does not proceed to judgment on pure surmise. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>487; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Gilbert Machine Works, Inc., </em>122 <em>Id. </em>533; <em>Jaeger </em>v. <em>Elizabethtown Consolidated Gas Co., </em>124 <em>Id. </em>420; <em>Auten </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>115 <em>Id. 71. </em>To hold on the evidence adduced that the industrial accident was the producing cause of death would be the merest conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
