Parker, by this appeal, seeks to void the divorce granted to her ex-husband, notwithstanding his subsequent marriage to another woman shortly before his death. Her motive seems clear: she is trying to reach into the grave to claim title to the property of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The husband was granted an absolute divorce from her on the grounds that they lived separate and apart for two years. The proceedings had been expedited, with appellant\u2019s consent, because Mr. Parker was gravely ill and wanted to be divorced so that he could remarry. The divorce was granted on January 4, 1985, and duly recorded by the clerk of the court as prescribed in \u00a7 7-106 of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court reserved the power to determine which property of the parties was marital property, for a period of ninety days, pursuant to \u00a7 8-203 of the Family Law Article. Notwithstanding this reservation, the judgment of divorce was final and appealable, Family Law Article \u00a7 8-213(b);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Athanason v. Athanason, </em>48 Md.App. 231, 233 n. 4, 426 A.2d 16 (1981), but no appeal was taken from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">On March 5, 1985, approximately one month after Mr. Parker died, appellant launched an attack upon the judgment of divorce by filing a motion to strike, alleging that the lower court had lacked jurisdiction to enter the decree. The motion was denied by Judge Pollitt, in a written order filed on March 22, 1985. In addition, the March 22, 1985 Order of Court correctly stated that the divorce judgment was final, citing Family Law Section 8-213.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The denial of appellant\u2019s motion to strike was also a final judgment and appealable, <em>First Federated Commodity Trust Corporation v. Commissioner of Securities for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>State of Maryland, </em>272 Md. 329, 333, 322 A.2d 539 (1974), but again no appeal was taken within the thirty day limit contained in Rule 1012a.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">A final disposition of the marital property of the parties was achieved in an opinion and order of the court filed on September 19, 1985.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 9, 1985 appellant filed an order for appeal, purporting to appeal \u201cfrom the judgment entered in this case on or about September 19, 1985, from the decree of divorce entered on or about January 4, 1985, and from the Order of March 22, 1985, denying the Motion to Strike the Judgment of Absolute Divorce, and each of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In her brief appellant alleges error with respect to the two earlier orders of the court, but alleges no error with respect to the September 19th opinion and order which disposed of the couple\u2019s marital property. We shall therefore affirm the September 19th judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The appeal from the January 4th and March 22nd orders was untimely and therefore the issues presented in appellant\u2019s brief are not properly before us. We shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Appeals to this court are controlled by various rules and statutes. The Maryland Rules are promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the statutes are promulgated by the legislature. We must examine the interplay between these statutes and rules to determine their effect upon the case <em>sub judice. See e.g., Pappas v. Pappas, </em>287 Md. 455, 413 A.2d 549 (1980); <em>Funger v. Mayor of Somerset, </em>244 Md. 141, 150, 223 A.2d 168 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 12-301 permits a party to \u201c ... appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d The exceptions to this rule are enumerated in Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-302. By statute, the legislature has permitted appeals of certain interlocutory orders. Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-303. The judgment of January 4, 1985 which divorced the parties, however, is not one of the enumerated appealable interlocutory orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The legislature has also determined that \u201cAny decree of annulment or of limited or absolute divorce in which the court reserves any power under this subtitle [Subtitle 2. Property Disposition in Annulment and Divorce] <em>is final and subject to appeal </em>in all other respects.\u201d (emphasis added) Family Law Article \u00a7 8-213(b). Thus any divorce decree which reserves only marital property issues is a final order and appealable pursuant to Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-301, which as noted earlier permits the appeal of a final judgment entered by a circuit court in a civil case. <em>See, also, Athanason, </em>48 Md.App. at 233 n. 4,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 426 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In her brief appellant states \u201c[i]f the procedural requirements of Rule 2-602(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> apply in addition to the substantive provisions of FL \u00a7 8-213(b) the January 4, 1985 divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>decree was not a final judgment and her appeal, taken on October 8, 1985, within thirty days of the conclusion of the entire case, was timely.\u201d But Rule 2-602 does not apply to this case because the right to appeal was expressly created by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Rule 2-602 permits the trial judge to exercise his discretion to allow the appeal of an otherwise non-final judgment by expressly determining that there is no just reason for delay and directing that the judgment be entered as to one or more, but fewer than all of the claims presented in a given case. In <em>Blocher v. Harlow, </em>268 Md. 571, 303 A.2d 395 (1973) the Court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> citing <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Mackey, </em>351 U.S. 427, 76 S.Ct. 895, 100 L.Ed. 1297, likened the role of the trial judge to that of a \u201cdispatcher\u201d who is \u201cto determine, in the first instance, the appropriate time <em>when each \u2018final decision\u2019 </em>upon \u2018one or more but less than all\u2019 of the claims in a multiple claims action is ready for appeal.\u201d (emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>it was the legislature that determined that the divorce decree would be final and appeal-able, as evidenced by \u00a7 8-213 of the Family Law Article. <em>See also, Athanason, supra. </em>Therefore the trial judge had no discretion in the matter. An immediate appeal should have been taken pursuant to Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-301 and Family Law \u00a7 8-213 without regard to Rule 2-602. <em>See, Pappas v. </em>Pappas,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>(Rule 605 (predecessor of Rule 2-602) not applicable to appeals expressly permitted by statute); <em>Funger v. Mayor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>of Somerset, supra, </em>(right to appeal created by statute not affected by Rule 605a); <em>Della Ratta v. Dixon, </em>47 Md.App. 270, 277, 422 A.2d 409 (1980) (the Rule will not limit or preclude an appeal permitted by statute.); <em>Howard County v. Eberhart, </em>58 Md.App. 407, 414, 473 A.2d 509 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">This court\u2019s opini\u00f3n in <em>Quigley v. Quigley, </em>54 Md.App. 45, 456 A.2d 1305 (1983) was erroneous in so far as it determined that the decree in that case was not an appealable final judgment. In <em>Quigley </em>this court failed to consider the effect of the then existing predecessor of the current Family Law Article \u00a7 8-213, and therefore we overrule the holding in <em>Quigley </em>that the appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Appellant cites no authority to support her conclusion that \u201c[t]he Order of March 22, 1985 was an interlocutory order and not a final judgment.\u201d \u201cIt is now well settled in this State, that a plaintiff or complainant in a law or equity action, as the case may be, has the right to an immediate appeal from an order striking a judgment or decree which has become enrolled ... (citations omitted). And, likewise, a defendant may appeal from an order refusing to set aside such an enrolled judgment or decree.\u201d (citations omitted) <em>First Federated Commodity Trust Corp., </em>272 Md. at 333, 322 A.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Appellant has therefore twice missed her opportunity to appeal the issue of the lower court\u2019s jurisdiction to enter the judgment of divorce based on a two year separation, because she failed to appeal from the actual judgment, and then failed to appeal from the order which foreclosed her secondary attack on that judgment, i.e., the denial of the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">JUDGMENT OF SEPTEMBER 19, 1985 AFFIRMED.

Chapter 154 of the Acts of 1980 effective July 1, 1980 transferred \u00a7 3-6A-07(c) to \u00a7 3-6A-07(d); and Ch. 159 of the Acts of 1983 effective July 1, 1983 caused \u00a7 3-6A-07 to be renumbered as \u00a7 3-6A-08. Chapter 296 of the Acts of 1984, effective October 1, 1984, <em>inter alia, </em>repealed \u00a7 3-6A-08 and enacted the present Family Law Article \u00a7 8-213.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">.
