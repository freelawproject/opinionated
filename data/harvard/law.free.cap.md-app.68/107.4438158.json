It presents one simple question for our resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">Whether a landowner in a developed or urban area has a cause of action against the adjoining property owner when tree limbs, vines and leaves, which originate from the latter\u2019s property, cause injury to the former\u2019s property-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">We hold that under the circumstances of the instant case, there is no cause of action and that the only available remedy is the Massachusetts Rule of Self-Help. Thus, the trial court was correct in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">As the instant case comes before this court on an expedited appeal, we shall simply restate the Agreed Statement of the Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">1. Sometime during the year of 1978, Your Appellant, Jonathan Melnick, purchased the real property located in Baltimore City, known as 900-920 E. 25th Street (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cMelnick Property\u201d). Sharing the common boundary with this property is the Railroad Right-of-Way passing through the City, North of 25th Street. (This property is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cRailroad Property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>2. At the time of the purchase of the Melnick Property, there was a 35,000 square foot building (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe building\u201d) situated at or near the common boundary with the Railroad Property. Prior to Melnick\u2019s purchase of the property he knew the roof of this building was in poor condition and had plans for its replacement which occurred immediately after the purchase. Since the roof replacement, Melnick has experienced constant clogged drains, standing water, roof deterioration and some water damage to the interior of the building. Moreover, there have been several instances of water damage to stored merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">3. The damage to the building and roof was caused by overhanging limbs, vines, leaves and/or other natural growth extending from the adjacent Railroad Property. Neither Melnick nor anyone else to Melnick\u2019s knowledge, knows if the trees and vines in question were natural growth or planted by the Defendant and/or its agents. While Melnick claims no expertise in landscaping, he did notice from airplane flights over the property, that it appeared to him the foliage was planted in an effort to diminish erosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">4. Neither the Defendant nor any of its agents planted any of the trees and vines at issue. In fact, the defendant has a strict policy against planting trees, bushes or foliage on B &amp; O Railroad Property <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">5. Melnick, on numerous occasions, advised the defendant of the imminent danger of harm as well as the actual danger and harm that was being done by the branches, trees, and vines and leaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">6. On at least one occasion, Melnick attempted to remedy the situation by himself. At cost to him of $1,000.00, he cut down several trees, however, the relief was only temporary since the trees and foliage would rapidly grow back.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Melnick filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking damages for Private Nuisance, Negligence and Trespass. C.S.X. responded by filing a Motion for Summa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ry Judgment alleging that, as a matter of law, the adjoining landowner is not responsible for the results of natural growth on his land that damages the land or property of his neighbor. The trial judge agreed and ruled in C.S.X.\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In order to understand the common law principles that are at the root of the issue in this appeal, we must first understand two generative rules: (1) the Massachusetts Self-Help Rule and (2) the Restatement Rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">1. <em>The Massachusetts Rule: Self-Help</em></p>\n<p id=\"AE\">In <em>Michalson v. Nutting, </em>275 Mass. 232, 175 N.E. 490 (1931), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts announced that a property owner, whose house had been damaged by encroaching roots from his neighbor\u2019s land, had no cause of action against him, but had a welbrecognized right to resort to self-help and cut off the intruding growth. The policy behind this rule of self-help was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhA\">[a]n owner of land is at liberty to use his land, and all of it, to grow trees. Their growth naturally and reasonably will be accompanied by the extension of boughs and the penetration of roots over and into adjoining property of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">The neighbor, though without right of appeal to the courts if harm results to him, is, nevertheless, not without remedy: ... His remedy is in his own hands. The common sense of the common law has recognized that it is wiser to leave the individual to protect himself, if harm results to him from this exercise of another\u2019s right to use his property in a reasonable way, than to subject that other to the annoyance, and the public to the burden, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>actions at law, which would be likely to be innumerable and, in many instances, purely vexatious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>Id. </em>175 N.E. at 490-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">2. <em>The Restatement Rule: Natural/Artificial Distinction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The Restatement Rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adopts the rule of non-liability espoused in the Massachusetts Rule, but limits it to situations where the damage is caused by a \u201cnatural condition\u201d of the land. As explained in Comment b to Section 363,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvB\">\u201cNatural condition of the land\u201d is used to indicate that the condition of land has not been changed by any act of a human being, whether the possessor or any of his predecessors in possession, or a third person dealing with the land either with or without the consent of the then possessor. It is also used to include the natural growth of trees, weeds, and other vegetation upon land not artificially made receptive to them. On the other hand, a structure erected upon land is a non-natural or artificial condition, as are trees or plants planted or preserved, and changes in the surface by excavation or filling, irrespective of whether they are harmful in themselves or become so only because of the subsequent operation of natural forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In sum, the rule of non-liability applies only where there is a natural condition. In other cases, however, where damage results from a non-natural or artificial condition, the rule is one of liability. This is reflected in the <em>Restatement (Sec</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>ond) of Torts </em>\u00a7 364, which was approved recently in <em>Tadjer v. Montgomery County, </em>61 Md.App. 492, 487 A.2d 658 (1985). We held in <em>Tadjer </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">If the defendants knew or should have known that the <em>artificial condition </em>created by them involved an unreasonable risk of physical harm to others, then they have a duty to make safe or warn of the dangerous condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgK\"><em>Id. </em>at 502, 487 A.2d 658 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">3. <em>Application and Modification of the Two Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA\">The case most often cited for its examination of the policies behind the two rules is <em>Sterling v. Weinstein, </em>75 A.2d 144 (D.C.1950). Very much like the facts in the case <em>sub judice, </em>leaves and buds from the defendant\u2019s overhanging branches had fallen onto the plaintiff\u2019s building, clogged rain gutters thereon, and resulted in water damage to the building. After reviewing the applicable case law, the District of Columbia court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">[W]e think the cases are in agreement that trees ordinarily are not nuisances; that overhanging branches which merely cast shade or drop leaves on the land are not nuisances; that if under any circumstances overhanging branches or protruding roots do constitute a nuisance it is only when they do sensible or substantial harm; and that, whether nuisances or not, a landowner may always cut away to his property line branches and roots from trees of the adjoining owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 147 (footnote omitted). Looking next to the Restatement and Massachusetts Rules, it rejected the Restatement\u2019s natural/artificial distinction as one which \u201ccannot reasonably be made in our jurisdiction which is almost entirely urban.\u201d <em>Id. See Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 57 p. 391 (5th ed. 1984). Instead, it chose the Massachusetts Rule and explained, at page 148:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">The simplicity and certainty of the Massachusetts rule appeals to us. It leaves no doubt as to the rights and obligations of the parties. While it places the burden on the owner of land to protect himself by cutting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>invading branches and roots, generally that burden is not great. It is of some significance that in this and many other jurisdictions there have been no reported cases involving this question. This would indicate to us that generally these questions between adjoining owners may be adjusted without the aid of courts and that the self-help rule is sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">There was, however, a dissenting opinion in <em>Sterling, </em>wherein Chief Judge Clayton said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">I have no doubt that [\u201cself-help\u201d] is <em>one </em>of his remedies; but I do not agree that it is his only one .... and other cases in the majority opinion support this view. I do not agree that he must climb onto his roof and construct scaffolding (or engage others to do the dangerous work for him) and saw off the limbs of defendant\u2019s trees. I think he has the right to demand that defendant abate the nuisance or pay for the damage caused thereby, just as he would have the right to demand that an adjoining property owner remove an unsafe structure which constituted a threat of danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 148 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Since <em>Sterling </em>there have been several cases that ostensibly would appear to be consistent with the dissenting opinion. These cases, which we note are factually distinguishable, provide an in-depth examination of the purposes and policies of those rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In <em>Rowe v. McGee, </em>5 N.C.App. 60, 168 S.E.2d 77 (1969), the North Carolina court addressed the issue of who has the responsibility for a tree which has become dangerous due to a rotten condition resulting from disease or other natural causes. Much of the discussion in that case focused on the fact that the tree was one of natural condition. The <em>Rowe </em>court noted that the natural/artificial distinction, as imposed by the Restatement, had received only lip-service in recent years; therefore, whether the dangerous condition was natural or otherwise was of no significance. Most enlightening, however, was its discussion of a recent Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>chusetts case, <em>Kurtigian v. City of Worcester, </em>348 Mass. 284, 203 N.E.2d 692 (1965), where it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">Public policy in a civilized community requires that there be someone to be held responsible for a private nuisance on each piece of real estate, and, particularly in an urban area, that there be no cases of nonliability where a private nuisance may be maintained with impunity. 348 Mass. at 291, 203 N.E.2d at 696.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">168 S.E.2d at 80 (emphasis added). Bolstered with this statement of policy, the <em>Rowe </em>court held, in part relevant to our discussion, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">Where the defendants knew that the tree on their property was decayed and liable to fall and to damage the property of [his neighbors], we think and hold that the defendants were under a duty to eliminate the danger and could not with impunity place such burden to remove the tree on [the plaintiffs].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 81 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In view of the earlier discussion in <em>Rowe, </em>rejecting the Restatement Rule, this holding is applicable to both natural and artificial conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The <em>Kurtigian </em>policy statement was relied on again in <em>Barker v. Brown, </em>236 Pa.Super. 75, 340 A.2d 566 (Pa.1975), where the Superior Court of Pennsylvania reversed a lower court\u2019s order of summary judgment for the defendant and held a landowner liable for damage when a large and decaying tree on his property fell upon the adjoining landowner\u2019s property. As in <em>Rowe, </em>the Pennsylvania court rejected the natural/artificial distinction, noting 340 A.2d at page 568:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">Though few cases directly on point have been decided in other jurisdictions, it appears that most courts, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>faced with these facts, have not opted to follow the <em>Restatement </em>view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">It then proceeded to set forth the following rule at page 569:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">[A] possessor of land in or adjacent to a developed or residential area is subject to liability for harm caused to others outside of the land by a defect in the condition of a tree thereon, if the exercise of reasonable care by the possessor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">(a) would have disclosed the defect and the risk involved therein, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">(b) would have made it reasonably safe by repair or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The most recent decision to reject both the Restatement and Massachusetts Rule, as well as the holding in <em>Sterling v. Weinstein, supra, </em>is <em>Whitesell v. Houlton, </em>2 Hawaii App. 365, 632 P.2d 1077 (1981). The issue there, as here, was whether the defendant had any duty to cut branches extending into the plaintiff\u2019s property and was therefore liable for any resulting damage or cost of cutting the branches. The Hawaii court first reviewed the treatment of this issue in the various jurisdictions including Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., California, Washington, New Jersey, and Virginia. <em>Id. </em>632 P.2d at 1078-79.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Next it considered <em>Sterling v. Weinstein\u2019s, </em>adoption of the Massachusetts Rule and its \u201csimple and certain\u201d rationale, but questioned \u201cwhether it is realistic and fair,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1079 (footnote omitted). The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">Because the owner of the tree\u2019s trunk is the owner of the tree, we think he bears some responsibility for the rest of the tree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>We hold that non-noxious plants ordinarily are not nuisances; that overhanging branches which merely cast shade or drop leaves, flowers, or fruit are not nuisances; that roots which interfere only with other plant life are not nuisances; that overhanging branches or protruding roots constitute a nuisance only when they actually cause, or there is imminent danger of them causing, sensible harm to property other than plant life, in ways other than by casting shade or dropping leaves, flowers, or fruit; that when overhanging branches or protruding roots actually cause, or there is imminent danger of them causing, sensible harm to property other than plant life, in ways other than by casting shade or dropping leaves, flowers, or fruit, the damaged or imminently endangered neighbor may require the owner of the tree to pay for the damages and to cut back the endangering branches or roots and, if such is not done within a reasonable time, the damaged or imminently endangered neighbor may cause the cutback to be done at the tree owner\u2019s expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">However, we also hold that a landowner may always, at his own expense, cut away only to his property line above or below the surface of the ground any part of the adjoining owner\u2019s trees or other plant life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\n<em>The Maryland Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The logic of this \u201cHawaiian Rule\u201d is somewhat tantalizing, in view of modern day demographics forcing residential, commercial and industrial elements closer to one another. <em>See </em>D. Noel, <em>Nuisances From Land In Its Natural Condition, </em>56 Harv.L.Rev. 772, 797-98 (1943). Although ostensibly \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d we resist this temptation and choose instead to adopt the \u201csimplicity and certainty\u201d of the Massachusetts Rule. To hold otherwise would be an open invitation to countless disputes between neighbors concerning encroaching vegetation, which could be remedied more efficiently through \u201cself-help\u201d rather than through costly and burdensome litigation. This deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>sion, of course, does not affect our earlier holding in <em>Hensley v. Montgomery County, </em>25 Md.App. 361, 334 A.2d 542 (1975), that where a landowner\u2019s property abuts a public highway the duty of inspection in rural and suburban areas is not the same as in urban and developed areas.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor are we concerned with the liability of adjoining landowners for rotted trees and limbs that cause substantial damage to their neighbors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These issues are not before us, and we express no opinion as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The narrow case that was before the circuit court concerned damage caused by clogged rain gutters. The trial judge correctly applied the Massachusetts Rule of Self-Help and held there to be no cause of action.
