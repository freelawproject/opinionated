This reading of the statute seems consistent with the interpretation the Commission has given it in its Rule 12. That rule requires an application for review (reopening) to state in detail all matters upon which the Commission is being required to change or modify its prior findings or orders. COMAR 14.09.01.12B. This clearly assumes some prior findings on the merits of the claim. An agency statute or rule and the agency\u2019s long-standing construction of it are entitled to weight. <em>Board of Education of Dorchester County v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 790-91, 506 A.2d 625 (1986); <em>Maryland Commission on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>295 Md. 586, 457 A.2d 1146 (1983); <em>National Asphalt Pavement Assoc., Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>292 Md. 75, 437 A.2d 651 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-14\">ADKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">The question put to us in this case is whether the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, once it has permitted a claimant to withdraw a claim prior to award or denial of compensation, may subsequently permit the claimant to reopen the claim. The essential facts are stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On October 28, 1981, appellant, Thomas Claude Judge, \u201csustained multiple injuries resulting from an accident occurring in Gaithersburg, Maryland and arising out of and in the course of his employment with\u201d appellees, his employers. The injuries rendered Judge a respirator dependent quadriplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">In November 1981, Judge filed a compensation claim with the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission. On December 11, however, Judge requested that the claim be withdrawn because he intended to file a claim with the Virginia Industrial Accident Commission, of which state he was a resident. On December 16 the Maryland Commission ordered that the claim \u201cbe and the same is hereby withdrawn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On February 2, 1982, the Virginia Commission \u201cawarded ... Judge compensation benefits during the course of his disability, and further awarded him medical benefits for as long as required.\u201d Later, however, that Commission denied Judge\u2019s request to be furnished with a specially-equipped van and to require the carrier \u201cto modify his residence to make it accessible for his uses as a wheelchair bound quadriplegic accident victim.\u201d On October 27, 1983, Judge requested the Maryland Commission to reopen his 1981 claim for further proceedings. The Commission denied that request on November 2, 1984, and dismissed Judge\u2019s claim \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Judge appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, where cross-motions for summary judgment were filed. The court granted appellees\u2019 motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The statute that Judge claims empowers the Commission to reopen his withdrawn 1981 claim is Art. 101, \u00a7 40 (c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">The powers and jurisdiction of the Commission over each case shall be continuing, and it may, from time to time, make such modifications or changes with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto as in its opinion may be justified; provided, however, that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>modification or change of any award of compensation shall be made to the Commission within five years next following the last payment of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The Court of Appeals has described this subsection as \u201cby its terms plain and unambiguous [leaving] no room for interpretation.\u201d <em>Adkins v. Weisner, </em>238 Md. 411, 414, 209 A.2d 255 (1965). Judge points to the grant of \u201ccontinuing\u201d jurisdiction to the Commission and to its power to \u201cmake ... changes with respect to former ... orders____\u201d He notes the undisputed fact that the Commission entered an order permitting him to withdraw his initial claim, and argues that \u00a7 40(c) authorizes the Commission now to change that former order.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Appellees, on the other hand, treat the Commission\u2019s action of November 2, 1984, as a denial of Judge\u2019s request to reopen. They contend (correctly) that no appeal lies from the denial of such a request. The subsection gives the Commission discretion to reopen or not to reopen. <em>Stevenson v. Hill, </em>170 Md. 676, 683, 185 A. 551 (1936) (construing former Art. 101, \u00a7 54). Its exercise of that discretion, when it refuses to reopen, ordinarily is not reviewable. <em>Gold Dust Corp. v. Zabawa, </em>159 Md. 664, 152 A. 500 (1930); <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Gray, </em>40 Md.App. 66, 389 A.2d 407, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 737 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The problem with appellees\u2019 argument is that it depends on the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion to deny reopening. \u201cDiscretion,\u201d' we have said, \u201csignifies choice\u201d\u2014that is, a reasoned decision based on the weighing of various alternatives. <em>Hart v. Miller, </em>65 Md.App. 620, 626, 501 A.2d 872 (1985). Had the Commission considered the pros and cons of reopening Judge\u2019s claim, and then refused to do so, we would agree with appellees. But that is not what happened. The Commission exercised no discretion. It concluded it lacked jurisdiction to reopen and for that reason dismissed the claim. Under these circumstances, the <em>Gold </em>Dust\u2014 <em>Roadway </em>line of cases does not bar an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">We hold, however, that \u00a7 40 (c) does not permit reopening in this case. We understand that the worker compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>law \u201c \u2018should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes\u2019 and that any uncertainty \u2018should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holy Cross Hospital v. Nichols, </em>290 Md. 149, 162, 428 A.2d 447 (1981) (quoting <em>Howard County Association for Retarded Citizens v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980)). But we can read this unambiguous statute only as liberally \u201cas its provisions will permit____\u201d We turn, then, to those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Subsection (c) is one of four subsections of \u00a7 40. Subsection (a) requires the Commission to \u201cmake or deny an award\u201d within a specified time. Subsection (b) permits readjustment or termination of compensation \u201c[i]f aggravation, diminution or termination of disability takes place or is discovered after the rate of compensation shall have been established or compensation terminated____\u201d Subsection (d) discusses the effect of fraud or estoppel on failure to file a reopening application. It is in no way implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The first two subsections deal with situations in which the Commission is required to make or deny an award; that is, in which it has taken some action to decide the merits of a claim. Reading \u00a7 40 as a harmonious whole, <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank of Hagerstown v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 56, 507 A.2d 172 (1986), we conclude that subsection (c) applies to the reopening of that kind of order or decision. That reading is supported by the very language of (c). The Commission\u2019s power to \u201cmake such modifications or changes\u201d is with respect to its <em>\u201cformer findings or orders with respect thereto </em>\u201d [emphasis supplied]. In the case before us, the only findings were those made by a totally different tribunal, the Virginia Commission. It is not those findings that Judge sought to reopen, and in any case, they are irrelevant for the purposes of \u00a7 40 (c). The Maryland Commission, on the other hand, made no <em>findings </em>in its December 16, 1981, withdrawal order. That order was not one \u201cwith respect\u201d to any findings, because there were none. The Commission simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>granted Judge\u2019s request to withdraw his claim. Such an order is not subject to reopening under \u00a7 40 (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">This conclusion is not affected by our comment in <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Baker, </em>40 Md.App. 339, 345, 392 A.2d 94 (1978) that Maryland \u201chas one of the broadest reopening statutes\u201d\u2014a view concurred in by Professor Larson. 3 A. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workman\u2019s Compensation Law </em>(1983), \u00a7 81.52 (c) n. 89. <em>Baker </em>was a case in which a prior award had been made. That is true of the authorities discussed in <em>Baker, </em>and it is also true of the authorities discussed by Professor Larson. As he observes in \u00a7 81.52 (c), \u201cSome broad reopening statutes give the Commission blanket power to make such changes <em>in awards </em>as are in its judgment justified\u201d [emphasis supplied]. This statement obviously presupposes the existence of a prior award or some earlier decision on the merits of a claim. That is a factor lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">To conclude that \u00a7 40 (c) does not empower the Commission to \u201creopen\u201d Judge\u2019s claim does not, however, dispose of this case. As we have seen, in December 1981, the Maryland Commission allowed Judge to withdraw his claim. In <em>Plater v. Kane Warehouse Co., Inc., </em>241 Md. 462, 217 A.2d 102 (1966), the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 40 (c) gave the Commission authority to permit withdrawal of a claim after an award had been made. That holding is completely consistent with our holding here, since in <em>Plater </em>(in contrast to the present case) there was an existing award upon which the Commission could exercise its \u00a7 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>(c) power. For present purposes, the importance of <em>Plater </em>lies in the analogy the Court of Appeals used to support its holding. The Court looked to former Md. Rule 541 b, which allowed voluntary dismissal of an action at law only by stipulation of all parties or by leave of court, after evidence had been taken. <em>Compare </em>present Rule 2-506 (b). The Court found Rule 541 b \u201cto be readily adaptable to the case at bar.\u201d 241 Md. at 468, 217 A.2d 102. It held, on the facts before it, that \u201cthe Commission\u2019s decision to allow [Plater] to withdraw was proper.\u201d 241 Md. at 470, 217 A.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The situation confronting us is not one that would have been covered by former Rule 541 b or that would be covered by present Rule 2-506(b). In December 1981, no evidence had been taken. So far as the record reveals, appellees had by then made no response to the claim. The analogous rule, then, is Rule 2-506 (a) which permits a plaintiff to dismiss an action without leave of court if he does so by stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties (obviously not the case here) or by filing notice of dismissal \u201cat any time before the adverse party files an answer or a motion for summary judgment____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Since no response to the claim had been filed, it may be that (looking to Rule 2-506 (a)), Judge could have withdrawn his claim without Commission approval. That is a point we need not decide. The point is that he voluntarily dismissed the claim. When a lawsuit is so dismissed under Rule 2-506 (a), the plaintiff, if he wishes to sue again, ordinarily does not move to \u201creopen\u201d or \u201crevive\u201d the former action. He or she files a new suit. If the voluntary dismissal is without prejudice (as it clearly was here, <em>see </em>Rule 2-506 (c)), there is nothing to prevent him or her from doing so, provided the statute of limitations has not run. <em>See Williams v. Snyder, </em>221 Md. 262, 266-67, 155 A.2d 904 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Judge\u2019s application to reopen was filed within the two-year period of limitations provided by Art. 101, \u00a7 39 (a). Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the Commission should have treated this as the filing of a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>claim, just as a court would treat the filing of a lawsuit after voluntary dismissal without prejudice. Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand with directions to remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action, we believe, is consistent with the benevolent purposes of the worker compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND IT TO THE WORKMEN\u2019S COMPENSATION COMMISSION FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. APPELLEES TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-13\">. Our decision does not necessarily mean that Judge will be before the Commission on the merits of his claim. Art. 101, \u00a7 39 (a) requires a claimant to take certain actions within 60 days after injury. The record does not disclose whether he did so. In any case, such a failure may be excused, but whether to do so is for the Commission to decide, just as it should initially determine the effect, if any, of Judge\u2019s receipt of Virginia compensation benefits. Since the record suggests that Judge and appellees are all residents of Virginia and that Judge\u2019s contract of employment was entered into there, Art. 101, \u00a7 21 (c)(4) might have some bearing on the case. None of these matters were raised on appeal and we express no opinion as to them or as to other issues that may properly be raised before the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
