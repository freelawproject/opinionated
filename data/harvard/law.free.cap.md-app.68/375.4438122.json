This appeal followed, with the request that we answer a solitary question: \u201cDoes a folding knife without switchblade but with a locking device for the protection of the user fall within the exception for \u2018penknife without switchblade\u2019 in Article 27, \u00a7 36(a)?\u201d Our affirmative response mandates reversal of the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\n<em>Article 27, section 36(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 36(a) makes it a misdemeanor for person to \u201cwear or harry any dirk knife, bowie knife, switchblade knife, star knife, sandclub, metal knuckles, razor, nunchaku, or any other dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind, whatsoever (penknives without switchblade and handguns, excepted) concealed upon or about his per-</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\n<em>Master\u2019s Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The following is an excerpt from the master\u2019s disposition memorandum to the juvenile judge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">The facts showed police officers saw Darryl <em>[sic] </em>[L.] and five companions, and approached to determine if the daytime curfew was being violated. Four of the group ran, and one of the two who were caught was Darryl <em>[sic]. </em>The officer conducted a patdown, and from Darryl\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>right front pocket removed a knife. The knife was brought to Court. Its total length is 8V2 inches. The blade is 3% inches long, while the handle is 4% inches long. The blade is between % and 1 inch wide and tapers to a narrow point. The blade folds into the handle, being partially concealed by it. When open, the blade locks into place and cannot be folded down without the purposeful depression of a mechanism on the bottom opposing side of the handle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">The Court ruled this knife was not in fact a penknife. The Court\u2019s ruling is based on the knifes <em>[sic] </em>structural capability for \u201coffensive or defensive infliction of bodily injury\u201d. The Court found the locking mechanism, size, and general characteristics of this knife precluded it being categorized as a penknife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\n<em>Mackall v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\"><em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100, 387 A.2d 762 (1978), makes clear that the State bears the burden of showing that the knife carried by appellant was \u201cnot a penknife without switchblade in order to prove the corpus delecti of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 387 A.2d at 768. <em>Mackall </em>also instructs that \u201c[pjenknives today are commonly considered to encompass <em>any knife with the blade folding into the handle, some very large.\u201d Id. </em>at 113 n. 13, 387 A.2d at 769 n. 13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In an effort to satisfy its burden, the State, at every stage of the proceedings in the case <em>sub judice, </em>has argued that the knife\u2019s locking mechanism places the knife within the ambit of \u00a7 36(a) and outside the ambit of \u00a7 36(a)\u2019s exception for penknives. As support for its argument, the State cites <em>Savoy v. State, </em>236 Md. 36, 202 A.2d 324 (1964), wherein the Court of Appeals declined to disturb the jury\u2019s finding of a violation of \u00a7 36(a). The <em>Savoy </em>knife was a gravity knife, <em>i.e., </em>\u201csimilar to a switch-blade knife, in that, when a button is pressed, the blade drops out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 202 A.2d at 325. Although the knife would not open in the normal manner, the blade could lock into position with a flick of the wrist. <em>Id., </em>202 A.2d at 325-26. The State relies upon the latter characteristic of the <em>Savoy </em>knife to support its \u201clocking mechanism\u201d argument. We find the State\u2019s argument upersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Absent the operational defect of the knife in <em>Savoy, </em>the knife was closely akin to a switchblade; a switchblade is specifically covered by \u00a7 36(a). Absent the locking mechanism, the knife described by the master in the instant case clearly falls within the <em>Mackall </em>court\u2019s definition of a penknife; a penknife is (except in certain circumstances not found here) specifically excluded from the coverage of \u00a7 36(a). In our view, the locking mechanism of appellant\u2019s knife, described by both appellant and the knife\u2019s manufacturer (Buck Knives, Inc.) as a protective feature, does not cause the knife in question be other than a penknife. It lacks the additional offensive qualities of a switchblade or a gravity knife which make those instruments instantly available for any violent design at the command of the user. The lockback knife exacts the same time and motion for opening as is required for any other penknife.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
