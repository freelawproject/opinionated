Rule 2-507 (c)? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In other words, if the clerk of court fails timely to do what should have been done, and defense counsel moves to dismiss for lack of prosecution, is that motion and ruling thereon a docket entry within the contemplation of Md. Rule 2-507 (c)?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Before discussing the issue, we shall briefly recount the facts from which the matter arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Michael A. Brown, individually and to the use of the United States of America, sued William Glen Tate, II, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Brown alleged that he was injured in September, 1979, through the negligence of Tate. At that time Brown was a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy. The medical services he received were furnished by the government of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">After some preliminary sparring, the case lay undisturbed from January 18, 1983, until counsel for Tate, on March 11, 1985, moved to dismiss for lack of prosecution. Tate\u2019s attorney grounded his motion on Md. Rule 2-507 (c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201cAn action is subject to dismissal for lack of prosecution at the expiration of one year from the last docket entry, other than an entry made under this Rule, Rule 2-131,<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> or Rule 2-132,<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> except that an action for divorce a mensa et thoro or for permanent alimony is subject to dismissal under this section only after two years from the last such docket entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Brown\u2019s lawyer responded that the rule contemplates dismissal by the clerk and not by the court on motion by defendant\u2019s counsel. To bolster his position, Brown\u2019s counsel relied upon \u00a7 (d) of Rule 2-507. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cWhen an action is subject to dismissal pursuant to this Rule, the clerk shall serve a notice on all parties pursuant to Rule 1-321<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> that an order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or prosecution will be entered after the expiration of 30 days unless a motion is filed under section (e) of this Rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The circuit court (Williams, J.) agreed and on March 27, 1985, denied the motion to dismiss. On August 19, 1985, the clerk of the court mailed a notice of contemplated dismissal. The notice stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cPursuant to Maryland Rule 2-507 this proceeding will be \u2018DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION OR PROSECUTION WITHOUT PREJUDICE,\u2019 30 days after service of this notice, unless prior to that time a <em>written </em>motion showing good cause to defer the entry of an order of dismissal is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Brown, through his attorney, filed a \u201cMOTION FOR DEFERRAL OF DISMISSAL.\u201d He asserted that \u201cdocket entries have occurred in the ... action within one (1) year of the Clerk[\u2019s] ... filing of the \u201cNotification ... of Contem-' plated Dismissal.\u201d Brown\u2019s basis for his contention was that when Tate moved pursuant to Rule 2-507 to dismiss for lack of prosecution, that motion was entered on the docket on March 11, 1985, as was the court\u2019s disposition of that matter. Therefore, Brown concluded, inasmuch as March, 1985, is well within one year of August 19, 1985, the date of the clerk\u2019s notice, Rule 2-507 (c) is not applicable. Judge Morris Turk disagreed with Brown and denied the motion to defer dismissal. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">While Brown\u2019s argument has a certain superficial validity, closer scrutiny reveals the contention for what it is\u2014a camouflage, hastily painted, to avoid the sanction of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The motion by Tate\u2019s counsel to dismiss for lack of prosecution would not have been filed had the clerk of the court done what he is supposed to do when a case is dormant for more than one year. Patently, in the instant case the notice of contemplation of dismissal should have been dispatched within a reasonable time after January, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Although the rule does not expressly mandate that the clerk shall send the notice of contemplated dismissal immediately upon the passage of one year from the date of the last docket entry, the Court of Appeals hardly expected clerks to send the notice two years and eight months after the last entry on the docket. Had the court believed a two year period was reasonable, it would have so stated. The obvious aim of the rule is to rid dockets of stale, untried cases and to free the already overburdened courts of unnecessary work. Failure by the clerk to pay heed to Rule 2-507 (c) frustrates the clear intent of the rule and serves only to clog already congested dockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Rule 2-507 (c) specifically excepts from the expression \u201clast docket entry\u201d those entries made pursuant to the rule itself. We think that exemption sufficiently broad to embrace counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution for violation of the rule and the court\u2019s ruling on that motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, Judge Turk did not err in refusing to grant Brown\u2019s motion to defer dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\">1.
