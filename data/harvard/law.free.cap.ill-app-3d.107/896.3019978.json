In her complaint she alleged negligence on the part of defendant for permitting the parking lot \u201cto become rough and uneven with an unnatural accumulation of ice and snow,\u201d for permitting \u201cruts to exist in ice in the parking lot area\u201d and for failing \u201cto remove, salt or otherwise treat an icy or snow covered condition upon its parking lot.\u201d The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding no genuine issue as to any material fact with respect to the duties of defendant. Plaintiff appeals contending that summary judgment was improper because the pleadings and depositions raised a genuine issue of material fact, that the condition of the parking lot was \u201cthe product of an unnatural accumulation of ice and snow created by defendant\u2019s customers and its snow removal effort\u201d and that whether defendant was negligent in the snow removal effort it undertook was a question of fact.</p> <p id=\"b920-4\" pgmap=\"920\">In her deposition plaintiff stated that at about 7:30 p.m. on January 26, 1979, she walked upon defendant\u2019s parking lot in order to attend a dance in defendant\u2019s building. She said at that time she could see in the parking lot \u201cice ruts\u201d caused by the tires of automobiles and that as a consequence she \u201ctrod over those very carefully when [she] walked in.\u201d During the course of the evening it snowed \u201cvery badly.\u201d When plaintiff emerged from the building a few hours later at about 12:40 a.m. her toe \u201ccaught\u201d in a snow-covered icy rut about 20 feet from the building and she fell fracturing her wrist. She said that the parking lot was well lit but that she was unable to see the rut beneath the snow.</p> <p id=\"b920-5\" pgmap=\"920\">According to the deposition of Roger Behrmann, defendant had an oral agreement with him to remove snow from the parking lot. Roger Behrmann stated that he had been instructed by Frank Booker, defendant\u2019s president and general manager, to remove \u201cwhat [snow] I can, you know.\u201d To remove the snow he used a backhoe \u201c[n]inety per cent of the time.\u201d He explained that he removed only the snow because \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t get ice,\u201d stating that \u201c[i]f it\u2019s packed on there, you can just get the top layer.\u201d He explained further why he could remove the snow but not the ice:</p> <blockquote id=\"b920-6\" pgmap=\"920\">\u201cWell, if you got snow, and it\u2019s packed on there with the cars that\u2019s run over it, and they pack it on there, and then turntto [sic] ice later on, and say, then you get another layer of snow. Okay. Then you come in and you try to remove that layer of snow. You don\u2019t have no traction with the ice under that snow to get under it to peel it off, you know.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b920-7\" pgmap=\"920\">The witness said that Frank Booker was \u201cgoing to get some cinders at one time, but I don\u2019t know if it was before [the date of plaintiff\u2019s fall] or after that.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b920-8\" pgmap=\"920\">In his deposition Frank Booker stated that if the parking lot is icy and rutted because of tire marks, he does not attempt to remove that ice or to have it removed. He said, \u201cIf it is frozen there, I can\u2019t remove it.\u201d According to the witness, the parking lot was not spread with cinders, salt, ashes or any other material of that kind.</p> <p id=\"b920-9\" pgmap=\"920(138) 921(151)\"> It is well settled that a property owner is not liable for injury sustained by a business invitee in a fall on any icy sidewalk or parking lot maintained by the property owner for the use of his customers where the accumulation is a natural one and not one caused or aggravated by the property owner. (Timmons v. Turski (1981), 103 Ill. App. 3d 36, 430 N.E.2d 1135; Zide v. Jewel Tea Co. (1963), 39 Ill. App. 2d 217, 188 N.E.2d 383.) On the other hand, a property owner may be liable for injury sustained by a business invitee who falls and is injured as a result of snow and ice that did not accumulate as a result of natural causes but as the result of the property owner\u2019s conduct in creating an unnatural or artificial accumulation of snow and ice. (Smalling v. La Salle National Bank (1982), 104 Ill. App. 3d 894, 433 N.E.2d 713; Fitzsimons v. National Tea Co. (1961), 29 Ill. App. 2d 306, 173 N.E.2d 534.) Although there is no duty to remove natural accumulations of snow and ice from one\u2019s premises, a voluntary undertaking to remove such snow and ice may be the basis of liability if the removal is performed negligently. (DeMario v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. (1972), 6 Ill. App. 3d 46, 284 N.E.2d 330.) However, mere removal of snow, which may leave a natural ice formation remaining on the premises, does not of itself constitute negligence. Timmons; McCann v. Bethesda Hospital (1979), 80 Ill. App. 3d 544, 400 N.E.2d 16; Bakeman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. (1974), 16 Ill. App. 3d 1065, 307 N.E.2d 449; Anderson v. Davis Development Corp. (1968), 99 Ill. App. 2d 55, 241 N.E.2d 222.</p> <p id=\"b921-5\" pgmap=\"921\"> In the case at bar there is nothing to suggest that anything but ordinary vehicular traffic caused the ruts of which plaintiff complains. There is, for example, no suggestion that the ice upon which plaintiff fell resulted from the drainage of melted snow that was later frozen, as happened in Fitzsimons, upon which plaintiff relies. There the defendant had plowed snow on his parking lot into two large piles, where it remained for about three weeks during a period of alternately thawing and freezing weather. There was evidence that water from the melting snow had run across the defendant\u2019s parking lot and had been later frozen into a sheet of ice that was \u201crutted\u201d with \u201cridges\u201d made by wheels of automobiles where the plaintiff fell. We find plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon Fitzsimons misplaced. As was said in Zide, where the plaintiff likewise relied upon Fitzsimons and where there was, however, no evidence that the plaintiff, who fell upon the defendant\u2019s parking lot, had fallen on ice formed from snow that had melted and so drained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b921-6\" pgmap=\"921\">\u201cIn the Fitz Simons case, the ice upon which the plaintiff fell was described as \u2018rough and dark,\u2019 \u2018rutted\u2019 ice, with \u2018ridges\u2019 made by wheels of automobiles. In the case at bar, the plaintiff, likewise, described the ice at the place she fell as \u2018heavy, thick, ridged ice.\u2019 Beyond the use of these descriptive terms there exists no similarity in the two cases.\u201d (39 Ill. App. 2d 217, 224, 188 N.E.2d 383, 386.)</blockquote> <p id=\"Aq7\" pgmap=\"921\">So, too, in the case at bar, the similarity between it and Fitzsimons ends with the use of these descriptive terms. In the instant case all that the defendant may be said to have done to cause an unnatural accumulation of snow and ice is to suffer its customers to use its parking lot while snow was upon the ground. In view of the fact that only ordinary vehicular traffic caused the ruts of which plaintiff complains in a place intended for use by such vehicles, we do not think that the ruts resulting from such use may be said to have been an unnatural accumulation of snow and ice created by defendant.</p> <p id=\"b922-4\" pgmap=\"922\">As we have already said, the removal of snow, which may leave a natural ice formation remaining on the premises does not, without more, constitute negligence. Nothing in this record suggests that defendant did more than remove snow and leave what we have deemed to be a natural, rather than an unnatural, ice formation at some time prior to the snowfall on the evening of January 26, 1979. Thus, defendant\u2019s conduct in leaving this ice formation did not constitute negligence, and, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s assertion here, there was no question of fact on this record as to whether defendant was negligent in the snow removal effort it undertook.</p> <p id=\"b922-5\" pgmap=\"922\">A motion for summary judgment should be granted only where pleadings, depositions, affidavits and other documents demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Erasmus v. Chicago Housing Authority (1980), 86 Ill. App. 3d 142, 407 N.E.2d 1031.) Because defendant created no unnatural accumulation of snow and ice by permitting its business invitees to operate motor vehicles in the parking lot provided for their use and because defendant in its snow removal effort may, therefore, be said to have left only a natural ice formation, there remains no genuine issue of material fact, and the trial court properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p> <p id=\"b922-6\" pgmap=\"922\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b922-7\" pgmap=\"922\">KASSERMAN, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b922-8\" pgmap=\"922\">JUSTICE HARRISON,</author> <p id=\"AoFo\" pgmap=\"922\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b922-9\" pgmap=\"922\">I must respectfully dissent.</p> <p id=\"b922-10\" pgmap=\"922\">As the majority opinion stated, a landowner is under no obligation to remove natural accumulations of snow and ice from his property. (Hankla v. Burger Chef Systems, Inc. (1981), 93 Ill. App. 3d 909, 910.) Likewise, the mere removal of snow and the exposing of a natural ice surface beneath does not itself constitute negligence. (Timmons v. Turski (1981), 103 Ill. App. 3d 36.) Nevertheless, property owners are charged with negligence when the ice upon which plaintiff falls accumulates either as a result of the owner\u2019s aggravating a natural condition or because of his engaging in conduct which gives rise .to a new, unnatural or artificial condition. For example, in cases where fallen snow was plowed into formations which melted, drained, and then refroze, the new frozen accumulation was termed unnatural. See Fitzsimons v. National Tea Co. (1961), 29 Ill. App. 2d 306.</p> <p id=\"b922-11\" pgmap=\"922(36) 923(230)\">However, it is not always clear which accumulations are natural and which are unnatural. As the Fourth District observed in Hankla when it refused to impose liability on the landowner for injuries sustained in a fall from a snow-covered curb: \u201cThe parties have not cited, nor have we found, an Illinois court which has detailed the differences between natural and unnatural accumulations.\u201d (Hankla v. Burger Chef Systems, Inc. (1981), 93 Ill. App. 3d 909, 911.) Likewise in Timmons, a parking lot case factually similar to the present case, we specifically declined to \u201cdetermine whether such compaction by motor vehicles constitutes a natural or an unnatural accumulation * * *.\" This court, instead, set aside plaintiff\u2019s $20,000 verdict because he failed to introduce evidence showing that defendant caused an unnatural accumulation of snow and ice at the place where plaintiff fell. (Timmons v. Turski (1981), 103 Ill. App. 3d 36, 38, 430 N.E.2d 1135, 1137.) Therefore, the issue presented for our determination, previously unaddressed, is whether this type of formation on a business owner\u2019s parking lot could constitute an unnatural accumulation. The icy ridges and ruts on the parking lot surface were allegedly formed by automobiles driving on the lot after a snowfall. The automobile traffic occurred because of defendant\u2019s implied invitation to enter onto the premises for business purposes. Thus, the character of the initial natural accumulation changed as a result of defendant\u2019s use of the area concerned. Under such circumstances, the icy ridges and ruts in the parking lot would constitute unnatural accumulations of ice and snow, in effect created by defendant.</p> <p id=\"b923-5\" pgmap=\"923\">Summary judgment should be granted only where pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and other documents demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Erasmus v. Chicago Housing Authority (1980), 86 Ill. App. 3d 142, 144.) Because I feel that frozen ruts and ridges caused by automobile traffic would constitute an unnatural accumulation, I believe there remain genuine issues of material fact as to whether this condition existed on the parking lot surface on the evening of January 26, how the condition developed, and whether, in fact, it was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries. Consequently, the judge\u2019s decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was in error. I would reverse the court\u2019s order and remand this cause for further proceedings.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
