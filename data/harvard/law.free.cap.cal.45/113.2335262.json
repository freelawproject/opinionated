It is true that one of the defenses is, that pending the engagement\u2014for the breach of which the action is brought, and before the alleged breach on the part of the defendant\u2014 the plaintiff had engaged herself to marry another person. While this was attempted to be shown as a fact, which, it is claimed, released the defendant from his antecedent promise to marry the plaintiff, there is nothing which fairly imports an assault by the defendant upon her character for chastity. And we have seen nothing in the evidence adduced by the defendant amounting to an attempt in that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Under this state of pleadings and evidence this instruction was not justified. It set prominently before the minds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of the jury an element which was really non-existent in the case, and left them at liberty to make it an ingredient in the assessment of the damages. But were this otherwise, it is not a correct proposition of law, that a defense of the character mentioned, even if unsuccessfully attempted, ought <em>per se </em>to aggravate the damages. There ought to be something showing, or tending to show, that in interposing such a defense the defendant was actuated by malice, or wantonness, or recklessness, and so, that it was not interposed in good faith. Otherwise the defendant might be punished for even a bona fide effort to defend himself upon a ground, which, if true, constituted a good defense, and this merely because he had in point of fact failed to establish it. The case which probably goes farthest upon this point in favor of the plaintiff is that of <em>Southard </em>v. Rexford, 6 Cowen, 254, where the jury were instructed \u201c that where the defendant attempts to justify his breach of promise of marriage by stating upon the record as the cause of his desertion of the plaintiff that she had repeatedly had criminal intercourse with various persons, and <em>fails entirely </em>in proving it, this is a circumstance which ought to aggravate the damages.\u201d But the circumstances of that case were that the defense of unchastity had not only been spread upon the record, but <em>it appeared from the testimony of the defendant\u2019s own witnesses </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s character for chastity had not been tarnished <em>even by the breath of suspicion. </em>The jury were told in that case that if the defendant had \u201c spread the defense upon the record <em>for the purpose of destroying her character,\u201d </em>they would be justified in giving exemplary damages. In <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>too (35 Cal. 89), the defendant set up a similar defense in pleading, and the instruction given by the Court (which was sustained here), was in substantial accord with the rule laid down in the case of <em>Southard </em>v. <em>Rexford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Bat </em>there is an entire want of similarity between the eir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>cumstances of those cases and the circumstances of this in the respect referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
