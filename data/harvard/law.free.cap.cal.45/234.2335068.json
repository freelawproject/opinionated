There has been a delay of more than two years in bringing this action, after the matters alleged as ground of relief were known to the plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Among other recognized rules governing such proceedings, is the one that application must be made promptly after the facts are discovered. Lord Hardwicke seems to have thought that a delay of seven months was scarcely admissible. (2 Atk. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">J udgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
