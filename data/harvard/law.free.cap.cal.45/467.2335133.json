We may admit that all the words of which it is composed existed somewhere at the time he adopted this designation, and even before; but we do claim\u2014and have established it by proof\u2014that he was the first to combine these words into the name \u201cWolfe\u2019s Aromatic Schiedam Schnapps,\u201d and the first to apply that name, or any part of it, as the distinguishing appellation of an article of trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">The name so adopted by Wolfe, possesses the requisite identifying and distinguishing qualities for a trademark. \u201cThe sole purpose being that the marks adopted shall\u2018be such as will identify the thing named as that of the person naming it, and distinguish it from all others. This purpose is accomplished if the name be not then in like use, or had not been within a period so recent as would be likely to defeat the primary purpose of distinctive designation.\u201d (Upton on Trademarks, p. 47.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">In the exclusive use of such a name and such marks so adopted, plaintifl\" is entitled to receive fullest protection from a Court of equity; and this upon the two grounds which form the basis of all legal interference in trademark cases:</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">First\u2014Security to the merchant and manufacturer of the rewards of his skill and enterprise; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">Second\u2014Protection to the public from imposition and fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-10\">A man\u2019s trademark, as we have seen, is his property, absolutely and completely. It is also to his goods, what his signature or indorsement is to his bond or note.' It lends them credit, and determines their rate in the market. Like the die at the mint, its impress guarantees genuineness and makes current the wares that bear it. <em>(Motley </em>v. <em>Downman, </em>3 M. &amp; C. 13.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The labels display the same inverted zeal, to avoid confusion of their preparation with the plaintiff\u2019s by the trade and the public. To their care in selecting a name for it, which, with the exception of an obscure prefix, is identical with plaintiff\u2019s in every particular, they add an equal diligence in surrounding it with every sign and device used by Wolfe that would be likely to associate the two articles in the mind of the buyer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">The doctrine of trademarks is of but comparatively recent birth. The first announcement of it appears in an unassuming duodecimo called Latch\u2019s Cases, p. 188 (Hil. T., 2 Car.), <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Steel; </em>and its brevity is in keeping with the book that contains it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">\u201c 24 Eliz.

But Wolfe manufactures at that town, and its name, when applied to his article, indicates its origin. Under all the authorities he is entitled to be protected in such a use of such a word. Beyond question is this the case as between him and every person not manufacturing at Schiedam. <em>(Brooklyn White Lead Co. </em>v. <em>Measury, </em>25 Barb. 417; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Alvord Bailey, </em>49 Barb. 588.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">But plaintiff\u2019s name cannot be assailed thus in detachments, nor is it necessary for him to justify, as he has done, the use of each particular portion of it.

It has taken a definite and logical shape, generalized from a great mass of decisions in which for more than a century we note a contest between two antagonistic principles tending to opposite extremes\u2014the one to encourage monopoly under the form of protection to property in names and symbols, and the other to open the door to imitation under the excuse of free competition. When property in a name was first recognized, the natural tendency was to an abuse of the doctrine, and property in any name or device was claimed to be admissible. But with the expansion of trade and the multiplication of modern wants, the necessity of free competition made itself felt, and it was soon manifest that the true rule must be that which gives just so much security to property as is consistent with fair and honest competition in trade. Thus it became apparent that the sole object to be attained was to prevent one person from selling or passing off his goods as and for the identical goods of another. And hence was evolved the rule that a person may claim as his trademark and exclusive property, any name indicating the origin or ownership of his article.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-8\">A manufacturer may call his article the \u201c Roger Williams \u201d long cloth, for though he is not himself Roger Williams, yet the name is one adapted to represent only individuality or identity of article, its origin, or ownership\u2014not in any way its character or quality. But he may not call his long cloth \u201cA Ko. 1,\u201d or \u201c superfine;\u201d as a druggist may not call his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>lotion Medicated Balm or Mexican Medicated Balm, for the manifest reason that many long cloths may be \u201cA Ho. 1,\u201d or \u201csuperfine,\u201d and all the world has a right to make such, and many lotions may be medicated or Mexican, and all the world has a right to compound such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-6\">In accordance with this rule, the words in which property may be claimed are either those which directly indicate origin or ownership as proper names of the owner, or those which, being wrested from their ordinary sense, are applied in an arbitrary or fanciful manner, so as to preclude the possibility of the word then meaning anything except the particular thing to which it is thus fancifully applied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-7\">Some of the names to which, in accordance with the above rule, protection is afforded, are the following: Revere House, Bismark Collar, Roger Williams Long Cloth, Charter Oak Stove, What Cheer House. Hames to which protection is denied, as too broad in their natural signification to be appropriated by one person or article, are the following, viz: Cologne Water, Venetian Blinds, Haples Biscuit, London Brown Stout, XXX Ale, Genuine Yankee Soap, Balm of Thousand Flowers, Club House Gin, Old London Gin, Medicated Mexican Balm, Chinese Liniment, Chartres Coffee, Antiquarian Book Store.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-8\">Such is the law of trademarks, as recognized by this Court. It is quite useless to refer to authorities in support of it. The leading cases are collected in Upton, and reviewed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-9\">Let us now apply the law to the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-10\">The respondents contend that the appellant has attempted to appropriate to his exclusive use words which do not indicate the origin or ownership of his particular article, but are words in common use in the same sense in which he has employed them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-11\">The respondents also insist that they have never attempted to pass off their goods as and for the goods of the appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>That their aim has been opposition in trade\u2014not imitation. The debatable words are \u201cAromatic Schiedam Schnapps.\u201d Certainly we need not pause over \u201caromatic.\u201d It is unreasonable in Mr. Wolfe to ask to appropriate a word so useful as \u201caromatic,\u201d especially when applied to liquors. What Sybarite has not, even from the time of Lucullus, as he quaffed his Falernian, Lachryma Christi, or Johanisberger, raved about its delicate aroma! Verily we cannot \u201cgive up to Wolfe what was meant for mankind.\u201d Hor need we linger over the word \u201cSchiedam,\u201d which is the name of a town in Holland. The appellant cannot claim to have introduced \u201c Schiedam \u201d to the world, or to be entitled to the sole use of it. For the word \u201cschnapps\u201d there is scarcely any more ground for contest. It is conceded to be a word originally from the German, signifying a dram or drink, which, at least since the beginning of this century, had the same meaning in Holland, and in that country is said by the appellant to be written \u201c Snaps.\u201d The appellant, as the only possible means of sustaining himself, claims that until he used the word to designate his article it never had been used to designate any particular article of commerce. Even if this were so it would not help him. For if the word had not been used in the same sense in which he used it, it certainly was in common use in a sense including that in which he uses it. <em>(Udolpho Wolfe </em>v. <em>Emile </em>Goulard, 18 How. Pr. R. 64.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-6\">If we have successfully established that the appellant has no proprietary right to the words \u201c Schiedam Schnapps,\u201d as he certainly has not to the words \u201ccelebrated\u201d and \u201caromatic,\u201d is he entitled to any relief in this action? His counsel contend that even if he cannot appropriate the separate words, he is entitled to the exclusive use of the term \u201cWolfe\u2019s Aromatic Schiedam Schnapps\u201d as an entirety. Here they are directly in conflict with <em>Falkinberg </em>v. <em>Lucy. </em>If single words cannot be appropriated, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>combination cannot be. If we may use aromatic, and Schiedam, and schnapps, we may use them in combination, and certainly we must use them in their natural order and combination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-6\">The respondents insist that they have not carried resemblance or imitation any further than is proper for competition. The name of the appellant, of course, he is entitled to keep inviolate, and in that the respondents have left him undisturbed right of property. They call their article \u201c Van Wolf\u2019s\u201d and \u201c Von Wolf\u2019s,\u201d for contrast rather than for resemblance. They desire to challenge comparison with \u201cWolfe,\u201d and at the same time to mark a difference. A resemblance and a difference are frequent elements of competition. These names were apparently chosen to point the l\u2019esemhlance and pi\u2019eserve the difference. They serve to raise the flag of opposition. Like the shoemaker' who, when his rival adopted the Latin motto, \u201c <em>Mens conscia recti\u201d </em>triumphantly met him with the impi\u2019ovement, \u201c Men\u2019s and women\u2019s conscia recti.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b489-7\">By the Court, Rhodes, J.: ,</author>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">From the year 1848 to the time of the commencement of these actions, Udolpho Wolfe, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, who has died since the commencement of these actions, has been engaged in the manufacture of gin at Schiedam, in Holland, and in the importation of it into Hew York, and in the sale of it in different places in the United States. The gin is put up in bottles having labels attached, and the bottles are inclosed in wrappers, also having labels thereon, and are packed in boxes, upon which are stamped certain words which appear on the labels. Wolfe claims as his trademark, the words: \u201c Wolfe\u2019s Aromatic Schiedam Schnapps.\u201d The defendants are engaged in manufacturing or compounding and offering for sale, at San Francisco, gin, or an article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>which resembles gin, but which is inferior in quality to that which is sold by the plaintiff; and the labels and stamps which they place on their bottles and the wrappers and boxes, bear a striking resemblance to those which are used by the plaintiff. The labels used by the defendants in one of the actions, represent the commodity to which it is attached as \u201c Von Wolf\u2019s Aromatic Schiedam Schnapps;\u201d and those which are used by the defendants in the other, action, represent it as \u201cVan Wolf\u2019s Aromatic Schiedam Schnapps.\u201d The plaintiff claims that, the use of those words,.stamps and labels, by the defendants, is a violation of his trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">A trademark is a word, symbol, figure, form, or device, or a combination thereof, adopted or devised and used by a manufacturer or vender of goods, to designate the origin or ownership of his goods, and is used by him to distinguish his goods from those which are manufactured or sold by others. A violation of a trademark consists in the adoption or colorable imitation thereof, and its use by the wrongdoer on his goods in such manner that the purchasers of the goods of the wrongdoer are deceived, or liable to be deceived, and induced to believe that such goods were manufactured or sold by the owner of the trademark. In its essence, it is a false representation in respect to the origin or ownership of the goods, to which the false or simulated trademark is attached. There is but little conflict among the cases in regard to the rules of law governing the acquisition or enjoyment of the right of a trademark, or those applicable to controversies growing out of the violation of those rights; but the principal difficulties arise in the application of those rules to the varied and sometimes complicated facts of the several cases. One of those rules is that a word, figure, etc., in common use, which indicates the name, nature, kind, quality, or character of the article, cannot be appropriated as a trademark; and even a new word which is devised for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>new preparation, compound, or article, will not be protected as a trademark, as is held by many well considered cases; but there are others which lay down the contrary doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The name which the plaintiff employs to designate the article which he sells, is \u201c Schiedam Schnapps,\u201d or \u201cSchnapps.\u201d The affidavits used on the.hearing of the motion to dissolve the injunction, tend to show that the word Schnapps was in common use in Holland, and to some extent in the United States, at the time of its adoption by the plaintiff\". Its primary signification probably was \u201cdram,\u201d or \u201cdrink,\u201d but it had long been used to designate gin manufactured at Schiedam. That word, therefore, could not be appropriated by the plaintiff* as his trademark. Had it not been used in Hew York, or elsewhere in the United States, as the name of gin, prior to its adoption by the plaintiff^ he still could not maintain his claim to it. Could he secure his claim to the word on the ground that it was not in use in the United States, prior to the time when he adopted it, the law for the protection of trademarks would be shorn of most of its strength, for on the same principle other persons would be at liberty to adopt and use the word in other cities, States, or countries, if at the time of its adoption by them it was not in use in such cities, States, or countries. The rule for the exclusion of a word in common-use, is coextensive with that for the protection of a word which was rightfully adopted as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Hor can the word \u201cSchiedam\u201d be adopted as a part of the plaintiff\u2019s trademark. It is claimed as indicating origin\u2014the place of manufacture of the plaintiff\u2019s gin; but the evidence shows that there are other manufactories of gin at that city besides that of the plaintiff, and the word has long been used to denote quality or kind. A party would not be entitled to be protected in the use of the word \u201cHavana\u201d as a trademark for his cigars, even as against a party whose cigars were neither manufactured or sold at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Havana, for that word is used as descriptive of the kind or quality of the cigars.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The word \u201caromatic\u201d is employed as expressive of one of the qualities of the plaintiff\u2019s liquor, and therefore cannot be claimed as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The name of the manufacturer or seller of goods may, of course, be used a\u00ed a trademark; and the adoption of the same name as a trademark for goods of the same kind, by a person bearing a different name, is without justification or excuse, and presents one of the clearest cases of piracy of a trademark. The name of the plaintiff\" is \u201cWolfe,\u201d and the name, as printed in the defendants\u2019 labels, is \u201cWolf,\u201d and has the prefix \u201cVan \u201d or \u201c Von.\u201d The latter, as we understand the affidavits, are mere prefixes, and have no greater significance than would the abbreviation \u201cMr.\u201d in the same position. The omission of the final letter of the plaintiff\u2019s name, does not work a material change of the name. A slight change in the name, is an artifice often resorted to by those who offer in the markets their goods, as the goods manufactured or sold by another; but the cases show that it meets with no favor from the Courts. We are clearly of the opinion that \u201cVan Wolf\u201d or \u201cVon Wolf\u201d are but imitations of the plaintiff\u2019s name, and are violations of his trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">It will readily be seen upon a comparison of the labels of the plaintiff' with those of the defendants, that they are in many respects different, but in other respects there is a marked resemblance. The similarity could not have been accidental. The design on the part of the defendants to imitate the plaintiff\u2019s labels is unmistakable. The labels are of nearly the same dimensions, the paper and ink are respectively of-the same colors. The prominent words in 1 each are those already mentioned in discussing the questions in respect to the trademark\u2014\u201cAromatic Schiedam Schnapps\u201d\u2014and the general appearance of the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>labels is such, that a large majority of persons would be liable to mistake them for the plaintiff\u2019s labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In <em>Falkinburg </em>v. Lucy, 35 Cal. 52, it is said that a label is not entitled to protection as a trademark; and on the authority of that case, as we understand the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the preliminary injunction in each of these cases was dissolved. A label is not a trademark, as recognized at common law, though it may in fact contain no words, figures, etc., except those which constitute the trademark. A person may adopt a label of given materials, size, color, etc., and may attach the same to his goods, or the wrappers, cases, etc., in which they are packed, although another person has previously adopted a label of the same materials, dimensions, and color, and used them in the same manner. While this right is conceded, in its exercise there is no necessity or propriety in adopting a label already in use by another. But labels, like trademarks, may be adopted and used by a manufacturer or seller of goods, to distinguish his goods from those of others; and when another person uses the same label or a colorable imitation thereof, it produces the same result as would a copy or colorable imitation of a trademark\u2014that is to say, it is a false representation, that the goods to which it is attached were manufactured or sold by the person whose label was copied or imitated, and purchasers are deceived and are liable to be defrauded. On principle, a person is as fully entitled to be protected in the use of his label as his trademark, and the authorities fully sustain this position. (See <em>Amoskeag </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>2 Sand. S. C. 599; <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Landgraff, </em>17 Barb. 608; <em>Fetridge </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>4 Abb. Pr. 144; <em>Coffeen </em>v. <em>Brunton, </em>4 McLean, 516; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Bos. 1; <em>Croft </em>v. <em>Day, </em>7 Beav. 84; Upton, 144.) The decision in <em>Falkinburg </em>v. <em>Lucy, supra, </em>is that an entire label will not be protected at common law as a <em>trademark; </em>but, while it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>be conceded that a label is' not, strictly speaking, a trademark, the authorities, in our opinion, leave no doubt that the' law does and should protect a party, against the use or colorable imitation of his label by another. The imitation by the defendants of the labels attached by \"Wolfe to his bottles and the wrappers, and of the stamp upon his boxes or cases, is very apparent and well calculated to deceive purchasers; and the plaintiff's are entitled to an injunction, to protect them from a further violation of their rights in those respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Order in each case dissolving the injunction is reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to modify the injunction so as to restrain the defendants from affixing, stamping, or attaching, or causing to be affixed, stamped, or attached to or upon the bottles, wrappers, or boxes in which is contained or packed the spirituous liquor manufactured, compounded, sold, or offered for sale by them, the name or word \u201cWolfe,\u201d or \u201cWolf,\u201d or \u201cYon Wolf,\u201d or \u201cYan Wolf,\u201d or any colorable imitation of the name or word \u201cWolfe,\u201d or the labels or stamps which are attached to or stamped on the plaintiff\u2019s bottles, wrappers, or boxes, or any colorable imitation of them or either of them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
