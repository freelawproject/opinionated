The complaint prayed for judgment for possession, and for five hundred and sixty dollars, the value thereof, and five hundred dollars damages. The defendant justified as Constable under a writ of attachment issued in a Justices\u2019 Court at the suit of Conway &amp; Co. against William C. Chapman. The Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for five hundred and sixty dollars, the value of the property, and fifty-six dollars damages for the wrongful taking, without any judgment for the return. The defendant appealed on the judgment roll alone.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-14\"><em>Foster \u00a7 Voorhees, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-15\">The judgment is erroneous because not in accordance with the prayer of the complaint. The judgment should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>have been in the alternative in accordance with section two hundred of the Practice Act. The defendant had a right to expect that the judgment would require him to return the property. The ability of the defendant to return the property is not made an issue in the pleadings, and the judgment is erroneous under section one hundred and forty-seven of the Practice Act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-6\"><em>Thomas A.

It does not appear in the record that a delivery could have been made even if the judgment had been in the alternative. <em>(Walde </em>v. <em>Doll, </em>29 Cal. 555; <em>Landers </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>26 Cal. 393; <em>Dimmick v.

And in support of such judgment, where, as here, the record discloses nothing on the -point, we will intend that the facts actually appearing below were such as to warrant its rendition. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
