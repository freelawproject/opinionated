The case was tried before the Court without a jury and findings were filed to the effect that the city authorities permitted a bridge to be constructed by a private party over a water ditch made for a private use in a public street within the city, but did not cause the bridge to be constructed; that on the 3d of October, 1871, it had been out of repair for two weeks, there being a hole eighteen or twenty inches square in the part most used by the public; that on the evening of that day the plaintiff, while going about his ordinary business, and not from his own fault or negligence, fell into the hole and received injuries from which damages resulted and will result to the amount of two thousand four hundred dollars. As a conclusion of law the Court found that the city was not bound to keep its streets in repair, and therefore was not liable for the injuries. The plaintiff moved to set aside the conclusion of law and for judgment upon the findings of fact. The motion was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-11\">Judgment was rendered for the defendant and plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Kewen &amp; Howard, </em>for Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA\">argued that granting permission to build the bridge was a corporate act under which the city was liable for the injuries by the common law and by the terms of its charter, and cited Stats. 1850, p. 87; 9 Cal. 454; 3 Hill, 612; <em>Eustace </em>v. <em>Jahns, </em>38 Cal. 19; <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Trustees of the City of Utica, </em>16 N.

But even if the conclusion would necessarily follow, the premises are not correct. The statute, as we have seen, imposes the duty in question not upon the corporation as such, but upon the City Council, and according to the argument the liability for its non-performance would devolve upon them. Incorporated cities in this State are mere governmental instruments formed under the State laws for the purposes of internal administration. They are not distinguishable in principle from counties created by law for the same purpose. Under the Acts organizing counties, Boards of Supervisors and Road Overseers are charged with the duty of keeping public highways in repair, and it was held here, in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>San Joaquin County, </em>21 Cal. 426, and <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Sonoma County, </em>25 id. 313, that counties are not liable for injuries sustained by private individuals through the neglect of the officers charged with such duties, and it was intimated that responsibility, if any, for such injuries, rested upon the individual officers in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We think that the same principle is applicable to and decisive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">J udgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
