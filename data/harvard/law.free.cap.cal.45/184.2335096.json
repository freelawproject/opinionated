The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>complaint asked for an injunction to restrain the defendants from suing out writs of possession against the plaintiffs, and to stay the execution of the decree in partition until the interests of all the tenants in common, including Castro or his vendees, shall have been finally determined. The injunction was granted. Answers were filed, denying in detail the allegations of the complaint, and the defendants moved the District Court, upon the pleadings and papers filed in the cause, that the injunction be dissolved. The motion was granted and the plaintiffs appealed. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\"><em>Spencer-, </em>for Appellants, argued that as the rights of the tenants in common are still in litigation\u2014the Supreme Court having granted a rehearing in the ejectment suit brought by Castro\u2014and as the bill shows that a multiplicity of actions would necessarily result from a dissolution of the injunction, the order dissolving it should be reversed; and cited 31 Cal. 406; 32 id. 590; 27 id. 643; 18 id. 433.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-7\"><em>Houghton $ Reynolds, </em>for Despondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-8\">The answer denies all the material allegations of the bill relative to the claim, which it is averred renders the partition void, and it was discretionary with the Court to dissolve the injunction or not. The case must be considered on the record before the Court, and it discloses no error indicating an abuse of discretion. It does not show that a rehearing has been granted in the ejectment suit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-9\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">The injunction granted by the County Judge in the first instance upon the complaint was dissolved by the District Court upon the coming in of the answers of the defendants, which denied in detail the allegations of the complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>From the order dissolving the injunction the plaintiffs appeal. The dissolution or continuance of the injunction in the face of the answers filed was largely a matter of discretion in the Court below at the hearing, and upon looldng into the pleadings we cannot, under the recognized rule applicable to such cases, disturb the order. We are urged to consider the result of the litigation lately had here in. the case of <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Tennant, </em>as furnishing a reason why the order dissolving the injunction in this case should be reversed now. But the only question which we can determine is as to whether, <em>upon the record before it, </em>the Court below committed an error which ought to be corrected here under the rules governing proceedings upon appeal, and we are not at liberty to interpolate into the record any matter which did not form an element in the case, as it was presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
