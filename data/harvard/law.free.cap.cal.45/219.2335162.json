It is : \u201calong the beach of T\u00f3males Bay, * * * from the most northerly point of said Miller Rancho, on T\u00f3males Bay, to the most southerly.\u201d Section twenty-nine of the Act of 1867-8, does not require that the county should be designated in the application.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-7\"><em>T. H. Hanson, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-8\">The application neither states the county or State in which the land lies. This is necessary, and a failure to describe the county and State is a fatal defect in the application, and renders it void and of no effect. Hence, as appears by the record, the defendant has never made application for the purchase of any portion of the lands in controversy, in conformity with the law in force at the time such application was made, and is, therefore, not entitled to purchase any portion thereof by virtue of such application. <em>(Hildebrand </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>41 Cal. 387.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b232-9\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The application by Taylor to purchase a portion of the tide lands belonging to the State, contained only the following description of the lands to be purchased, viz: \u201cA certain tract of salt marsh and tide lands in-county, lying and situate along the westerly side of the Miller Rancho, so known, to all the land along the beach of T\u00f3males Bay, along the beach of ordinary low tide, and the hard land, from the most northerly point of said Miller Rancho, on T\u00f3males Bay, to the most southerly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">Irrespective of other objections taken to the proceeding, the description is utterly unintelligible, and is wholly insufficient to support the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
