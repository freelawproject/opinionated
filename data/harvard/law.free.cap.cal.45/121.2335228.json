The Alcalde of the Pueblo de San Jos\u00e9, on the 15th day of May, 1849, granted to Antonio Sunol a tract of land in said pueblo, which tract includes the demanded premises. Sunol and his family resided on the tract until his death about 1865. In 1861 Sunol made a declaration of homestead on a lot on which his residence stood, and which was a part of the tract granted. In March, 1865, Sunol made a will, in which he devised to his executors, his son Harcisso Sunol and Henry M. Haglee, all and singular his property, real and personal, wherever situated, to hold the same in trust, to sell and pay his debts, and certain bequests made in the will, and to hold the remainder in trust for his heirs. The property devised was the sep\u00e1rate property of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">There were several children, and the will contained a clause that \u201c should my present wife, Dolores Mesa Sunol, elect to choose the devise and bequest herein named, in lieu of what the law may set aside for her, I do give, devise, and bequeath unto her, my said wife, out of the residue of my estate, and after the payments of said debts and legacies above named, one eighth part and portion of my said estate, both real and personal.\u201d The will also contained this clause: \u201c It is my desire that my present residence, with the furni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ture therein, be not sold or disposed of unless necessary, and that the same shall be used by my said wife and children as their home.\u201d The last clause in the will was as follows: \u201c Should my said wife, Dolores, refuse to accept the gift and devise to her, above mentioned, then the said one eighth portion so given and devised, I give, bequeath, and devise to my children as above named, to be divided equally between them, share and share alike.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">The defendant, Auzerais, had a mortgage on the homestead lot, and to pay off this mortgage the executors, in 1866, sold him the demanded premises, being a portion of the homestead lot, but not embracing the dwelling or outhouses. After this sale Mrs. Sunol, the widow, made a deed of gift of the premises thus sold to the plaintiff After the will had been filed for probate, Mrs. Sunol filed in the Probate Court a paper relinquishing her right of homestead, and accepting of the bequest contained in the will. The case was tried before a jury who rendered a verdict for the defendants. The Court granted a new trial on motion of the plaintiff, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>Moofe, Laine \u00a3 </em>Leib, for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\">The law would have set aside the homestead for the widow.

As we have seen, the testator vested the legal title of all this estate in his executors. Bid he mean to include the homestead in the expression, \u201call my estate.\u201d He surely did, for he afterwards tells them not to sell it, unless necessary. How, if he did not have the homestead in his mind while disposing of his property, why did he give directions concerning its sale?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-6\"><em>J. G. Black </em>and <em>J. Reynolds, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-7\">Antonio Sunol, in his lifetime, in April, A. B. 1861, made, signed, acknowledged, and recorded a homestead declaration, covering the lot in dispute, and died in 1865, after the amendment of the homestead law of A. B. 1862.- The law as amended asserts that the survivor shall, by operation of law, own the homestead property absolutely, and this has often been so held by this Court; therefore, the homestead is no part of the assets of the estate, and the Probate Court is not presumed to do a useless thing, because if tine title is in the survivor absolutely, the estate cannot have any interest in it, and therefore, the Probate Court has no jurisdiction or control over the homestead, since the amendment of A. B. 1862. <em>(Estate of Orr, </em>29 Cal. 101.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-8\">The language of the will cannot pass the homestead, because in construing the will we must apply its terms, in absence of specific description of property, to land or property belonging to the testator, and within his testamentary disposition at the time of maki <em>(Estate of Sylvey, </em>42 Cal. 211.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">1. Upon looking into the will of Sunol we are of opinion that the devise to the executors included the homestead and carried with it the authority to sell it, if its sale should become necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">2. The acceptance by Mrs. Sunol of the devise in her favor, if the fact be that she did accept it, would operate to estop her, or her grantee,.the plaintiff in this action, from asserting her title to the homestead as' against the executors, or Auzerais, the defendant here, who derives his title from the executors. This estoppel is, however, one of equitable cognizance, and it not having been relied upon by the defendant in pleading, though he had an opportunity to plead it, it results that it could not, for want of the requisite pleadings, have been properly considered or determined at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
