Romie, described as \u201con the south end of said town, and being bounded in front by the base line run by James D. Hutton, Esq., and extending from said line to the rear of a lot granted to Feliz Buelna, and being seventy-five varas in front, and having forty-eight varas in depth on the south line.\u201d The defendant claimed under a grant made by Alcalde Feliz Buelna, dated at San Jos\u00e9, December 17tli, 1845, translated as follows: \u201cThere is granted to the neighbor Bisente Padia a lot of fifty varas front and a hundred deep, this lot being situated to the south of the house of the citizen Feliz Buelna, and in this municipality.\u201d The demanded premises only embraced the land granted to Padia, and when the grant was made the Alcalde placed him in possession of the same, and he built a house on it, and moved into it. Judgment was rendered for the defendants, and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Houghton &amp; Reynolds, </em>for Appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APX\">argued that the house, and not the lot, of Buelna, must be taken as the call in the grant to Padia, and that if the grant was susceptible of location from such a call, it must be made in a parallelogram with the south side of the house, in the center of the base or north line, and cited <em>Chinoweth </em>v. <em>Lessee of Haskell et al. </em>3 Pet. 96; <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>6 Cranch, 165; <em>Bodlie </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>5 id. 225, 226; <em>Shipp </em>v. <em>Miller\u2019s Heirs, </em>2 Wheaton, 323; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>17 Johnson R. 156.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-6\"><em>Archer, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">The construction asked by the appellants would make it appear that the Alcalde granted to Padia the southern fifty varas of his own lot, and delivered to him, not that property, but property adjoining it. The language of the grant does not require such a construction. The word house, in the grant, should be taken to mean lot.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b144-8\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The Court below finds that the demanded premises were granted by the Alcalde to the defendant\u2019s grantor in 1845, and that juridical possession thereof was given. We think the evidence justifies the finding. The words in the grant, \u201cthis lot being situated to the south of the house of the citizen Buelna,\u201d do not necessarily imply that the lot was immediately adjoining the <em>house </em>of Buelna. It may well have been, where the Court finds it was, to the south of the Buelna lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
