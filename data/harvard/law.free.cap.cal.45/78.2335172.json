Yovember 1st, 1865, the company had not received a patent therefor, but was willing to sell the same by giving a bond for a deed when the patent was issued. John H. Carroll was occupying some of this quarter section, and James McCloy the other part. On said day Carroll applied to the company to buy the north half of the quarter, and McCloy to buy the south half. Each paid the company one hundred dollars, and received a bond for a deed. They then entered into an agreement in writing, reciting that whereas their division fences did not run on the sectional lines, that they therefore agreed that each would deed to the other any land he might have of the other\u2019s when the company gave a deed, so that each might have the land he was then in possession of. The real agreement was that the deed need not be given until the one demanding a deed should pay the other what the land had cost him, but this the draftsman left out. The plaintiff derived title from Carroll, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the defendant from McCloy. The railroad company had received a patent, and deeded to the parties the half his bond called for, when the plaintiff brought ejectment to recover a portion of the north half) which was in possession of the defendant, and in McCloy\u2019s possession when the agreement was made.' The defendant set up the contract, and asked - the Court to reform and enforce it. The Court below rendered .judgment for the plaintiff.
