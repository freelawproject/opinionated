The plaintiff and defendant resided on the lot from January to April, 1868, when the plaintiff, the wife, at the husband\u2019s request, went to San Francisco to reside, and the defendant remained in San Jos\u00e9, and the premises were rented. The defendant Prescott, in May, 1870, without any consideration, conveyed the premises to the defendant Clayton, to have Clayton sell the same and give him the proceeds. The wife, in July, 1870, made and filed a declaration of homestead on the premises, and then commenced this action, to compel Clayton to reconvey the lot to her husband, to. be by husband and wife held in joint tenancy, and to have the husband enjoined from selling the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7\">The Court tried the case without a jury, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff. The appeal was from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Black </em>and <em>Reynolds, </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\">The findings and evidence show clearly that neither plaintiff nor defendant Prescott have lived upon the premises in question since April 30th, 1868, and that on the 9th of July, 1870, the date of filing the homestead declaration, plaintiff was residing in San Francisco, and defendant Prescott, the head of the family, was not living \"or residing upon the premises. This is fatal to any homestead claim made by plaintiff. <em>(Gregg </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>33 Cal. 220; <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>35 Cal. 316.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-7\"><em>Drake Rix, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-8\">The plaintiff, by leaving the premises temporarily, did not lose her residence thereon, or right of homestead therein. <em>(Herrick </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>16 Wis. 157; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>14 Iowa, 523; <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Bachelder, </em>11 Gray, Mass., 214; <em>Dulanty </em>v. <em>Pynchon, </em>6 Allen, Mass., 510; <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>31 Illinois, 148; <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>31 Illinois, 200.)

We .held in <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>33 Cal. 220, that in order to impress the character of a homestead upon\"premises they must be such in fact by occupation at the time the declaration is filed\u2014\u201c must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>resided upon and used as such at the time the declaration is made.\u201d Under the circumstances appearing, the declaration of the wife, claiming the premises in controversy as a homestead, cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
