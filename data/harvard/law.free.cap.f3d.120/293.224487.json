Walsh in the amount of $8400 this 8th day of August, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Division for the Purpose of Appointing Independent Counsels Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as Amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Opinion for the Special Court filed PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">ON APPLICATION FOR ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<author id=\"b361-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">William Dwyer (\u201cDwyer\u201d) petitions this Court under section 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>(1988 and Supp. V 1993), for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred during and as a result of the Iran/Contra investigation conducted by Independent Counsel (\u201cIC\u201d) Lawrence E. Walsh. After considering Dwyer\u2019s petition we find that he is entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $8400.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">During the time that the events which constituted the Iran/Contra matter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> took place, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North sought help from the Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) in rescuing hostages held by a terrorist group in Lebanon. For use in this operation North was given considerable sums of money by H. Ross Perot, the Central Intelligence Agency, the DEA, and others. The funds were to be used partly to buy information regarding the hostages from informants in Lebanon. To this end, North recruited the services of William Dwyer, a DEA agent. IC Walsh, during his investigation of Iran/Contra, investigated the possible misuse of the Lebanon funds by North and Dwyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">After the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation, Dwyer petitioned the court for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred during this time period. In his original petition he prayed for reimbursement in the amount of $65,577.48; in his \u201cReply to Justice Department\u2019s Comment\u201d he requested$53,548.23; finally, in the \u201cResponse of Petitioner to the Former Independent Counsel\u2019s Evaluation\u201d (\u201cResponse\u201d) he asked to \u201cbe awarded fifty percent of the hourly fees ... and fifty percent of the out-of-pocket charges\u201d incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-19\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b361-20\">Section 593(f)(1) of the Independent Counsel statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-21\">Upon the request of an individual who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel pursuant to this chapter, the division of the court may, if no indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation, award reimbursement for those reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by that individual during that investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). To obtain an attorneys\u2019 fees award under the statute a petitioner must show that the following requirements are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-23\">1) the petitioner is a \u201csubject\u201d of the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>2) the fees were incurred \u201cduring\u201d the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX_\">3) the fees would not have been incurred \u201cbut for\u201d the requirements of the Act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A484\">4) the fees are \u201creasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALbb\"><em>In re Mullins (Tamposi Fee Application), </em>84 F.3d 1439, 1441 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1996) (per curiam). We will address each of these requirements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"ALc\">\n<em>A. \u201cSubject\u201d Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AA_\">We have previously defined the term \u201csubject\u201d as a person whose conduct is within the scope of the independent counsel\u2019s investigation such that \u201cthe Independent Counsel might reasonably be expected to point the finger of accusation\u201d at him. <em>In re North (Dutton Fee Application), </em>11 F.3d 1075,1078 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1993) (per curiam); <em>see also Shultz, </em>8 F.3d at 850. Although no criminal charges were sought against Dwyer, IC Walsh investigated him for possible misuse of funds and therefore, according to IC Walsh, Dwyer \u201ccould reasonably have believed he was a subject of my investigation.\u201d Report of Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh Regarding Fee Application of William Dwyer at 2-3, In Re: Oliver L. North, et al. (March 10, 1997) (Div. No. 86-6) (hereinafter \u201cReport of IC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AvU\">Additionally, in <em>Shultz </em>we held that under any definition of the term, the criterion for \u201csubject\u201d status is squarely met when the independent counsel tells a party that he is in fact a subject. 8 F.3d at 850. In his affidavit to the Court, Dwyer\u2019s attorney states that an attorney from IC Walsh\u2019s office informed him that \u201cDwyer, though not a target of the investigation, was nonetheless one of the subjects and could face possible criminal charges.\u201d Sehippers\u2019 Affidavit at 4. Accordingly, Dwyer qualifies as a subject under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AFq\">\n<em>B. Fees Incurred \u201cDuring\" the Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3-\">Dwyer seeks fees for representation from May 1987 to February 1988. The court has identified the maximum time for which fees can be sought as spanning from the time an IC begins an investigation of an individual to the deadline for filing comments to the final report. <em>See, e.g., In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1420-22 (D.C. Cir Spec. Div.1989) (per curiam). The relevant period in this case is from December 19,1986, when IC Walsh was appointed, to the December 3, 1993 deadline for filing comments to the Final Report. Therefore, the fees were incurred \u201cduring\u201d the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai4\">\n<em>C.Fees Not Incurred \u201cBut For\" the Requirements of the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHMt\">The Independent Counsel statute requires that to be reimbursable, attorneys\u2019 fees must be such as \u201cwould not have been incurred <em>but for </em>the requirements of [the Ethics in Government Act].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1) (emphasis added). Therefore, \u201c[a]ll requests for attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act must satisfy the \u2018but for\u2019 requirement of\u2019 the Act. <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d 451, 452 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1989) (per curiam). The purpose of awarding only fees that would not have been incurred \u201cbut for\u201d the Act is to ensure that \u201cofficials [and here derivative \u2018subjects\u2019] who are investigated by independent counsels will be subject only to paying those attorneys\u2019 fees that would normally be paid by private citizens being investigated for the same offense by\u201d federal executive officials such as the United States Attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 452-53 (citing S.Rep. No. 496, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 18 (1982), <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3537, 3554 (referring to \u201cfees [that] would not have been incurred in the absence of the [independent counsel] law\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"ASbO\">The Iran/Contra investigation arose as a result of IC Walsh\u2019s decision to treat as a criminal conspiracy efforts to circumvent the Boland Amendments, which prohibited the U.S. Government from supporting the Contras in Nicaragua. As we have previously noted, \u201ca politically appointed Attorney General ... would never have subjected [attempts to circumvent the Boland Amendments] to criminal prosecution. Therefore, the investigation would never have occurred ... \u2018but for\u2019 the appointment of the Independent Counsel.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"Axi\">Dwyer\u2019s activities involving North and the Lebanon funds were within the scope of IC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Walsh\u2019s investigation of alleged attempts to circumvent the Boland Amendments by supplying military aid to the Contras. IC Walsh has stated that \u201csome of the funds that we traced to [Dwyer] were raised in connection with Contra support. It was the tracing of these funds that exposed Dwyer to possible investigation.\u201d Report of IC at 3. Therefore, Dwyer would not have been investigated, and attorneys\u2019 fees would not have been incurred, \u201cbut for\u201d the appointment of the independent counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Avo\"><em>D. Fees are </em>\u201cReasonable\u201d <em>under the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aoc\">We must determine whether the time expended by Dwyer\u2019s attorney on Dwyer\u2019s representation was reasonable, and whether the attorney charged a reasonable rate. <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d 1192, 1201 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1990) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"A3R5\">As to the reasonableness of time expended, in support of the petition Dwyer\u2019s attorney has submitted two separate billing documents: the first is a set of monthly statements from June, 1987 to March, 1988; the second is a document entitled \u201cRevised Accounting for Services Rendered and Costs Incurred,\u201d covering the same time period. For the reasons stated below neither of these documents is sufficient for the awarding of fees, and we have to look elsewhere for verification of the reasonableness of time billed.</p>\n<p id=\"AVX-\">The monthly statements submitted by Dwyer\u2019s attorney are woefully inadequate: each one contains the same paragraph that provides only an exceedingly general description of the legal work performed and which mentions only services rendered in connection with the congressional investigation of the Iran initiative; there is no mention whatsoever of the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation. These monthly statements are thus deficient for two reasons. First, we have held previously that fees incurred in connection with congressional proceedings are not reimbursable under the Act. <em>In re North (Gadd Fee Application), </em>12 F.3d 252, 256-57 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1994) (per curiam); <em>In re North (Gardner Fee Application), </em>30 F.3d 143, 147 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1994) (per cu-riam). Second, as we have also held previously, adequate documentation of legal work performed is a necessary ingredient for the reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d at 1204, and inadequate documentation \u201cmakes it impossible for the court to verify the reasonableness of the billings, either as to the necessity of the particular service or the amount of time expended on a given legal task,\u201d <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"A-oe\">The second billing document submitted lists the legal work performed in somewhat more detail, and includes references to the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation. However, for each month the document lists only cumulative amounts of time expended and money owed, and does not indicate how much time was spent, or how much money was charged, for any particular task. This too is inadequate documentation upon which no fee reimbursement can be based. <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d at 455; <em>see also In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 994 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div. 1989) (per curiam) (requiring that fee applications include \u201ca detailed description of the subject matter of the work\u201d performed).</p>\n<p id=\"AC9E\">The insufficiency of these billing documents would ordinarily bar any fee recovery. However, a close reading of the submissions presented to the court reveals that the petitioner and the Independent Counsel are in agreement that for a very short period of time Dwyer\u2019s attorney was working almost exclusively on the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation of Dwyer, and we will reimburse him for that time.</p>\n<p id=\"AMat\">Dwyer\u2019s attorney was required to obtain a security clearance for his representation of Dwyer in the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation. On July 30, 1987, he underwent a briefing in Washington, D.C., for this clearance. Therefore, we will order reimbursement for fees for that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We will also order reimbursement for representation in Washington on August 10-13 and 27-28, 1987, when counsel met with IC Walsh\u2019s staff and performed other activities related to the IC\u2019s investigation. For each of these days we will allow recovery for six hours of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We will not, however, allow reimbursement of travel expenses for these time periods. Dwyer\u2019s attorney practiced in Chicago, traveling to Washington, D.C., for the abovementioned time periods. Expenses for such travel are not reimbursable \u201cin the absence of some showing that local counsel could not have rendered the service involved and thereby obviated the necessity of employing an attorney\u201d who incurs costs traveling from his home to the work site. <em>In re North (Bush Fee Application), </em>59 F.3d 184, 194 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1995) (per curiam). Dwyer has made no such showing and could easily have retained counsel here in Washington, D.C. where, we have previously noted, there is no shortage of lawyers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">For the same reason, we do not find the hourly rate charged by Dwyer\u2019s attorney to be reasonable. Dwyer was billed at the rate of $300 per hour. In his affidavit Dwyer\u2019s attorney states that this was his fee for matters handled outside Chicago; his regular rate for matters in Chicago was $200 per hour. Since we can discern no legitimate reason why outside counsel was retained in this case, <em>supra, </em>we will order reimbursement at the attorney\u2019s regular hourly rate of $200, which is in the range of rates we have previously held to be reasonable for representation during IC Walsh\u2019s investigation. <em>See Gardner, </em>30 F.3d at 146; <em>In re North (Armitage Fee Application), </em>50 F.3d 42, 44 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1995) (per curiam). .</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Final Calculations</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Taking into consideration the days and rates to be reimbursed mentioned above, we arrive at the following final total for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">Date Fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">July 30,1987 $1200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">August 10-13 $4800</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">August 27-28 $2400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">Total $8400</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">Based on the foregoing analysis we will grant Dwyer\u2019s petition in part and award $8400 for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-15\">. The facts of the Iran/Contra investigation are generally collected in cases cited in <em>In re North (Shultz Fee Application), </em>8 F.3d 847, 849 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1993) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A631\">. Dwyer\u2019s attorney admits that virtually all of the costs incurred prior to August, 1987 (approximately $35,000 of the reimbursement request) would have been incurred in his representation of Dwyer for the congressional investigations of Iran/Contra alone, even if no independent counsel had been appointed. Response at 3. These costs would have been incurred regardless of the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation, and therefore are not reimbursable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
