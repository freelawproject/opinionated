The questions involved herein are the same as those considered and disposed of in the case of <em>Department of Public Works et al. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, ante, </em>p. 215 [239 Pac. 1076], except that in this proceeding the State Board of Fish and Game Commissioners is the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>cant for a writ of review in the Superior Court. Because of our determination that the petitioners herein do not exercise a judicial function in acting on an application under section 12 of the Water Commission Act (Stats. 1913, p. 1018), it is unnecessary to determine whether or riot the State Board of Fish and Game Commissioners is a party beneficially interested in the <em>certiorari </em>proceedings in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">On the authority of the case above referred to and this day decided the demurrer is overruled. Let the peremptory writ of prohibition issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
