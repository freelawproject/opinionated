The particular facts upon which it bases its application and upon which the same is resisted are embraced within a stipulation of the parties as to the facts of the case, which said stipulation is in the main identical with that presented in the case of <em>Robison </em>v. <em>Brayton, ante, </em>p. 516 [241 Pac. 867], with the exception that in the above case the petitioner was seeking to have received and entered upon the docket of the respondent an oral demurrer in a case which was pending before him as a justice of the peace prior to July 24, 1925, while in the instant case the petitioner was, on August 24, 1925, seeking to have the respondent receive and file a complaint in an action not theretofore pending in the justices court of Long Beach township, of which it is herein contended the respondent was and still is a justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">We can perceive no difference in principle between these two cases, nor in the application to them of the conclusions which this court arrived at in the case of <em>Bakkenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, ante, </em>p. 504 [241 Pac. 874].</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">On authority of the foregoing cases it is, therefore, ordered that a writ of mandate issue as prayed for herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Myers, C.
