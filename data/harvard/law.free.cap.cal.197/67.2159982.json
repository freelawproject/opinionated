The decision of this court in reversing the judgment made no provision for the recovery of costs. The clerk, however, issued a <em>remittitur </em>containing the provision \u201cthe appellants to recover costs of appeal.\u201d The present motion is to recall the <em>remittitur </em>and to strike from it the last-named provision. The motion is, therefore, limited to the question as to whether or not the costs on appeal were recoverable against this respondent.  The inheritance tax statute (Stats. 1921, p. 1520), section 17, subdivision 5, provides with reference to the state controller \u201cthat no undertaking shall be required from or costs charged against the state controller in any such proceeding.\u201d The statute was read into our decision and was a part of it. Rule 23- of this court could not, of course, prevail as against the statute.  It follows, therefore, that the insertion of the words \u201cappellants to recover costs of appeal\u201d was in violation of the statute, was no part of our judgment, and was an inadvertence on the part of the clerk. The cases cited are not out of harmony touching this subject. The case of <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Civil Service Board, </em>68 Cal. App. 752 [230 Pac. 196], was a case to which the rule of this court upon the subject of costs was properly applicable. The action of the clerk, therefore, in that case was in conformity with our judgment and our rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>and it followed that the motion to recall the <em>remittitur </em>some time after the <em>remittitur </em>had been issued for the purpose in reality of amending our judgment could not prevail. Judge Knight\u2019s decision in that regard was correct, but that case has no application to the case before us. The case of <em>San Joaquin &amp; Kings River Canal &amp; Irr. Co. </em>v. <em>Stevinson, </em>165 Cal. 540 [132 Pac. 1021], is directly in point, and points out the procedure to be followed in such eases by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The motion is granted. The <em>remittitur </em>is recalled for the purpose of striking therefrom the provision \u201cThe appellant to recover costs on appeal\u201d and as corrected is ordered to issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
