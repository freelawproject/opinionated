Second, whether the commission is required to explain why it did not accept the conclusions of a vocational consultant who, in consideration of appellant\u2019s experience, education, and age, found that as to employment opportunities, appellant would not present the \u201cbest qualifications or least problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">As to the evidence supporting the commission\u2019s finding and order, appellant argues that Dr. Kackley\u2019s admission in his answers to interrogatories that he did not consider the factors of age, education and work history in making his impairment evaluation is not evidence supporting a want of permanent and total disability because disability must be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>sidered in context with those factors. The answer to this argument is that disability, determination rests with the Industrial Commission. <em>State, ex rel. Dallas, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 193. The determination herein is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence of Dr. Kackley based upon his conclusions as to the extent of appellant\u2019s impairment. While the credibility of Dr. Reynolds\u2019 evaluation might arguably be impugned as equivocatory (see <em>State, ex rel. Walters, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1985], 20 Ohio St. 3d 71), the credibility of Dr. Kackley\u2019s evaluation is unimpeached and supports the commission\u2019s determination that appellant is not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">As to the commission\u2019s failure to refer to the evaluation of the vocational rehabilitation consultant, that evaluation may be accepted or rejected as the commission deems appropriate because the determination of extent of disability is the function of the commission. See <em>Dallas, supra. </em>Moreover, the standard by which the commission must be guided in determining whether a claimant is permanently and totally disabled is whether he is \u201cunfit for sustained remunerative employment.\u201d See <em>State, ex rel. Jennings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 101, 102. The report of Rosenthal addressed a standard, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cbest qualifications or least problems,\u201d which differed from that set forth in <em>Jennings. </em>Thus, the Rosenthal report was properly rejected by the commission and no reference thereto was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">For reasons of the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals, denying the writ of mandamus, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-8\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b238-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., and C.

I concur in today\u2019s decision because it reaffirms this court\u2019s recognition that the commission, not outside \u201cexperts,\u201d has the responsibility for determining disability. Factors such as age, education and work history may certainly be considered by the commission but should not provide the basis for usurping the role of the commission in determining disability.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-11\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b238-12\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ark\">dissenting. Because I believe the Industrial Commission abused its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s application for permanent total disability benefits, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">The court of appeals held that the commission\u2019s denial of benefits was supported by competent evidence, specifically the medical reports of Drs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Kackley and Reynolds. However, the court below did not consider the fact that Kackley stated in response to interrogatories that he did not consider appellant\u2019s age, education and work skills in his evaluation of appellant\u2019s disability. This court has held that \u201c[a]ny conclusion with regard to permanent total disability must * * * address the claimant\u2019s ability to work.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Hutt, </em>v. <em>Frick-Gallagher Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 184, 185. The Medical Examination Manual issued by the commission states at vi that permanent total disability \u201cis established when the injury has caused the injured worker to be unfit for sustained remunerative employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Any meaningful determination of a claimant\u2019s fitness for sustained remunerative employment should consider \u201cthe whole person\u201d; <em>i.e., </em>such determination should address claimant\u2019s injury <em>and </em>his work experience, level of education and age, when relevant. Appellant, at the time of his application for permanent total disability benefits, was sixty-five, had worked a substantial portion of his life as a truckdriver, and had a ninth grade education. These factors are highly relevant to a determination of whether appellant is fit for \u201csustained remunerative employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The only medical reports before the commission which considered appellant\u2019s age, education, and work history in evaluating his fitness for sustained remunerative employment are those of Dr. Reynolds and Dr. Davies. Reynolds states that \u201c[considering his [appellant\u2019s] age and his impairment and the fact that he has worked as a truck driver it is doubtful whether this man will ever be returned to any gainful employment.\u201d Davies states that \u201cbased upon the allowed conditions and the acceptance of the objective findings of the examining physicians, the claimant may be PTD due to his age, education and physical condition.\u201d Further, the vocational consultant\u2019s report indicates strongly that the only jobs for which appellant would be qualified require either more education than claimant has or more exertion that he can handle. This, coupled with appellant\u2019s age and the competition for such jobs, renders him unfit for sustained employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Thus, there is no evidence upon which the commission could have reasonably based its order denying appellant\u2019s application for permanent total disability benefits. There is substantial, credible and competent evidence that claimant is permanently and totally disabled based on the combination of his allowed conditions and the vocational factors outlined above. Where there is no evidence upon which the Industrial Commission could have based its factual conclusion, it abuses its discretion, and a writ of mandamus will be granted. <em>State, ex rel. Kramer, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 3d 39, 42 [13 O.O.3d 30]. For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and grant a writ of mandamus directing the Industrial Commission to issue an order finding appellant to be entitled to compensation for permanent total disability.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
