R. 56(E). That rule provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201c* * * When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Toledo contends that defendant failed in its duty under this rule to respond with any evidence to show that there was a genuine issue of fact warranting trial. Toledo states that the only evidence submitted by defendant in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion was an affidavit of Charles Abde, president of the defendant corporation, which is silent on the dispositive fact alleged by plaintiff that defendant had announced its intention to plaintiff of never returning to the premises upon completion of repairs, regardless of whether plaintiff restored all or none of defendant\u2019s improvements. Toledo contends that its evidence in support of its motion, to the effect that defendant had in fact announced such intention, remained uncontroverted, and therefore summary judgment was entirely appropriate. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">While it may be true that defendant presented no evidence to contravene the dispositive fact<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that it had announced its intention of never returning to the premises, the materials that plaintiff submitted in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>of its own motion contained evidence to contradict this fact. Plaintiff presented a deposition taken of Charles Abde, in which Abde repeatedly-denied plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he had no intention of returning, or that he had ever told plaintiff that he had no intention of returning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiff <em>by its own evidence </em>showed that a genuine issue of fact existed, and summary judgment was therefore improper. If it is true that defendant\u2019s affidavit did not \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d as required by Civ. R. 56(E), that rule only states that where a party fails to so respond, \u201csummary judgment, <em>if appropriate, </em>shall be entered against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clearly not appropriate here. Summary judgment will not be rendered unless reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party opposing the motion. Civ. R. 56(C). \u201cThe burden of showing that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact falls upon the moving party in requesting a summary judgment.\u201d <em>Harless </em>v. <em>Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 64, 66 [8 O.O.3d 73], citing <em>Hamlin </em>v. <em>McAlpin Co. </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 517, 519-520 [26 O.O.2d 206]. Moreover, the party against whom the motion is made is entitled to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. Civ. R. 56(C). Given Charles Abde\u2019s repeated denials of plaintiffs allegations regarding his intention to return, it cannot be said that plaintiff sustained its burden of showing that no genuine issue existed as to this material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">These principles find support in the federal cases and in the commentators to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). \u201c* * * [This rule]'implicitly recognizes that there are situations in which no defense will be required; in some situations this is true even though a motion for summary judgment has been supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. Rule 56(e) states that a defense is required only if the motion for summary judgment is \u2018supported as provided in this rule\u2019 and that even if the opposing party fails to submit counter-evidence, summary judgment shall be entered only \u2018if appropriate.\u2019 Furthermore, the Advisory Committee stated in its Note: \u2018Where the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied <em>even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.\u2019 \u201d </em>10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d (1983) 523-524, Section 2739 (emphasis in original). See, also, <em>Adickes </em>v. <em>S.H. Kress &amp; Co. </em>(1970), 398 U.S. 144, 159-161 (holding that because respondent failed to meet its initial burden as the party moving for summary judgment, petitioner was not required to come forward with suitable opposing affidavits). Accord <em>Sterner Aero AB </em>v. <em>Page Airmotive, Inc. </em>(C.A. 10, 1974), 499 F. 2d 709, 714; and <em>Bromley-Heath Modernization Commt. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Auth. </em>(C.A. 1, 1972), 459 F. 2d 1067, 1071-1072. Based on these principles, we therefore hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and the court of appeals properly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Toledo next asserts that the court of appeals exceeded its proper scope of review by going beyond defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error to contemplate errors which were not assigned and on which Toledo had no opportunity to present an argument. Toledo specifically challenges the court of appeals\u2019 reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment on plaintiff\u2019s complaint, contending that since defendant framed as its sole assignment of error the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on its counterclaim, the court of appeals overstepped its bounds by reversing the judgment on the underlying complaint. We find no merit in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It is certainly true, as Toledo asserts, that in reviewing the judgment of a lower court, a court of appeals need only pass upon errors assigned and briefed; errors not specifically raised may be disregarded. App. R. 12(A); <em>C. Miller Chevrolet </em>v. <em>Willoughby Hills </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 298, 301 [67 O.O.2d 358]. It is also true that this court has cautioned that \u201c[i]n fairness to the parties, a Court of Appeals which contemplates a decision upon an issue not briefed should * * * give the parties notice of its intention and an opportunity to brief the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, fn. 3. These principles do not, however, support Toledo\u2019s contention that the court of appeals erred in reversing the judgment on the complaint, for several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>reasons. First, it is evident from the discretionary language employed in App. R. 12(A) that a court of appeals <em>may </em>pass upon an error which was neither assigned nor briefed by a party. See <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 301. An appellate court does not <em>per se </em>exceed its authority by addressing errors not assigned. Second, contrary to Toledo\u2019s assertion, plaintiff did have notice that defendant was challenging both the summary judgment on the counterclaim and the judgment on the underlying complaint. Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal to the court of appeals clearly states that defendant was appealing both judgments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fact that defendant\u2019s assignment of error in the appellate court appeared to narrow the issue to the propriety of the entry of summary judgment on the counterclaim does not persuade us that the court of appeals was therefore bound to limit its holding to that judgment only. Under the circumstances of this case, any error in the granting of summary judgment on the counterclaim would inevitably affect the subsequent trial on the underlying complaint. The theory raised in the counterclaim (whether plaintiff had a duty to restore the premises to their condition before the fire, <em>i.e., </em>with all improvements) is so intertwined with the issue at the trial (whether defendant breached its duty to fulfill its remaining obligations under the lease) that any error in deciding the counterclaim would be fatal to the trial on the complaint. It is for this reason that the court of appeals did not exceed its proper scope of review by reversing both judgments. Its ruling that summary judgment on the counterclaim was improper necessarily casts such doubt on the validity of the trial judgment that reversal of the former required reversal and remand of the latter. The appellate holding would have very little meaning otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-7\">Celebrezze, C J., Sweeney, Locher, C. Brown and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b259-8\">Holmes and Douglas, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-12\"> This fact is dispositive because even if plaintiff indeed had a duty to restore all improvements made by defendant, such duty would have been discharged once defendant announced its intention of not returning to the premises. There would have been no point in requiring plaintiff to expend extra funds to replace all these improvements in order to render the premises suitable for defendant\u2019s reoccupancy if defendant in fact announced that it never planned to return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-5\"> The following excerpts are taken from the deposition taken of Charles Abde, submitted by plaintiff in support of its motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cQ.
