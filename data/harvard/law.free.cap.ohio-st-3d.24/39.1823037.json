Quine, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b96-9\">Locher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">The issue presented in this cause is whether the trial court erred in modifying appellant\u2019s visitation rights. We hold that appellant\u2019s visitation rights were properly modified by the trial court and affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Appellant avers that the lower courts erred because any modification of his visitation rights should be governed by R.C. 3109.04 and that the rules for determining when a court may modify a custody decree are equally applicable to modification of visitation rights. We do not agree. Modification of visitation rights is governed by R.C. 3109.05 and the specific rules for determining when a court may modify a custody decree are not equally applicable to modification of visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">R.C. 3109.04 provides specific guidelines for a trial court to follow in determining whether a prior custody decree should be modified. That section is silent as to rights of visitation. R.C. 3109.05 governs visitation rights. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">\u201c(B) The court may make any just and reasonable order or decree permitting any parent who is deprived of the care, custody, and control of the children to visit them at the time and under the conditions that the court directs. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Therefore, parental rights of visitation are within the sound discretion of the trial court. This court has previously recognized that discretion and distinguished it from the trial court\u2019s discretion with regard to custody. \u201c* * * While custody and visitation are obviously related, a court\u2019s discretion regarding visitation is broader. See R.C. 3109.05.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Scordato, </em>v. <em>George </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St. 2d 128 [19 O.O.3d 318].</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The trial court is to make a \u201cjust and reasonable order or decree\u201d concerning visitation rights in accord with R.C. 3109.05. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find the trial court\u2019s order modifying appellant\u2019s visitation rights is just and reasonable. While the visitation rights in the \u201cStandard Order of Visitation\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are not as extensive as the visitation rights provided appellant in the amended separation agreement, this does not make the trial court\u2019s order unjust and unreasonable. The referee held a hearing on the motions of the parties and made appropriate recommendations to the trial court. The recommendations were properly reviewed by the trial court and incorporated into its judgment entry. The court of appeals held that the order was reasonable and found no abuse of discretion by the trial court. Upon independent review of the record and order, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s visitation rights were properly modified by the trial court and affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., Parrino, Holmes, C. Brown and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b97-8\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b97-9\">Parrino, J., of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting for Sweeney, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\"> The \u201cStandard Order of Visitation\u201d modifies or excludes visitations (B) through (F) provided in the amended separation agreement.
