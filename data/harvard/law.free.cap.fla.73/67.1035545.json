See Russ v. Mitchell, ii Fla. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Thoug'h under section 1397 General Statutes of 1906, the writ may \u201crun throughout the State,\u201d the defendant may plead his privilege of being sued in the county of his residence in the State unless the action is brought in a county where the cause of action accrued and proper service is made on him in that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Rehearing- denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">All Concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
