State of Florida, </em>835 F.2d 1404 (11th Cir.1987), this court affirmed the decision of the trial court denying Ault\u2019s request for a new trial and upholding the award of damages as to Randolph. However, we reserved ruling on the award of damages as to Lohr in order to certify a question to the Florida Supreme Court. In a separate opinion at 835 F.2d 1402, we certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether, in Florida, a compensatory damages award must underlie a punitive damages award in a case in which the jury has made express findings against a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-5\">The Florida Supreme Court has answered the question in the negative, concluding that a jury finding of liability is the equivalent of finding nominal damages, and consequently, the jury may assess punitive damages. <em>Ault v. Lohr, </em>538 So.2d 454 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-6\">In light of this authoritative interpretation of state law, the judgment of the district court upholding the award of punitive damages as to Lohr is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
