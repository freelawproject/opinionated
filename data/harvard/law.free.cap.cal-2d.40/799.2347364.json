As in <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, ante, </em>p. 778 [256 P.2d 947], the appeal is from a judgment entered upon an order sustaining the demurrers of the defendants without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">For his first cause of action, Kurlan alleges that Ruth MeKenney \u201coriginated, created and wrote certain stories for the \u2018New Yorker Magazine\u2019 which were subsequently dramatized in a stage play entitled \u2018My Sister Eileen,\u2019 and which were subsequently used as the basis of a motion picture photo-play also entitled \u2018My Sister Eileen\u2019 featuring the same leading female characters known as \u2018Ruth\u2019 and \u2018Eileen,\u2019 and depicting unique characterizations and relationships between said characters.\u201d He states that, by written agreement, Mc-Kenney transferred to him \u201cthe sole andTexcl\u00f1sivRrifybt. to us\u00e9 for radio broadcasting purpoges_saidpleading female characters.\u201d She also assigned to him \u201call radio broadcasting rights\u201d which she had \u201cexpressly reserved\u201d in connection with prior licenses and uses of these characters. A further allegation is that, prior to the commencement of this action, MeKenney assigned to him all causes of action which she might have against these defendants arising out of transactions alleged in this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Kurlan then pleads that he \u201cconceived, originated, and devised a new and original radio program idea and original untitled radio program\u201d featuring Ruth and Eileen. In connection with this program, he states, he originated new program techniques and methods of radio presentation, including a new radio production format. These, he says, he \u201creduced to concrete form and embodied\u201d in a written script and a sample audition recording, at a cost of $10,000, retaining at all times his common law rights of ownership and authorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Kurlan states that he submitted his radio program to the defendants at their special instance and request pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>an express oral agreement. In consideration of such submission, if they used all or any part of the program they promised to pay him its reasonable value. The defendants accepted submission of the program script and recording, he states, heard it, and became fully familiar with it. Thereafter, CBS and the other defendants, without Kurlan\u2019s authority or license, produced and broadcast over a coast-to-coast network a weekly series of radio programs entitled, \u201cMy Friend Irma.\u201d This radio broadcast, the complaint continues, substantially copied, used and embodied his radio program idea and format. Kurlan claims general damages of $150,000 for rendering valueless his \u201cpersonal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\">The second count of the complaint incorporates by reference all of the allegations of the first one except the averments with respect to an express agreement. In addition, it declares that Kurlan submitted his radio program idea and sample audition recording to the defendants at their request for the purpose of sale to or use by them upon payment to him of its reasonable value.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The third count also incorporates by reference all of the allegations of the first one except the averments with respect to an express agreement. It then alleges that Kurlan submitted his radio program idea and audition recording to the defendants at their request pursuant to an implied agreement that, in consideration for the submission, if used by them, they would pay him the reasonable value of the program idea, or any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">After incorporating by reference all of the allegations of the first count except those with respect to an express agreement, the fourth count asserts that the radio program was submitted to the defendants at their request pursuant to trade customs, practices and usages. These customs, the complaint declares, are that the defendants would not use or copy all or any part of his program without his consent and that they would not do or permit any act in derogation of its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">By reference, all of the allegations of the first count, except those respecting an express agreement, use of the program by the defendants and damages, are made a part of the fifth one. Kurlan then pleads that he submitted his program to the defendants at their request for the purpose of sale to them. They heard the audition recording, he says, and retained it in their possession for several weeks, becoming fully familiar with its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Thereafter, according to the complaint, the defendants negotiated with him for production of a series of radio programs based upon his idea. These negotiations, Kurlan states, were terminated when the defendants informed him that they \u201cintended to use\u201d his idea, characters and format \u201cwithout compensation therefor by merely changing the names of the characters and describing the leading female characters as girl friends instead of sisters.\u201d According to Kurlan, the defendants said that by doing so they would save the expense of compensating him and McKenney and own and control the program. Kurlan alleges that he immediately objected to the proposed action and notified the defendants that they would act at their peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Thereafter, Kurlan states, with full notice and knowledge of his rights and \u201cin wilful and deliberate disregard thereof,\u201d the defendants broadcast over a coast-to-coast network a weekly series of radio programs entitled, \u201cMy Friend Irma.\u201d These programs substantially copied, used, embodied and misappropriated his \u201cuntitled and unpublished sample audition recording.\u201d By such conduct, Kurlan says, the defendants \u201chave appropriated the rights,\" benefits, royalties and profits to which\u201d he \u201cis solely and exclusively entitled,\u201d and they have destroyed the value of his \u201cpersonal property.\u201d He alleges general damages in the amount of $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The fifth count includes an allegation that, because of their nature, \u201cit is not practicable to attach to the complaint\u201d either Kurlan\u2019s audition recording or recordings of the defendants\u2019 radio program. The defendants\u2019 recordings are in their possession and control, it is said. Kurlan makes profer\u00ed of his recording and consents that the records which be submitted to the defendants \u201cshall be deemed to be a part of this complaint for all purposes and upon any demurrer, motion or other proceeding in this cause.\u201d By stipulation, this allegation was made a part of each of the preceding counts of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The defendants demurred to the complaint upon the grounds that each count fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. They also moved to require Kurlan to comply with section 426(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The motion to require compliance with the statute was granted and the records of both radio programs were ordered to be introduced and filed as exhibits on demurrer. Thereafter, demurrers were sustained without leave to amend and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>judgment entered \u201cthat plaintiff take nothing as against said defendants. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\">This court has studied the scripts and heard recordings of both radio programs. Hurlan\u2019s program, \u201cMy Sister Eileen,\u201d features \u201cthe further adventures of Ruth and Eileen,\u201d the principal characters \u201cfrom Ruth McKenney\u2019s best-selling stories and from the Broadway and motion picture hit\u201d of the same name. The principal idea of the program is to capitalize upon the success of McKenney\u2019s creation. As stated in an advertising blurb in the audition script, \u201cMillions of people have read the Ruth and Eileen stories or seen the play or picture . . . which means that several million dollars worth of some one else\u2019s money has already been spent for you, Mr. Prospective Client. . . . These characters have been highly successful in every medium\u2014magazines\u2014books\u2014stage\u2014and screen . . . but\u2014as a series have never before been presented on the air . . . the medium for which they are best suited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The program may be summarized as follows: Ruth and Eileen are sisters living in an apartment which Eileen found for them in New York City. Ruth possesses average intelligence and capabilities and is the balance wheel of the pair. Eileen is semi-moronic, scatterbrained, impulsive, naive, completely thoughtless and oblivious to the consequences of most of her acts. Lucille Ball, a motion picture actress under contract to Kurlan, plays the part of Ruth.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Ruth, as narrator, introduces a series of incidents in which Eileen\u2019s stupidity creates situations extremely embarrassing to Ruth. Ruth is constantly trying to rescue one or both of them from Eileen\u2019s scrapes, while Eileen continues to add complications. Through Ruth\u2019s efforts, Eileen\u2019s situations are turned to the benefit of the pair.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Most of the situations which Eileen creates arise, directly or indirectly, from the fact that Eileen is man-crazy. She trusts any man, and has an astonishing capacity for acquiring large numbers of them in unorthodox ways. This trait introduces certain minor characters into the program, including one dispossessed male who moves in to live with the girls. There is a loud-mo\u00fcthed Texan boor who, thanks to Eileen, forces his crude attentions upon Ruth. Among other characters are an eccentric old landlady and an ill-tempered canine monstrosity. Ruth\u2019s boy friend, Lloyd Carter, is mentioned in the audition recording but his personality is not developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The defendants\u2019 program, \u201cMy Friend Irma,\u201d also features two girls, one reasonably intelligent, the other stupid, living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>in an apartment in Now York City. However, it in no way attempts to capitalize upon the success of McKenney\u2019s creation. Jane and Irma are chance friends, not sisters. Jane, for lack of a better place to live, moved into an apartment already occupied by Irma. Marie Wilson, a motion picture and stage actress famous for \u201cdumb-blonde\u201d roles, plays the part of Irma.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Jane, the more intelligent of the two, acts as narrator, introducing a series of incidents in which Irma\u2019s stupidity creates situations extremely embarrassing to one or both girls. Jane, however, is totally incapable of coping with the dilemmas posed by Irma\u2019s antics. With helpless fascination, Jane watches the unfolding of each new near-catastrophe. Inevitably, in the most improbable and unexpected manner, each situation turns out for the benefit of all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Irma is a confirmed 1 \u2018 one-man girl. \u2019 \u2019 Her boy friend, \u25a0 Al, a smooth talking phony, is the third principal character in the show. Al, with his schemes, frequently does as much or more than Irma to create the uncomfortable situations to which the characters are subjected. Jane also is a \u201cone-man girl,\u201d very much in love with her socialite businessman employer, Richard Rhinelander III. Richard is frequently the baffled victim of Irma\u2019s stupidity and Al\u2019s machinations. Minor characters include an avaricious landlady, a burlesque violinist, Richard\u2019s mother, and a succession of startlingly unconventional neighboring tenants and friends of Al.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Kurlan contends that his complaint tenders issues of fact with respect to access, originality, similarity and copying and that the trial court erred iu deciding these issues upon demurrer. He further claims that each count of his complaint is well pleaded and that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend. The 1947 \u201cprocedural\u201d amendment to section 426(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, he says, was not intended to prevent jury trials upon the merits and did not change the \u201csubstantive\u201d rule of law that issues of fact shall not be determined upon demurrer or motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Another point urged by Kurlan is that the first four counts of his complaint, based upon express and implied contract, state causes of action which cannot be governed by the principles applicable to the tort action of plagiarism. As to the fifth count, he declares that the cause of action will lie for deliberate taking of his idea and format although no literary property is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>The defendants contend that, under section 426(3), upon demurrer, the court must examine the alleged infringed and infringing productions and determine whether Kurlan\u2019s production is legally proteetible property and whether there is any substantial evidence of similarity with respect to such property. In determining the issue of originality, they argue, the court should apply the doctrine of judicial notice. They also contend that the complaint shows upon its1 face that the literary content of Kurlan\u2019s program previously has been published and is, therefore, a part of the public domain. Because no legally proteetible material was used by them, they say, the demurrers to each cause of action were properly sustained. In addition, as to the. counts upon express and implied-in-fact contract, the defendants assert that the alleged agreement is within the statute of frauds and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\">The preliminary question here, as in <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, su,pra, </em>is: To what actions does section 426(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure apply f Kurlan\u2019s counsel does not raise this point in his briefs. However, it appears from the record that the order requiring compliance with section 426(3) was entered over his objection and after argument concerning the question. The general rule is \u201cthat ordinarily where a party has neglected to present a point in his brief he may be precluded from insisting that the court consider the point when deciding the case. . . . However, we know of no hard-and-fast rule which prohibits the court from considering and deciding points of law which may not have been urged and argued in the briefs originally filed if it appears to the court that an important legal principle is necessarily involved in the newly discovered point and that a proper disposition of the case requires a discussion and decision of that point.\u201d <em>(Schubert </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>193 Cal. 291, 294 [223 P. 550]; <em>Philbrook </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>195 Cal. 95, 105 [231 P. 739].)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">In <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, supra, </em>it is held that the statute applies not only to a tort action for plagiarism but also to causes of action for infringement of related contract rights. Therefore, the order of the trial court making the records of both radio programs a part of the complaint affects all five alleged causes of action and a comparison of the productions must be made in considering each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Kurlan contends that the statute cannot and does not deprive him of his right to a jury trial of issues of fact with respect to access, originality, similarity and copying. As held in <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, supra, </em>the statute provides a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>method for considering the alleged infringed and infringing productions upon demurrer. This in no way deprives a plaintiff of his right to a jury trial. If, from a comparison of the productions, a question of fact is shown to exist, the cause should be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The defendants argue that the court may take judicial notice of the contents of published books and plays and of former and contemporary radio programs in determining whether Kurlan\u2019s claim of originality is well founded. For the reasons stated in the Weitzenkorn case, the court cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">However, Kurland has alleged facts which negative originality as to the major portion of his production. He states that \u201cMy Sister Eileen\u201d featuring the characters \u201cRuth\u201d and \u201cEileen\u201d and \u201cdepicting unique characterizations and relationships between said characters\u201d was originated, created and written by Ruth MeKenney for the \u201cNew Yorker Magazine.\u201d The audition recording which Kurlan has attached to his complaint also states that the story has been published in books. According to the recording, \u201cMillions of people have read the Ruth and Eileen stories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">At the time Kurlan\u2019s cause of action arose, section 983 of the Civil Code declared: \u201cIf the owner of a product of the mind intentionally makes it public, a copy or reproduction may be made public by any person, without responsibility to the owner, so far as the law of this state is concerned.\u201d Section 980 of the same code, as then in effect, provided that, \u201cThe author of any product of the mind, . . . has an exclusive ownership therein, and in the representation or expression thereof, which continues so long as the product and the representations or expressions thereof made by him remain in his possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Kurlan\u2019s complaint shows that any property interest which MeKenney may have had in either the story or characters of \u201cMy Sister Eileen\u201d has been lost by publication. According to the pleader, neither the product of MeKenney\u2019s mind nor its representations or expressions remain in her possession. Therefore, as a matter of law, there is no protectible property in the \u201cbasic dramatic core\u201d of the story, its characters and their relationships, or the form and manner of its expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">It is suggested, however, that MeKenney retained the right to use the characters \u201cRuth\u201d and \u201cEileen\u201d in sequels to the original stories. The implication is that no one else could acquire this right. But even if we assume that eharacteriza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>!tions may be protectible, these characters were products of the mind which intentionally had been made public. Under the circumstances, there was nothing to prevent McKenney or anyone else from utilizing them in other productions.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\">The program incorporated in the complaint declares that it features \u201cthe further adventures of Ruth and Eileen.\u201d Therefore, we must assume for the purposes of the demurrers that the story is a sequel to, and not a reproduction of, McKenney\u2019s literary creation, which is not before the court and the contents of which we cannot judicially notice. Even though the dramatic core of Kurlan\u2019s production, together with its two principal characters, their relationships, and its locale, are unoriginal under the allegations of the pleading, neither its style and manner of expression nor its minor characters can be held, upon demurrer, to lack originality as a matter of law. <em>(Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In addition to his allegation that he created an \u201coriginal untitled radio program,\u201d Kurlan claims to have \u201cdevised a new and original radio program idea\u201d for which he \u201coriginated, created and devised . . . new program techniques and methods of radio presentation . . . including a new radio production format.\u201d In that regard, this case is similar to <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 653 [221 P.2d 73, 23 A.L.R.2d 216] , and <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>99 Cal.App.2d 56 [221 P.2d 108], where the claimed protectible property was a \u201cradio program idea\u201d rather than the traditional conception of \u201cliterary property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">(Under the rules stated and applied in deciding those cases, for Kurlan to have a protectible interest in his radio program idea as reduced to a production format, he must establish both originality and novelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">I Kurlan\u2019s radio program idea was to capitalize upon a famous I and successful story, play and motion picture by producing | it on the radio. The court may take judicial notice of the | fact that there is nothing new and novel in this idea which | might constitute protectible property. <em>(Stanley </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra, </em>p. 663.) Whether there is any originality or novelty in Kurlan\u2019s \u201cnew program techniques and methods of radio presentation\u201d is more difficult to determine. There is nothing novel about customary broadcasting techniques, but the court cannot have judicial knowledge of all of the methods of the highly complicated radio industry. It might be possible for Kurlan to show that he created something novel in the way of program techniques and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>methods of presentation. Because extrinic evidence is required | to prove whether there is any element of novelty in his program techniques, it cannot be determined upon demurrer, that there is no protectible property in them. Insofar as the I question of a lack of originality or novelty may be involved | in each cause of action, the demurrers could not properly have been sustained solely upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The next question for decision is that of similarity. Access and inclination to copy being admitted by the demurrer, then if it may be said that some substantial similarity between the programs reasonably could be found, the issues of similarity and of copying are to be determined by the trier of fact. Having both programs before it upon demurrer in accordance with section 426(3), the court may determine whether there is substantial similarity between them. <em>(Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, supra.) </em>If, as a matter of law, there is no such similarity, then there is no question of fact and the demurrers to each count of the complaint were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In order for the fifth count of the complaint to state a cause of action for plagiarism, there must be some substantial similarity between the defendants\u2019 radio program and protectible portions of Kurlan\u2019s production. <em>(Weitzenkorn </em>v <em>Lesser, supra.) </em>Even if it might be found that there is some! originality in the development of minor characters which j Kurlan may have added to McKenney\u2019s story for the purposes I of the radio program, there is no similarity between them and I characters in the defendants\u2019 program. Nor is there any simi-1 larity between the two shows as to the form and manner of | expression of their literary content. However, some similarity I might be found in the methods of program presentation and 1 radio techniques. Because evidence may tend to prove that Kurlan\u2019s program format was both original and novel, the demurrers to the fifth cause of action were improperly sus- 1 tained. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The defendants strike directly at the heart of Kurlan\u2019s other claims by asserting that the complaint charges only the breach of an express, or an implied-in-fact, contract to pay for a \u201cnew and original\u201d radio program, if used. They argue that, both from the allegations of the complaint and from the audition program itself, it appears, as a matter of law, that the program is neither original nor novel. Therefore, they say, no cause of action is stated upon an express or implied-in-fact contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>However, as previously stated, it cannot be determined upon demurrer in the absence of evidence of previously published works that there is nothing original in the literary content of the program or that the radio production techniques \u201e utilized lack novelty. Nor may the complaint be construed so narrowly as suggested by the defendants. In substance, it alleges that Kurlan created a new and original radio program which he submitted to the defendants in return for their promise, express or implied, to pay \u201cthe reasonable value thereof\u201d if they used it. Although Kurlan has described his production as a new and original program, he does not allege that he represented it to the defendants as such. Also, there is no allegation that the agreement was conditioned upon Kurlan\u2019s production\u2019s being new and original. The pleading allows Kurlan to present evidence, if there be such, tending to prove a promise, express or implied in fact, to pay for the use of his program whether or not it is original.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\">For this reason, and in accordance with the rule stated in <em>Weitsenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, supra, </em>the question of protectibility need not be considered in determining the sufficiency of the allegations of the first count of the complaint, based upon A express contract. Kurlan may be able to present evidence [jshowing some similarity between the program techniques. I \u00a1In addition, although there is no similarity between proteetibie portions of the literary content of Kurlan\u2019s program and jthe defendants\u2019 broadcasts, there is the possibility of finding Isome similarity in the use by each production of a \u201cdumb\u201d character who produces difficult situations for a \u201csmart\u201d ' character, both being girls who share an apartment in New York City. The terms of the contract and the content of the programs present questions of fact for the jury as to the contractual provisions, access, similarity, and copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">1 ' However, the defendants argue that, even if the cause of action upon express contract otherwise is well pleaded, the demurrers to it properly were sustained because the complaint shows on its face that the contract is within the bar of the statute of frauds. Even if it be assumed that the transaction alleged might be said to be a sale of \u201cgoods\u201d within section 1624a of the Civil Code, the complaint, upon its face, does not show the bar of the statute. A transaction is removed from the statute by acceptance of part of the goods received. \u201cThere is an acceptance of goods . . . when the buyer, either before or after delivery of the goods, expresses by words or conduct his assent to becoming the owner of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>specific goods.\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 1624a[3].) Kurlan alleges facts from which access, copying and use conceivably could be found. If such findings were made, acceptance of at least a portion of the goods received would be proved and the statute would constitute no bar to the action.  Under the circumstances, the facts pleaded in the first count are sufficient to state a cause of action and the demurrers thereto were improperly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"> The second and third counts of the complaint are based upon the common count of <em>quantum, valebant </em>and are sufficient to state a cause of action upon either a contract implied in fact or one implied in law. <em>(Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, </em>supra.) As stated in the Weitzenkorn case, \u2018 \u2018 Although it is unnecessary for the pleading to distinguish between the contract implied in fact and the contract implied in law, or quasi contract, the elements which must be proved for recovery upon each of them are quite different. \u2019 \u2019 Here, it might be possible for Kurlan to recover upon either a contract implied in fact or one implied in law. Under the first theory, the required proof is essentially the same as that for the count upon express contract, with the exception that conduct, rather than words of promise, must be proved from which the promise may be implied.

He alleges that they made use of his program by producing \u201cMy Friend Irma,\u201d and that either under the terms of an express or implied contract, or by virtue of piracy of his literary property, he is entitled to recover damages for such use. The majority opinion holds that he has stated causes of action both for breach of contract and for plagiarism. Since in my opinion plaintiff has not alleged facts, which if proved, would establish infringement of his literary property, I cannot agree with the latter holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">I Plaintiff\u2019s program may be divided into three elements. 1 There is the raw material consisting of the two principal characters, the basic relaJuJnship between them, and the locale of their adventures. Since this material was taken from the j published works of Ruth McKenney, it could in no event con- ,, stitute protectible literary property under the law of this state. : (Civ. Code, \u00a7 983.) Accordingly, it is unnecessary to decide \u00a1 whether it constituted merely some of the basic' ideas embodied j in the program, or would, had it not been previously published, | constitute a sufficient development and treatment of basic ; ideas to be the subject of copyright protection. (See <em>Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O. Pictures, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 690, 701 [221 P.2d 95], dissent, and cases and authorities there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Using McKenney\u2019s material, plaintiff produced his sample program in which he presented one adventure of the two sisters. Although he cannot claim copyright protection under the law of this state for McKenney\u2019s material or for the ideas he may have added to it, he is entitled to protection for any original treatment and development he has given to such 1 maienZPuSRURME^T^agreA'TOthlTIie holding of the court, however, that insofar as the dramatic content of the sample 1 program is concerned, there is no similarity between plaintiff\u2019s j original contributions and defendants\u2019 program. Such similar- ' ity as does exist in this respect arises only from the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>use of the basic dramatic situation found in the MeKenney works, and accordingly, will not support a finding of piracy. <em>(Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O. Pictures, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 690, 695-696 [221 P.2d 95].)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The third element of plaintiff\u2019s program is its basic plan as distinct from the specific episode or adventure presented'asTa sample or illustration thereof. The plan or format consists of a combination of the following ideas: the use of the Mc-Kenney material as the basis for a serialized radio program ; the use of first person narration by the intelligent sister to set the stage and bridge the gaps between the scenes in each program; and the use of the principal characters to carry over listener interest from week to week. It may be assumed that this combination of ideas was original with plaintiff. Moreover, although there is nothing new or novel about any one of these ideas, it may be assumed that they had not been combined in the same manner in any earlier radio'program. It does not follow, however, that this combination of ideas constitutes protectible intellectual property. The basic program plan adopted as the foundation for a radio serial is analogous to the basic dramatic core or plot of a play or movie. It consists only of the author\u2019s general ideas as distinct from his original treatment or development of them. Such general ideas are free and cannot constitute property. (See <em>Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O. Pictures, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 690, 701 [221 P.2d 95], dissent; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 653, 672 [221 P.2d 73, 23 A.L.R.2d 216], dissent.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, ante, </em>p. 778 [256 P.2d 947], the court holds that since the 1947 amendment to Civil Code, section 980, ideas, as distinct from the original form and manner of their expression, 'do not constitute literary property in this state. It justifies the protection against plagiarism that was given to the basic dramatic core of plaintiffs\u2019 play in <em>Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O. Pictures, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 690 [221 P.2d 95], and to the radio program idea in <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 653 [221 P.2d 73, 23 A.L.R.2d 216], on the ground that &lt;rin its earlier form, the statute expressly protected both the idea, the \u2018product of the mind,\u2019 <em>and </em>\u2018the representation or expression thereof.\u2019 \u201d Since in the present case the cause of action arose before the statute was amended, the court follows the Stanley and Golding cases in treating plaintiff\u2019s radio program idea as protectible literary property.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>As it was originally enacted, Civil Code, section 980<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, referred generally to \u201cany product of the mind,\u201d and then listed the different types of intellectual property that might exist. Among those listed was \u201ca composition in letters or art,\u201d and protection was extended not only to the product itself, that is, to the composition in letters or art, but also to any representation or expression thereof. Thus protection was not limited to the exact literary composition created by the author, but extended to other and different representations and expressions that might be copied therefrom. Under its terms, however, the protection existed only so long 11 as the product and the representation or expression thereof\u201d remained in the author\u2019s possession. It was thus arguable that the common law copyrights in a literary composition might be lost by a transfer of possession of-the manuscript even without actual publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\">In 1947 the statute was amended to deal specifically with compositions in letters or art,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the provisions relating to other forms of intellectual property and the limitation with respect to possession were deleted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus the amendment made clear that the author\u2019s common law copyrights in a composition in letters or art are not dependent upon possession of the composition or its expression or representation, but are only lost in the event of publication as provided in section 983 of the Civil Code. The statute now deals expressly with copyrights as distinct from rights of possession or ownership of the original manuscript itself. (Cf., Civ. Code, \u00a7 985.) Neither before nor after its 1947 amendment, however, did section 980 purport to define the extent to which property rights might exist in original ideas as distinct from their treatment and development. An expression or representation of an original composition might consist only in the statement ; of the general outline of the dramatic core or plot of a play I or movie, or in the statement of a general plan for a radio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>program. <em>(Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O. Pictures, Inc., supra; Stanley </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra.) </em>Thus, if the Golding and Stanley eases were correctly decided, protection could be extended to the basic dramatic core of a play or the plan of a radio program under the present statute just j as it was in those cases under the former. i</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">g</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In my opinion, however, the court properly accepted the concession of the parties in the Stanley case that sections 980 and 983, as formerly worded, were but codifications of the common law. The 1947 amendments to those sections, which antedated the decisions in the Stanley and Golding cases, merely clarified this fact by eliminating the language that might have been interpreted as making the duration of common law copyrights turn on possession rather than publication. Accordingly, the common law rule that ideas are not property, which the court now recognizes <em>(Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, ante, </em>p. 778 [256 P.2d 947]), should be applied in this case by holding that plaintiff has not stated a cause of action for plagiarism.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">From a comparison of the two programs it cannot be said as a matter of law that defendants have not used plaintiff\u2019s radio program idea. Although that idea is not property, it may be protected by an express or an implied-in-faet con- , tract. <em>(Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, ante, </em>p. 778 [256 P.2d 947]<em>; Stanley </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 653, 674 [221 P.2d 73, 23 A.L.R.2d 216]; dissent.)

It also shows that the stories had never been presented on the air and that by written agreement plaintiff\u2019s assignor had expressly reserved the sole and exclusive right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>to use for radio broadcasting purposes these leading female characters. \u201cThe owner of the common-law copyright has a perpetual right of property and the exclusive right of first general publication, and may, prior thereto, enjoy the benefit of a restricted publication without forfeiture of the right of general publication. Thus, he may communicate the contents of his work under restrictions without forfeiture of the right. <em>This communication </em>of <em>contents under restriction, is known as a restricted or limited publication.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; <em>Bobbs-Merrill Co. </em>v. <em>Straus, </em>147 F. 15, 18.) \u201cA limited publication of a subject of copyright is one which communicates a knowledge of its contents under conditions expressly or impliedly precluding its dedication to the public. <em>Abernethy </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>3 L.J.Ch. 209; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Pitman, </em>26 L.R.Ch.Div. 374; <em>Caird </em>v. <em>Sime, </em>12 L.R.App.Cas. 326; <em>Tomkins </em>v. <em>Halleck, </em>133 Mass. 32, 43 Am.Rep. 480; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>De Witt, </em>47 N.Y. 532, 7 Am.Rep. 480; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>10 Ir.Ch.

(Crowe </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>Fed.Cas. 3441; <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Clark, 5 </em>Robertson (28 N.Y.

Consequently a special public use of it by the author for his own benefit is no evidence of abandonment of his property therein, because such a use is entirely consistent with his exclusive right to its control. Thus, the reading, recital or stage representation of a manuscript play in public for profit, with the consent of the author, does not constitute any evidence of abandonment to the public of any rights arising from the authorship of the play; nor does it deprive him of his right to copyright the play. <em>(Boucicault </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>3 Fed.Cas. 977.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>\u201cA ticket of admission merely entitles the holder to witness and enjoy a single exhibition of the play, without conferring upon any member of the public the right to obtain surreptitiously the possession of the original manuscript for subsequent representation for profit, or to reproduce the composition from memory or from notes taken during the performance, in order to share in the earnings of its public presentation. <em>If the author of a play were not entitled to claim, the protection of the lam to secure to him, the profits resulting from, public performances of his composition, dramatists would soon cease to write pla/ys for the amusement and entertainment of the public, unless subsidised by government or aided by primate patronage: for the revenue derived from the sale of published copies of a popular drama would be negligible in comparison with the box-office receipts.

Section 1(b) of the 1909 Copyright Act expressly confers upon the copyright proprietor the exclusive right to transform the work by translation, dramatization, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>adaptation, and by making other versions embodying material and substantial parts of the original in order to enable the author to reap the profits of his work in every field of intellectual property in which it can be exploited advantageously by vending copies or by public performance for profit <em>(O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>General Film Co., </em>157 N.Y.S. 1028). This section has been literally construed by the courts to cover any adaptation of a literary work which tells the same story as the original, whether the resulting drama be adapted for presentation in the form of a stage play or for exhibition on the screen <em>(Kalem Co. </em>v. <em>Harper Bros, </em>222 U.S. 55 [56 L.Ed. 92, Ann.Cas. 1913A 1285]; <em>International Film S.

It is alleged in the complaint here that on or about the 11th day of March, 1946, Ruth MeKenney and plaintiff entered into an agreement in writing, |wherein Ruth MeKenney did grant to plaintiff the sole and exclusive right to use for radio broadcasting purposes the \u00a1leading female characters created by her and featured or I portrayed in \u201csaid stories, stage play and motion picture \u00cd entitled <em>\u2018My Sister Eileen,\u2019 </em>and said Ruth MeKenney did ; furthermore grant to said plaintiff Arthur Kurlan all radio <em>j </em>broadcasting rights therein and thereto <em>which had theretofore </em>i <em>been expressly reserved by said Ruth MeKenney in eonnec- </em>! <em>tion with each and all of said prior licenses and uses of said characters in connection with said stories, play and motion </em>I <em>picture hereinbefore mentioned.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It is further alleged that after the expiration of the original term of the agreement the time was extended by the parties, Ruth MeKenney and plaintiff; that Ruth MeKenney reserved and retained the right to receive royalties in connection with the production of any and all radio programs licensed under the f agreement. Hence, plaintiff\u2019s assignor reserved all radio rights in the two leading characters, and it cannot be true, as is stated in the majority opinion, that \u201cas a matter of law, there is no protectible property in the \u2018basic dramatic core\u2019 of the story, its characters and their relationships, or the form and manner of its expression \u2019 \u2019 because there has been a publication. The allegations of the complaint show that the , publication was a limited one with certain rights reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">It has been recognized that different types of rights may be reserved in literary works and that publication may be restricted so as to preserve those rights.

The majority says, however, that the two leading characters involved were unoriginal and unworthy of protection inasmuch as any property right in them had been lost by publication. As I have heretofore stated, it is my opinion that the publication was a limited one, with the radio rights expressly reserved and that there was a protectible property interest involved. The statute reads, for our purposes, as it did when this court decided <em>Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O. Pictures, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 690 [221 P.2d 95], wherein a basic, dramatic core with one important dramatic figure was held to constitute a protectible interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Characters and characterizations which are products of the mind~s7\u00fc\u00f1tM be held to be protectible property interests. The radJoTmdustry is a large one, and radio programs are fre\"qUeStly-based upon a \u00a1single character, personality or characterization. To illustrate the extremely valuable theatrical-radio properties which are in existence one only must look as far as the radio column in his daily paper to note the pYdgrams,\" \"built Around a single character, or family, which continue from day to day, week to \"week, and year to year.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It should be apparent to even the least intelligent that these programs are as valuable as the most gilt-edged security listed on the Stock Exchange.

It is sur\u00e9ly a subject'of judicial notice that Calif ornials-t']ie center of the motion picture industry of the world and if its laws are inadequate for the protection of the individual creative writer who must find a market for his work, then those laws should be amended. It is axiomatic that the movie.industry could not exist without_the writer and yet, if the present trend^confemes, \"the\"writer will vanish from'the scene. The i same is true~of the radio industry. A writer submits his work . to either industry in the hope and rightful expectation that l if his work is used, he will be paid its value, but, under pres-l ently existing conditions, and court decisions, these industries l may make minor \u25a0 changes in the play, or manuscript, and (escape liability and any obligation to pay any consideration \u00a1therefor.

That statement is \u201c Hurlan\u2019s radio program idea was to capitalize upon a famous and successful story, play and motion picture by producing it on the radio. The court may take judicial notice of the fact that there, is nothing new and novel in' this idea which might constitute , protectible property. \u201d We said there that there was \u201cnothing new in a play broadcast over the air.\u201d There is nothing new in a play broadcast over the air, but there is something new in a play broadcast by someone else over the air for the first time <em>if </em>the author of that play has reserved the radio rights [thereto, because the play is being used in a medium new to it. The Stanley case was not concerned with the broadcasting rights in a play; it was concerned with a combination of ideas which was being used for the first time in a certain way and the originator of that combination of ideas, with the permission of the author of the new play, was suing the broadcasting system.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Section 426(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure now provides that the copy of the production as to which the infringement is claimed and a copy of the alleged infringing produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>tion must be attached to the complaint. This permits the trial court, upon demurrer, to decide in the first instance whether or not there is similarity between the two productions. Heretofore, the question of similarity has been considered to be one of fact <em>(Stanley </em>v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 653 [221 P.2d 73, 23 A.L.R.2d 216]; <em>Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O.

There should be no change in the test to be used under the new code section. It should still be that of the reasonable man. In other words, <em>if reasonable minds could differ as to whether or not there is similarity between the two works, then the question is still one of fact for the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">In the play \u201cMy Sister Eileen,\u201d Ruth, as narrator, is a young, attractive, intelligent working girl who is the unwilling victim of a succession of difficulties created by her sister, Eileen, with whom she lives because \u201capartments are hard to find in New York.\u201d Ruth is the balancewheel for her completely thoughtless, impulsive, scatterbrained sister, Eileen. Eileen is hopelessly unable to hold a job and has had six of them within four months. She has no financial sense and never has any money because she spends every cent she has on \u201cjunk\u201d which everybody seems to be able to sell her. She uses the common exchequer and family funds without Ruth\u2019s knowledge or consent and makes life unbearable for Ruth with her scatterbrained schemes; embarrasses Ruth by ridiculous lies told without malice or intent to creat mischief but with every desire to help her sister and roommate. Ruth and Eileen are from Ohio. Ruth has acquired some city \u201csophistication\u201d while Eileen has not and remains completely naive. Ruth\u2019s supposed fianc\u00e9, Claude, is described as a blustering \u201cbraggart,\u201d but she is in love with a serious, intelligent businessman, Lloyd Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Jane, in the radio production \u201cMy Friend Irma,\u201d as narrator, is a serious, intelligent working girl from Wyoming who has acquired a certain amount of city \u201csophistication.\u201d She lives with her \u201cfriend Irma\u201d because apartments are \u201chard t.o find these days.\u201d Jane is in love with a serious, intelligent businessman, Richard Rhinelander III. Irma is gay, careless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>impulsive, thoughtless and completely lacking in sophistication ; she causes Jane endless difficulties because of her scatterbrained schemes. Irma\u2019s boy friend, Al, is described as a \u201cphony windbag.\u201d In this program, as in the play \u201cMy Sister Eileen\u201d there is an eccentric landlady.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\">In conjunction with the similarities just set forth, attention is called to the summary of the two productions as set forth in the majority opinion. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that there is no similarity between the two. The briefs show that in describing the radio program entitled \u201cMy Friend Irma,\u201d the New York Herald-Tribune, on March 22, 1948, stated in a dramatic criticism and review of the program: \u201cThe <em>central idea, </em>that of two young girl roommates, one bright, the other one almost intolerably innocent of all knowledge, was <em>taken almost intact from a very funny play entitled \u2018My Sister Eileen.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The question of ' similarity between the two productions is most assuredly one on which reasonable minds might differ as can be seen from the above quoted dramatic review and the fact that three justices of the District Court of Appeal (see (Cal.App.) 233 P.2d 936) as well as myself feel that within the common knowledge of the average reader, observer, spectator or listener there are sufficient similarities to induce the belief that copying ' has taken place. It is true that there are differences between 1 the two programs, but as Mr. Justice Edmonds said in the Golding case \u201csuch differences go to the quality of the plagiarism, and not to its existence or nonexistence.\u201d <em>(Golding </em>v. <em>R.K.O. Pictures, Inc., </em>35 Cal.2d 690, 699 [221 P.2d 95].)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">No test other than the reasonable minds one has ever been laid down for determining the question of similarity between the alleged infringed and infringing productions and there is no reason why, in determining the matter upon a demurrer, the trial court should apply any other rule. As I read the majority opinion in this case and in that of <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, ante, </em>p. 778 [256 P.2d 947] (this day filed) I do not find that any test has been proposed other than that of \u201csubstantial similarity.\u201d In <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, supra, </em>it is said \u201cif some substantial similarity between the compositions reasonably could be found, the issues of similarity and of copying are to be determined by the trier of the fact\u201d and in the instant case it is said that \u201cIf, from a comparison of the productions, a question of fact is shown to exist, the cause should be submitted to the jury.\u201d In my opinion, these statements are not the equivalent of saying that the question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>one for the jury if reasonable minds could differ on whether or not the two productions are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">I would reverse the judgment with directions to the trial court to overrule the demurrer as to all counts and permit defendants to answer if they be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied May 28, 1953. \u2022 Carter, J., and Spence, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\"> Sherlock Holmes; The Thin Man; The Fat Man; Michael Shane; Count of Monte Cristo; Crime Doctor; The Whistler; Mr. District Attorney; A Date with Judy; Adventures of Bulldog Drummond; Adventures of Ellery Queen; Adventures of the Falcon; Jack Armstrong; Blondie; Captain Midnight; The Lone Banger; Stella Dallas; Ma Perkins; The Great Gildersleeve; Perry Mason; Superman; Young Dr. Malone; The Cisco Kid; Fibber McGee and Molly; Mr. and Mrs. North; One Man\u2019s Family; The Aldrich Family; Amos \u2019n\u2019 Andy; Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy; Bums and Allen; and many others.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
