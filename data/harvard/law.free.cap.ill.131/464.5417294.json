Redemption\u2014by judgment creditor\u2014question of his right\u2014waiver, by acceptance. It matters not whether a party has the right to redeem from a sheriff\u2019s sale of land as a judgment creditor or not, if the purchaser at such sale accepts the redemption money. Such acceptance terminates all the rights of the purchaser to the land, and no one else can question the validity of the redemption.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-17\" pgmap=\"464(36) 465(74)\">2. Specific performance\u2014agreement by judgment creditor to redeem \u2014and to reconvey to debtor. Where a party whose land has been sold on execution, gives his note to a creditor for a sum in excess of his indebtedness, and confesses judgment on the note, and furnishes the money necessary to redeem from the sheriff\u2019s sale, under an agreement that the creditor shall redeem the land and acquire the title thereto, and, on payment of the sum due him, with costs, reconvey the land to the debtor, and there is no intention to defraud any creditors, the creditor, on performance by the debtor, will be compelled to specifically perform the agreement.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">3.

Starr, a judgment creditor of hers, redeemed from that sale, Bronson accepting the redemption money. The sheriff thereupon sold the lands, under Starr\u2019s execution, to Samuel Dunavan. An agreement was then made between plaintiff in error and defendant in error, whereby the latter was to execute to him her promissory note for $3800, confess judgment thereon, and furnish him with the money necessary to redeem from the sale to Dunavan, and he was to redeem from the sale, have the lands sold on execution, on his judgment, bid them in, and take deed therefor and hold it until she paid him, and as security for what she owed him, which was some amount, not then adjusted, less than the amount of the promissory note she was to give him, and upon her making such payment he was to convey the lands to her. Defendant in error executed the promissory note, confessed the judgment thereon, and furnished plaintiff in error the money with which to redeem from the sale to Dunavan, as she thus agreed she would. Plaintiff in error redeemed from the sale to Dunavan, had the lands sold on an execution on his judgment, and took a deed therefor.</p> <p id=\"b467-5\" pgmap=\"467\">There is conflict in the evidence, but we agree with the circuit court that the preponderance warrants the conclusion that the facts are as just stated. We are also of the opinion that the preponderance of the evidence shows that defendant in error had, after the making of this agreement, and before the filing of her bill, paid plaintiff in error all that she owed him. Upon these facts, we are clearly of the opinion that plaintiff in error is not justified in his refusal to convey the lands to defendant in error, and transfer to her the promissory note executed for the rent thereof, which he holds, and that the decree of the circuit court directing him to make such conveyance and transfer is right.</p> <p id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467(173) 468(33)\">It is unnecessary to consider whether either Starr or plaintiff in error was entitled, as a matter of legal right, to redeem when they did so. Bronson and Dunavan, respectively, accepted the money they paid; as redemption money, and this terminated their several rights as purchasers of the lands. (Meyer v. Mintonye, 106 Ill. 414; Massey v. Westcott et al. 40 id. 160.) No one else is entitled to question whether redemption was effected. It is not pretended that defendant in error had plaintiff in error to take and hold the title to the lands to defraud creditors, and no reason is therefore apparent why she might not have him take and hold the title in the way it was agreed that he should, in order that she might regain her lands and at the same time secure him in what she owed him. When a title to real estate is taken as a security for the payment of money, it is a mortgage, and it is always competent to prove that a deed, absolute on its face, is, in fact, hut a mortgage.
