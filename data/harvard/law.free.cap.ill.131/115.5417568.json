De Haven, executrix of the last will and testament of Joseph DeHaven, deceased, was made a defendant, and she answered, and also filed a cross-bill. Among other things, she alleged in her cross-bill, \u201cthat said Francis T. Sherman was, on or about the 25th day of January, 1875, duly adjudicated a bankrupt, in the District Court of the United States for. the Northern District of Illinois, under and in pursuance to the provisions of the Bankrupt act of the United States then in force; that said Sherman afterwards conveyed to the register in bankruptcy all his estate of every kind, including his right to have and receive all annuities and moneys provided for him in said will, then due or thereafter to become due and payable to him; that thereafter, on or about the 19th day of February, 1875, Samuel B. Walker was duly appointed assignee in bankruptcy of the estate of said Francis T. Sherman; that on February 20, 1875, said register conveyed to said assignee all the estate, title and interest which said Sherman had conveyed, as aforesaid, to said register; that said assignee, on November 12,1875, conveyed, under order of court, by deed of that date, to Hugh A. White, all said estate, title and interest; that on February 23,1876, White conveyed said estate, title and interest and rights to Joseph E. DeHaven, all of which will more fully appear from proceedings and records of court and said conveyances; that by virtue of said Bankrupt law, the said proceed&amp;gs and said conveyances, the said Joseph E. DeHaven, on the date of the conveyance to him, became the owner of all the estate and interest in and to said Sherman House property which said Francis T. Sherman had or was entitled to have at the time of said adjudication in said court, and vested with the right and title to have and receive from said trustee, at the times and in the manner provided in said will, all moneys and annuities provided in said will to be paid to said Francis T. Sherman, and which, at the time of said adjudication, were due and unpaid to said Sherman, or which might thereafter become due and payable to him according to the provisions of said will; that Joseph E. DeHaven died on December 2, 1879, still owning the said estate, rights and interests conveyed to him as aforesaid, leaving a will, by which your oratrix was appointed sole executrix, and in which will the testator conveyed all his real and personal estate for certain trust purposes; that the will has been duly probated, and letters testamentary issued to your oratrix on or about February 6, 188 , and that your oratrix has since said last date been, and yet is, such executrix and trustee, and as such has succeeded to all the estate, right and interest formerly held, as aforesaid, by said Francis T. Sherman, and that as such she is now entitled to have and receive from the trustee, under the will of said Francis 0. Sherman, all moneys and annuities which were provided in said will to be paid, as aforesaid, to said Francis T. Sherman, the same as said Francis T. Sherman might have done had he not been adjudicated bankrupt, as aforesaid; that neither Francis T. Sherman, Joseph E. DeHaven nor your oratrix has received any payment on account of said annuities.\u201d The cross-bill concludes with a prayer that a decree be entered declaring the complainant therein to be entitled to payment of her said claims, and requiring said trustee to pay her the amount found due, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-5\" pgmap=\"120\">Francis T. Sherman answered the cross-bill, admitting his bankruptcy, but denying -that any interest in the Sherman House property, or the amounts to be pdid to him out of \u2022 the rents thereof by the trustee of the estate of Francis C. Sherman, passed by the sale and conveyance of his assignee in bankruptcy to Hugh A. White, or by the sale and conveyance of Hugh A. White to De Haven.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-6\" pgmap=\"120\">On hearing, the circuit court found and decreed as follows: \u201cAnd the court, after argument by counsel, and being fully advised in the premises, doth find, from the evidence, that the said complainant has not acquired any title to or interest in .the moneys which said defendant, Francis T. Sherman, might be entitled to demand and receive from the trustee under the provisions of the will of his father, Francis G. Sherman, deceased, out of the rents and profits of the property known as the Sherman House property, being lots seven (7) and eight (8), in block thirty-four (34), in the original town of Chicago, by said will devised to Joshua L. Marsh, as trustee. And it is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court, that said cross-bill and amended cross-bills be and the same are hereby dismissed for want of equity.\u201d From that decree Augusta W. De Haven appeals to this court, and assigns errors questioning its correctness.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-7\" pgmap=\"120\">Messrs.

(12th ed.) 595, *496. They are simply annuities, to be paid from the annual rents contemplated to accrue from the leasing of the Sherman House. 1 Broom &amp; Hadley\u2019s Com. (Ward\u2019s notes,) 459, *55; 1 Thomas\u2019 Coke, 352, *144 b; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. (12th ed.) 595. It could not have been intended by the testator that the payment of these annuities are a charge against the copus of the estate, because that might have defeated the power expressly given to the trustee to borrow money to rebuild, and secure the loan by mortgage on the property, and his expressed intention that his trustee \u201cshall have, hold and manage the Sherman House property entire and undivided,\u201d and appropriate the rents, issues and profits in the manner therein before directed, during the natural life of his wife and children, and until the death of the survivor of them. The rule is, that unless it appears it was intended by the testator to charge the payment of the annuities upon the corpus of the estate, they can only be enforced against the trustee, personally, so far as he has received the rents. The-fee in the realty, whether for life or for years, can not be sold for their payment. (Irwin v. Wollpert, 128 Ill. 527; Delaney v. Van Aulen, 84 N. Y. 16; Nudd v. Powers, 136 Mass. 276; Baker v. Baker, 6 H. L. 616.) Whatever, therefore, may, in other respects, be the effect of the deed of assignment of Francis T. Sherman, the deed of the assignee in bankruptcy to Hugh A. White, and the deed of Hugh A. White to De Haven, it is impossible that they can have the effect of passing a freehold in the Sherman House property to De Haven. It hence follows, that under the 89th section of the Practice act (2 Starr &amp; Curtis, 1842,) the appeal should have been to the Appellate Court for the First District, instead of to this court.</p> <p id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">The appeal is accordingly dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs, and leave is given to her, if she shall so desire, to withdraw record, abstracts and briefs, for the purpose of filing them in the Appellate Court.
