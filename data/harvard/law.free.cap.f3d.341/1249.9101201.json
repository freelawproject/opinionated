(\u201cGalactic\u201d), a motor vehicle towing operator, filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of certain sections of Defendant City of Miami Beach\u2019s (\u201cCity\u201d) Municipal Code regulating motor vehicle towing. The district court denied Galactic\u2019s requested relief and granted summary judgment in favor of the City. The principal issue in this case is whether the City\u2019s regulations fall within the public safety exception to the preemption contained in The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act (\u201cICCTA\u201d), as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A). After <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that the City\u2019s challenged motor vehicle towing regulations fall within the public safety exception to ICCTA, as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>City of Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv., Inc., </em>536 U.S. 424, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 153 L.Ed.2d 430 (2002), and thus escape federal preemption. <em>See Galactic Towing, Inc. v. City of Miami Beach, </em>\u2014 F.Supp.2d -(S.D.Fla. Mar. 25, 2003)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-17\">Section 14501(c) of ICCTA, as amended, preempts provisions by a \u201cState [or] political subdivision of a State ... related to a price, route, or service of any motor vehicle carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c) (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ICCTA, however, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>vides an exception to this general federal preemption, directing that it \u201cshall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">In <em>Ours Garage, </em>a similar vehicle towing case, the Supreme Court recently interpreted the preemptive force of \u00a7 14501(c) of ICCTA. The Court first noted that although \u00a7 14501(c) generally preempts state regulation of the \u201cprice, route, or service of any motor carrier,\u201d the statutory exception to this preemption for \u201csafety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles\u201d saves both state and municipal regulations falling within its reach from federal preemption. <em>Ours Garage, </em>536 U.S. at 428, 122 S.Ct. 2226. The Court reasoned that \u201cCongress\u2019 clear purpose in \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States\u2019 economic authority over motor carriers of property, \u00a7 14501(c)(1), \u2018not restrict\u2019 the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 122 S.Ct. 2226. As such, the Court stated that any local regulation of \u201cprices, routes, or services of tow trucks that is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garners no .exemption from \u00a7 14501(c)(l)\u2019s preemption rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 122 S.Ct. 2226. The Court expressed no opinion as to the scope of local regulations that are indeed \u201cgenuinely responsive\u201d to public safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Galactic makes essentially three arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">1. <em>Whether the Ordinance is Genuinely Related to Safety.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-14\">Galactic argues that the district court erred by ruling that the challenged sections of the City\u2019s vehicle towing ordinance fall within \u00a7 14501(e)(2)(A)\u2019s public safety exception because the record fails to support a finding that the ordinance is \u201cgenuinely responsive\u201d to safety concerns, as required by <em>Ours Garage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-15\">Galactic contends that certain sections of the City\u2019s non-consensual towing ordinance, embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 106-264 (towing permit), 106-266 (business application requirement), 106-268(a)(l) (written authorization for tow), and 106-268(a)(5) (storage within city \u25a0 limits) are not genuinely responsive to the City\u2019s safety concerns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>The district court carefully considered the challenged sections of the City\u2019s vehicle towing ordinance, identifying and discussing analogous towing ordinances where courts held them to fall under the purview of \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A). <em>See Galactic Towing, Inc. v. City of Miami Beach, </em>\u2014 F.Supp.2d -, (S.D.Fla. Mar. 25, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">The record supports the district court\u2019s ruling that the challenged sections of the City\u2019s ordinance are \u201cgenuinely responsive\u201d to public safety concerns. Several analogous cases have upheld similar city ordinances. The Fifth Circuit, on remand from the Supreme Court subsequent to its <em>Ours Garage </em>decision, recently denied a tow truck company\u2019s preemption challenge to a similar city ordinance regulating vehicle towing, holding that the ordinance fell under the purview of \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A)\u2019s public safety exception. <em>See Cole v. City of Dallas, </em>314 F.3d 730 (5th Cir.2002) (regulation requiring criminal history included within safety exception). Likewise, a Washington appellate court recently upheld a similar preemption challenge under \u00a7 14501(c). <em>See Fife Enterprises v. Washington State Patrol, </em>113 Wash.App. 1011 (Wash.App.2002) (unpub.) (licensing and record keeping requirements exempt under safety exception); <em>see also Ace Auto Body &amp; Towing, Ltd. v. City of New York, </em>171 F.3d 765 (2d Cir.1999) (towing ordinance requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>licensing, display of information, reporting, record keeping, disclosure of criminal history, insurance, posting of bond by towing companies, and maintaining local storage and repair facilities, fell within the safety exception); <em>Hott v. City of San Jose, </em>92 F.Supp.2d 996 (N.D.Cal.2000) (holding that regulations requiring liability insurance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>criminal background check, displaying of information, reporting, and record keeping were all within scope of safety exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">The district court did not err in holding the challenged sections of the City\u2019s vehicle ordinance to fall under the purview of the \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A)\u2019s public safety exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">2. <em>Proof of Legislative Intent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">Galactic argues that, because the City offered \u201cno direct proof\u2019 of the City\u2019s legislative intent in the implementation of the challenged ordinances, the district court erroneously granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">There is direct evidence of the City\u2019s legislative intent in the implementation of the challenged ordinances to support the district court\u2019s grant of the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The text of the challenged ordinance specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArO\">The city commission finds and determines that the unauthorized parking of vehicles that cannot be removed constitutes a public nuisance and public emergency effecting the property, public safety and welfare of the citizens and residents of the city.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">Miami Beach Code \u00a7 106-257. The text of the ordinance itself therefore expressly articulates a public safety purpose. Furthermore, the City offered affidavits from two City officials, the Assistant City Manager and the Assistant Chief of Police. Both affidavits contained relevant information on how the challenged sections of the City\u2019s vehicle towing ordinance affect <em>safety concerns. </em>Although Galactic had the opportunity to refute those affidavits in the district court, it failed to do so. Instead, it rested on its pleadings. <em>See Valdivieso v. Atlas Air, Inc., </em>305 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe non-moving party, however, may not rest on mere allegations or denials of the adverse party\u2019s pleading when a motion for summary judgment is made and supported by affidavits ....\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">3. <em>Failure to Strike Affidavits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">Galactic argues the district court abused its discretion by denying Galactic\u2019s motion to strike affidavits from two City officials because they consisted of \u201copinions, mere speculation, and fabricated claims.\u201d There was no abuse of discretion by denying Galactic\u2019s motion to strike these affidavits and admitting the same. <em>See Telfair v. First Union Mortgage Corp., </em>216 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir.2000) (no abuse of discretion in denying motion to strike affidavits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1278-11\">.
