The parties agree that the Council consists of private-sector business leaders from the three countries, that it includes at least one sub-group made up exclusively of U.S.based delegates, and that the Department of Commerce has \u201cmet with the [Council] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>and the U.S. component periodically.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. 6-7; Appellant\u2019s Br. 7-9. Judicial Watch argues that the Council and its constitutive entities are \u201cadvisory committees\u201d within the meaning of FACA, 5 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 3(2). By way of relief, it sought a declaration that defendants had breached a number of FACA\u2019s requirements concerning past meetings of the Council; injunctions curing some of those violations and ensuring full FACA compliance for future meetings; and a writ of mandamus compelling similar conduct. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 A-E.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Commerce moved to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), arguing that Judicial Watch lacked standing and had failed to state a claim. The district court found a want of standing, accepting the government\u2019s argument that, because the Department didn\u2019t <em>control </em>the Council, Judicial Watch\u2019s injuries were neither caused by Commerce nor redressable in a suit solely against Commerce and the Secretary. <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>576 F.Supp.2d 172, 178 (D.D.C.2008). Judicial Watch appealed; we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">To satisfy the constitutional standing requirement, familiar doctrine requires a plaintiff to allege an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and that will likely be redressed by a favorable decision on the merits. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). When the district court has resolved no factual disputes in a ease, we review a dismissal for lack of standing de novo. <em>Muir v. Navy Fed. Credit Union, </em>529 F.3d 1100, 1105 (D.C.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Here the injury requirement is obviously met. In the context of a FACA claim, an agency\u2019s refusal to disclose information that the act requires be revealed constitutes a sufficient injury. <em>Public Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>491 U.S. 440, 449-50, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989); <em>Byrd v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>174 F.3d 239, 243 (D.C.Cir. 1999). The principal dispute, then, concerns causation and redressability, with Commerce relying, as it successfully did before the district court, on its lack of control over the Council and its U.S. component sub-groups. Appellees\u2019 Br. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Given the duties FACA prescribes for government agencies, Commerce\u2019s lack of control over others is of no consequence. We assume, as we must at the pleading stage, that for purposes of standing the Council and its assorted subgroups are, as alleged, \u201cadvisory committees\u201d within the meaning of FACA \u00a7 3(2). See <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Muir, </em>529 F.3d at 1105. If that proves correct, Commerce is subject to an array of FACA obligations concerning the Council and its sub-groups that are entirely within its power to discharge. Cf. <em>Public Citizen, </em>491 U.S. at 450- 51, 109 S.Ct. 2558 (finding standing requirements satisfied in a FACA case concerning an alleged advisory committee, the American Bar Association, wholly free of the relevant cabinet department\u2019s control). These include Commerce\u2019s duty under 5 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 10(b) to make available for public inspection transcripts or minutes of meetings of the Council or its U.S. subgroups. Commerce attended some of these in the past, Appellees\u2019 Br. 7, and could therefore itself generate minutes if the Council refused to cooperate or if extant minutes were incomplete. Looking to the future, the court could order that Commerce conduct any prospective encounters between itself and the Council \u2014 including those alleged to take place \u201ctwo to three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>times per year,\u201d Compl. \u00b621 \u2014 in compliance with FACA\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">At argument, government counsel suggested, for the first time, that Judicial Watch\u2019s requests for records under \u00a7 10(b) were effectively moot because Commerce had responded to certain of Judicial Watch\u2019s requests under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. Recording of Oral Argument, 16:58-18:15 (Sept. 21, 2009). Even granting the factual predicate, the legal conclusion does not follow. The scope of FOIA\u2019s document disclosure requirements is in a number of respects narrower than FACA\u2019s analogous requirements. FOIA, for example, applies only to existing records, <em>Students Against Genocide v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>257 F.3d 828, 837 (D.C.Cir.2001), and exempts materials manifesting an agency\u2019s deliberative processes, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5); <em>Public Citizen, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>111 F.3d 168, 170 (D.C.Cir.1997), while FACA is not so limited, see, e.g., 5 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 10(c) (requiring the creation of minutes for advisory committee meetings).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">As Judicial Watch has standing to pursue its FACA claim, and the merits remain an open question, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
