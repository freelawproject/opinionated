Faris, III, met an undercover Tallahassee Police Department investigator who posed as \u201cStephanie,\u201d the mother of two fictitious minor girls, in an internet chatroom called \u201cOpen Minded Parents.\u201d Faris identified himself as a fifty-three year old man from Tallahassee, Florida. In their first chat, he stated his interest in, among other things, young girls and boys. Stephanie responded that she loved her daughters and that she liked watching.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In their second chat, Faris asked Stephanie detailed sexual questions about her daughters. He later arranged by telephone to personally meet Stephanie and her daughters. Stephanie provided him with an address, and, when he arrived, he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Faris\u2019 apartment was lawfully searched on the day following his arrest, resulting in the seizure of a computer containing 20-30 images of minors engaged in sexual activity. Faris was subsequently charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), which prohibits possessing child pornography that has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce; and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), which prohibits using a facility of interstate commerce to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity. He pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and was convicted after a jury trial of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Faris appeals both his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) and his 292-month sentence. He argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and by applying a two-level \u201cundue influence\u201d enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B). For the reasons that follow, we affirm both his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">I. Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Faris argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), as applied here, violates both the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Section 2422(b) prohibits using any means of interstate commerce to knowingly persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in \u201cany sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense ....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). We address Faris\u2019 arguments in turn, applying <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (\u201cWe review the constitutionality of statutes <em>de novo.\u201d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">\n<em>A. Commerce Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Faris concedes that his internet communications were routed through Virginia. Nonetheless, he argues that the statute, as applied here, violates the Commerce Clause because his internet communications, telephone calls, e-mails, and travel routes were confined within Florida state lines and did not otherwise affect interstate commerce. This argument is merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">The Commerce Clause provides Congress with the power \u201c[t]o regulate commerce ... among the several states ----\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. \u201cThe Commerce Clause power is plenary.\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.2004). It includes the power to regulate and protect the \u201cinstrumentalities of interstate commerce,\u201d even when the targeted \u201cthreat may come only from intrastate activities.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 558, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 1629, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). It also includes prohibiting the use of commercial instrumentalities for harmful purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>even if the targeted harm \u201coccurs outside the flow of commerce\u201d and \u201cis purely local.\u201d <em>United States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218, 1226 (11th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The internet is \u201can instrumentality of interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d at 1311. Congress \u201chas the power to regulate the internet\u201d and \u201cto prohibit its use for harmful or immoral purposes regardless of whether those purposes would have a primarily intrastate impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCongress may reach and prohibit the use of a telephone or the internet to set up the sexual abuse of children through intermediaries .... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Faris\u2019 Commerce Clause argument fails for two reasons. First, our precedent forecloses it. We have held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) does not exceed Congress\u2019 commerce power. <em>Homaday, </em>392 F.3d at 1310-11. Second, Faris\u2019 argument is inconsistent. He concedes that his internet communications crossed state boundaries but asserts that Congress cannot regulate those interstate communications. Even if none of Faris\u2019 communications were routed over state lines, the internet and telephone he used to contact the undercover officer were still \u201cinstrumentalities of interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. at 1629; <em>Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d at 1226. Therefore, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) does not, as applied here, violate the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">\n<em>B. Necessary and Proper Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Faris argues that it is inadequate to invoke the Necessary and Proper Clause to confer authority for the prosecution against him. The Necessary and Proper Clause states that \u201cCongress shall have power ... [t]o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers .... \u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18. Faris asserts that it is not necessary and proper for Congress to regulate every wholly intrastate activity that involves using a telephone or computer since the Tenth Amendment delegates that responsibility to the states. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">In a case involving the production and possession of child pornography, \u201cwe h[e]ld that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s authority pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause to effectuate Congress\u2019s power to regulate commerce among the several states.\u201d <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>446 F.3d 1210, 1219 (11th Cir.2006). In so holding, we affirmed the principle that \u201cCongress [has] substantial leeway to regulate purely intrastate activity (whether economic or not) that it deems to have the capability, in the aggregate, of frustrating the broader regulation of interstate economic activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Faris\u2019 use of the internet, an instrumentality of commerce, is sufficient to satisfy 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b)\u2019s interstate commerce element even if he did not use it for economic purposes. Since Congress may prohibit the use of an instrumentality of commerce for harmful purposes, <em>Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d at 1226, the prosecution against Faris is not inconsistent with the Necessary and Proper Clause. And because \u00a7 2422(b) does not, as applied to Faris, violate either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause, the district court did not err by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">II. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Faris argues that the district court erred by applying U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B)\u2019s two-level enhancement. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts de <em>novo </em>and all factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citation omitted) (italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The guidelines provide a two-level sentence enhancement if \u201ca participant ... unduly influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct .... \u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B). A \u201cminor\u201d can be \u201can undercover law enforcement officer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of 18 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G1.3 cmt. n.l(C). \u201cIn determining whether subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, the court should closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant\u2019s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor\u2019s behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G1.3 cmt. n.3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Faris attempts to distinguish his case from <em>United States v. Root, </em>296 F.3d 1222, 1233 (11th Cir.2002), where we held that \u201can undercover officer playing the role of a minor victim qualifies as a victim, thereby making an actual victim unnecessary.\u201d Faris argues that, unlike the defendant in <em>Root, </em>he communicated only with an adult intermediary and not directly with the minor victims, and that he did not use superior resources in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">To be sure, <em>Root </em>involved a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B)(ii), not \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B)(ii). But both provisions, using identical language, provide an enhancement when the defendant \u201cunduly influenced the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct .... \u201d <em>Compare </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B)(ii) <em>with </em>\u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, <em>Root </em>applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">We have rejected the very argument that Faris raises to distinguish his case from <em>Root. </em>In <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283 (11th Cir.2004), the defendant, like Faris, appealed his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). <em>Id. </em>at 1284. The defendant tried to distinguish <em>Root </em>by noting that he communicated with an adult intermediary, not directly with a minor. <em>See id. </em>at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">We found that distinction \u201c[irjrelevant to the disposition of the charges .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1286. \u201c[N]ot[ing] that the efficacy of \u00a7 2422(b) would be eviscerated if a defendant could circumvent the statute simply by employing an intermediary to carry out his intended objective\u201d and \u201cfinding] ... direct communication with a minor or supposed minor ... unnecessary under the text of \u00a7 2422(b),\u201d we held that the defendant violated the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1287-88. And \u201c[bjecause the Sentencing Commission specifically provided that undercover officers are \u2018victims\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2G1.1, we deduce[d] that the enhancement is directed at the defendant\u2019s intent, rather than any actual harm caused to a genuine victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289. Thus, we found \u201cno difference between an undercover officer victim and a fictitious victim\u201d and \u201cthe enhancement applicable] whether the minor \u2018victim\u2019 is real, fictitious, or an undercover officer.\u201d <em>Id. Murrell </em>forecloses Faris\u2019 distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Similarly, our precedent forecloses Far-is\u2019 argument that he did not use superior resources to communicate with the adult intermediary. Like the defendant in <em>United States v. Vance, </em>494 F.3d 985 (11th Cir.2007), Faris \u201cused his knowledge of computers and the internet to contact [a person] whom he believed would supply minors for sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 996. Faris notes that he merely used his home computer to communicate with the intermediary. His knowledge of computers and the internet, however, qualifies as a \u201csuperior resource[].\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err by applying \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B)\u2019s two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Finally, Faris suggests that we overrule <em>Root </em>en banc. He notes that two other circuits have rejected our reasoning in <em>Root. </em>The Seventh Circuit criticized <em>Root </em>by suggesting that the <em>Root </em>majority \u201cignored the clear language of the commentary requiring a court to closely consider the voluntariness of the victim\u2019s behavior.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>353 F.3d 552, 561 (7th Cir.2003). Declining to follow <em>Root, </em>the <em>Mitchell </em>court held that a defendant cannot \u201cunduly influence!] a minor ... in the case of an attempt where the victim is an undercover police officer .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The Sixth Circuit has taken a third position. It characterized the <em>Root </em>approach as a defendant-focused inquiry and the <em>Mitchell </em>approach as a victim-focused inquiry. <em>United States v. Chriswell, </em>401 F.3d 459, 468 (6th Cir.2005). The Sixth Circuit shares the Seventh Circuit\u2019s concern that the <em>Root </em>approach inadequately considers \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s actions compromised the voluntariness of the victim\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The Sixth Circuit asserts, however, that \u201cthe <em>Mitchell </em>rationale sweeps unnecessarily broadly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe <em>Mitchell </em>court\u2019s reasoning,\u201d according to the Sixth Circuit, \u201ceffectively makes it impossible to apply \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) in any case of attempt, regardless of whether the victim is an actual child or an undercover agent.\u201d Id. Finding neither the Root nor <em>Mitchell </em>approach fully satisfactory, the Sixth Circuit \u201ch[e]ld that \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) is not applicable in cases where the victim is an undercover agent representing himself to be a child under the age of sixteen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The Sentencing Commission has addressed the circuit split by proposing Amendment 7 to the Guidelines. Unless Congress acts otherwise, Amendment 7 will take effect on November 1, 2009. Amendment 7 would provide in the Commentary to \u00a7\u00a7 2A3.2 and 2G1.3 that the undue influence enhancement \u201cdoes not apply in a case in which the only \u2018minor\u2019 ... involved in the offense is an undercover law enforcement officer.\u201d Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines (May 1, 2009), at 27-28, http://www.ussc.gov/2009 guid/20090501_Reader_Friendly_ Amendments.pdf. It would also provide in the Commentary to both sections \u201cthat \u2018[t]he voluntariness of the minor\u2019s behavior may be compromised without prohibited sexual conduct occurring.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Although Amendment 7 would resolve the circuit split against our precedent, it has no legal force until Congress adopts it. \u201cThe law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). In light of <em>Root </em>and its progeny, we must conclude that the district court did not err by applying \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">We affirm Faris\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
