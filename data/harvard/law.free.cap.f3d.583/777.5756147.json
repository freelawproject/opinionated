BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">The City of Albany, Georgia, employed John Ross Juneau as the Safety Chief at the Southwest Georgia Regional Airport, a position that required Mr. Juneau to be a law enforcement officer certified by the State of Georgia. In addition to his employment as the airport Safety Chief, Mr. Juneau also worked part time as a security guard for Dillard\u2019s, Inc., a department store located in the Albany Mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">On March 2, 2003, while working at Dillard\u2019s, Mr. Juneau noticed two people who he believed were shoplifting. As Mr. Juneau approached the suspects, they began to flee, and a chase on foot ensued. After chasing the suspects out of the store and across the Albany Mall parking lot, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Juneau caught one suspect and brought him to an interview room at Dillard\u2019s for interrogation. After sitting down, Mr. Juneau slumped over in his chair and lost consciousness. Mr. Juneau was taken to a hospital, but he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving there.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Mr. Juneau\u2019s death certificate lists his cause of death as \u201c[complications of coronary atherosclerotic disease ... in a background of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\u201d An autopsy was performed by Dr. Anthony Clark, the same doctor who completed the death certificate; Dr. Clark\u2019s autopsy report listed the same cause of death as the death certificate and stated that \u201cno evidence of significant recent or remote traumatic injuries\u201d was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">After Mr. Juneau\u2019s death, his wife and children applied to the Georgia State Indemnification Commission, which ultimately held that, because Mr. Juneau had died in the line of duty, his estate should receive benefits from the State of Georgia. Key in the Georgia State Indemnification Commission\u2019s decision was an opinion from the Georgia Attorney General considering whether \u201can off-duty law enforcement officer [who] is working as a security guard and [who] dies from a heart attack pursuing shoplifters\u201d could be said to have died \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The Claimants also applied to the BJA for benefits under the PSOB Act, which provides a one-time cash payment to survivors of \u201ca public safety officer [who] has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a). In October 2004, the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits (PSOB) Office denied this claim on two grounds: (1) Mr. Juneau was serving as a private security guard rather than as a public safety officer at the time of his death, and (2) Mr. Juneau\u2019s death was not the result of a traumatic injury. On the latter point, the PSOB Office relied on the decision of this court\u2019s predecessor in <em>Smykowski v. United States, </em>227 Ct.Cl. 284, 647 F.2d 1103 (1981), to find that Mr. Juneau\u2019s death, resulting from \u201ca chronic, congenital, or progressive disease or other condition,\u201d was not a death resulting from a \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d as that term is used in the PSOB Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">In February 2005, Claimants appealed the initial determination to a hearing officer. The hearing officer heard testimony from Mr. Juneau\u2019s wife and from employees of Dillard\u2019s and the Southwest Georgia Regional Airport. He also received documentary evidence from Dr. Clark, who had performed the autopsy on Mr. Juneau; Dr. Laurence T. Crimmins, Mr. Juneau\u2019s family physician; and two physicians from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Dr. Dzuy Nguyen and Dr. Craig Mallak. Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Mallak agreed with Dr. Clark that \u201cMr. Juneau died from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a natural process.\u201d Dr. Crimmins, though, argued that he believed that Mr. Juneau \u201cdied as a result of trauma, specifically the trauma to his body caused by the chase and apprehension of the shoplifting suspect in the minutes before his collapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">In March 2007, the hearing officer reversed the October 2004 determination, finding both that \u201cthe physical nature of the lengthy chase ... as well as the energy exerted while chasing the suspect ... were substantial factors contributing to John Ross Juneau\u2019s death\u201d and that, \u201cwhen Mr. Juneau exited the doors of Dillard\u2019s, he was acting within the scope of his duties as a State of Georgia law enforcement officer, not as a security guard.\u201d Having thus disposed of both problems found in the initial determination, the hearing officer held that Mr. Juneau\u2019s survivors were \u201celigible for coverage under the [PSOB] Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>In October 2008, the director of the BJA reviewed the hearing officer\u2019s decision. The director agreed with the hearing officer that Mr. Juneau was a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the PSOB Act, but the director reversed the hearing officer\u2019s determination that Mr. Juneau died as a result of an \u201cinjury,\u201d as that term is used in the PSOB Act. Because the director\u2019s finding that Mr. Juneau did not die as the result of an injury required denial of benefits, the director did not make any finding regarding whether Mr. Juneau was acting in the line of duty at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Claimants have appealed the director\u2019s final decision that Mr. Juneau did not die as a result of an \u201cinjury,\u201d as that term is used in the PSOB Act. This court has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 appeal under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796C-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Our review of a denial of benefits under the PSOB Act by the BJA is limited to three inquiries: \u201c(1) whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations; (2) whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the government officials involved; and (3) whether substantial evidence supports the decision denying the claim.\u201d <em>Amber-Messiek v. United States, </em>483 F.3d 1316, 1321 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The BJA has promulgated regulations implementing the requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a) that it pay a benefit of $250,000 to survivors of any public safety officer who \u201cdie[s] as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\u201d Among Claimants\u2019 arguments is that, in determining that Mr. Juneau did not die of an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of the PSOB Act, the BJA improperly applied versions of its regulations that were not promulgated until after Claimants filed their claim. In particular, Claimants argue that the BJA should have applied the versions of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4, providing that \u201cany reasonable doubt arising from the circumstances of the officer\u2019s death\u201d should be resolved \u201cin favor of payment of the death ... benefit,\u201d and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5, providing that the BJA should \u201cgive substantial weight to the evidence and findings of fact presented by State, local, and Federal administrative and investigative agencies,\u201d that were in effect in 2004, rather than applying the versions of these regulations presently in effect, which do not contain these provisions. Chiefly, Claimants believe that, had the BJA applied the 2004 version of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5 to give \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to the findings of the Georgia State Indemnification Commission, the BJA could not have then found, as it did, that Mr. Juneau\u2019s death was anything other than the result of an \u201cinjury.\u201d Claimants also suggest that, had the BJA applied the 2004 version of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4 to resolve reasonable doubt in Claimants\u2019 favor, the disagreement between Mr. Juneau\u2019s family physician and the three pathologists who presented opinions on the cause of Mr. Juneau\u2019s death would have been resolved by agreeing with Dr. Crimmins that the trauma experienced by Mr. Juneau constituted an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of the PSOB Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">We disagree on both counts. First, the findings of the Georgia State Indemnification Commission were irrelevant to the BJA\u2019s decision regarding whether or not Mr. Juneau suffered an \u201cinjury.\u201d The Georgia State Indemnification Commission focused entirely on the question of whether Mr. Juneau died in the line of duty, no surprise given that the relevant Georgia statute contains no requirement that an officer have died as the result of an \u201cinju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ry,\u201d but rather only a requirement that the officer have been \u201ckilled in the line of duty.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 45-9-82(a)(l). Thus, the state agency made no findings relevant to any issue other than whether Mr. Juneau died in the line of duty, an issue not presented by this appeal. Regardless of whether Claimants are correct that the 2004 version of the BJA regulations should have been used instead of the present version, the outcome of the BJA\u2019s analysis would have been identical either way. Given the irrelevance of this issue to the appeal, the Court need not reach the question of which version of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5 should have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">A similar problem exists with respect to Claimants\u2019 argument that the BJA should have applied the 2004 version of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4. Even if Claimants were correct, the old version of the regulation merely required that the BJA resolve \u201creasonable\u201d doubt in Claimants\u2019 favor. Given that two pathologists appointed by the BJA agreed with the pathologist who performed the autopsy on Mr. Juneau that Mr. Juneau did not suffer any traumatic injury, the testimony of Mr. Juneau\u2019s family physician \u2014 who had not seen Mr. Juneau for two years before his death \u2014 that Mr. Juneau experienced trauma is not sufficient in our view to create reasonable doubt about whether that trauma was the result of an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of the PSOB Act. Given the lack of reasonable doubt, even application of the 2004 version of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4 would not have required the BJA to adopt the findings of Dr. Crimmins. Again, then, the Court need not reach the question of which version of the regulations should have been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">This leaves only the issue of whether the bodily condition that killed Mr. Juneau, which counsel for the BJA characterize as a \u201cheart attack\u201d and which Claimants refer to as a \u201ctraumatized condition of the body\u201d caused by the body being in \u201ca hypoxic state,\u201d constitutes an \u201cinjury,\u201d as that term is defined in the regulations promulgated by the BJA to implement the PSOB Act. Once again we are faced with a change in the language of the regulations. Both the 2004 version and the present version of the regulations provide a definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d but, as with the other regulations discussed above, it makes no difference which version of the regulations we apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The present version of the PSOB regulations provides definitions at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.3 and defines the term \u201cinjury\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxZL\">a traumatic physical wound (or a traumatized physical condition of the body) directly and proximately caused by external force (such as bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects, or physical blows), chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious disease, radiation, virii [sic], or bacteria, but does not include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-9\">(1) Any occupational disease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-10\">(2) Any condition of the body caused or occasioned by stress or strain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.3 (2009). The 2004 version of the regulations provides a definition of \u201cinjury\u201d at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(e) as \u201cany traumatic injury, as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such an injury, but not occupational diseases.\u201d The 2004 regulations further define \u201ctraumatic injury\u201d as \u201ca wound or a condition of the body caused by external force, including injuries inflicted by bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other physical blows, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious diseases, radiation, and bacteria, but excluding stress and strain.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g). Thus, the 2004 regulations can be synthesized to provide a definition of injury as \u201cany [wound or condition of the body caused by external <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>force, including injuries inflicted by bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other physical blows, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious diseases, radiation, and bacteria, but excluding stress and strain], as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such [a wound or condition of the body], but not occupational diseases.\u201d But for the addition in the present regulation of wounds or bodily conditions caused by viruses, this definition is essentially identical to that presently in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Here, we agree with the BJA that Mr. Juneau\u2019s death was not caused by an \u201cinjury\u201d falling within this definition. There is no dispute that Mr. Juneau\u2019s chasing the shoplifting suspects on foot gave rise to a traumatic condition that, given his \u201ccoronary atherosclerotic disease\u201d and \u201cinsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,\u201d caused his heart to fail. But a traumatic condition, even one caused by actions taken in the line of duty as a law enforcement officer, is not sufficient to warrant payment of benefits under the PSOB Act. The traumatic condition must also be caused by an injury, and such was not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Among other things, both the 2004 definition and the present definition have in common that conditions caused by \u201cstress or strain\u201d are excluded from the definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d even if those conditions can be characterized as \u201ctraumatic.\u201d Here, Mr. Juneau\u2019s traumatic bodily condition was caused by the stress and strain occasioned by his chasing the shoplifting suspects out of Dillard\u2019s and across the mall parking lot, physically apprehending one suspect, and bringing that suspect back into the department store for interrogation. This conclusion is supported by all four physicians who presented opinions to the BJA. Dr. Clark, who performed the autopsy, stated that Mr. Juneau\u2019s death was natural and a result of \u201ccomplications of coronary artery disease in a background of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,\u201d and he found \u201cno evidence of significant recent or remote traumatic injuries.\u201d Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Mallak, who were asked by the BJA to answer the question of whether Mr. Juneau\u2019s death could be \u201cattributed to the direct or proximate result of the traumatic injury he sustained in the line of duty,\u201d answered that \u201c[t]here was no evidence of a traumatic injury\u201d and that death could be expected for someone with \u201csevere atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ... when the heart is subjected to increased oxygen demand such as strenuous work.\u201d Finally, even Dr. Crimmins, Mr. Juneau\u2019s own physician, stated only that Mr. Juneau \u201cdied as a result of trauma ... caused by the chase and apprehension of the shoplifting suspect in the minutes before his collapse,\u201d providing no opinion regarding any injury that Mr. Juneau sustained that might have caused the trauma. Given this consistent medical evidence, we cannot say that the BJA\u2019s decision fails the requirement that it be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Amber-Messick, </em>483 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Claimants argue that, merely because Mr. Juneau died from a \u201ctraumatic condition of the body\u201d that was \u201cdirectly attributable [to] the events\u201d following Mr. Juneau\u2019s detection of the alleged shoplifting at Dillard\u2019s, his death satisfies the injury requirement of the PSOB Act. This ignores the portion of the definition that lays out the causes of traumatic bodily conditions that render those conditions \u201cinjuries\u201d under the PSOB Act. The definition limits these causes to \u201cexternal force (such as bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects, or physical blows), chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious disease, radiation, [viruses], or bacteria.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.3 (2009). None of these causes was present in Mr. Juneau\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>case; the record shows no evidence of Mr. Juneau\u2019s having been shot, stabbed, hit, involved in an explosion, exposed to chemicals, electricity, or unusually adverse climatic conditions, infected with any disease-causing agent, or subjected to radiation. Instead, the record amply demonstrates, as the BJA held, that Mr. Juneau\u2019s traumatic bodily condition stemmed directly from the stress and strain of chasing and apprehending the shoplifting suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">To avoid this conclusion, Claimants argue that this case is factually similar to that presented to the Court of Federal Claims in <em>Bice v. United States, </em>72 Fed.Cl. 432 (2006), in which the court awarded PSOB benefits to a firefighter who died of a heart attack a little more than one month after having been exposed to heavy smoke while fighting a forest fire. Claimants suggest that here, Mr. Juneau\u2019s death is attributable to what happened to him on the job, just as Ms. Bice\u2019s death was attributable to the smoke she inhaled in <em>Bice. </em>But this misses the point. In <em>Bice, </em>the issue was whether the firefighter\u2019s death was attributable to her smoke inhalation, or whether it was instead attributable solely to her pre-existing heart disease. 72 Fed.Cl. at 436. There was no issue regarding whether there was an appropriate injury that occurred in the line of duty, only whether that injury was actually the cause of the firefighter\u2019s death. <em>Id.; see also Bice v. United States, </em>61 Fed.Cl. 420, 430-31 (2004) (decision predating remand to the BJA, finding that smoke inhalation constitutes a traumatic injury, because smoke is a climatic condition). Here, we encounter precisely the opposite scenario: there is no dispute that Mr. Juneau\u2019s death was caused by activities he performed in chasing down the shoplifting suspects, but there is a question whether he suffered any \u201cinjury\u201d in the course of those activities that entitles his survivors to benefits. We answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The situation here is factually most similar to that in <em>Smykowski, </em>in which this court\u2019s predecessor found no benefits payable where a police officer died of a heart attack after he entered a house in which a suspect was hiding, found the suspect, and struggled with the suspect for a few minutes. 647 F.2d at 1106. The Court of Claims noted that it could not \u201caccept ... that physical struggle represents a form of traumatic injury.... At most, a physical struggle can serve as the occasion for the sustaining of injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Mr. Juneau in this case chased and apprehended a suspect. Just as our predecessor court found it difficult to accept that a struggle could be called an injury, we have trouble seeing how a foot chase can be called an injury. Thus, we agree with the BJA that Mr. Juneau did not die as a result of the type of \u201cinjury\u201d that is compensable under the PSOB Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">No costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b827-11\">NEWMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AIP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">On May 2, 2003, John Ross Juneau, an airport safety chief, while working as a part-time security guard at a department store, ran after two persons he believed had committed a crime and who were fleeing outside the store, and apprehended one of the suspects. A short time thereafter Mr. Juneau collapsed and died. Mr. Juneau\u2019s surviving family members filed a claim pursuant to the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Act (PSOBA), which provides for payment to beneficiaries when \u201ca public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\u201d 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\u00a7 3796(a). The medical examiner who performed the autopsy stated that the \u201cimmediate precipitating factor contributing to the cause of death was the chase and surrounding events on May 2, 2003.\u201d Mr. Juneau\u2019s family physician stated that \u201cJohn Ross Juneau died as a result of trauma, specifically the trauma to his body caused by the chase and apprehension of the shoplifting suspect in the minutes before his collapse on May 2, 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">A Hearing Officer for the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), Dr. Voncile B. Gowdy, heard live testimony at a hearing and then requested further documentary evidence, including an independent medical evaluation by two physicians from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Dr. Gowdy considered all of the facts and circumstances of Mr. Juneau\u2019s death and concluded that the requirements of the statute were met. Dr. Gowdy remarked that there were discrepancies between the medical evaluation he had ordered (which was based solely on documentation of Mr. Juneau\u2019s death) and the medical opinions of the coroner and Mr. Juneau\u2019s family physician (who had personally observed Mr. Juneau\u2019s body). The Hearing Officer applied the BJA\u2019s \u201creasonable doubt\u201d regulation then in effect, to resolve the issue in favor of the claimants. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4 (2004) (\u201cThe Bureau shall resolve any reasonable doubt arising from the circumstances of the officer\u2019s death or permanent and total disability in favor of payment of the death or disability benefit.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Hearing Officer concluded that \u201cthe physical nature of the lengthy chase, coupled with the condition of the weather that was present that day, as well as the energy exerted while chasing the suspect on May 2, 2003 were substantial factors contributing to John Ross Juneau\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The Director of the BJA, reversing the decision of the Hearing Officer, determined that Officer Juneau had suffered no injury, despite his death from heart failure that all agree was caused by his strenuous pursuit and apprehension of an apparent criminal. This is an implausible conclusion, and is not reconcilable with the purpose of the PSOBA. <em>See Demutiis v. United States, </em>48 Fed.Cl. 81, 86 (2000) (\u201cThe PSOBA is likewise remedial in nature and thus should not be applied grudgingly, but rather should be construed liberally to avoid frustration of its beneficial legislative purpose.\u201d); <em>see also Baltimore &amp; Phila. Steamboat Co. v. Norton, </em>284 U.S. 408, 414, 52 S.Ct. 187, 76 L.Ed. 366 (1932) (laws designed to compensate employees for \u201cpersonal injuries and deaths occurring in the course of their work\u201d are \u201cdeemed to be in the public interest and should be construed liberally in furtherance of the purpose for which they were enacted and, if possible, so as to avoid incongruous or harsh results\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The Department of Justice does not dispute that Mr. Juneau was acting \u201cin the line of duty,\u201d as required for benefits under the PSOBA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a). It is also not disputed that Mr. Juneau\u2019s act of running down and apprehending a person he believed had committed a crime was the direct and proximate cause of his death; that is, Mr. Juneau died from the physical trauma induced by the encounter. The Director of the BJA nonetheless found that Mr. Juneau had not been injured in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>the line of duty. The Director apparently ignored or discounted the medical evidence that supported the petitioners\u2019 claim, and did not take account of the reasonable doubt regulation. This was in violation of the BJA regulations that applied to the petitioners\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The terms and purpose of the PSOBA are squarely met on the facts of this case. The public interest served by this law is not in dispute. The Director\u2019s decision, affirmed by my colleagues on this panel, is not the appropriate application of the PSO-BA. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-5\">. The Department of Justice argues in this appeal that a regulatory change in 2006 that removed the reasonable doubt standard had retroactive effect to the 2003 death of Mr. Juneau. That retroactivity argument has been rejected by this court and the Court of Federal Claims, which courts have applied the pre-2006 BJA regulation to claims that accrued before the regulatory change. <em>See Amber-Messick v. United States, </em>483 F.3d 1316, 1325 (Fed.Cir.2007); <em>Winuk v. United States, </em>77 Fed.Cl. 207, 215 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
