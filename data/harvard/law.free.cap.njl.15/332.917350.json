The assignment of the breach is, that he did not pay, in the language of the covenant: there was no necessity of a demand of payment of Hood, and hence no necessity for notice of non-payment. 1 <em>South. R. </em>178, it was the business of the defendants to enquire and ascertain whether the same was paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">The cases arising upon notes and bills of exchange, have no application to this case. The indorser of a promissory note enters into no express contract or guarantee, but the law raises a contract founded upon the law merchant. If due diligence be used, and legal demand and notice given, the indorser is liable. Here the defendants by their contract in writing and under seal, bind themselves for the payment by Hood as stipulated in the condition of the bond, and guarantee such payment. Their liability does not depend upon the principles of mercantile law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The opinion of the court, was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b346-8\">Hornblower, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afz\">I think the demurrer must be overruled. The liability of the defendants was not conditional, but absolute according to the express terms of their covenant. Plaintiffs were not bound to demand payment of the obligor, or to use due diligence as in the case of mercantile securities; hence they were not obliged to give notice of non-payment. Nor is a special request necessary in this case, as in those cases where defendant\u2019s liability is contingent or dependent upon the happening of some event, or upon the doing of something by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
