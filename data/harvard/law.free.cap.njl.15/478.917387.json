We cannot reverse that upon this motion, nor can we command them by our writ, to reverse their own decision and to render another and specific judgment. We know of no remedy for the petitioner, but to make his application <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">\n<em>Buie discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
