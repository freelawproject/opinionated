It came on to be tried upon the merits, and after hearing the evidence and the arguments of counsel, the conrt being equally divided on the question, whether the plaintiff below was entitled to recover; and therefore unable to decide the cause, ordered the appeal to be dismissed. Strader the appellant, having obtained a rule of this court, to show cause why a <em>mandamus </em>should not issue, requiring the Court of Common Pleas to restore the appeal, and proceed to judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-8\"><em>Hamilton, </em>in support of that rule,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnG\">cited <em>Cheesman and al. </em>v.

The court instead of dismissing the appeal, ought to have continued the cause and ordered a re-hearing. The effect of dismissing the appeal was not only to subject the appellant to the payment of costs, but to leave in full force, and thus in effect to affirm a judgment, from which the party had regularly appealed, without any decision on the merits of his case. Under the provisions of our statutes upon this subject, a regular appeal from the judgment of a court for the trial of small causes, effectually suspends, or rather supersedes that judgment; and the Court of Common Pleas must re-try the cause upon the merits, and give such judgment as the court below ought to have given.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Cited in <em>Rodenbury </em>v. <em>Rosebury, </em>4 <em>Zab. </em>493.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
