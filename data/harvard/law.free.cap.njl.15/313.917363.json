THE DEVISEES OF JOHN SINNICKSON.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b323-4\">In the action of covenant for breach of warranty of title to land, the uniform rule is, to allow the consideration money with interest, and costs, and no more.

At the Salem Circuit the parties agreed as to the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages, with certain exceptions, and agreed to submit to the Judges of the Supreme Court at bar, the question, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to receive <em>counsel fees </em>and interest; or anything more than the consideration money, with interest and taxed costs ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-6\"><em>R.

Not content to receive back the consideration money which was the value of the land at the time it was sold, together with six years\u2019 interest to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>countervail his liability for mesne profits, and the costs of eviction, he has been struggling after other allowances, such as for improvements that he has put on the land, the formation of gardens, avenues, parks, palaces and the endless embellishments that taste and luxury can invent; but courts of justice have as firmly resisted all such claims, as being innovations on the common law measure of recompense. I shall not state any of the numerous cases that are to be found on this subject, because they have been collected and reviewed by Chancellor Kent, with his usual ability, in 4 <em>Kent's Com. </em>468, and shall only give the result of them, in his words. \u2014 \u201c The uniform rule is, to allow the consideration money, with interest, and costs, <em>and no more.'' </em>Any counsel fees beyond those allowed in the fee bill, are no part of the legal costs, and are just as much out of the prescribed rule, as buildings or improvements. I am therefore of opinion that counsel fees are not allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Hornblower, C.
