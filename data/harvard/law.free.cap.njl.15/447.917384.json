The following is a copy of the examination of the said William Compton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">\u201cSomerset County, ss. The voluntary examination of <em>William </em>Compton, taken in writing, and upon oath before William D. Stewart and \u2019Squire Terill, two of the Justices of the Peace in the county of Somerset, touching his last legal settlement, as a pauper, and Susannah his wife, on application for relief from the overseers of the township of Warren in the county aforesaid, on oath saith, that about the year 1809, he purchased a farm from Doc. Hugh McEwen and David Ayers, executors, &amp;c. of Nathaniel Ayers, deceased, being a part of said deceased\u2019s farm, of about ninety acres, for which he paid and secured to be paid about twenty-two hundred dollars, and received from the said executors a deed for the same, and took possession accordingly, and resided on the said farm, and in the township of Bernards, about four or five years. Said farm is situated in the township of Bernards in the county of Somerset. He then sold said farm to Daniel Doty, and then moved with his family into a house belonging to Samuel Compton, in the township of Warren in the county of Somerset, and lived there about five or six months, he then moved into a house belonging to Peter Ayres, near the Stone House in the township of Bernards, in Somerset county, and lived there about seven months. Soon after he moved into said house of Peter Ayres, he contracted with Solomon Doughty, for a part of the farm of the late Reuben Compton, deceased,. now owned by Nathaniel Pennington, in the township of Warren in the county of Somerset, of about thirty-five acres, and Solomon Doughty made and executed a deed for said land to Andrews Smally, Esq. trustee, in trust for the said William Compton, the term of his natural life, and from and after his decease, to his wife Susannah, during her widowhood and from and after her inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>marriage, if that should ever happen, then to the use of the children, son and daughter, of the said William Compton and Susannah his wife, and to such other children, as they may have, to the only proper use, benefit and behoof of the said heirs of William Compton and Susannah his wife, and the heirs and assigns of said children forever. The consideration mentioned in the said deed, was one thousand dollars, and the deed bears date May 20th, 1818. In the month of November following, he moved unto said farm, and resided on said farm for about five years, he was then dispossessed of the said premises by the foreclosure of a mortgage given on said land, by Samuel Compton to Jacob Vail, sometime previous to the purchase of the same by the said Andrew Smally, trustee as aforesaid. He then left said premises, and lived since that time in different parts of the township of Warren, until the present time, has purchased no land, has no goods and chattels, is lame and unable to labour, and cannot support himself, and prays relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">From this order of removal thus made by the two Justices, the overseers of the poor of the tOAvnship of Bernards appealed to the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace, in and for the county of Somerset. After the appeal was duly entered, the folloAving testimony additional to the foregoing examination of the said William Compton, was taken by consent of parties, subject to all legal exceptions to be taken on the argument of the cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\"><em>William. </em>Compton, the pauper, being duly sworn, says, \u201c knows the premises in question, he agreed for them with Solomon Doughty.

Andrew Smally, Esq. did not exert any authority over the premises, while I was on them, which was for about six years. Solomon Doughty agreed to pay off the Vail mortgage, witness having assigned to him obligations of one thousand dollars, the full amount of the purchase money; Doughty did not pay off the Vail mortgage. I paid the taxes on the land.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJd\">William Compton, the pauper, in the year 1813, purchased a farm in the township of Warren, of the value of, and for which he paid one thousand dollars. He took possession of the farm, and resided upon it about five years; receiving the rents and profits, and paying the taxes. At the time of the purchase, the property was subject to a mortgage for five hundred dollars, which his vendor was to pay off, and satisfy out of the consideration money, paid by Compton to him. This not being done, Compton was finally turned out of possession, by a suit in Chancery upon that mortgage. If this were the whole of the case, there would be no doubt, upon the authority of <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Pompton, Penn. R. </em>1039, but that Compton acquired a settlement in Warren. The difficulty arises upon another part of the case: which is, that the deed for the farm, was not made to Compton himself; but by his direction, it was made to Andrew Smally, Esq., <em>in trust, </em>for him and his wife, during their joint lives ; and after the death of the survivor of them, to their children in fee. Hence it is argued that Compton, was never so <em>seized, </em>as to entitle him to a settlement in the township of Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The ease of <em>Tewksbury </em>v. <em>Readington, </em>3 <em>Halst. </em>319, does not stand in the way of the plaintiffs in <em>certiorari; </em>for, however strongly the opinion expressed in that case, may have indicated, that nothing less than an absolute title <em>at law, </em>would satisfy the language of our statute; yet it is manifest the court did not intend to conclude the question now presented to us. In that case the pauper had not even an equitable title; he had only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>naked possession; and at most, a <em>mere right </em>in equity, to be substituted in tbe place of Bocker, (tbe man under whom he entered) and to have a conveyance upon fulfilling the conditions, which Bocker was bound to perform according to his contract with Mr. Rutherford, who was the owner in fee. And so far was the court in that case, from deciding, that <em>seizin </em>in equity, or of an equitable estate, was not sufficient, that the Judge who delivered the opinion of the court, expressly said, that, \u201c whenever the case of a <em>cestuy que </em>trust, shall present itself to the court upon <em>express </em>trusts, created in a <em>deed </em>or settlement; affording no uncertainty; where the trustees are a_ mere machinery for the express purpose of protecting him in possession and enjoyment, it will be time enough for the court to give an opinion upon it.\u201d In the cause now before us, we have that very case; Compton, the pauper, was the purchaser of the farm: he paid for it, and had the actual, uncontrolled possession for five years: he resided upon it, enjoyed the profits and paid the taxes. His title to the land, and his . right of possession were complete, and undisputed. Smally was a naked trustee; a <em>mere instrument </em>for protecting him in the enjoyment of, and preserving to him, the estate. Compton was substantially, and truly, the owner of the land, and could not have been removed from it, by Smally himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Was Compton then, so <em>seized of a freehold </em>estate, as to give him a settlement ? I am clearly of opinion that he was, both by the terms of the statute, and upon the soundest principles of law. A <em>cestuy que </em>trust, in possession, is considered, in every respect, as the real owner of the estate: 1 <em>Cruis. Dig. tit. </em>Trust, <em>Sect. </em>4. <em>p. </em>493. To run after the naked legal title, and overlook the actual ownership, declared upon the very face of that title, would be like pursuing the shadow, and leaving the substance behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">It is not necessary to have recourse to English settlement cases for authority upon thispoint; perhaps none, in very terms can b\u00e9 foufid; but many ftiay b\u00e9 cit\u00e9d, which in principle, fully sustain niy vie\\v \u00f3f th\u00e9 subject. By 9 <em>Geo., </em>1 <em>O. </em>7, it is enacted, that n\u00f3 person shall acq'uir\u00e9 \u00e1, s\u00e9ttleni\u00e9nb, \u201c by virtue of \u00e1ny purchase \u00f3f <em>'any </em>estatewhereof the consideration 'does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>not amount to thirty pounds, <em>bona fide </em>paid &amp;c. Under this statute, the purchaser of an equity of redemption, has been held to give a settlement, provided the pauper had actually and in good faith paid thirty pounds for the estate. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Mattingly, </em>2 <em>T. R. </em>12. So in <em>The King </em>v. <em>Offchurch, </em>8 <em>T. R. </em>117, it was decided that a husband gained a settlement by living on an estate, vested in Trustees for the separate use of his wife; that is, by being in possession of the <em>equitable </em>estate of the wife. Lord Kenyon in delivering his opinion, asks the question, whether it must be a <em>legal estate </em>in order to confer a settlement; and then answering his own interrogatory, replies \u201c certainly not \u201d; and after citing cases to show that an equitable <em>estate </em>is sufficient to confer a settlement, his Lordship adds, \u201c and indeed this position is confirmed by many other cases, and there are none in opposition to it.\u201d nor is there any thing in the language of our statute to confine its influence to <em>legal </em>estates; it says \u201c ever}'- person who shall become <em>seized </em>of <em>any </em>freehold estate, &amp;c.,\u201d that is, <em>any estate, </em>of freehold, whether for 'life or in fee, legal or equitable. This accords with the decision of this court, in the case of <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Pompton, Penn. R. </em>1039, and upon no other principle can it be sustained; for after all that can be said, a mortgage has not the <em>strict legal estate, </em>notwithstanding courts of law, now follow the courts of equity, and consider the mortgagor for certain purposes, as the real owner. There is a wide difference between a <em>mere right </em>in equity, to have an estate, and an <em>equitable </em>estate in possession. In <em>Tewksbury </em>v. <em>Readington </em>the pauper, had at most, only the former, but Compton in the case before us, had the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">By the 6th <em>Section </em>of the statute, making lands liable to be sold for the payment of debts, <em>Rev. laws </em>430, the Sheriff is to be commanded to make the money of \u201c the lands, hereditaments and real estate, whereof the party <em>was seized, </em>&amp;c. Under this statute, so far as I know, it has never been doubted in this State, but that an equity of redemption, may be levied upon and sold under a <em>fi.fa. </em>And can any one doubt, whether Compton was not so <em>seized </em>of his life estate in the farm, as that .it might have been sold under an execution ? In <em>Waters and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>al. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>1 <em>Caine\u2019s Cas. in Error, </em>47, Spencer, Justice says, \u201c where a statute speaks of seizin, an equitable seizin, may be as well intended, as a legal one.\u201d Kent, Justice, in the same case says, \u201cthe word <em>seizin </em>in a statute, is frequently construed to apply, to an equitable, as well as to a strict legal seizin. In this position those learned Judges are fully sustained by the case of <em>Shropnel </em>v. <em>Vernon, 2 Bro. C. C. </em>268. That was a case upon the annuity act, 17 <em>Geo. </em>8. which exempts from the necessity of enrolment, the grarit of an annuity, where the grantor is <em>seized </em>in fee or in tail, and it was held that an <em>equitable </em>estate in fee or in tail, was within the exemption, as much as legal estates. The Lord Chancellor in that case, says, that, \u201c in many acts of Parliament, an equitable estate, is Considered the same, as if it were a legal estate; \u201d and he refers to the words, \u201c seized in law or equity \u201d in the qualification act, as evidence that the word seized' is applicable to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">As to was constitutes an equitable seizin, or rather, a seizin of an equitable estate, the books abundantly show us. In <em>Casborne </em>v. <em>Scarfe. and al. </em>1 <em>Atk. </em>604, it was,, held that a husband might be tenant by the courtesy of his wife\u2019s equity of redemption; and yet we know, that <em>seizin in fact, </em>is one of the essential prerequisites of such an estate. But Lord Hardwicke in that case held, that there was such a <em>seizin </em>or possession of the equitable estate of the wife, as in equity is considered equivalent to an actual seizin of a freehold estate, at the common law; and he adds, \u201c actual possession, clothed with the receipt of rents and profits, is the highest instance of an equitable seizin.\u201d The same doctrine is more fully illustrated in <em>Burgass </em>v. <em>Wheates, </em>1 <em>Bl. R. </em>260 <em>and seq., and see 4th Kent\u2019s com. </em>1st <em>edit. fol. </em>31. Here, Compton had the actual possession, and was in the receipt of the rents and profits. He w. as therefore <em>seized </em>of a freehold estate in equity, and that satisfies the statute. In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Geddington, 2 B. and C. </em>129, it was decided that the words \u201c any estate or interest \u201d in a statute, means either a legal or equitable estate or interest; and I can perceive no reason for confining the words \u201cfreehold estate \u201d in our statute'- for the settlement of paupers, to legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>estates of freehold. (See <em>The King </em>v. <em>St. </em>Michael's, <em>Dougl. </em>608, 630. <em>Whitestown </em>v. Constable, 14 <em>Johns. R. </em>469.) I am therefore of opinion, that Compton\u2019s legal settlement was in Warren; and consequently both orders, that of the Justices as well as of the Quarter Sessions, must be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Orders of the </em>Justices, <em>and the Quarter Sessions quashed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Cited in <em>Yeo </em>v. <em>Mercereau, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>394.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
