The Court has jurisdiction of this matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. For the reasons stated below, Defendants\u2019 motion is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">I. <em>Mortgage-Backed Security Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbH\">The following facts are taken from the TAC, the documents incorporated by reference therein, and other documents of which the Court may properly take judicial notice. Plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations are taken as true for purposes of this motion practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">On March 10, 2006, and March 31, 2006, SAMI Depositor and Bear Stearns Depositor, respectively, filed Registration Statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) indicating their intention to sell $50 billion in MBS Certificates. (TAC \u00b6 4.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Registration Statements and the accompanying Prospectus and Prospectus Supplements (collectively referred to as \u201cOffering Documents\u201d) contained untrue statements and omissions of material fact regarding the underwriting and appraising standards, the value of the collateral, the amount of credit support for each offering, and the credit ratings of the Certificates. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 9.) These omissions and misstatements are alleged to have caused the Offering Documents to be materially false and misleading. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">In brief, an MBS is created when a \u201cdepositor\u201d buys an inventory of mortgages (or \u201cloan pool\u201d) from a primary lender (or \u201coriginator\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the depositor ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>tains the loan pools, it places them in issuing trusts, securitizes them by organizing the loans into \u201ctranches,\u201d and issues securities backed by the loan pools. The depositor uses the borrowers\u2019 monthly payments as the revenue stream to pay investors who have bought the securities. Each tranche has a different risk profile and is assigned a credit rating \u2014 here, by the rating agencies S &amp; P and Moody\u2019s (\u201cRating Agencies\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All of the tranches from which named Plaintiffs purchased Certificates were initially rated AAA, which ostensibly indicated the lowest likelihood of default.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Because the value of an MBS depends on the ability of the borrowers to repay the principal and interest on the underlying loans as well as the adequacy of the collateral in the event of default, thorough assessments of the borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness and the homes\u2019 values are paramount. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 3.) To this end, the MBS packaging process has three principal levels of quality control. First, underwriting and appraisal standards are crafted to assist the originator in weeding out excessively risky loan applications; second, the depositor reviews the loan pools to ensure that they meet the originator\u2019s stated underwriting standards <em>(id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 55-58); and third, the Rating Agencies review the securities\u2019 risk profiles and assign ratings. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6,184-85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The TAC details a systemic breakdown at each level, one that resulted largely from the misalignment of incentives in the MBS industry. Under the traditional mortgage investment model, the loan originator held the mortgage to maturity and made its profits from the borrower\u2019s payment of interest and repayment of principal-an arrangement that gave the originator an economic interest in ensuring that (1) the borrower had the financial wherewithal to repay the promissory note, and (2) the underlying property had sufficient value to cover the lender\u2019s losses in the event of default. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-47, 168.) With the advent of securitization, originators quickly parted with the mortgages\u2014 and the attendant risk of default \u2014 by selling them to investors. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 169). The primary source of profit shifted from borrowers\u2019 interest payments to loan fees and sales revenue. Largely free from the risk of defaults, originators began pushing high-risk loan products and deviating from underwriting and appraisal standards in an attempt to maximize loan volume. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 169-70). Wall Street banks like Bear Stearns, which profited enormously from the packaging and sale of MBS, were content to overlook the widespread degradation of underwriting and appraisal practices. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56-67, 171.) The final guarantors of the securities\u2019 quality, the Rating Agencies, were equally compromised. The Rating Agencies\u2019 models were outdated and failed to properly account for the increased riskiness of new loan products. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 196.) Compounding the problem, banks such as Bear Stearns shopped for Rating Agencies willing to assign their securities top credit ratings, pitting the Agencies against each other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>and provoking a race to the bottom in rating quality. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 195.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">A. <em>Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Underwriting Standards and Appraisals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Plaintiffs allege that the Offering Documents misrepresented and omitted material facts regarding the underwriting standards applied by the loan originators. EMC Mortgage Corp. (\u201cEMC\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bear Stearns Residential Mortgage Corp. (\u201cBSRM\u201d), Countrywide Home Loans (\u201cCountrywide\u201d), American Home Mortgage (\u201cAHM\u201d), Wells Fargo Mortgage Corp. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), Fieldstone Mortgage Corp. (\u201cFMC\u201d), as well as six additional corporations listed in the Prospectus Supplement, originated loans held by the trusts in which Plaintiffs invested.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 82, 94,100,126, 141,157,166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">EMC was an originator of loans for the BSABS 2007-HE4, BSMF 2006-AR1, BSMF 2006-AR4, BSMF 2006-AR5, BAL-TA 2006-6, BALTA 2006-8, and BALTA 2007-1 trusts. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 82.) The Offering Documents represented that: \u201cEach mortgaged property relating to an EMC mortgage loan has been appraised by a qualified independent appraiser\u201d in accordance with the \u201cUniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 84.) The Offering Documents further represented that \u201cunderwriting standards are applied to evaluate the prospective borrower\u2019s credit standing and repayment ability and the value and adequacy of the mortgaged property as collateral\u201d and elaborated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">In determining whether a prospective borrower has sufficient monthly income available (i) to meet the borrower\u2019s monthly obligation on their proposed mortgage loan and (ii) to meet the monthly housing expenses and other financial obligations on the proposed mortgage loan, each lender generally considers, when required by the applicable documentation program, the ratio of such amounts to the proposed borrower\u2019s acceptable stable monthly gross income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-12\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 83.) The Prospectus Supplement also stated that, while certain loans did not require income verification, the originators would \u201cobtain a telephonic verification of the borrowers\u2019 employment without reference to income\u201d and that \u201c[b]orrower\u2019s assets are verified.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">EMC systematically disregarded its own underwriting and appraisal standards and prioritized the pursuit of loan volume over loan quality. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 86.) According to one study, EMC breached its representations and warranties with respect to 89% of its loans by providing misrepresentations about borrower income, employment, and assets, and by failing to adhere to its own mortgage lending guidelines. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 88.) According to Matt Van Leeuwen, a former mortgage analyst with EMC, Bear Stearns forced EMC analysts to rush their loan analyses so that Bear Stearns would not have to hold the loans on its books. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 92.) Mr. Van Leeuwen further revealed that EMC analysts were allowed to falsify missing loan data, that the documentation level of the loans was often incorrectly identified, and that Bear Stearns would declare the loan \u201cfit\u201d rather than investigating to fill in the missing information. <em>(Id.) </em>As of the date of the TAC, 98% ($7.3 billion) of the $7.45 billion of the initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>AAA-rated Certificates from the seven trusts had been downgraded to or below speculative \u201cjunk\u201d status. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">BSRM was an originator of loans for the BSMF 2006-AR1, BSMF 2006-AR4, BSMF 2006-AR5, and BSABS 2007-HE4 trusts. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 94.) The Prospectus Supplements described stringent underwriting standards. For example, the Prospectus Supplement for the BSMF Series 2006-AR1 Certificate Offering stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\"><em>The BSRM Alt-A Underwriting Guidelines are intended to ensure that (i) the loan terms relate to the borrower\u2019s willingness and ability to repay and (ii) the value and marketability of the property are acceptable </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">Based on the documentation type each loan application package has an application completed by the prospective borrower that includes information with respect to the applicant\u2019s assets, liabilities, income, credit and employment history, as well as certain other personal information. During the underwriting process, BSRM calculates and verifies the loan applicant\u2019s sources of income (except documentation types, which do not require such information to be stated or independently verified), reviews the credit history of the applicant, calculates the debt-to-income ratio to determine the applicant\u2019s ability to repay the loan, and reviews the mortgaged property for compliance with the BSRM Underwriting Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 95) (emphasis in original.) The Prospectus Supplements also described BSRM\u2019s prudent underwriting standards for loans that required less documentation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 97.) However, BSRM systematically disregarded its own underwriting and appraisal standards to maximize loan volume. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 98.) As of the date of the TAC, almost 100% ($3.74 billion) of the $3.75 billion of the initially AAA-rated Certificates from the above four trusts had been downgraded to or below speculative \u201cjunk\u201d status. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Countrywide was an originator of loans for the SAMI 2006-AR6, SAMI 2006-AR7, BALTA 2006-6, BALTA 2007-1, BSARM 2006- 4, BSARM 2007-3, and BSARM 2007- 1 trusts. The Prospectus Supplements describe Countrywide\u2019s rigorous, stated underwriting standards. For example, the Prospectus Supplement for the SAMI 2006-AR6 offering stated that Countrywide evaluates \u201cthe prospective borrower\u2019s credit standing and repayment ability and the value and adequacy of the mortgaged property as collateral\u201d by verifying employment history and appraising the property, in a manner \u201cconformfing] to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac appraisal standards then in effect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 101\u2014 102.) The Prospectus Supplement represented that loans requiring less documentation were \u201climited to borrowers with excellent credit histories\u201d and that the loan application would be \u201creviewed to determine that the stated income is reasonable for the borrower\u2019s employment and that the stated assets are consistent with the borrower\u2019s income.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">However, in an effort to originate as many loans as possible, Countrywide routinely and systematically violated its stated underwriting standards. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 104.) According to a confidential witness (\u201cCW1\u201d), a senior Countrywide underwriter, Countrywide regularly designated loans made to unqualified borrowers as \u201cprime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 105.) According to a second confidential witness (\u201cCW2\u201d), Countrywide created a computer system that identified high risk loans and routed them out of the normal loan approval process; instead of being rejected, the loans were reviewed to evaluate whether they should require a higher price or higher interest rate. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 106.) Other confidential witnesses (\u201cCW3\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201cCW4\u201d) stated that, between 2000 and 2007, Countrywide extended loans to individuals with increasing debt-to-income ratios, and that branch managers pressured underwriters to approve risky loans. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 107-108.) According to a former Regional Vice President of Countrywide Mortgage Ventures, LLC, Countrywide also placed pressure on appraisers to appraise to predetermined values, which distorted the loan-to-value ratios and made the mortgage loans in the pool much riskier than suggested by the Offering Documents. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 109-10.) As a result of these unlawful mortgage practices, Countrywide has been the target of federal investigations, lawsuits by several state attorneys general, and numerous civil actions. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 111-124.) As of the date of the TAC, 98% ($9.31 billion) of the initially AAA-rated Certificates issued from the seven trusts had been downgraded to or below speculative \u201cjunk\u201d status. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">AHM was an originator of loans for the SAMI Series 2006-AR5 trust. The Prospectus Supplement for that trust represented that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">American Home\u2019s underwriting philosophy is to weigh all risk factors inherent in the loan file, giving consideration to the individual transaction, borrower profile, the level of documentation provided and the property used to collateralize the debt....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">American Home underwrites a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness based solely on information that American Home believes is <em>indicative of the applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to pay the debt they would be incurring.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-8\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 127) (emphasis in original). The Prospectus Supplement further represented that there would be \u201ccompensating factors such as higher credit score or lower loan-to-value requirements\u201d for loans requiring less documentation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 129.) However, AHM systematically disregarded its underwriting guidelines and regularly approved low documentation loans in the absence of sufficient compensating factors in order to maximize its loan volume. An internal report circulated in October 2005 relaxed the underwriting standards by no longer requiring verification of income sources on stated-income loans, reducing the time required to have elapsed since the borrower was last in bankruptcy or credit counseling, reducing the required documentation for self-employed borrowers, and broadening the acceptable use of second and third loans to cover the property value. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 131.) According to confidential witnesses CW6, CW7, and CW8, each of whom held senior positions at AHM, it was commonplace to overrule underwriters\u2019 objections in order to complete a loan. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 134-36.) Senior Executives encouraged loan officers to make risky loans, including stated-income loans, where neither the assets nor the income of the borrower were verified, \u201cNo Income\u201d loans, which allowed for loans to be made without any disclosure of the borrowers\u2019 income or assets, and \u201cNo Doc\u201d loans, which allowed loans to be made to borrowers who did not disclose their income, assets or employment history. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 132.) AHM\u2019s mortgage practices have also been the focus of several criminal probes and at least one AHM sales executive has admitted that he regularly falsified clients\u2019 income or assets, with AHM\u2019s knowledge, to get loans approved. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 138-139.) On August 6, 2007, AHM filed for bankruptcy. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 137.) As of the date of TAC, 77% ($687 million) of the initially AAA-rated Certificates issued from the SAMI Series 2006-AR5 trust had been downgraded to or below speculative \u201cjunk\u201d status. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Wells Fargo was an originator of loans for the BALTA 2006-8 and BSARM 2007-1 trusts. The BSARM 2007-1 Prospectus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Supplement represented that its \u201cgeneral\u201d underwriting standards were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">applied by or on behalf of Wells Fargo Bank <em>to evaluate the applicant\u2019s credit standing and ability to repay the loan, as well as the value and adequacy of the mortgaged property as collateral. </em>The underwriting standards that guide the determination represent a balancing of several factors that may affect the ultimate recovery of the loan amount, including, among others, the amount of the loan, the ratio of the loan amount to the property value (i.e., the lower of the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the purchase price), the borrower\u2019s means of support and the borrower\u2019s credit history. Wells Fargo Bank\u2019s guidelines for underwriting may vary according to the nature of the borrower or the type of loan, since differing characteristics may be perceived as presenting different levels of risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 143) (emphasis in original). The Prospectus Supplement also disclosed that Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201cmodified\u201d underwriting standards \u201cpermit different underwriting criteria, additional types of mortgaged properties or categories of borrowers ... and include certain other less restrictive parameters.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 144.) Finally, the Prospectus Supplement stated that in order to qualify for participation in Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgage loan purchase program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">lending institutions must (i) meet and maintain certain net worth and other financial standards, (ii) demonstrate experience in originating residential mortgage loans, (iii) meet and maintain certain operational standards, (iv) <em>evaluate each loan offered to Wells Fargo Bank for consistency with Wells Fargo Bank\u2019s underwriting guidelines and represent that each loan was underwritten in accordance with Wells Fargo Bank standards </em>and (v) utilize the services of qualified appraisers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 146) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">However, Wells Fargo systematically disregarded its stated underwriting and appraisal standards. According to a confidential witness (\u201cCW9\u201d), loan officers applied \u201cintense\u201d pressure on underwriters to approve risky loans and rewarded \u201chigh producers.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 148.) Another confidential witness and former Wells Fargo employee (\u201cCW10\u201d) states that the mortgage unit would loosen its underwriting standards at the end of the year to meet the origination goals; those employees who did not approve risky loans \u201cwouldn\u2019t be around very long.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 150.) According to CW11, Wells Fargo instituted a program in 2006 called \u201ccourageous underwriting,\u201d which CW11 described as \u201cfollowing the guidelines but also finagling the guidelines if it meant getting the loan approved.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 152.) According to CW12, a former Wells Fargo Home Mortgage employee who was employed as a Loss Mitigation Supervisor from 1999 through 2004, and as an REO Supervisor from July 2006 through May 2008, some of the information in the loans was \u201cblatantly falsified.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 153.) As of the date of the TAC, 93.6% ($2.08 billion) of the initially AAA-rated Certificates issued from the BALTA 2006-8 and BSARM 2007-1 trusts had been downgraded to or below speculative \u201cjunk\u201d status. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">FMC was an originator of loans for the BSABS 2007-HE3 trust. The BSABS 2007-HE3 Prospectus Supplement represented that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">FMC\u2019s underwriting policy is to analyze the overall situation of the borrower and to take into account compensating factors that may be used to offset areas of weakness. These compensating factors include credit scores, proposed reductions in the borrower\u2019s debt service ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>pense, employment stability, number of years in residence and net disposable income....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">The underwriters review each non-conforming loan in one of FMC\u2019s regional funding centers. FMC believes that this regionalized underwriting process provides them with the ability to fund loans faster than many of its competitors, and the experience of their loan originators and branch managers, information systems and rigorous quality control process <em>ensure the continued high quality of their loans.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\"><em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 158 (emphasis in original).) The underwriting was not consistently monitored by FMC\u2019s supposed rigorous quality control process; rather, FMC\u2019s \u201cunderwriting personnel\u201d regularly modified mortgage loan applications in order to increase the volume of loans and resulting fees. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 159.) The rising rate of foreclosures and delinquencies resulting from these practices forced FMC to file for bankruptcy in November 2007. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 163.) According to press reports, an undercover operation resulted in fraud charges against 24 defendants, including brokers, business owners and appraisers who dealt regularly with FMC. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 164.) As of the date of the TAC, 64.4% ($461.1 million) of the initially AAA-rated Certificates issued by the BSABS 2007-HE3 trust had been downgraded to or below speculative \u201cjunk\u201d status. (MU 165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Six other originators \u2014 Aegis Mortgage Corporation, Mid America Bank, U.S. Bank, NA, Provident Funding Associates, L.P., Synovus Mortgage Corporation, and American Mortgage Express Corp. d/b/a American Residential Mortgage Corp.\u2014 contributed loans to several of the offerings at issue. The Prospectus Supplements for those trusts contained untrue statements and omitted material facts. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 167.) As a result of these originators\u2019 high-risk lending practices, 100% ($1.89 billion) of the initially AAA-rated Certificates backed by loans originated by these six entities had been downgraded to or below speculative \u201cjunk\u201d status as of the date of the TAC. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">B. <em>Misrepresentations Regarding Appraisals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">In each Prospectus Supplement, Defendants included Loan-to-Value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios that were based on inflated appraisals of the collateral. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 177-78.) The LTV ratio expresses the loan amount as a percentage of the collateral\u2019s value. For example, if an individual seeks to borrow $90,000 to pay for a house worth $100,000, the LTV ratio is 90%; however, if the home appraisal is artificially elevated to $120,000, the LTV ratio drops to 75%. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 178.) Lower LTV ratios are indicative of less risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">The Offering Documents represented that the appraisals were conducted in accordance with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac appraisal standards. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 179.) Contrary to those representations, many appraisals were inflated, which resulted in class members paying more for the Certificates than they were worth. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 178-80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">C. <em>Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding The Certificates\u2019 Credit Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">The Offering Documents also contained material misrepresentations concerning \u201ccredit support\u201d or \u201ccredit enhancement,\u201d which provides holders of senior Certificates with a degree of protection should there be a shortfall in payments received on the mortgage loans. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 181-82.)

Once the Rating Agency\u2019s analysis was complete, Bear Stearns submitted its bids; if the mortgage originator accepted the bid, Bear Stearns often retained third-party due diligence firms such as Clayton Holdings and Bohan Group, ostensibly to comb through the loan pools and eliminate loans that violated the underwriting standards. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 55.) However, executives at these firms have characterized Bear Stearns\u2019 due diligence process as lax and haphazard. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 56.) Investment banks like Bear Stearns directed the due diligence firms to drastically decrease the number of loans that they evaluated <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 63), and routinely ignored the numerous \u201cred flags\u201d about flaws in subprime mortgage loans. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 64.) According to documents filed with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Clayton reviewed 19,248 Bear Stearns loans from January 2006 to June 2007, and initially rejected 4,494 (23%) of them; Bear Stearns waived the exceptions related to 1,295 (29%) of those loans. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 65.) During that same period, Clayton reviewed 53,131 EMC loans, and initially rejected 7,277 (13.7%); EMC waived the exceptions related to 3,628 (50%) of those loans. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">E. <em>Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding The Certificates\u2019 Ratings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Each of the Certificates was provided a rating by Standard <em>&amp; </em>Poor (\u201cS &amp; P\u201d) and Moody\u2019s. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 184.) The Offering Documents stated that the Certificates\u2019 ratings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Q\">address the likelihood of the receipt by Certificateholders of all distributions to which the Certificateholders are entitled. These ratings address the structural, legal and issuer-related aspects associated with the Certificates and notes, the nature of the underlying mortgage assets and the credit quality of the guarantor, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-8\"><em>(Id.) </em>All of the ratings set forth in each of the Prospectus Supplements were within \u201cInvestment Grade\u201d range for Moody\u2019s (Aaaa through Baa3) and S &amp; P (AAA through BBB.) <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">These ratings were premised on false representations that the originators had complied with the underwriting guidelines. <em>(Id.) </em>Moreover, Rating Agency executives have since admitted that the ratings were based on inaccurate data <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 187), and relied on deficient statistical models. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 188-195.) The Rating Agencies succumbed to market pressure to lower their standards. According to former Moody\u2019s Managing Director Jerome S. Fons, securities issuers were free to shop around for the Rating Agency that would give them the highest rating and \u201ctypically chose the agency with the lowest standards, engendering a race to the bottom in terms of rating quality.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 195.) These unreliable ratings made it impossible for class members to accurately assess the risk of the Certificates and caused class members to pay more for the Certificates than they were worth at the time of the Offerings. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">II. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">On August 20, 2008, Plaintiff New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund (\u201cNJ Carpenters\u201d) filed a complaint (the \u201cOriginal Complaint\u201d) in New York state court, asserting claims against Bear Stearns and Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II, Inc.

The first prong of Section 13 is a statute of limitations, which provides that claims must be brought within one year of \u201cthe discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute of limitations may be tolled based on equitable considerations for up to three years, at which point a plaintiffs claim is extinguished by Section 13\u2019s second prong \u2014 the statute of repose \u2014 which provides that <em>\u201cfi]n no event </em>shall any such action be brought ... more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Defendants argue that each of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims is time-barred by the statute of limitations because various news reports and other publicly accessible information placed Plaintiffs on inquiry notice more than one year prior to the filing of the operative complaint. Defendants further argue that the claims first asserted by Plaintiffs with standing more than three years after the initial offerings are barred by the statute of repose.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">A. <em>Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The Court must first determine whether the inquiry notice standard is still applicable, or whether, as Plaintiffs contend, it was rendered inoperative by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1784, 176 L.Ed.2d 582 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Inquiry notice has been held to arise when circumstances \u2014 often called \u201cstorm warnings\u201d \u2014 \u201c \u2018suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the probability\u2019 that she has a cause of action.\u201d <em>In re Openwave Sys.

The emergence of storm warnings triggers the potential plaintiffs duty to investigate. If the potential plaintiff makes an inquiry when that duty arises, the one-year statute of limitations begins to run when a plaintiff \u201cin the exercise of reasonable diligence[] should have discovered\u201d the violation. <em>Lentell v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 161, 168 (2d Cir.2005), <em>accord In re IndyMac Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation, </em>718 F.Supp.2d 495, 502-03 (S.D.N.Y.2010). Where, on the other hand, the plaintiff fails to investigate, the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the storm warnings triggered the duty to inquire. <em>Id. </em>In effect, the inquiry notice standard can penalize the heedless would-be plaintiff by commencing the limitations period before a reasonably diligent plaintiff could have discovered the actionable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1784, 176 L.Ed.2d 582 (2010), invalidated inquiry notice as a statute of limitations measuring point in securities cases. In <em>Merck, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the inquiry notice standard in the context of a claim brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 (\u201c34 Act\u201d), holding that \u201cthe discovery of facts that put a plaintiff on inquiry notice does not automatically begin the running of the limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1798. Rather, the Court held, \u201cthe limitations period does not begin to run until ... a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered \u2018the facts constituting the violation,\u2019 ... irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1792 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)). The Second Circuit elaborated on <em>Merck </em>in <em>City of Pontiac Gen. Emps. Ret. Sys. v. MBIA, Inc., </em>637 F.3d 169 (2d Cir.2011), holding that a fact is not deemed \u201cdiscovered\u201d for limitations purposes until \u201ca reasonably diligent plaintiff would have sufficient information about that fact to adequately plead it in a complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. Put differently, \u201cthe reasonably diligent plaintiff has not \u2018discovered\u2019 one of the facts constituting a securities fraud violation until he can plead that fact with sufficient detail and particularity to survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The question before the Court is whether the Supreme Court\u2019s invalidation of the inquiry notice standard for '34 Act claims extends to claims brought under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the '33 Act. The Court concludes, in accord with the majority of judges in this district, that it does. <em>See In re Wachovia Equity Sec. Litig., </em>753 F.Supp.2d 326, 370-71, n. 39 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (applying <em>Merck </em>to claims under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the '33 Act); <em>New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v.

In both instances, the limitations clock starts when the plaintiff discovers, or should have discovered,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the factual predicates of the offense-whether it be facts constituting the fraud in the case of a Section 10(b) claim, or the facts constituting the \u201cuntrue statement or the omission\u201d in the case of a Section 11 or 12(a)(2) claim. <em>See Dodds v.

Given this identity of operation, the Court finds no principled basis for cabining <em>Merck\u2019s </em>holding to Section 1658(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In light of <em>Merck </em>and <em>City of Pontiac, </em>the Court finds that Defendants\u2019 focus on inquiry notice is misplaced. The operative question is no longer when a reasonable plaintiff would have known that she had a likely cause of action and inquired further. Rather, the question is whether a plaintiff could have pled '33 Act claims with sufficient particularity to survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss more than one year prior to the filing of the operative complaint. Whether sufficient facts existed at that time is, by definition, a fact-intensive inquiry and, thus, generally ill-suited for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage. <em>Cf. In re Dreyfus, </em>No. 98 Civ. 43180HB), 2000 WL 10211, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2000) (\u201c[T]he issue of constructive knowledge and inquiry notice should more properly be resolved by the trier of fact at a later stage in this litigation.\u201d).

State St. Corp., </em>686 F.Supp.2d 369, 380 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must allege some facts to close the loop between the market turmoil and the accuracy of the Fund\u2019s valuations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">More significantly, even though evidence of improprieties and irresponsible risk-taking in the MBS industry began to emerge in early 2007, there is no indication that the <em>BSMF 2006-ARl </em>Certificates declined in value. Indeed, according to Defendants\u2019 chart detailing Certificate downgrades, the earliest downgrade of any Certificate issued from the BSMF 2006-AR1 trust occurred on December 14, 2007, and the earliest downgrade of a AAA-rated Certificate (the only Certificates any Plaintiff held) from that trust occurred on June 19, 2008. (Ex. ZZ.) The fact that the Certificates retained their ratings amidst growing concerns about the MBS industry is significant for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">First, absent a decline in the Certificates\u2019 ratings (or some other indicator of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>steep decline in the Certificates\u2019 value), it is difficult to see how a plaintiff could have plausibly pled that the epidemic of indiscretions in the MBS industry had infected his or her Certificates. A complaint couched in nothing more than the sweepingly general allegations contained in Defendants\u2019 exhibits would almost certainly \u201cstop[ ] short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotations omitted); <em>Freidus v. ING Groep N.V., </em>736 F.Supp.2d at 831; <em>Yu v. State St. Corp., </em>686 F.Supp.2d at 380. Second, absent a showing that the Certificates\u2019 value had diminished by August 2007, NJ Carpenters could not have stated a claim supportive of statutory damages. While a complaint \u201cis not required to plead damages under Section 11, it fails to state a claim if the allegations of the complaint do not support any conceivable statutory damages.\u201d <em>NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., </em>743 F.Supp.2d 288, 290-91 (S.D.N.Y.2010); <em>see also In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, </em>241 F.Supp.2d 281, 347 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (dismissing claims for failure to allege cognizable damages where plaintiffs sold securities for an amount in excess of the offering price).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Because Defendants have failed to show that NJ Carpenters could have pled facts sufficient to survive a 12(b)(6) motion in August 2007, the Court concludes that the Original Complaint was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">2. <em>Timeliness of Subsequent Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Defendants also allege that the FAC (filed May 15, 2009) and the Pension Trust Complaint (filed July 9, 2009) are untimely. Defendants marshal publicly available sources that refer to missteps, misfortunes, and malefactions of corporations involved in the packaging and sale of the securities at issue here, including: 1) two complaints from May and July 2007 against Countrywide for violating Truth in Lending laws and misrepresenting the quality of its mortgage investments (Ex. MMM, NNN); 2) the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 (FAC \u00b6 105); and 3) AHM\u2019s worsening financial condition as a result of its investment in subprime mortgages. (Ex. NN.) In addition, Defendants catalogue more than 900 downgrades to investment grade Certificates issued by the 13 trusts added after the Original Complaint. <em>(See </em>Defs\u2019 Memo, at 37; Ex. ZZ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">It is not clear that a complaint whose allegations were supported solely by this body of information would survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The two complaints against Countrywide detail conduct that is only tangentially related to the TAC\u2019s allegations concerning underwriting practices and improper appraisals. <em>(See </em>Ex. MMM (suit alleging deceitful lending practices); Ex. NNN (suit alleging insider trading, artificial inflation of stock prices, and misrepresentations concerning stock prospects)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As for the collapse of Bear Stearns, there is nothing in Defendants\u2019 submission suggesting that Plaintiffs knew or should have known by May or July of 2008 that <em>their securities </em>were tainted by the irresponsible practices that drove Bear Stearns into bankruptcy; the same holds for the collapse of AHM. It is far from clear that speculative attempts to link those events to the securities in question would have survived a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Defendants\u2019 treatment of the downgrade history is equally unpersuasive. As an initial matter, downgrades alone do not convey facts sufficient to plead a Section 11 or 12(a)(2) claim. As Defendants point out in their papers, a downgrade can occur for any number of reasons \u2014 for example, a recession or a collapse in housing prices\u2014 that are unrelated to the problematic underwriting and quality control practices that form the basis of each complaint. <em>Cf. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Mississippi v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., </em>No. 09 CV 1110(HB), 2011 WL 135821, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 12, 2011) (while minor downgrades and negative watches \u201cmay have been an indication that the Certificates were performing badly, [they] do[ ] not constitute triggering information [that] relate[s] directly to the misrepresentations and omissions that the Plaintiff alleges\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Defendants\u2019 downgrade figure is also severely misleading. First, it characterizes hundreds of \u201cnegative watches\u201d as downgrades even though the latter do not constitute rating changes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Cf. In re Morgan Stanley Mortg. Pass-Through Certificates Litigation, </em>810 F.Supp.2d 650, 663-65 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (declining to find inquiry notice based on \u201cnegative watches\u201d where securities maintained their investment-grade rating); <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., </em>714 F.Supp.2d 475, 479-80 (S.D.N.Y.2010); <em>New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund v. Royal Bank of Scotland Group, PLC, </em>720 F.Supp.2d 254, 267 (S.D.N.Y.2010). Second, Defendants\u2019 figure includes as many as nine months of legally irrelevant downgrades that occurred less than a year prior to the filing of the relevant complaint.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Third, Defendants arrive at their downgrade count primarily by itemizing downgrades to the most subordinate tranches, which exist to absorb losses to the underlying collateral and protect the cash flow of higher-rated Certificates. <em>(See </em>Pis\u2019 Opp. at 36.) It bears emphasis that Plaintiffs purchased exclusively from the AAA-rated tranches. When Defendants\u2019 chart is re-examined with a focus on the tranches from which Plaintiffs purchased their securities, the following picture emerges: in the year pri- or to being listed in a complaint, only one trust had AAA-rated tranches that were downgraded;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> five trusts had AAA-rated tranches that were subject to scattered negative watches (ie., from AAA to AAA*- or Aaa to Aaa*-);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the AAA-rated tranches from the remaining seven offerings retained their AAA ratings unblemished.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In sum, a year prior to the filing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>operative complaint, the securities that Plaintiffs held were (at least as judged by the ratings) seemingly untarnished by the problems that plagued the MBS industry as a whole. As with the Original Complaint, it is far from clear that Plaintiffs could have adequately pled, one year prior to the filing of the operative complaint, that the Offering Documents for <em>their </em>securities contained material misrepresentations and omissions, or that they suffered cognizable injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Accordingly, the Court finds that the subsequent complaints were timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">B. <em>Statute of Repose</em></p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are untimely to the extent they were first asserted by actual buyers from offerings more than three years after the offering date. The Court recently addressed this very argument in <em>In re Morgan Stanley Mortg. Pass-Through Certificates Litigation, </em>810 F.Supp.2d 650 (S.D.N.Y.2011). That decision concluded that, under the tolling rule announced in <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974), the commencement of the original class action tolled the statute of repose for all members of the putative class, even where the original named plaintiffs lacked standing to bring some of the claims. <em>In re Morgan Stanley, </em>810 F.Supp.2d at 665-71. Here, named Plaintiffs had asserted claims on behalf of purchasers of Certificates from each of the 14 trusts as of July 19, 2009, Pension Trust Complaint-less than three years after each of the offerings\u2019 issuance dates.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, none of the claims is barred by the statute of repose. Because the Court finds that the statute of repose was tolled under <em>American Pipe, </em>it need not decide whether relation back could save the later claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">II. <em>Pleading Actionable Misrepresentations/Omissions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">The Court will address Defendants\u2019 arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to state viable claims of misrepresentations or omissions as they relate to the three categories of allegations \u2014 underwriting standards, appraisals, and investment ratings \u2014 made in the TAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">A. <em>Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Underwriting Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Defendants first contend that Plaintiffs fail to meet their pleading burden under <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal </em>by failing to proffer facts linking the alleged disregard for underwriting standards with the decline in the Certificates\u2019 value. This contention is without merit. The Complaint is replete with public reports and detailed statements by numerous confidential witnesses<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that describe the systematic dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>regard of underwriting standards by the specific parties involved in the origination of the loans populating the offerings, as well a failure to conduct proper due diligence by the depositors. (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 56-67, 87-93, 98-99, 105-25, 131-40, 148-55, 160-65.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The facts alleged in the TAC are sufficient to support a reasonable inference that the loan pools were inferior in credit quality to loans that would have been selected had Defendants\u2019 originators employed the sort of underwriting standards described in the Offering Documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Defendants next contend that the Offering Documents contained \u201crobust risk disclosures\u201d (Defs\u2019 Memo, at 15), including disclaimers that a downturn in the housing market could adversely affect the value of Plaintiffs\u2019 Certificates, and that the originators would grant exceptions from stated underwriting guidelines. These warnings, Defendants contend, \u201cbespoke caution.\u201d Under the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine, \u201c[cjertain alleged misrepresentations in a stock offering are immaterial as a matter of law because it cannot be said that any reasonable investor could consider them important in light of adequate cautionary language set out in the same offering.\u201d <em>See Halperin v. eBanker USA.com, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 352, 357 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine is inapposite to the market-downturn disclosure. The doctrine only applies where a plaintiff alleges that the defendant made misleading statements about the possibility that future, unforeseen events could undermine an investment\u2019s value; it does not apply to cases, such as this, where a plaintiff alleges omissions or misrepresentations of historical <em>fact </em>\u2014 ie., that the underwriting standards were followed. P. <em>Stolz Family Partnership L.P. v. Daum, </em>355 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir.2004). The doctrine is also inapposite to the disclaimer that exceptions had been granted. For the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine to shield a seller from liability, the \u201ccautionary lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>guage ... must relate directly to that by which the plaintiffs claim to have been misled.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Alliance N. Am. Gov\u2019t Income Trust, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 723, 729 (2d Cir.1998). No language in the Offering Documents disclosed, for example, that the originators had systematically violated their own stated underwriting standards, that exceptions were <em>improperly </em>granted, or that Bear Stearns had directed its third-party due diligence firms to keep non-conforming loans in the Offering pools. (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 55-67.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Accordingly, the Court finds that the TAC properly states a claim as to the underwriting allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">B. <em>Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Appraisals</em></p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 appraisal-related allegations fail to state a claim. According to the allegations in the TAC, the Offering Documents represented that the property appraisals conformed to the Uniform Standard of Professional Appraisal Practice (\u201cUSPAP\u201d) and were conducted by \u201cqualified independent appraisers.\u201d (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 80, 84, 96, 102.) In fact, originators systematically disregarded their stated appraisal standards, and strong-armed appraisers to inflate property values. <em>(See, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 109-10, 121, 154, 190.) In moving to dismiss the appraisal-related claims, Defendants rely principally on <em>Tsereteli v. Residential Asset Securitization Trust 2006-A8, </em>692 F.Supp.2d 387 (S.D.N.Y.2010), which held that property appraisals and corresponding LTV ratios are \u201csubjective opinion[s]\u201d that are \u201cactionable under the Securities Act only if the [plaintiff] alleges that the speaker did not truly have the opinion at the time it was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393-94. Defendants argue that the appraisal claims fail because the TAC does not allege that any Defendants were involved in appraising properties or knew that the loans underlying the Certificates were based on \u201cinflated appraisals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Defendants\u2019 argument misses the mark. Plaintiffs do not merely allege that the appraisal amounts were incorrect; they allege that the appraisals were not conducted in accordance with the industry standards identified in the Offering Documents. The former allegation differs from the latter in the same way the statement \u201cthe cook baked a delicious cake\u201d differs from the statement \u201cthe cook followed the cake recipe on the box\u201d: the former is opinion, the latter an assertion of fact. Likewise, the conclusion that a house is worth $500,000 may be a statement of subjective opinion, but the assurance that the $500,000 figure was reached in accordance with a body of professional appraisal standards is a statement of verifiable fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Second, to the extent the TAC does bring a claim based on the inaccuracy of the appraisal values \u2014 as opposed to\u2019 appraisal methodology used \u2014 Plaintiffs have pled facts supporting an inference that these opinions were not only objectively false, but also subjectively false. Because the appraisal \u201copinions\u201d were expressed by both the originators and Bear Stearns (by incorporating the originators\u2019 representations into the Offering Documents), Plaintiffs can state a claim by showing that either one disbelieved the appraisal amounts. <em>Cf. In re Twinlab Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>103 F.Supp.2d 193, 203 (E.D.N.Y.2000) (liability under '33 Act may attach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>even for innocent misrepresentation); <em>Plumbers\u2019 Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund v. Nomura Asset Acceptance Corp., </em>632 F.3d 762, 775 (1st Cir.2011) (liability may attach for accurately conveying ratings that are false and misleading). The TAC alleges that, during the due diligence stage, Clayton submitted reports to Bear Stearns which revealed that many of the loans contained no appraisals at all. (Compl. \u00b6 58.) The TAC also alleges that the originators pressured their employees to inflate appraisal values. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 109-10, 121,154.) These allegations suffice to support an inference that Bear Stearns and the originators did not believe that the appraisal numbers were accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Accordingly, the TAC\u2019s allegations that the Offering Documents failed to disclose the allegedly rampant violation of appraisal standards is sufficient to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">C. <em>Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Investment Ratings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Defendants further contend that the TAC fails to state a claim regarding the investment ratings.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Offering Documents stated that the Certificates\u2019 ratings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aou\">address the likelihood of the receipt by certificateholders of all distributions to which the certificateholders are entitled. These ratings address the structural, legal and issuer-related aspects associated with the certificates and notes, the nature of the underlying mortgage assets and the credit quality of the guarantor, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">(TAC \u00b6 184.) The Offering Documents also stated that \u201c[i]t is a condition to the issuance of each class of Offered Certificates that it receives at least the ratings set forth [in the prospectus supplement] from S <em>&amp; </em>P and Moody\u2019s.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The TAC alleges that the Offering Documents failed to disclose that the ratings process relied on inaccurate mortgage loan data, stale delinquency, and outdated models, and that the ratings process was compromised by conflicts of interest. While the TAC does not allege that the Offering Documents misstated the ratings that the Agencies assigned to the Certificate, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants nonetheless had a duty, under 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.408(a),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to disclose flaws underlying the ratings to prevent the ratings from being misleading to investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">It is well-settled that investment ratings are subjective opinions and, accordingly, only actionable where \u201cthe speaker did not truly believe the statements at the time it was made public,\u201d <em>see, e.g., N.J. Carpenters Health Fund v. DLJ Mortg. Capital, Inc., </em>No. 08 Civ. 5653, 2010 WL 1473288, at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2010); <em>In re IndyMac Mortg.-Backed Sec. Litig., </em>718 F.Supp.2d 495, 511-12 (S.D.N.Y.2010), or if the speaker \u201cknowingly omits undisclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>facts tending seriously to undermine the accuracy of the statement.\u201d <em>Plumbers\u2019 Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund v. Nomura Asset Acceptance Corp., </em>632 F.3d 762, 775 (1st Cir.2011). Here, there are two \u201cspeakers\u201d: the agencies that rated the Certificates, and Defendants, who presented those ratings to investors in the Offerings Documents. Thus, Plaintiffs can state a claim by pleading that the Rating Agencies <em>or </em>Defendants did not believe that the ratings accurately reflected the quality of the securities. As to the former, Plaintiffs do not need to plead that Defendants were aware that the Rating Agencies believed the ratings to be false or misleading. <em>See, e.g., In re Twinlab Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>103 F.Supp.2d 193, 203 (E.D.N.Y.2000) (\u201cthe defendant\u2019s knowledge of the misrepresentations is not an element of a [\u201933 Act] claim; indeed, a defendant can be held liable even for an innocent misstatement.\u201d); <em>see also Plumbers\u2019 Union, </em>632 F.3d at 775 (liability may attach for accurately conveying false or misleading ratings).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Plaintiffs have not, however, adequately pled a claim based on the theory that the Rating Agencies disbelieved their ratings. The TAC includes excerpts of reports from 2007 and 2008 in which Moody\u2019s and S &amp; P personnel admitted that, in hindsight, their rating models and procedures were flawed. <em>{See, e.g., </em>TAC \u00b6 187 (quoting Moody\u2019s Managing Director as saying: \u201cThere is a lot of fraud that\u2019s involved there, things that we didn\u2019t see ... We\u2019re sort of retooling those to make sure that we capture a lot of the things that we relied on in the past that we can\u2019t rely on, on a going forward basis.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 193 (quoting former S &amp; P Managing Director as saying: \u201c[E]vents have demonstrated that the historical data we used and the assumptions we made significantly underestimated the severity of what has actually occurred.\u201d)). These retrospective remarks are insufficient to support an inference that the Rating Agencies disbelieved the ratings at or before the time of the offerings. <em>Plumbers\u2019 Union, </em>632 F.3d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">However, Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants could not reasonably have believed that the ratings were accurate because \u201cthe information Bear Stearns provided to the Rating Agencies regarding the loans underlying the pools at issue was faulty and inaccurate.\u201d (Pis\u2019 Opp. at 22.) Unlike Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about the conflict of interest<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and flawed data models,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> this one potentially has merit. However, the exact contours of this allegation are obscure. It is unclear what the faulty loan information consisted of. It is also unclear when, in Plaintiffs view, Bear Stearns became aware that the Rating Agencies had relied on inaccurate information in assigning the Certificate ratings. The TAC recounts the following chronology: prior to making bulk loan purchases, the originators sent Bear Stearns a spreadsheet containing detailed information about the loans, which Bear Stearns passed to the Rating Agencies. (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Agencies ran the spreadsheet through their models and determined the appropriate bid price. <em>(Id.) </em>Once the originator accepted the bid, Bear Stearns retained third-party due-diligence firms, ostensibly to conduct a more thorough review of the loan pools. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 55-56.) According to the TAC, it was during the due-diligence process that Bear Stearns first discovered (and ignored) the fact that loans were missing critical documentation or failed to comply with underwriting standards. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56-60). The narrative stops there \u2014 the TAC does not reveal at what stage the Agencies rated the Certificates, nor what information the Agencies relied upon to arrive at those ratings.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">This missing information is crucial. If Bear Stearns knowingly fed incomplete or inaccurate information to the Rating Agencies, or discovered after the Agencies rated the Certificates that they did so based on defective loan data, it follows that Bear Stearns could not have reasonably believed that the ratings accurately reflected the Certificates\u2019 risk. In either case, the ratings\u2019 unqualified reproduction <em>in the </em>Offering Documents would constitute an actionable misrepresentation and omission.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court will grant, without prejudice, the motion to dismiss claims based on the securities\u2019 ratings. Plaintiffs will be granted leave to amend the complaint to plead facts demonstrating that Bear Stearns was aware, when it released the Offering Documents, that the Certificates\u2019 ratings were based on inaccurate or incomplete information.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">III. <em>Section 15 Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ajr\">Defendants move to dismiss all claims against the Individual Defendants. In order to establish a prima facie Section 15 claim, a plaintiff must show (1) control, and (2) an underlying violation of Section 11 or Section 12(a)(2). <em>In re Lehman Bros. Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation, </em>650 F.3d 167 (2d Cir.2011). As explained above, the complaint\u2019s allegations are sufficient to state claims for primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>violations of Sections 11 and 12. Thus, the remaining relevant question is whether Plaintiffs have adequately pled control.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The Second Circuit has defined control as \u201cthe power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of [the primary violators], whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.\u201d <em>In re Lehman Bros., </em>650 F.3d at 185 (quoting <em>SEC v. First Jersey Sec., Inc., </em>101 F.3d 1450, 1472-73 (2d Cir.1996)). While the Second Circuit has yet to address the question of whether a plaintiff bringing a Section 15 claim must allege \u201cculpable participation,\u201d a majority of judges in this District-including the undersigned-have held such an allegation is not required. <em>Plumbers\u2019 &amp; Pipefitters\u2019 Local No. 562 Supplemental Plan &amp; Trust v. J.P. Morgan Acceptance Corp. I, </em>No. 08 Civ. 1713(ERK), 2012 WL 601448, at *20-21 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2012); <em>In re Deutsche Bank AG Securities Litigation, </em>No. 09 Civ. 1714(DAB), 2011 WL 3664407, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2011); <em>In re Refco, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>503 F.Supp.2d 611, 637 n. 24 (S.D.N.Y.2007); <em>American High-Income Trust v. Alliedsignal, </em>329 F.Supp.2d 534, 549 (S.D.N.Y.2004). Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that Individual Defendants are (1) officers or directors of the Depositors who (2) each signed one or both of the Registration Statements at issue. These allegations satisfy Plaintiffs\u2019 obligation to plead control. <em>See, e.g., In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec.

Plaintiffs have also realized losses by disposing of many of the Certificates at as little as one-third of their purchase price. The decline in value and the losses that Plaintiffs suffered as a result of the sale of their Certificates are alleged with specificity.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Defendants contend that the Offering Documents disclosed the risk that the Certificates could diminish in value, and that purchasers might be forced to sell them at a loss. In light of these disclosures, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs can only show cognizable injury if they demonstrate that pass-through payments were missed. This argument is essentially the same one Defendants made in support of their contention that Plaintiffs had failed to state a claim based on underwriting practices, and it fails for the same reason \u2014 the Offering Documents\u2019 generic disclosures about market fluctuations did not advise purchasers that the Certificates\u2019 value would decline due to noncompliance with appraisal and underwriting guidelines. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the Certificates\u2019 decline in value and their resale at a loss identify legally cognizable injuries. <em>See In re Morgan Stanley, </em>810 F.Supp.2d at 670-72; <em>New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>DLJ Mortg.

KK to the Robins Deck) The MLPA further provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">The obligations of [the Mortgage Loan Seller] to cure, purchase or substitute a qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan shall constitute the Purchaser\u2019s, the Trustee\u2019s and the Certificateholder\u2019s sole and exclusive remedies under this Agreement or otherwise respecting a breach of representations or warranties hereunder with respect to the Mortgage Loans....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-8\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 7(xxvii).) The Prospectus for BAL-TA 2006-6 recited the general content of certain representations that each mortgage seller made, described the seller\u2019s obligation under the MLPA to cure violations of the representations, or repurchase or substitute loans whose characteristics are inconsistent with the representations, and described the obligations of the master servicer or trustee in connection with the enforcement of the seller\u2019s obligations under the MLPA; the Prospectus provides that the obligations described \u201cwill constitute the sole remedies available to securityholders or the trustee for a breach of any representation by a Seller or for any other event giving rise to the obligations as described above.\u201d <em>(See </em>BALTA 2006-6 Prosp. at 20-25, attached as Ex. G to the Robins Deck)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Relying on <em>Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, </em>594 F.3d 383 (5th Cir.2010), Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiffs have adequately pled material misrepresentations or omissions, the sole remedy for breach of any representations or warranties is for the seller to repurchase or replace the particular nonconforming loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Lone Star </em>is misplaced. There, the plaintiffs discovered a number of delinquent mortgages in the loan pools and brought a misrepresentation claim based specifically on the breach of a representation in a prospectus supplement that there were \u201cno delinquent loans.\u201d 594 F.3d 383, 388. The prospectus supplement contained a \u201csole remedy\u201d provision, similar to that in the BALTA 2006-6 documentation, providing that the defendant would \u201csubstitute or repurchase\u201d delinquent loans. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the claim, holding that the plaintiffs could not state a misrepresentation claim based on the limited number of delinquencies that had been identified because the defendant never represented that the pools were \u201cabsolute<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>ly free\u201d of delinquent mortgages. <em>Id. </em>at 388. To the contrary, the repurchase and substitution clause amounted to an implicit acknowledgment that some amount of delinquency was unavoidable, thereby qualifying the defendant\u2019s representation that there were \u201cno delinquent loans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit did not rule, as Defendants here suggest, that their remedies would still be limited to repurchase or substitution <em>even if plaintiffs had shown a misrepresentation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Nor are the claims in the instant case as limited as those in <em>Lone Star. </em>Here, Plaintiffs point not only to seller representations as to the conformity of specific loans, but to representations in the Registration Statement and other Offering Documents concerning the underwriting and appraisal practices that were employed in constituting the pools. Rather than claiming a limited number of deviations from the underwriting and appraisal standards, Plaintiffs claim that the representations were belied by systemic noncompliance. While the \u201csole remedy\u201d clause could be read as an acknowledgment of occasional underwriting violations, it cannot be read as an acknowledgment of the pandemic of violations that Plaintiffs allege. <em>See City of Ann Arbor Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. Citigroup Mortg. Loan Trust Inc., </em>08 No. 1418(LDW), 2010 WL 6617866, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2010) (distinguishing <em>Lone Star </em>on the same grounds); <em>Emps. Ret.

Defendants cite a handful of recent cases from other districts which hold that the Securities Act explicitly limits standing to a person who acquires or purchases a specific security, and that every tranche is a unique security because each one \u201chas its own certificates, credit rating, interest rate, risk profile and a unique CUSIP identifier\u201d (Defs\u2019 Dec. 22, 2011, Letter at 2), and because each was backed by a different assortment of loans. <em>See Plumbers\u2019 &amp; Pipefitters\u2019 Local No. 562 Supplemental Plan &amp; Trust v. J.P. Morgan Acceptance Corp. I (\u201cPlumbers</em>\u201d), No. 08 Civ. 1713(ERK), 2012 WL 601448 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2012); <em>In re Washington Mutual Mortgage-Backed Secs. Litig.

These cases also hold that named plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to bring claims based on tranches they did not purchase because they cannot have been injured by the decline in value of a security they did not hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Plaintiffs argue that they have standing to sue as to every tranche because at least one named Plaintiff purchased from every offering; the tranches in each offering were constituted from \u201ca single pool of mortgages\u201d and the Certificates from each tranche were \u201cissued pursuant to identical Offering Documents containing the exact statements Plaintiffs allege [are] untrue.\u201d (Pis\u2019 Jan. 4, 2012, Letter at 5.) Thus, Plaintiffs contend, the untrue statements and omissions in the Offering Documents regarding the quality of the underlying loan pool negatively affected all tranches within each respective offering in a like manner. <em>See Genesee County Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. Thornburg Mortg. Securities Trust 2006-3, </em>825 F.Supp.2d 1082, 1211-14 (D.N.M.2011) (rejecting tranche-based standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">A. <em>Constitutional Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">To have standing under Article III, \u201ca plaintiff must allege an actual or threatened injury to himself that is fairly traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct of the defendant.\u201d <em>Lamar Advertising of Penn, LLC v. Town of Orchard Park, New York, </em>356 F.3d 365, 373 (2d Cir.2004) (citation omitted). This requirement is \u201cno less true with respect to class actions than with respect to other suits.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., </em>433 F.3d 181, 199 (2d Cir.2005). To bring suit on behalf of a class, the named plaintiffs \u201cmust allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 502, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Put differently, the named plaintiff \u201cmust be a part of that class, that is, he must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury shared by all members of the class he represents.\u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208, 216, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). \u201c[I]f none of the named plaintiffs purporting to represent a class establishes the requisite of a case or controversy with the defendants, none may seek relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class.\u201d <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">It is uncontested here that at least one named Plaintiff purchased securities from every offering. It is likewise uncontested that each tranche within a given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>offering was constituted from a single pool of mortgages, issued pursuant to the same set of Offering Documents, each with the same alleged misrepresentations and omissions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> As a result of these common misrepresentations and omissions, named Plaintiffs assert, every tranche experienced a higher rate of defaults and delinquencies than anticipated. Paraphrased in standing terminology, named Plaintiffs and the members of the class have suffered an identical form of injury (a decline in their Certificates\u2019 value) traceable to a single, allegedly unlawful act by Defendants (disseminating Offering Documents with misrepresentations and omissions). As such, named Plaintiffs have clearly established that they, and the purchasers of all other tranches within the offerings, are part of the same case and controversy with Defendants. Cf<em>. N.J. Carpenters Health Fund v. Residential Capital, LLC, </em>272 F.R.D. 160, 166-67 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (\u201cPlaintiffs show that the [loans] ... were originated under identical loan underwriting guidelines, and by the same four principal loan originators ... The alleged disregard for those guidelines thus impacted all proposed class members in the same manner, irrespective of which tranche they purchased.\u201d); <em>see also Genesee County Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. Thornburg Mortg. Securities Trust 2006-3, </em>825 F.Supp.2d 1082, 1211-14 (D.N.M.2011) (finding that named plaintiffs have constitutional standing to sue with respect to tranches which they did not purchase because \u201cthe same misrepresentations flow to all of the tranches\u201d); <em>In re Am. Int\u2019l Group, Inc., </em>741 F.Supp.2d 511, 538 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (plaintiffs had standing to sue on behalf of offerings from which they did not purchase because each offering was issued pursuant to shelf registration statements that incorporated the same misstatements, which meant plaintiffs could \u201ctrace the injury of the purchasers in each of the 101 offerings to the same underlying conduct on the part of the defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Defendants\u2019 central contention \u2014 that named Plaintiffs lack standing to sue over losses in the tranches which they did not purchase because an investor is not injured when a security she does not hold declines in value \u2014 reflects an excessively narrow view of the standing requirements for a lead plaintiff.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> That view is expressed most aptly in <em>Maine State Retirement Sys. </em>\u2014 a case on which Defendants rely heavily \u2014 which held that \u201c[a] lead plaintiff cannot prosecute a class action based on claims he could not advance individually.\u201d 2011 WL 4389689 at *3 (quoting <em>In re Wells Fargo Mortgage-Backed Certificates Litig., </em>712 F.Supp.2d 958, 965 (N.D.Cal.2010)). If, by \u201cclaim,\u201d the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>meant \u201ca cause of action arising from a discrete case and controversy,\u201d the statement is both correct and consistent with Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they have constitutional standing to bring claims as to all tranches. However, if \u201cclaim\u201d is supposed to mean a cause of action based on a discrete manifestation of an injury- \u2014 -which is apparently what Defendants intend\u2014 that statement is demonstrably false. Every time a lead plaintiff prosecutes an action on behalf of a class, she brings claims based on injuries she did not personally suffer \u2014 in other words, claims she could not have advanced individually. For example, the cancer- \u2014 -stricken lead plaintiff in an asbestos case brings claims based on <em>other peoples </em>\u2019 cancers; a lead plaintiff, paralyzed from the waist down due to a car brake malfunction, can bring product liability claims on behalf of other people who were paralyzed from the neck down due to the same faulty brake design. To say, as Defendants do, that named Plaintiffs cannot bring claims on behalf of purchasers of other securities because they cannot trace an injury to securities they did not hold is analogous to asserting that a driver who suffered injury when her brakes malfunctioned cannot sue on behalf of purchasers of cars <em>with the same defective brake design </em>because a plaintiff cannot claim to have been harmed by a car she never drove.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\">Defendants\u2019 assertion that named Plaintiffs lack standing over tranches they did not purchase because each tranche differs in its particularities is no more convincing. Arguing that named Plaintiffs lack standing because each tranche has, for example, a unique CUSIP number and a different interest rate is akin to asserting that the hypothetical plaintiff who drove a red two-door model lacks standing to sue on behalf of those who were driving the blue four-door model with the same faulty brake design. They are, in short, legally inconsequential distinctions. Defendant has identified no substantive differences among the tranches that would warrant treatment of the tranches as separate securities here for Article III standing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Once, as here, a named plaintiff has established that she suffered the same species of injury as the members of the class, traceable to the same unlawful conduct by a defendant, she has fulfilled the requirements of constitutional standing. Having satisfied Article Ill\u2019s standing criteria, the dissimilarities between the tranches is an issue appropriately left to the class certification stage. <em>See </em>7AA Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1785.1, at 388-89 (2d ed. 2005) (\u201cRepresentative parties who have a direct and substantial interest have standing; the question whether they may be allowed to present claims on behalf of others who have similar, but not identical, interests depends not on standing, but on an assessment of typicality and adequacy of representation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">B. <em>Statutory Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Section 11(a) provides that where \u201cany part of the registration statement ... contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact ... any person acquiring such security\u201d may sue. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77k(a) (West 2010). Section 12(a)(2) similarly provides that, where an individual \u201coffers or sells a security ... by means of a prospectus or oral communication, which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact,\u201d that individual will be liable to \u201cthe person purchasing such security.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77\u00a3(a)(2) (West 2010). The dispute here centers on the meaning of the phrase \u201csuch security\u201d in either section. Relying on <em>Maine State Retirement Sys., WaMu, </em>and <em>Plumbers, </em>Defendants interpret \u201csuch security\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>encompass securities with certain shared attributes. 2011 WL 4389689, at *6, 276 F.R.D. 658, 663-64, 2012 WL 601448, at *7. Defendants again point to the rate of return, rating, interest rate, and CUSIP number as the salient attributes. In addition, Defendants appear to argue that \u201csuch security\u201d only encompasses Certificates that are backed by the same mixture of loans, but have not pointed to anything in the record illuminating the differences in the nature or composition of the loans underlying the various tranches. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that \u201csuch security\u201d means any security issued pursuant to an offering document that contains an actionable misrepresentation or omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The text of Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) does not support Defendants\u2019 interpretation. While the phrase \u201csuch security\u201d has no grammatical referent in Section 11(a), the text makes clear that the only prerequisite to filing suit is the presence of a misrepresentation or omission in its registration statement. Section 12(a)(2) is even clearer: there, the referent of \u201csuch security\u201d is \u201ca security [sold] ... by means of a prospectus or oral communication\u201d that contains a material misrepresentation or omission. Neither makes any reference to the characteristics of the security outside the flaw in its offering documents. There is no mention of common rates of return, equivalent ratings, shared interest rates, or investors\u2019 needs and expectations. <em>Cf. Maine State Retirement Sys., </em>2011 WL 4389689, at *7 (emphasizing that the tranches \u201cprovided a different investment opportunity with unique characteristics\u201d to allow each investor to choose the security \u201cthat best matched its needs\u201d). In short, there is nothing in the record that indicates that the differences between the tranches that the Defendants\u2019 identify warrant treating the tranches \u2014 which were issued pursuant to the same, allegedly defective Offering Documents \u2014 as \u201cdifferent\u201d securities for the purpose of Sections 11 and 12(a)(2). <em>See, e.g., In re Countrywide Financial Corp. Securities Litigation, </em>588 F.Supp.2d 1132, 1165-66 (C.D.Cal.2008) (\u201c[Section 11] grants standing to anyone who buys \u2018such security\u2019 \u2014 one traceable to a defective registration statement.\u201d); <em>see also In re WorldCom, Inc.

As with constitutional standing, to the extent these differences are relevant, they may be appropriately addressed at the class certification stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the TAC is granted without prejudice insofar as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are premised on the alleged unreliability of the ratings of securities included in the investment pools.

The only pre-August 2007 events connected to those, or any other business involved in that trust are (1) the suit against EMC; (2) the collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge funds in July 2007; and (3) the Rating Agencies' reassessments of their rating models. None constitute facts that would enable a plaintiff to meet its pleading burden. The EMC suit concerned a species of lending practices (charging improper fees and failing to post timely payments) wholly different from those alleged in the complaint. There is no information linking the collapse of the two Bear Stearns hedge funds to any aspect of the BSMF 2006-AR1 trust. Finally, Defendants\u2019 exhibits indicate that the Rating Agencies acknowledged flaws in their models and began downgrading MBS securities in the spring and summer of 2007; however, tir\u00f3se corrective steps apparently did not affect <em>NJ Carpenters' </em>Certificates, which were not subjected to any downgrades until the following year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\">. Moreover, these two lawsuits were not discussed in any of the press articles submitted by Defendants and there is no indication that they received wide press coverage. Plaintiffs cannot be charged with knowledge of every suit filed against an originator. <em>See Staehr v. Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., </em>547 F.3d 406, 418 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b806-5\">. Plaintiffs explain \u2014 and Defendants do not dispute \u2014 that a negative watch is not a downgrade, but \"merely indicates that the rating agency is putting the issuer on notice that it is being reviewed closely. At the close of the review period, the rating agency removes the issuer (or issue) from watch with either its old rating intact or a new rating assigned.\" (Pis\u2019 Opp. at 35-36; <em>see also </em>TAC \u00b6 42.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. For example, Defendants tabulates 112 downgrades to investment grade BSMFT 2006-AR5 Certificates from April 2008 to February 19, 2009 (Defs' Memo, at 37, citing Exs. BBB and ZZ.) As the complaint listing that offering was filed on May 15, 2009, only six weeks of those downgrades are germane to the statute of limitations inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. That trust was BSABS 2007-HE3. Moody's downgraded three Aaa-rated tranches from Aaa to Aal. (Ex. ZZ.) Whatever significance this minor downgrade might have had, it is mitigated by the fact that those tranches retained their AAA S &amp; P rating until February 27, 2009. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b806-9\">.

Defendants\u2019 attack on the use of confidential witnesses in the TAC is unavailing. It is well-established that confidential sources may be relied upon in a complaint so long as plaintiffs also rely on \"other facts [that] provide an adequate basis for believing\u201d the allegations in the complaint. <em>Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 313-14 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see also Glaser v. The9, Ltd., </em>772 F.Supp.2d 573, 590 (S.D.N.Y.2011) <em>(\u201cNovak </em>removed a requirement that confidential sources be named when corroborative facts exist.\u201d). The TAC contains a multitude of corroborative facts that reinforce the claims made by the confidential sources. In any event, \u201ceven if personal sources must be identified, there is no requirement that they be named, provided they are described in the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged.\u201d <em>Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 313-14. Here, every confidential witness (with the sole exception of CW9 <em>(see </em>TAC 11 148)) is identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>by job title, office location, and duration of employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">. Defendants also argue that the sections of the TAC that rely on allegations put forth in other litigants\u2019 complaints should be disregarded or stricken. The Court disagrees. The authority on which Defendants anchor this argument emanates from <em>Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., </em>551 F.2d 887 (2d Cir.1976), which held that a plaintiffs pleadings could not reference a complaint that resulted in a consent decree. The Circuit\u2019s rationale was that the consent decree was inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 410; thus, the plaintiff could not derive any evidentiary benefit from the complaint that proceeded it. <em>Id. </em>at 893. The Circuit reiterated the strong presumption against striking portions of the pleadings and cautioned that its holding was limited to \u201cthe facts of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, some courts in this district have stretched the holding in <em>Lipsky </em>to mean that any portion of a pleading that relies on unadjudicated allegations in another complaint is immaterial under Rule 12(f). <em>See, e.g., RSM Prod. Corp. v. Fridman, </em>643 F.Supp.2d 382, 403 (S.D.N.Y.2009). Neither Circuit precedent nor logic supports such an absolute rule. Not all complaints are created equal \u2014 while some barely satisfy the pleading requirement, others are replete with detailed factual information of obvious relevance to the case at hand. To take but one example, the <em>Ambac </em>complaint cited in the TAC (\u00b6 87), recounts a detailed study by Ambac Assurance Corp. that revealed \u201cwidespread breaches of representations in almost 80 percent of the documents\u201d supporting the loans it reviewed. It makes little sense to say that information from such a study \u2014 which the TAC could unquestionably rely on if it were mentioned in a news clipping or public testimony \u2014 is immaterial simply because it is conveyed in an unadjudicated complaint. The other complaints on which the TAC relies are of a similar character. Accordingly, the Court will not strike references to them from the TAC. In any event, nothing rides on how much weight the Court gives the sections of the TAC that rely on other parties\u2019 pleadings. Even if the Court struck every such paragraph, the TAC would still contain sufficient factual allegations to plead claims under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. Defendants also argue that an unforeseen event- \u2014 namely, the housing collapse \u2014 and not the abandonment of underwriting standards caused the Certificates to decline in value. However, \"any decline in value is presumed to be caused by the misrepresentation in the registration statement.\u201d <em>McMahan &amp; Co. v. Wherehouse Entertainment, Inc., </em>65 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995). If Defendants wish to challenge that presumption they may present evidence at a later stage establishing an alternative cause of loss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">. Defendants' first argument-that, under SEC Rule 436(g), the ratings cannot be considered part of the Registration Statement and, thus, cannot be a basis for liability under Section 11 \u2014 is meritless. <em>See </em>SEC Rule 436(g)(1), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.436(g)(1) (\"the security rating assigned ... by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ... shall not be considered a part of the registration statement prepared or certified by a person within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Act.\u201d). Rule 436(g) was intended to shield the <em>Rating Agencies, </em>not the issuers who incorporate the ratings, from civil liability under Section 11. <em>See </em>SEC Release No. 33-6336, 46 Fed.Reg. 42024-01, 42024 (Aug. 18, 1981). <em>See also Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., </em>714 F.Supp.2d 475, 481 (S.D.N.Y.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b810-12\">. Section 230.408(a) provides in relevant part that: \"In addition to the information expressly required to be included in a registration statement, there shall be added such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\">. <em>See e.g., In re Morgan Stanley Mortg. Pass-Through Certificates Litigation, </em>810 F.Supp.2d 650, 672-73 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (dismissing claims based on conflict of interest between the MB.S issuers and Rating Agencies); <em>In re IndyMac Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation, </em>718 F.Supp.2d 495, 512 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (\"there was no duty to disclose the ratings agencies\u2019 conflicts of interest, as the information was known widely\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\">. <em>See, e.g., Plumbers\u2019 Union, </em>632 F.3d at 775 (\"ratings were not false or misleading because rating agencies should have been using better methods and data\u201d); <em>Tsereteli, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 395 (issuers had no obligation to disclose the Rating Agencies' models and methodologies).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\">. Defendants argue that even if the ratings were actionable misrepresentations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">the risk disclosures in the Offering Documents shield them from liability. <em>(See e.g., </em>SAMI 2006-AR5 Prosp. Supp. at S-22, Ex. L to Robins Deck (\"[t]he ratings of the offered certificates by the rating agencies may be lowered following the initial issuance thereof as a result of losses on the mortgage loans ... in excess of the levels contemplated by the rating agencies at the time of their initial rating analysis.\u201d).) They also argue that the ratings allegations constitute impermissible \"fraud by hindsight\u201d because Plaintiffs failed to plead facts demonstrating that the downgrades resulted from the disclosure of information regarding improper lending practices opposed to the housing market collapse. Neither argument is availing. The TAC suggests that Plaintiffs could plead facts sufficient to support an inference that the widespread violation of underwriting standards left the Certificates more vulnerable to economic shocks and that the inaccurate loan information relied upon in assigning the ratings resulted in assessments that significantly understated the risk that the underlying loans would experience high rates of delinquency or default. The boilerplate disclaimers notified Plaintiffs of the prospective risk that unforeseen events could cause rating downgrades; they did not disclose that the ratings in the Offering Documents were tainted by their reliance on deficient loan data. <em>See Rombach v. Chang, </em>355 F.3d 164, 173 (2d Cir.2004) (\"Cautionary words about future risk cannot insulate from liability the failure to disclose that the risk has [already] transpired.\u201d).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b812-10\">. In its order denying without prejudice Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the SAC, the Court granted Plaintiffs leave to file a final amended complaint. <em>(See </em>docket entry no. 133) However, given that the Court\u2019s order did not address Defendants\u2019 argumentation about the Certificate ratings, the Court deems it appropriate to give Plaintiffs another opportunity to amend the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\">. Defendants incorrectly claim that Plaintiffs fail to specify damages for SAMI 2006-AR5 and BALTA 2007-1. In fact, the TAC states quite clearly that the values of those Certificates dropped, from approximately $1 to $0.3586 and $0.3817, respectively. (TAC $\u00b6 19, 21.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b815-6\">. As the Fifth Circuit noted: \u201c[There are] difficulties ... investigating the underlying residential mortgages. Even the best due diligence may overlook problems. A mortgage may become delinquent from a single missed payment. Some of the loans might fall into delinquency during the pendency of the transactions leading to an investor's purchases. Because mistakes are inevitable, both seller and purchaser are protected by a promise that the mortgage pools will be free from later-discovered delinquent mortgages [by including the repurchase and substitute clause].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">. <em>Cf.

Defendants' argument also appears to be based on a false premise. While the point is not developed in Plaintiffs' briefs, the TAC pleads that a decline in value in the more junior tranches does, in fact, decrease the value of the higher tranches. <em>(See </em>TAC \u00b6 41 (\"Of course, because the lower tranches are designed to provide a cushion, diminished cash flow to the lower tranches results in impaired value of the higher tranches.\u201d).) <em>See also Pub.

If this is correct, purchasers of senior tranches are not merely part of the same case and controversy as purchasers of junior tranches \u2014 the former can also trace personal injury to declines in securities they did not hold. However, because the Court finds that there is a common case and controversy, it need not rely on this underdeveloped aspect of the record to find that named Plaintiffs have constitutional standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
