PRATTER, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AA0\">\n<em>I. Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">Indirect purchasers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of domestic eggs and egg products charge producers of those goods, and the producers\u2019 trade groups, with conspiring to manipulate the supply of, and thereby fix prices for, domestically-sold eggs and egg products. The Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (hereinafter, the \u201cIPSAC\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleges violations of federal and state law. The 22 state jurisdictions at issue geographically reach considerably farther than a rooster\u2019s most vigorous crows can be heard. In total, the IPSAC contains 51 claims: a Section 1 Sherman Act claim for injunctive relief, 20 state antitrust claims, 9 state consumer protection claims, and 21 state unjust enrichment claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-23\">In response, Defendants have jointly filed the Motion <em>sub judice </em>which tries to crack, if not wholly topple, most of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims by seeking full or partial dismissal of all counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants argue that the IPSAC is deficient in a number of ways, <em>inter alia, </em>lack of standing (in the various applications of that term) and failure to state a claim consistent with the demands of Rules 8 and 9(b). As outlined below and as delineated in the accompanying Order, the Court grants the Motion in part and denies it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-24\">\n<em>II. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-25\">This multidistrict litigation concerns numerous consolidated and coordinated actions based upon allegations of a conspira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>cy in violation of the Sherman Act among egg producers and trade groups to manipulate the supply of eggs and egg products and thereby affect the domestic prices of those goods. <em>See In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., </em>588 F.Supp.2d 1366, 1367 (J.P.M.L.2008). The plaintiffs are direct purchasers (such as grocery stores, commercial food manufacturers, restaurants, other food service providers, and other entities who purchase directly from Defendants or other egg producers) and indirect purchasers (individual consumers who purchased from other parties along the distribution chain) of eggs and egg products. The direct purchaser plaintiffs fall into additional categories: \u201cDirect Purchaser Plaintiffs\u201d who have brought a consolidated class action against Defendants, and \u201cDirect Action Plaintiffs\u201d who are pursuing individual actions against Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">In this Opinion the Court addresses one, albeit a multifaceted one, of the Defendants\u2019 pending motions to dismiss the IP-SAC.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court previously addressed motions to dismiss filed by virtually the same group of Defendants concerning the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. <em>See </em>Sept. 26, 2011 Mem. and Order, 821 F.Supp.2d 709 (E.D.Pa.2011) (Doc. Nos. 562 and 563); Oct. 14, 2011 Mem. and Order, 2011 WL 4945864 (Doc. Nos. 581 and 582); Nov. 30, 2011 Opinion and Order, 2011 WL 5980001 (Doc. Nos. 593 and 594). Much of the history and many of the dynamics of this litigation are outlined in detail in those prior decisions, and will not be repeated here except as appropriate and necessary predicates to the rulings here.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\"><em>III. Factual </em>Allegations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">As the parties are already well-aware, and indeed, have represented to the Court, the IPSAC alleges virtually the same underlying facts as the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, notwithstanding some (generally minor) factual distinctions, and as to be expected, authored in a different drafting style. Both pleadings set forth factual allegations concerning the Defendants\u2019 alleged conspiracy to decrease the supply of eggs and thereby increase egg prices, the Defendants\u2019 conduct undertaken in relation thereto, and the nature of the egg industry in terms of structure, production practices, and market dynamics. <em>See </em>Sept. 26, 2011 Mem. and Order, 821 F.Supp.2d at 712-16 (describing the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs \u2018core allegations\u2019). Although the two pleadings have much in common, they are nonetheless separate and distinct complaints, and the Court briefly outlines the IPSAC\u2019s main allegations as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Plaintiffs \u2014 to wit, 23 individuals and three corporations \u2014 bring this action on behalf of themselves individually and as class actions on behalf of other similarly situated indirect purchasers. These individual named Plaintiffs are residents of, or incorporated in, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin. IP-SAC \u00b6\u00b6 19-44. They each purportedly \u201cindirectly purchased shell eggs and/or egg products during the Class Period\u201d and suffered economic injury by paying \u201csupra-competitive prices for shell eggs and egg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>products\u201d as a result of the Defendants\u2019 alleged violations of federal and state law. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8,19-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Plaintiffs request federal injunctive relief pursuant to Section 16 of the Clayton Act on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class. As to the state law claims, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of members of the proposed classes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> seek a variety of remedies, including, <em>inter alia, </em>damages, restitution, and disgorgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">As alleged, the Plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state claims are based upon the Defendants\u2019 conduct relating to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aor\">a long-running conspiracy between and among Defendants and certain unnamed co-conspirators extending from at least January 1, 2000 through the present ... with the purpose and effect of fixing, raising, and maintaining and/or stabilizing prices and restricting output of both shell eggs and egg products (collectively, \u201ceggs\u201d) sold indirectly to Plaintiffs and other indirect purchasers in the United States, including the Class Jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEF\">IPSAC \u00b6 1; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 140. Defendants supposedly took \u201ccoordinated efforts\u201d to advance the aims of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 7. According to Plaintiffs, coordination among Defendants was facilitated by the trade group Defendants, United Egg Producers (\u201cUEP\u201d), United Egg Association (\u201cUEA\u201d), and United States Egg Marketers (\u201cUSEM\u201d); most of the other named Defendants are allegedly members of some of these groups. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b649, 51, 137, 255, 286. Many of the Defendants\u2019 decisions, discussions, and agreements concerning various aspects of the conspiracy apparently occurred at, or are connected to, these trade groups\u2019 committee and member meetings, and were communicated to Defendants through UEP\u2019s newsletter. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 143-47, 152-156, 158-167, 170, 173-76, 192-209, 212-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The Defendants\u2019 \u201ccoordinated efforts\u201d allegedly were mechanisms to reduce the supply of eggs in terms of either egg production or availability in the egg market. By reducing the supply of eggs, Defendants apparently sought to manipulate certain features of the domestic egg market as a means of increasing egg prices. Those market features include the price inelasticity of demand for eggs, the lack of product substitutes for eggs, minimal product differentiation among eggs, and industry consolidation. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 127-31. Because of these market features \u2014 and more particularly, the inelasticity of demand \u2014 \u201csmall reductions in supply can lead to sharp increases in egg prices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The specific \u201ccoordinated efforts\u201d undertaken throughout the alleged conspiracy period entailed various flock reduction, chick hatch reduction, molting, and hen disposal initiatives, as well as the adoption of and compliance with the United Egg Producers Certification Program and the United States Egg Marketers export program. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 170, 219, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The UEP Certification Program originated as an \u201canimal husbandry program\u201d that mandated lower cage space densities for hens, but evolved into a program whereby egg producers would comply with the Program\u2019s guidelines in order to be able to sell or market eggs with a logo indicating that the eggs were certified under the Program. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 158,160, 224, 298. The IPSAC alleges that initially</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adh\">[certification required a producer to (a) meet [a] cage space allowance ... [of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>an] average of 56 square inches per hen ...; (b) commit to meeting the guideline for beak trimming ...; (c) commit to meeting the guidelines for molting ...; (d) commit to meeting the guidelines for handling and transportation for both pullets and spent hens ...; (e) agree to be audited annually by a 3rd party independent auditor to confirm that the company is meeting guidelines; (f) agree to provide UEP with a copy of the audit results upon the completion of each audit; and (g) recognize that passing the audit is necessary in order to maintain the certification status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 159. The Certification Program\u2019s guidelines also required (or eventually came to require): reduction in chick hatch, 100% of an egg producers\u2019 egg production be in compliance with the guidelines, and a prohibition on the practice of \u201cbackfilling cages to replace mortality.\u201d <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 174-75, 202, 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The USEM export program \u201caimed to have its members export shell eggs even when the export prices were lower than domestic egg prices\u201d with the alleged purpose of \u201craising domestic U.S. prices through reduced supply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 240. One central feature of the export program was that \u201cUSEM members that did not provide eggs for the export would agree to \u2018repay1 or \u2018reimburse\u2019 the USEM members that provided eggs for the export in order to \u2018share\u2019 any losses incurred when exporting shell eggs at below-market prices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">As described in the IPSAC, the Defendants\u2019 \u201ccoordinated efforts\u201d enabled Defendants to realize the ultimate objectives of their conspiracy: decreased egg supply, and thus higher egg prices and greater revenues and profits. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 150, 181-83, 247, 312, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\"><em>IV. Legal </em>Standards<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">\n<em>A. Rule 12(b)(6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">For purposes of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and must construe the pleading in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. <em>Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Of course, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d providing the defendant \u201cfair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number><em>v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). This standard \u201cdoes not require \u2018detailed factual allegations,\u2019 \u201d but a \u201cpleading that offers \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Consistent with Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may consider the allegations contained in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, matters of public record and records of which the Court may take judicial notice. <em>See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rts., </em>551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007); <em>Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., </em>998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">A complaint need allege \u201conly enough facts to state a claim of relief that is plausible on its face\u201d so as to test whether \u201cplaintiffs ... have ... nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible\u201d to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Thus, a complaint is subject to dismissal when the plaintiff fails to plead \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">\n<em>B. Rule 9(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">To determine whether a particular claim is subject to and meets the Rule 9(b) pleading standard, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has held that \u201cwhere the plaintiff grounds [her] claims in allegations of fraud \u2014 and the claims thus \u2018sound in fraud\u2019 \u2014 the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) apply.\u201d <em>In re Suprema Specialties, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>438 F.3d 256, 270 (3d Cir.2006); <em>see also Cal. Pub. Emps.</em>\u2019 <em>Ret. Sys. v. Chubb Corp., </em>394 F.3d 126, 161-62 (3d Cir.2004). Conversely, \u201cclaims ... that do not sound in fraud are not held to the heightened pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).\u201d <em>In re Adams Golf, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>381 F.3d 267, 273 n. 5 (3d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Shapiro v. UJB Fin. Corp., </em>964 F.2d 272, 288 (3d Cir.1992)). However, there is no requirement that fraud or mistake be a necessary element of a <em>prima facie </em>claim in order for Rule 9(b) to apply. <em>See Chubb, </em>394 F.3d at 161 (discussing this law with respect to a section 11 Securities Act claim); <em>see also Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn cases where fraud is not a necessary element of a claim, a plaintiff may choose nonetheless to allege in the complaint that the defendant has engaged in fraudulent conduct. <em>In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the basis of a claim. In that event, </em>the claim is said to be \u2018grounded in fraud\u2019 or to \u2018sound in fraud,\u2019 and the pleading of that claim as a whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b).\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The Third Circuit Court of Appeals illustrated the application of this standard in the context of an antitrust claim in <em>Lum v. Bank of America, </em>361 F.3d 217 (3d Cir.2004), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., </em>618 F.3d 300, 323 n. 22 (3d Cir.2010). There, the Court of Appeals recognized that \u201cantitrust claims generally are not subject to the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b),\u201d but that Rule 9(b) applies when \u201c[f]raud is the basis for the antitrust violation alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. In <em>Lum, </em>the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant banks \u201callegedly violated the Sherman Act by agreeing to misrepresent the \u2018prime rate\u2019 [as] the lowest rate available to their most creditworthy borrowers, when in fact\u201d other lower rates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>below the prime rate were offered to certain other borrowers, and by allegedly giving \u201cfalse information about their \u2018prime rate\u2019 both to consumers who were seeking credit and to leading financial publications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. According to the plaintiffs, such alleged fraudulent conduct inflated the prime rate, and thereby resulted in the plaintiffs \u201cbeing charged higher interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals determined that the \u201cantitrust claim is ... based on fraud \u2014 on misrepresentations in the information given to consumers and on misrepresentations in the information given to ... independent financial publications,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 220, and \u201c[bjecause plaintiffs allege that the defendants accomplished the goal of their conspiracy through fraud, the Amended Complaint is subject to Rule 9(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228; <em>see also Insur. Brokerage, </em>618 F.3d at 347-48 (reaffirming the <em>Lum </em>rationale concerning the application of Rule 9(b) in an antitrust case).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">To satisfy the Rule 9(b) pleading requirements, a complaint may either describe \u201cthe circumstances of the alleged fraud with precise allegations of date, time, or place\u201d or may use \u201csome [other] means of injecting precision and some measure of substantiation into their allegations of fraud.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trs. of Teamsters Local 863 Pension Fund v. Foodtown, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 164, 172 n. 10 (3d Cir.2002) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Rolo v. City Investing Co. Liquidating Trust, </em>155 F.3d 644, 658 (3d Cir.1998), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by Forbes v. Eagleson, </em>228 F.3d 471, 483-84 (2000); <em>Seville Indus. Mach. Corp. v. Southmost Mach. Corp., </em>742 F.2d 786, 791 (3d Cir.1984). At the very least, \u201c[plaintiffs also must allege who made a misrepresentation to whom and the general content of the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Lum, </em>361 F.3d at 224. This pleading standard not only gives defendants notice of the claims against them, but also combats \u201cfrivolous suits brought solely to extract settlements\u201d from defendants and \u201cprovides an increased measure of protection for their reputations.\u201d <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1418 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">While a significant purpose of Rule 9(b) is to provide notice of the precise misconduct at issue, courts \u201cshould ... apply the rule with some flexibility and should not require plaintiffs to plead issues that may have been concealed by the defendants.\u201d <em>Rolo, </em>155 F.3d at 658. Accordingly, the particularity rule is somewhat relaxed when key factual information remains within the defendant\u2019s control. <em>Burlington Coat, </em>114 F.3d at 1418. \u201cRelaxation,\u201d however, does not translate into, or otherwise authorize, boilerplate and conclusory allegations, and plaintiffs \u201cmust accompany their legal theory with factual allegations that make their theoretically viable claim plausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Allegations \u201cbased upon information and belief\u2019 are permissible, \u201cbut only if the pleading sets forth specific facts upon which the belief is reasonably based.\u201d <em>Hollander v.

Quaker Oats Co., </em>129 F.3d 310, 319 (3d Cir.1997) (\u201c[A] boilerplate allegation that plaintiffs believe the necessary information \u2018lies in defendants\u2019 exclusive control,\u2019 if made, must be accompanied by a statement of facts upon which their allegation is based.\u201d) (quoting <em>Shapiro v.

In other words, even a \u201crelaxed fit\u201d requires some tailoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Likewise, Rule 8 continues to apply even when under Rule 9(b) \u201c[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\u2019s mind may be alleged generally.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). For purposes of its meaningful presence in Rule 9(b) the word \u201c \u2018generally\u2019 is a relative term\u201d and \u201cit is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1954. By way of example, \u201cRule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard.

Legal </em>Discussion<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">A. <em>Article III Standing as to Four State Antitrust Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Defendants contend that the 26 named Plaintiffs have no standing, as would be demanded by Article III of the Constitution, to pursue antitrust claims under the laws of Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to allege an injury that would provide a basis for constitutional standing to bring claims under those four states\u2019 antitrust laws. The defense argument is that the named Plaintiffs have \u201cfailed to show that they suffered any injury entitling them to bring the[ ] claims\u201d because no named Plaintiffs are alleged to reside, or to have purchased eggs, <em>in </em>those four states. Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Plaintiffs retort that the \u201cnamed [class] representatives meet normal standing re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>quirements,\u201d and that \u201ceach of the named Plaintiffs has been injured in the same way by the same conduct that has injured other members of the proposed classes.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 56-57 &amp; n. 39. Thus, the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that because Defendants have not objected to the named Plaintiffs\u2019 standing to pursue the IPSAC\u2019s federal antitrust claim and other state claims, and given that \u201ceach Plaintiff has standing to pursue an action under federal antitrust law and the laws of several states, there is no longer a question of the court having subject matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted by Plaintiffs on the basis of the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 58. Plaintiffs claim that \u201c[i]f a named plaintiff who has standing can, under Rule 23\u2019s criteria, represent the interests of out of state class members, then once the class is certified, a plaintiff from each state will be present and \u2018standing\u2019 will be established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. Plaintiffs contend that this reasoning leads to the conclusion that at the motion to dismiss stage \u201cit is not necessary that there be named plaintiffs in each state for which damages are sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Plaintiffs characterize the defense arguments as raising \u201cwhat are really [class] certification issues in the guise of standing at this point in the litigation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 57, particularly the adequacy of an out-of-state named Plaintiff to serve as class representative as to a particular state claim, <em>id. </em>at 56 n. 39; Tr. at 91:15-21. They assert that consideration of such issues should be deferred until the class certification stage of this litigation on the grounds that the issues are \u201cpremature because class certification issues are \u2018logically antecedent\u2019 to questions about standing in that ... the \u2018standing\u2019 asserted by Defendants would not exist but for Plaintiffs\u2019 asserting claims on behalf of a class.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 56-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Despite the divergent positions, amid the parties\u2019 arguments there is an apparent consensus that the Court may consider the standing of the <em>named Plaintiffs </em>at this time. Indeed, Defendants make this assertion outright, whereas embedded in the Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments is the contention that named Plaintiffs have standing to bring the four states\u2019 antitrust claims at this time and have alleged that they have suffered an injury. But, to the extent that Plaintiffs invoke \u201clogically antecedent\u201d language and charge that Defendants are actually raising questions as to the named Plaintiffs\u2019 adequacy as class representatives, they obfuscate the narrower issue raised by Defendants\u2019 motion, namely, whether the named Plaintiffs have alleged facts that plausibly demonstrate injury-in-fact sufficient to confer upon them individual Article III standing to bring antitrust claims under the laws of Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As to this actual issue presented as explained <em>infra, </em>the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>concludes that the named Plaintiffs have Article III standing to pursue causes of action under the four states\u2019 antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">\n<em>1. Requirements for Article III Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Generally, Article III standing is a threshold issue for any case, including class actions. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, </em>609 F.3d 590, 606 (3d Cir.2010). Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution limits the federal judicial power to the adjudication of \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d \u201cAbsent Article III standing, a federal court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to address a plaintiffs claims, and they must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Berg v. Obama, </em>586 F.3d 234, 242 (3d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.\u201d <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, </em>547 U.S. 332, 353, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006). Standing as to one claim is simply not \u201ccommunicative\u201d across other separate claims for relief. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>The \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum\u201d of Article III standing entails three elements. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Those constitutional standing requirements are: \u201c(1) an \u2018injury in fact\u2019; (2) \u2018a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court\u2019; and (3) a showing that it \u2018be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Physicians, Inc. v. President of United States, </em>653 F.3d 234, 238 (3d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560-61,112 S.Ct. 2130).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Of these three elements, Defendants here place only the injury-in-fact element at issue. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has articulated the nature of an injury that is sufficient to confer Article III standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-5\">To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must allege an injury that is both (1) \u2018concrete and particularized\u2019 and (2) \u2018actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u2019 Each of these definitional strands imposes unique constitutional requirements. An injury is \u201cconcrete\u201d if it is \u201creal,\u201d, or \u201cdistinct and palpable, as opposed to merely abstract,\u201d while an injury is sufficiently \u201cparticularized\u201d if it \u201caffect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\u201d The second requirement \u2014 \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\u201d \u2014 makes plain that if a harm is not presently or \u201cactually]\u201d occurring, the alleged future injury must be sufficiently \u201cimminent.\u201d Imminence is \u201csomewhat elastic,\u201d but requires, at the very least, that the plaintiffs \u201cdemonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury.\u201d In other words, there must be a realistic chance \u2014 or a genuine probability \u2014 that a future injury will occur in order for that injury to be sufficiently imminent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 238 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The consideration of the injury-in-fact element bears particular significance because the nature of a party\u2019s injury \u201cis relevant to the determination of whether she has \u2018alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979) (quoting <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962)); <em>see also Toll Bros., Inc. v. Township of Readington, </em>555 F.3d 131, 138 (3d Cir.2009) (\u201cWhile all three of these elements are constitutionally mandated, the injury-in-fact element is often determinative.\u201d). \u201cTo meet the standing requirements of Article III, \u2018[a] plaintiff must allege <em>personal injury </em>fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u2019 For our purposes, the italicized words in this quotation ... are the key ones. [This Court] ha[s] consistently stressed that a plaintiffs complaint must establish that he has a \u2018personal stake\u2019 in the alleged dispute, and that the alleged injury suffered is particularized as to him.\u201d <em>Raines v. Byrd, </em>521 U.S. 811, 818-19, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the Court\u2019s attention must turn to the named Plaintiffs to ask whether they have a personal stake sufficient to confer Article III standing based upon \u201ctheir specific allegations and the relief which they seek.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number><em>Goode v. City of Phila., </em>539 F.3d 311, 316 (3d Cir.2008) (citing <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 105-06, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">\n<em>2. Named Plaintiffs\u2019 Article III Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Defendants argue that all named Plaintiffs in this case lack Article III standing to pursue the four states\u2019 antitrust claims \u201cbecause they do not and cannot allege to have been injured under the laws of these jurisdictions.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 5. As a fundamental premise of their argument, Defendants claim that \u201ceach of the relevant states requires at least some part of the alleged injury to have occurred in that particular state,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 6, and Defendants further posit that meeting this in-state injury requirement can only be accomplished either by an allegation that named Plaintiffs are residents of, or actually purchased eggs in, those states. Here, the IPSAC does neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">While the Defendants\u2019 Motion only asks the Court to decide whether the named Plaintiffs have Article III standing as to the four specific state antitrust claims, their argument \u2014 by invoking elements of those claims and arguing that those elements impose certain in-state requirements as to injury \u2014 is pecking at similar, but conceptually distinct, questions. These questions ask whether Plaintiffs have a right to maintain a private enforcement action under the states\u2019 statutes, and whether the Plaintiffs have a cause of action \u2014 which, by way of example, may ask more specifically whether the alleged injury is legally and judicially cognizable. These inquiries go to issues of whether the states\u2019 statutes authorize these named Plaintiffs to sue, issues which are sometimes cloaked in terms such as \u201cstatutory standing\u201d or \u201cantitrust standing,\u201d and question whether the scope of the rights of action under the four states\u2019 antitrust statutes include the Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">The Supreme Court has drawn some distinctions among these concepts. In one opinion, the Court defined \u201cstanding\u201d and \u201ccause of action\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACA\"><em>standing </em>is a question of whether a plaintiff is sufficiently advers[e] to a defendant to create an Article] III case or controversy, or at least to overcome prudential limitations on federal-court jurisdiction; <em>cause of action </em>is a question of whether a particular plaintiff is a member of the class of litigants that may, as a matter of law, appropriately invoke the power of the court ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-13\"><em>Davis, </em>442 U.S. at 239 n. 18, 99 S.Ct. 2264 (citation omitted). The Court has generally described an issue of \u201cstatutory standing\u201d as involving whether a plaintiff comes \u201cwithin the \u2018zone of interests\u2019 for which the cause of action was available.\u201d <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 97, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (citing <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Assn. of R.R. Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453, 465 n. 13, 94 S.Ct. 690, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court has further clarified that \u201cthe merits inquiry [such as whether a private right of enforcement exists] and the statutory standing inquiry often \u2018overlap,\u2019 \u201d and that the \u201cquestion whether <em>this </em>plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute, and the question whether <em>any </em>plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute are closely connected \u2014 indeed, depending upon the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing, they are sometimes identical, so that it would be exceedingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>artificial to draw a distinction between the two.\u201d <em>Id. </em>97 n. 2, 118 S.Ct. 1003 (citation omitted). Nonetheless, questions of Article III standing are distinguishable from both concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Indeed, it is necessary for the Court to distinguish Article III standing issues from \u201cstatutory standing\u201d and cause of action issues because \u201cthe. question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief \u2018goes to the merits\u2019 in the typical case, not the justiciability of a dispute, and conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion.\u201d <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2355, 2362, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011) (citation omitted); <em>cf. Sullivan, </em>667 F.3d at 307 &amp; n. 35 (\u201cStatutory standing <em>[ie., </em>\u2018the possession of a viable claim or right to relief, not to a jurisdictional requirement,\u2019 \u201d]) is distinct from jurisdictional standing in that \u2018Article III standing is required to establish a justiciable case or controversy within the jurisdiction of the federal courts,\u2019 whereas \u2018lack of antitrust standing affects a plaintiffs ability to recover, but does not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.\u2019 (quoting <em>Gerlinger v. Amazon.com Inc., </em>526 F.3d 1253, 1256 (9th Cir.2008)); <em>id. </em>at 349 n. 15 (Jordan, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhether a party has standing under Article III is a distinct inquiry from whether the party may assert a cause of action under state or federal law.... [T]he Supreme Court made clear that a party may have standing under Article III, but fail to assert a cause of action under state law.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis continues: It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>i.e., </em>the courts\u2019 statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.... \u2018[J]urisdiction ... is not defeated ... by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.\u2019 Rather, the district court has jurisdiction if \u201cthe right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another,\u201d unless the claim \u201cclearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-9\"><em>Steel Co., </em>523 U.S. at 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003 (quoting <em>Bell v.

The Supreme Court has \u201ccriticized the implications of treating the validity of a cause of action as jurisdictional----Under that approach, each element of every cause of action would have a legitimate claim to being a jurisdictional requirement \u2014 essentially eviscerating the distinction between the jurisdictional and merits inquiry (and requiring a court to dismiss a claim for lack of jurisdiction whenever the plaintiff does not prevail).\u201d <em>Nesbit v. Gears Unlimited, Inc., </em>347 F.3d 72, 80 (3d Cir.2003) (citation omitted) (discussing <em>Steel Co., </em>523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003). An exception arises when a claim is \u201cso insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\u201d <em>Steel Co., </em>523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Nesbit, </em>347 F.3d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Thus, even if Defendants are correct that the four states\u2019 statutes require an intrastate injury \u2014 either due to in-state residency or in-state purchase of eggs\u2014 such an argument is beside the point. An <em>Article III </em>standing inquiry simply does not require considering the elements of a state claim as \u201cjurisdictional prerequisites.\u201d To inject the condition that Plaintiffs must satisfy certain elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>state antitrust claims into a constitutional standing analysis would result in an impermissible out-of-the-box merits inquiry. \u201c[T]he Article III requirement of remediable injury in fact ... (except with regard to entirely frivolous claims) has nothing to do with the text of the statute relied upon.\u201d <em>Steel Co., 523 </em>U.S. at 97 n. 2, 118 S.Ct. 1003.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">As it happens, the Article III constitutional standing criterion is met here as to the four states\u2019, antitrust claims. The IPSAC alleges that the named Plaintiffs paid artificially inflated prices for eggs because of the Defendants\u2019 conspiracy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That is, the named Plaintiffs allegedly personally purchased eggs at artificially inflated prices \u2014 a monetary injury \u2014 which constitutes actual harm. <em>Cf.

Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact .... \u201d). After all, \u201cMonetary harm is a classic form of injury in fact. Indeed, it is often assumed without discussion.\u201d <em>Danvers Motor Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>432 F.3d 286, 293 (3d Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Furthermore, this injury purportedly was caused by the Defendants\u2019 alleged conspiratorial conduct which named Plaintiffs complain violated the four states\u2019 laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">This injury can be redressed, if granted, by the relief sought by named Plaintiffs, which includes, <em>inter alia, </em>monetary damages to compensate for their financial harm as a result of conspiracy. <em>See, e.g., </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 9, C, D, E (describing relief requested).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Cf.

The defense argument that the named Plaintiffs lack injury sufficient to confer standing is contingent upon the claim that the four states\u2019 laws do not allow named Plaintiffs to recover for their alleged injuries arising from the Defendants\u2019 alleged conspiratorial conduct. Defendants argue that \u201ceach of the relevant states requires at least some part of the alleged injury to have occurred in that particular state,\u201d and Defendants cite to certain statutory language and one case in support of their construction of the laws. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 6 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">However, on their faces the four states\u2019 statutory provisions can plainly be construed to not require in-state residency or an in-state purchase, but rather only that some of the Defendants\u2019 conduct occurred, or the effects of which were felt, within the state \u2014 thereby violating the statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>deed, when read literally, the language of these respective provisions authorizes broad private enforcement, and thereby can be read to afford relief to all persons whose injuries may have occurred outside of the state, but are causally related to an antitrust violation. As to these four statutes, Defendants fail to discount the existence of possible constructions of those statutes other than their own. They cite no legal authority to support their construction of the statutes, nor do they point to legal authority foreclosing alternative interpretations of those states\u2019 laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">For example, under the Iowa Competition Law, \u201c[t]he state or a person who is injured or threatened with injury by conduct prohibited under this chapter may bring suit\u201d for various specified forms of relief. Iowa Code \u00a7 553.12. Such prohibited conduct includes a \u201ccontract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons shall not restrain or monopolize trade or commerce in a relevant market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 553.4. These provisions can be read to permit a broad class of persons to maintain a civil enforcement action so long as they suffer an injury resulting from a violation of the law. Upon an unadorned reading of the Competition Law, and contrary to the Defendants\u2019 position, a cognizable injury under the statute does not appear to be exclusively restricted to injuries of residents, or injuries sustained intrastate.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The North Dakota Antitrust Act contains similarly broad language: \u201c[a] person threatened with injury or injured in that person\u2019s business or property by a violation of this chapter may bring an action for appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief, [and] damages sustained.\u201d N.D.

As with the Iowa Competition Law, a cognizable injury does not appear to be restricted to residents\u2019 injuries, or injuries experienced due to transactions occurring within North Dakota\u2019s borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">South Dakota\u2019s antitrust law also grants a private right of action for a person injured by a violation of that antitrust provision and does not contain statutory language that explicitly requires an intrastate injury. Under that law, \u201c[a] person injured in his business or property by a violation of this chapter may bring an action for appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief, damages sustained and, as determined by the court, taxable costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>See </em>S.D. Codified Laws \u00a7 37-1-14.3. The law also provides: \u201cA contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons in restraint of trade or commerce <em>any part of which </em>is within this state is unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 37-1-3.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Furthermore, as to these three states\u2019 antitrust laws, there is a dearth of interpretative authority with respect to whether and to what extent, if any, there is an \u201cintrastate\u201d requirement as to a presumptive plaintiffs injury in order for that injury to be cognizable. With respect to the Iowa Competition Law specifically, one commentator notes that an \u201cunusual feature of both Sections 4 and 5 of the Iowa Competition Law is their explicit reference to \u2018relevant market,\u2019 which is defined in Section 3 of the law to mean \u2018the geographical area of actual or potential competition in a line of commerce, all or any part of which is within this state.\u2019 Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>the phrase \u2018potential competition\u2019 nor the phrase \u2018within this state\u2019 is statutorily defined or judicially interpreted as yet ....

Indeed, the ellipses in the quote stand in the place of the words \u201cby Microsoft.\u201d That is, the <em>Microsoft </em>Court determined that Mississippi requires some of the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>conduct offensive to the antitrust statute be \u201cperformed wholly intrastate.\u201d Moreover, the decision simply does nothing to support the Defendants\u2019 contention as to the permissible scope of a presumptive plaintiffs injuries for recovery under the law. Whether a defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>need be \u201cperformed wholly intrastate\u201d is an entirely distinct issue from whether a plaintiffs <em>injury </em>need to have occurred <em>in-state </em>\u2014 ie., where the <em>effect </em>of the conduct transpires. Defendants raise no legal authority other than <em>Microsoft </em>to support their construction of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">In sum, it appears that there is an absence of definitive legal authority as to whether <em>vel non </em>an extraterritorial injury that might be traced to an antitrust violation is cognizable under the Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota antitrust statutes. Either construction of those four laws is possible and neither can</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">be said to be strained or without appropriate attribute. Indeed, some \u201c[sjtate antitrust laws can extend to transactions involving interstate commerce\u201d and \u201csome state statutes, or judicial interpretations of those provisions may expressly address the extraterritorial effects of a state\u2019s antitrust law.\u201d 1 ABA Section of Antitrust Law, <em>Antitrust Law Developments, </em>625 (6th ed. 2007). Moreover, the existence of these statutory construction issues certainly suggests that the named Plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to these states\u2019 antitrust laws cannot be deemed foreclosed by case law, or otherwise completely devoid of merit. <em>See Nesbit, </em>347 F.3d at 80 (\u201c \u2018[Dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not appropriate merely because the legal theory alleged is probably false, but only because the right claimed is so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware Cnty., </em>983 F.2d 1277, 1280-81 (3d Cir.1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). And, accordingly, the Plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring these claims, and the Court denies the Defendants\u2019 motion in this respect.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\"><em>B. Utah Antitrust </em>Claim<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>The Court concludes that it is appropriate to dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 Utah antitrust claims arising from damages that occurred before May 1, 2006. According to Defendants, May 1, 2006 is the effective date of an amendment to the Utah Antitrust Act \u2014 specifically to amend Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-10-918(1) \u2014 which authorized indirect purchasers to recover for violations of the Act. Such statutory provisions are sometimes known in antitrust parlance as an <em>\u201cIllinois Brick </em>repealer\u201d amendment because such plaintiffs could not, or were not explicitly authorized by law to, recover prior to the amendment. Several courts have observed the nature of the Utah amendment is akin to an <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer. <em>See California v. Infineon Techs. AG, </em>No. C 06-4333, 2008 WL 1766775, at *4-5 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 15, 2008) (concluding that the amendment to the Utah Antitrust Act was an <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer and \u201cthat indirect purchaser standing was not available prior to 2006\u201d); <em>In re Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) Antitrust Litig., </em>2010 WL 5094289, at *6 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 8, 2010) (reaching the same conclusion). In Utah, a \u201cstatute is not to be applied retroactively unless the statute expressly declares that it operates retroactively.\u201d <em>Goebel v. Salt Lake City S. R.R. Co., </em>104 P.3d 1185, 1197-98 (Utah 2004). Defendants contend that because the Utah Antitrust Act did not permit indirect purchasers to recover for antitrust injuries prior to the amendment\u2019s effective date, dismissal of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for damages suffered pri- or to May 1, 2006 is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Plaintiffs do not dispute the Defendants\u2019 characterization of Utah law in any of the aforementioned respects; nor do they dispute the cited legal authority. Indeed, Plaintiffs do not raise any challenge to the defense contention that Plaintiffs cannot recover for claims arising from damages accruing before May 1, 2006 under the Utah Antitrust Act. Accordingly, the Court determines that it is appropriate to grant the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Utah Antitrust Act arising from damages that occurred prior to May 1, 2006.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">\n<em>C.

The IPSAC defines egg products as \u201ceither shell eggs substitutes such as liquid, frozen, and dry eggs, or manufactured products incorporating processed eggs such as baked goods and mayonnaise.\u201d IPSAC \u00b6 124. Defendants seek to partially dismiss certain of the Plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state antitrust claims with respect to alleged injuries relating to purchases of manufactured products incorporating processed eggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In response, Plaintiffs agree that the IPSAC definition of egg products is \u201coverly inclusive\u201d by including \u201cmanufactured products incorporating processed eggs such as baked goods and mayonnaise,\u201d and further \u201cagree to limit the scope of egg products in this action to \u2018shell substitutes such as liquid, frozen, and dry eggs,\u2019 the portion of the definition of egg products set forth in the [IPSAC] that Defendants do not challenge.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Mot. at 62. Given the Plaintiffs\u2019 agreement to narrow the definition, the Court grants without prejudice the Defendants\u2019 Motion as to this issue. Plaintiffs may seek leave to proceed with their proposed amendment with the appropriate motion or equivalent procedure to achieve pleading precision on this point as by for example, stipulation, and the Court expects that the amendment or stipulation will be respectful of the discussions among counsel on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">\n<em>D. Separate Egg Products Conspiracy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have alleged a separate conspiracy relating to egg products which should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. However, because this challenge hinges \u2014 at least to some degree \u2014 upon the definition of \u201cegg products\u201d in the IPSAC, and given that the definition of egg products will be amended pursuant to Plaintiffs\u2019 aforementioned agreement to do so, it would be improvident for the Court to consider this argument at this time in the absence of the actual amendment or stipulation.

Plaintiffs counter by arguing that the Defendants\u2019 alleged antitrust violations are the grounds for their UCL claim, and that the requisite alleged antitrust violation is the unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Indeed, antitrust violations can constitute \u201cunfair competition\u201d under the UCL. <em>See Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health &amp; Welfare Plan v.

Defs.\u2019 Reply at 8. Be that as it may, the Defendants do not demonstrate that such circumstances exist here, and they do not identify such additional elements for a UCL claim arising from an alleged antitrust violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">The Court agrees that it is an analytically sensible and entirely fair operation of pleading standards and substantive law to conclude that the IPSAC\u2019s allegations giving rise to alleged antitrust violations also give rise to the Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim. Plaintiffs have alleged that they suffered injury in fact and lost money or property due to the Defendants\u2019 practices of \u201cunfair competition.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>IPSAC \u00b6 332 (\u201cAs a direct and proximate result of Defendants\u2019 unlawful practices, including combinations and contracts to restrain trade and allocate relevant markets, Plaintiff [and class members] have been injured in their business and/or property in that they paid more for shell eggs and egg products than they otherwise would have paid in the absence of Defendants\u2019 unlawful conduct.\u201d). The IPSAC alleges, supported by other factually specific allegations concerning the contours of the conspiracy, that Defendants committed \u201cunlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act[s] or practiees[s] in violation of\u2019 the UCL by \u201cengaging in a continuing unlawful trust and concert of, the substantial terms of which were to fix, raise, stabilize, and maintain prices of, allocate markets for, and restrain and manipulate the supply of shell eggs and egg products at supra-competitive levels.\u201d IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 329-30. More specifically, such conduct entails the Defendants purportedly advancing the goals of their antitrust conspiracy through eight alleged \u201ccollective actions,\u201d which included various flock reduction and early molting initiatives, and actions taken in connection with the United Egg Producers Certification Program and the United States Egg Marketers export program. Whatever else it may be, if it occurred, the unlawful price-fixing alleged in the IPSAC surely would constitute unfair competition within the meaning of the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Defendants have not contended that the IPSAC fails to allege an antitrust violation for purposes of bringing a UCL claim (except with respect to injuries relating to certain egg products), nor have they raised any arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege their separate California antitrust claim under Section 16720, California Business and Professions Code. <em>See </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 325-28. Thus, the Defendants\u2019 argument does not support the conclusion that Plaintiffs have failed to meet the Rule 8 pleading requirements as to their UCL claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Contrary to the Defendants\u2019 contention otherwise, case law from the Third Circuit does not require that the heightened pleading standard under Rule 9(b) be applied to the Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim. This particular alleged violation of the UCL is simply not grounded in fraud nor does it \u201csound in fraud.\u201d The Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim arises from the alleged conduct\u2014 namely, the alleged conspiracy to reduce the supply of eggs as allegedly advanced by the eight collective actions \u2014 which, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>alleged, is not based on fraudulent acts.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As such, the UCL claim does not entirely rely on a course of fraudulent conduct, in contrast to the Third Circuit\u2019s <em>Lum </em>case, so as to require the application of Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">As to the Defendants\u2019 second challenge to the Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged their eligibility for seeking restitution. The California Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">Restitution under section 17203 [of the UCL] is confined to restoration of any interest in \u201cmoney or property, real or personal, which may have been <em>acquired </em>by means of such unfair competition.\u201d (Italics added.) A restitution order against a defendant thus requires both that money or property have been lost by a plaintiff, on the one hand, and that it have been acquired by a defendant, on the other.... But the economic injury that an unfair business practice occasions may often involve a loss by the plaintiff without any corresponding gain by the defendant, such as, for example, a diminishment in the value of some asset a plaintiff possesses. <em>(See Overstock.com, Inc. v. Gradient Analytics, Inc. </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 716, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 29 [a plaintiff who alleged that a defendant\u2019s defamatory statements diminished its assets and reduced its market capitalization adequately alleged UCL standing]; <em>Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1240, 1262, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 521 [a plaintiff whose home and car were vandalized by defendant animal rights protesters adequately alleged lost property under Prop. 64].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-9\"><em>Kwikset Corp., </em>120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d at 895 (parentheticals and brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Thus, the issue at hand is whether Plaintiffs have connected their alleged loss\u2014 which they claim is the loss of \u201cmoney by paying more than they should have for eggs as a result of Defendants\u2019 unfair method of competition,\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 24\u2014 with a \u201ccorresponding gain\u201d by and of the Defendants. Defendants argue that while such a gain might be demonstrated by alleging that Plaintiffs \u201cpurchased eggs originating from any of the Defendants,\u201d Plaintiffs have failed to do so. Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 33. For example, an allegation that a plaintiff \u201cpaid money to a retailer to purchase [defendant] Microsoft\u2019s product based on false or misleading statements on the product package\u201d would demonstrate eligibility for restitution because it can be inferred that the plaintiffs\u2019 payment for the product to the retailer benefitted Microsoft. <em>Shersher v. Superior Court, </em>154 Cal.App.4th 1491, 65 Cal.Rptr.3d 634, 636 (Cal.Ct.App.2007). Presumably, Defendants here argue that these Plaintiffs have not met the <em>Shersher </em>standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">However, legal authority also exists to propose that a \u201ccorresponding gain\u201d may be able to be a more broadly-defined benefit conferred upon the defendant by a plaintiff. <em>Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc., </em>171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 90 Cal.Rptr.3d 589 (Cal.Ct.App.2009), reflects reasoning that restitution under the UCL applies traditional restitution principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-12\">\u201c \u2018A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>quired to make restitution to the other.\u2019 (Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 1.) \u2018A person is enriched if he receives a benefit at another\u2019s expense. <em>(Id., </em>com. a, p. 12.) The term \u201cbenefit\u201d \u201cdenotes any form of advantage.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>com. b, p. 12.) Thus, a benefit is conferred not only when one adds to the property of another, but also when one saves the other from expense or loss. Even when a person has received a benefit from another, he is required to make restitution \u201conly if the circumstances of its receipt or retention are such that, as between the two persons, it is unjust for him to retain it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>com. c, p. 13.)\u2019 <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli </em>[14 Cal.4th 39, 57 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 924 P.2d 996 (Cal.1996) ]) \u2018For a benefit to be conferred, it is not essential that money be paid directly to the recipient by the party seeking restitution.\u2019 <em>(California Federal Bank v.

As discussed in greater detail <em>infra, </em>in relation to the arguments focused on the Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims \u2014 and specifically the general discussion concerning the conferral of benefits upon Defendants<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u2014 there are factual allegations in the IPSAC that suggest that Defendants acquired a \u201ccorresponding gain\u201d resulting from the Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged purchase of eggs at an over-inflated price due to the Defendants\u2019 alleged unfair business practice. <em>See </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 332-34.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, at this time, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for restitution under the UCL must be dismissed. The Court denies the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">\n<em>2. District of Columbia</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Defendants contest the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection and Procedures Act (\u201cDCCPPA\u201d) for failure to state a claim under the pleading standards of Rules 8 and 9(b) because, according to Defendants, \u201cmore than simply the elements of an antitrust violation\u201d must be alleged. Defendants also argue that a DCCPPA claim requires pleading unconscionable conduct but the IPSAC fails to sufficiently plead that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">The DCCPPA prohibits \u201cunlawful trade practices.\u201d The Act defines \u201ctrade practice\u201d to be \u201cany act which does or would create, alter, repair, furnish, make available, provide information about, or, directly or indirectly, solicit or offer for or effectuate, a sale, lease or transfer, of consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>goods or services.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 28-3901(a)(6). The Act enumerates a nonexclusive list of specific practices that constitute violations of the Act. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 28-3904; <em>District Cablevision Ltd. Partnership v. Bassin, </em>828 A.2d 714, 723 (D.C.2003). Additionally, \u201cthe statute obviously contemplates that procedures and sanctions provided by the Act will be used to enforce trade practices made unlawful by other statutes.\u201d <em>See Atwater v. District of Columbia Dept. of Consumer &amp; Regulatory Affairs, </em>566 A.2d 462, 466 (D.C.1989); <em>see also Bassin, </em>828 A.2d at 723 (\u201cTrade practices that violate other laws, including the common law, also fall within the purview of the CPPA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Just as the California UCL encompasses violations of the California antitrust law, violations of the District of Columbia Antitrust Act of 1980, D.C.Code \u00a7 28-4501, <em>et seq., </em>can constitute unlawful trade practices within the purview of the DCCPPA. <em>See Marbry v.

Plaintiffs have alleged that their DCCPPA claim is based upon the alleged antitrust violation. <em>See, e.g., </em>IPSAC \u00b6 340-41 (alleging that \u201cDefendants agreed to, and did in fact, act in restraint of trade or commerce by unfairly and deceptively fixing, raising, stabilizing, and maintaining prices of, allocating markets for, and restraining and manipulating the supply of shell eggs and egg products at supracompetitive levels\u201d and that this \u201cconduct constitutes \u2018unlawful trade practices\u2019 \u201d under the DCCPPA).

Consequently, both of the Defendants\u2019 arguments \u2014 that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for relief consistent with the demands of Rule 8 and that Plaintiffs \u201cmust plead that the defendant engaged in \u2018unconscionable\u2019 conduct\u201d under the DCCPPA \u2014 are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Furthermore, the Court\u2019s reasoning as to why a Rule 9 pleading standard does not apply to the Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim applies to the DCCPPA claim as well. The Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for the DCCPPA violation is based upon factual allegations that do not entirely rely on fraud, and thus the Plaintiffs\u2019 DCCPPA claim does not sound in fraud so as to require the application of Rule 9 under Third Circuit case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Neither of the Defendants\u2019 objections to the Plaintiffs\u2019 DCCPPA claim are meritorious, and the Court denies the Defendants\u2019 Motion as to the Plaintiffs\u2019 DCCPPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">\n<em>3.

Antitrust violations constitute FDUTPA violations, in part, because \u201csection 501.204(2) provides that in determining what constitutes an \u2018unfair method of competition\u2019 under subsection 501.204(1), \u2018due consideration and great weight shall be given to the interpretations of the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts relating to s. 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1).\u2019 Section 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act encompasses violations of the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Mack, </em>673 So.2d at 104. It follows that Florida law recognizes that a FDUTPA claim may arise from a violation of antitrust laws such as the Sherman Act and other state antitrust laws because such a violation in and of itself is an unfair method of competition. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>F.T.C. v.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57-12-3. The Act separately defines both \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practice\u201d and \u201cunconscionable trade practice,\u201d but the Court need evaluate only the latter concept in order to resolve this Motion. The NMUPA defines an \u201cunconscionable trade practice\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-12\">an act or practice in connection with the sale, lease, rental or loan, or in connection with the offering for sale, lease, rental or loan, of any goods or services, including services provided by licensed professionals, or in the extension of credit or in the collection of debts that to a person\u2019s detriment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-13\">(1) takes advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience or capacity of a person to a grossly unfair degree; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-14\">(2) results in a gross disparity between the value received by a person and the price paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">N.M. Stat. \u00a7 57-12-2(E) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">These provisions of the NMUPA appear largely undeveloped, and there is only sparse case law that has addressed either of the two definitions of \u201cunconscionable trade practice.\u201d The law has developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>enough, however, for the Court to appreciate that an inquiry into either definition is necessarily fact-intensive, and a multitude of factors may be appropriate for consideration as to whether an act or practice is an \u201cunconscionable trade practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">For example, as to the second definition of an \u201cunconscionable trade practice\u201d involving \u201cgross disparity\u201d between price paid and \u201cvalue received,\u201d Defendants have argued that in <em>Hernandez v. Wells Fargo Bank N.M., N.A., </em>139 N.M. 68, 128 P.3d 496, 499 (N.M.Ct.App.2005), the Court\u2019s single use of \u201cbenefit received\u201d in place of \u201cvalue received\u201d is meaningful. <em>See id. </em>(concluding that Plaintiff \u201cdoes not raise an evidentiary issue that there was a gross disparity between the overdraft fee and the benefit received\u201d). That is, according to Defendants, <em>\u201cvalue </em>received\u201d is defined as <em>\u201cbenefit </em>received.\u201d Expanding upon this notion, Defendants argue that, assuming the truth of the IPSAC\u2019s allegations, the pleading highlights that egg consumers actually receive the benefit of the bargain even when purchasing eggs at certain artificially elevated prices because there are \u201cmany benefits of eggs\u201d and the <em>high </em>inelasticity of consumer demand serves to reflect consumers\u2019 perceived benefits from eggs. Defs.\u2019 Reply at 17 (citing IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 127, 145, 181); <em>see also </em>IPSAC \u00b6 128. In economic terms, Defendants appear to argue that consumers derive a high level of utility from eggs, and that this utility is the measure of \u201cbenefit received\u201d and, thus, of \u201cvalue received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">However, the Defendants\u2019 reading of <em>Hernandez </em>and arguments based upon that reading are not entirely, much less inexorably, justified. Rather, the <em>Hernandez </em>usage of \u201cbenefit received\u201d can be read as merely a synonym for \u201cvalue received,\u201d not intended to convey any substantive difference of \u201cmessage.\u201d Indeed, although the <em>Hernandez </em>Court uses the term \u201cbenefit received,\u201d it does not further elaborate or provide any discussion that might illuminate the meaning of the term, including whether <em>vel non </em>it implicates consumer utility.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">At this time, the Court need only address whether the IPSAC\u2019s allegations plead the second definition of \u201cunconscionable trade practice\u201d under the NMUPA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>In this respect, Plaintiffs plead that the act or practice that constitutes the unconscionable trade practice in violation of the NMUPA is that \u201cDefendants agreed to, and did in fact, act in restraint of trade or commerce by unfairly and deceptively fixing, raising, stabilizing; and maintaining prices of, allocating markets for, and restraining and manipulating the supply of shell eggs and egg products at supracompetitive levels.\u201d IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 440-41. The IPSAC alleges that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of\u2019 that conduct, \u201cPlaintiff and the New Mexico Indirect Purchaser State Class have been injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 445. The IPSAC alleges that Plaintiffs \u201chave been injured in their businesses and property in that they have paid more for shell eggs and processed egg products than they otherwise would have paid in the absence of Defendants\u2019 unlawful conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 314; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 8 (alleging that the injury is the payment of \u201csupra-competitive prices for shell eggs and egg products\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Defendants quantify the alleged artificially-inflated price increase by example, alleging that Defendants attributed their alleged export program \u2014 one of the eight collective actions allegedly advancing the conspiracy to reduce the supply of eggs \u2014 to a 40% increase in the domestic prices of eggs. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6247 (\u201cAs the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>reported on September 23, 2008: The industry group [UEP] itself credited the [export] campaign with helping to boost domestic egg prices, which rose more than 40% in the next year.\u201d). In light of these allegations, and given this early stage of the litigation, the Court concludes that dismissal of the NMUPA'-claim as a matter of law is not warranted at this time.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">The case law discussed above demonstrates that a fact-intensive inquiry is required to determine whether Defendants\u2019 engaged in conduct related to the sale of eggs that resulted in a \u201cgross disparity\u201d between the benefit received and the price paid. Moreover, although Defendants have proposed one approach to pleading gross disparity (one not entirely supported by the legal authority cited), they have not identified any case law specific to the NMUPA that has held that gross disparity between value received and price paid cannot be sufficiently pled based upon factual allegations that Plaintiffs paid artificially-inflated prices for eggs as a result of a supply-side price-fixing conspiracy.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Indeed, there is case law that has concluded otherwise. Several federal courts that have considered similar factual allegations (some even less specific than those in the IPSAC) have determined that such allegations are sufficient to state a NMU-PA claim based upon gross disparity and are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>See, e.g., TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1127 (denying motion to dismiss NMUPA claim based upon allegations that \u201cdefendants\u2019 conspiracy resulted in significant artificial increases in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>price of LCDs, which resulted in a \u2018gross disparity\u2019 between the value received by the New Mexico plaintiff and class and the prices paid by them for LCD\u201d); <em>Chocolate, </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 586 (determining allegations that plaintiffs \u201cpaid \u2018artificially inflated prices for\u2019 chocolate candy products ..., that defendants stabilized prices at noncompetitive levels ..., and that plaintiffs \u2018paid more for [chocolate candy] products than they would have paid in the absence of [the alleged] antitrust violations,\u2019 \u201d were adequate to plead a claim under the NMUPA); <em>Aftermarket Fitters, </em>2009 WL 3754041, at *9 (\u201c[Plaintiffs plead that they paid \u2018supra-competitive\u2019 prices for the filters they received.

They argue that Plaintiffs do not state such a claim for relief because, <em>inter alia, </em>the IPSAC does not contain factual allegations that plausibly suggest that the conduct purported to be the basis for the Section 349 claim caused the Plaintiffs\u2019 harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">General Business Law \u00a7 349 prohibits \u201c[deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state.\u201d N.Y.

As the Court of Appeals of New York has summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">A plaintiff under section 349 must prove three elements: first, that the challenged act or practice was consumer-oriented; second, that it was misleading in a material way; and third, that the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the deceptive act.

In addition, a plaintiff must prove \u201cactual\u201d injury to recover under the statute, though not necessarily pecuniary harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-10\">Further, as we have repeatedly stated, reliance is not an element of a section 349 claim.

However, this theory does not plainly emanate from the actual allegations pled by the Plaintiffs as to the Section 349 claim as articulated in the IPSAC. To the extent that the IPSAC arguably invokes concepts of \u201chiding\u201d and \u201cpretext,\u201d it appears that to do so Plaintiffs primarily rely on the vague, convenient catch-all adverb \u201cdeceptively\u201d that does appear in their pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The IPSAC alleges that \u201cDefendants agreed to, and did in fact, act in restraint of trade or commerce by unfairly and <em>deceptively </em>fixing, raising, stabilizing, and maintaining prices of, allocating markets for, and restraining and manipulating the supply of shell eggs and egg products at supracompetitive levels.\u201d IPSAC \u00b6 454 (emphasis added). As alleged, this \u201cknowing and willful conduct of the Defendants ... constitutes materially misleading consumer-oriented deceptive acts or practices within the meaning of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 349 [because] Defendants\u2019 actions materially misled New York consumers and resulted in consumer injury and broad adverse impact on the public at large, and harmed the public interest of New York State in an honest marketplace in which economic activity is conducted in a competitive manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 455. According to the IPSAC, \u201c[a]s a result of Defendants\u2019 illegal conduct Plaintiffs and members of the New York Indirect Purchaser State Class paid supra-competitive, artificially inflated prices for shell eggs and egg products\u201d and Plaintiffs are \u201cseeking actual damages only for their injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 457-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Plaintiffs defend these allegations by claiming that there is case law to suggest that allegations that plead \u201cin a conclusory fashion that defendants engaged in deceptive conduct\u201d in order to conceal the alleged price-fixing conspiracy satisfies the requisite pleading standard. Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 25. But this argument is at odds with and is directly contradicted by the principle that in order to sufficiently plead a claim a plaintiff must provide \u201cmore than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (citation omitted). Certainly, \u201c[w]hile legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1950. Arguably, some factual allegations in support of the Section 349 claim that are not conclusory may be nesting in the IPSAC \u2014 but it is not clear from the IPSAC or the Plaintiffs\u2019 briefing on which precise factual allegations the Section 349 claim relies (and, accordingly, whether they plausibly suggest a Section 349 claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Regardless, there are insufficient factual allegations in the IPSAC to plausibly suggest that the alleged \u201chiding\u201d of the antitrust conspiracy from Plaintiffs through pretextual explanations for rising egg prices actually caused the Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury. \u201c[W]hile the statute does not require proof of justifiable reliance, a plaintiff seeking compensatory damages must show that the defendant engaged in a material deceptive act or practice that caused actual, although not necessarily pecuniary, harm.\u201d <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v.

Indeed, as this articulation of the Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 349 claim demonstrates, Plaintiffs would have paid artificially-inflated egg prices <em>before </em>Defendants allegedly began to offer pretextual reasons for those increases. Moreover, there are no factual allegations, or causation theories proffered, by Plaintiffs that would suggest that the Defendants\u2019 alleged misleading conduct caused artificially-inflated egg prices <em>after </em>the challenged conduct allegedly occurred. Because this element of a Section 349 claim has not been sufficiently pled, Plaintiffs cannot have stated a claim that Defendants have violated Section 349 for purposes of meeting the demands of Rule 8.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Court grants without prejudice the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">\n<em>8. North Carolina</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Defendants urge that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under Section 75-1.1 of the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\u201cUDTPA\u201d) be dismissed on the grounds that the IPSAC does not allege facts suggesting that a plaintiff detrimentally relied on a deceptive statement or misrepresentation. They assert this claim is deficiently pled under Rules 8 and 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Section 75-1.1 of the UDTPA provides: \u201cUnfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are declared unlawful.\u201d N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-l.l(a). Certain violations of state and federal law can constitute a <em>per se </em>violation of Section 75-1.1. <em>See generally </em>Noel L.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-12\">Highly persuasive to us is the fact that the substantive provisions of the North Carolina act are reproduced <em>verbatim </em>from \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1), and that the North Carolina Supreme Court, consistent with that observation, had held that \u201c[b]ecause of the similarity in language, it is appropriate for us to look to the federal decisions interpreting the FTC Act for guidance in construing the meaning of ... \u00a7 75-1.1.\u201d Of course, it is an accepted tenet of basic antitrust law that \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>mission Act sweeps within its prohibitory scope conduct also condemned by \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-4\"><em>ITCO Corp., </em>722 F.2d at 48 (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Apart from <em>per se </em>violations, plaintiffs have alternative recourse in pleading a <em>prima facie </em>UDTPA violation in terms of \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d and \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d The UDTPA distinguishes between these two concepts. <em>See Henderson v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>346 N.C. 741, 488 S.E.2d 234, 239 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">As for the latter concept, to set forth the elements for a <em>prima fade </em>claim of \u201cunfair or deceptive practices,\u201d North Carolina law requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that: \u201c(1) defendant committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) the action in question was in or affecting commerce, and (3) the act proximately caused injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Dalton v. Camp, </em>353 N.C. 647, 548 S.E.2d 704, 711 (2001) (citing <em>Spartan Leasing Inc. v. Pollard, </em>101 N.C.App. 450, 400 S.E.2d 476, 482 (N.C.Ct.App.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">As to the former concept, according to the Court of Appeals of North Carolina, \u201c[n]o precise definition of \u2018unfair methods of competition\u2019 as used in [Section 75-1.1] exists.\u201d <em>United Laboratories, Inc. v.

Rather, a case-by-case assessment is required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay4\">Unfair competition has been referred to in terms of conduct \u201cwhich a court of equity would consider unfair.\u201d ... Thus viewed, the fairness or unfairness of particular conduct is not an abstraction to be derived by logic. Rather, the fair or unfair nature of particular conduct is to be judged by viewing it against the background of actual human experience and by determining its intended and actual effects upon others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-10\"><em>Id.; see also Universal Furniture Intern., Inc. v. Collezione Europa USA, Inc., </em>618 F.3d 417, 439 (4th Cir.2010) (\u201cAs used in the UDTPA, the words \u2018unfair methods of competition\u2019 encompass \u2018any conduct that a court of equity would consider unfair.\u2019 ... More specifically, a \u2018practice is unfair if it is unethical or unscrupulous, and it is deceptive if it has a tendency to deceive.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Polo Fashions, Inc. v. Craftex, Inc., </em>816 F.2d 145, 148 (4th Cir.1987))).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">The Defendants\u2019 objections to the UDT-PA claim are based entirely upon the contention that Plaintiffs must allege their reliance on a defendant\u2019s statement or misrepresentation and have failed to do so. This argument directly invokes a <em>prima facie </em>claim for an \u201cunfair or deceptive practice.\u201d However, as the foregoing summary of North Carolina law concerning the UDTPA demonstrates, a Section 75-1.1 claim may also arise in the form of a <em>per se </em>violation, such as a violation of the Sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>man Act, or an \u201cunfair or deceptive practice,\u201d which defies a precise legal test. As such, for a Section 75-1.1 violation, a plaintiff is not always obligated to plead allegations of reliance on a statement or misrepresentation, and therefore, the Defendants\u2019 argument does not compel dismissal as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Furthermore, given that a violation of the Sherman Act constitutes a <em>per se </em>violation of Section 75-1.1, and acknowledging that Defendants have not raised any arguments on the grounds that Plaintiffs entirely have failed to sufficiently allege federal antitrust violations, for that reason alone the motion to dismiss this claim cannot succeed. A fair reading of the IPSAC\u2019s allegations suggests that the Defendants\u2019 alleged federal antitrust violation is the basis for the Section 75-1.1 claim. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 4-5; IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 466-67, 469 (alleging that \u201cDefendants agreed to, and did in fact, act in restraint of trade or commerce by unfairly and deceptively fixing, raising, stabilizing, and maintaining prices of, allocating markets for, and restraining and manipulating the supply of shell eggs and egg products at supraeompetitive levels .... \u201d and that the \u201cDefendants\u2019 unlawful practices, including combinations and contracts to restrain trade and allocate the relevant markets\u201d constitutes the violation of Section 75-1.1).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Thus, it is appropriate to deny the Defendants\u2019 motion as to the Section 75-1.1 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">\n<em>9.

Plaintiffs have brought those claims under the laws of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">At the outset, the Court notes that the <em>prima facie </em>elements for various state unjust enrichment claims are not entirely birds of a feather. That is, it is well-accepted that the \u201celements necessary to allege unjust enrichment vary state by state.\u201d <em>Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 541 (citing <em>Powers v. Lycoming Engines, </em>245 F.R.D. 226, 230-31 (E.D.Pa.2007), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>328 Fed.Appx. 121 (3d Cir.2009) (unpublished); and Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 1 (1937)); <em>see also SMW, </em>737 F.Supp.2d at 424. Nonetheless, the common denominator is the shared principle that it is unjust for a defendant who is enriched at the expense of the plaintiff to accept and retain the ill-gotten benefit. <em>See Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 541; <em>SMW, </em>737 F.Supp.2d at 424; <em>see generally </em>Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 1; Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 1 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">As to virtually each of the Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims \u2014 excepting those brought under the laws of Arizona, North Dakota, and Tennessee \u2014 the IPSAC poses the following three cookie-cutter allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-7\">A. By engaging in the unlawful conduct described herein, Defendants received higher prices for their eggs that were sold to indirect purchasers in the <em>[Name of State </em>] than would have been possible absent the illegal conduct. <em>See, e.g., </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 333, 345, 353.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-8\">B. The Defendants were able to achieve their increased revenues and profits from their sales of eggs to <em>[Name of State </em>] indirect purchasers because the demand for eggs by indirect purchasers is relatively price inelastic, as Defendants understood. Thus, the ability of Defendants to profit from then-sales of eggs to indirect purchasers in <em>[Name of State </em>] was connected to and due to the increased prices paid for Defendants eggs by indirect purchasers in <em>[Name of State]. See, e.g., </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 334, 346, 354.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-9\">C. Defendants were enriched by their illegal activities at the expense of <em>[Name of State </em>] indirect purchasers of eggs and thus Defendants should be ordered to make restitution for the benefit of <em>[Name of State ] </em>indirect purchasers because it would be unjust to allow Defendants to retain the benefits of their sales of eggs at illegally inflated prices. <em>See, e.g., </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 335, 347,355.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Defendants raise several arguments for dismissal of the unjust enrichment claims \u2014 some specific to certain state\u2019s laws and others more broadly generalized to the law of several states. The Court addresses these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">\n<em>1.

Plaintiffs have stated that they \u201cdo not contest dismissal of the North Dakota claims for unjust enrichment.\u201d Pis. Resp. at 52 n. 34. Therefore, the Court grants the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim under North Dakota law, and will proceed to discuss in this decision the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining 20 unjust enrichment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>\n<em>2. Unjust Enrichment as an Independent Cause of Action: California and Mississippi</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Defendants claim that neither the laws of California nor Mississippi recognize unjust enrichment as an independent cause of action. Rather, in those states, Defendants contend, the principles of unjust enrichment apply only as a measure of damages. Plaintiffs defend the IPSAC by asserting that both of these states\u2019 courts recognize a separate cause of action for unjust enrichment. The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs\u2019 position on this point is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">California courts, including the Supreme Court of California, have acknowledged that parties may pursue causes of action arising from an unjust enrichment claim under California law. <em>See, e.g., Ghirardo v.

Yet even Defendants concede that there are \u201ceases that have allowed unjust enrichment causes of action\u201d in California. Defs.\u2019 Reply at 27. Given that California courts have not uniformly or definitively barred an independent cause of action for unjust enrichment, this Court cannot agree with Defendants that as a matter of law Plaintiffs may not pursue an unjust enrichment claim under California law. The Court will permit this claim to move ahead, and denies the Motion as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Likewise, with respect to Mississippi, there is considerable authority that supports the existence of an independent state law claim for unjust enrichment. <em>See, e.g., Owens Corning v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>868 So.2d 331, 342-43 (Miss.2004) (evaluating whether a Mississippi unjust enrichment claim survives summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>judgment); <em>Omnibank of Mantee v. United Southern Bank, </em>607 So.2d 76, 92-93 (Miss.1992) (summarizing Mississippi case law as to guiding principles pertaining to an unjust enrichment claim); <em>Dorsey Miss. Sales, Inc. v. Newell, </em>251 Miss. 77, 168 So.2d 645, 651 (1964) (discussing Mississippi law as to an unjust enrichment claim based upon quasi-contract theory). One federal district court recently examined the precise issue <em>sub judice </em>with a thoughtful survey of Mississippi law, as applied by Mississippi courts and federal courts sitting in diversity, and concluded that \u201cthere is a substantial body of Mississippi case law that treats unjust enrichment as a separate cause of action.\u201d <em>See In re Light Cigarettes Mktg. Sales Practices Litig., </em>751 F.Supp.2d 183, 194-95 (D.Me.2010). This Court embraces that district court\u2019s sound analysis and ultimate conclusion of law by reference here. <em>See id. </em>at 193-96. Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss as a matter of law the Plaintiffs\u2019 Mississippi unjust enrichment claim on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">\n<em>3. Absence of Adequate Remedy at Law: 10 Jurisdictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Defendants move to dismiss the unjust enrichment claims under the laws of 10 states- \u2014 -Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and Vermont \u2014 on the grounds that Plaintiffs have failed to allege the absence of an adequate remedy at law. According to Defendants, the absence of an adequate remedy at law is a\u2019 \u201cnecessary element\u201d of an equitable claim for unjust enrichment under these states\u2019 laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">As discussed above, the elements necessary to establish an unjust enrichment vary state by state, and some jurisdictions require proof of elements that others do not require. Consequently, an evaluation of the Defendants\u2019 argument simply requires determining whether the absence of an adequate remedy at law is actually an element of the <em>prima facie </em>case for unjust enrichment under the law of a given state \u2014 for which Plaintiffs would have the burden of proof. Some jurisdictions may only recognize this legal precept as an affirmative defense or some other equitable consideration,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> while others may not embrace it in any form.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">If the first scenario applies, the Plaintiffs must plead that element of the <em>prima facie </em>claim under state law. If the latter several scenarios apply, Plaintiffs have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>obligation to plead the unavailability of an adequate remedy at law. Certainly, when a jurisdiction does not recognize such a legal principle in the context of unjust enrichment, it need not be pled. And even if a jurisdiction recognizes an adequate remedy at law as an affirmative defense or equitable consideration, a plaintiff does not carry the burden of proof, and furthermore generally has no obligation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 to anticipate and plead in opposition to that defense \u2014 except, perhaps, when the defense will be an inevitable response given what is pled on the face of the complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a); Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1276 (recognizing that pleading \u201callegations that seek to avoid or defeat a potential affirmative defense ... are not an integral part of the plaintiffs claim for relief and lie outside his or her burden of pleading\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1226 (\u201cThe pleader must be careful not to allege facts that constitute a defense to his claim for relief .... A complaint containing [such] a built-in defense usually is vulnerable under Rule 12(b)(6) to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d); <em>see also Rycoline Prods., Inc. v. C &amp; W Unlimited, </em>109 F.3d 883, 886 (3d Cir.1997) (acknowledging that an affirmative defense must be apparent on the face of the complaint to be subject to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Furthermore, under any of the aforementioned scenarios, that a complaint alleges an unjust enrichment claim and also brings alternative claims for relief that might constitute adequate remedies at law is of no consequence under the pleading constraints of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 8 allows plaintiffs to plead claims in the alternative despite inconsistencies \u201cin both legal and factual allegations.\u201d <em>Indep. Enters. Inc. v. Pittsburgh Water and Sewer, </em>103 F.3d 1165, 1175 (3d Cir.1997); see Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(d)(2), (3). The Rule \u201chas been interpreted to mean that a court may not construe a plaintiffs first claim as an admission against another alternative or inconsistent claim.\u201d <em>Indep. Enters., </em>103 F.3d at 1175 (internal quotations and brackets omitted). It follows that regardless of <em>whether or not </em>a jurisdiction requires proving the absence of an adequate remedy at law as part of the <em>prima facie </em>claim for unjust enrichment, an unjust enrichment claim cannot be deficient on the grounds that the complaint also alleges claims at law for alternative forms of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">As a starting point, the Court concludes that the absence of an adequate remedy at law is <em>not </em>an element of the <em>prima facie </em>case for unjust enrichment under the laws of 9 of the jurisdictions at issue \u2014 Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and Vermont.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>fendants have cited no authority that disturbs this conclusion. It follows that Plaintiffs are not required to plead factual allegations suggesting such an absence as to those states\u2019 unjust enrichment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">As to the jurisdiction of Arizona, the Court determines that the absence of an adequate remedy at law is a <em>prima facie </em>element of a claim for unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Plaintiffs must allege facts which, taken as true, plausibly suggest this element of the claim in order to survive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim dependent upon Arizona state law.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The Defendants\u2019 argument thus follows that the IPSAC\u2019s allegations specific to Arizona are insufficient to comply with the Plaintiffs\u2019 obligation to plead that \u201cthey lack an adequate remedy at law.\u201d The IPSAC\u2019s allegations as to Arizona specifically plead:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">The enrichment of Defendants that occurred because of Defendants\u2019 illegal activities was without legally cognizable justification. <em>To the extent legal remedies do not sufficiently accomplish disgorgement </em>of Defendants\u2019 illegal profits from their sales to indirect purchasers in Arizona, Defendants should be ordered to make restitution for the benefit of Arizona indirect purchasers because it would be unjust to allow Defendants to retain the benefits of their sales of eggs at illegally inflated prices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 324 (emphasis added). In light of Rule 8(d)(2)\u2019s permissiveness of alternative pleading, given the IPSAC\u2019s italicized language above, and allowing for all inferences to be drawn in favor of Plaintiffs, the Court cannot rule as a matter of law that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly suggest that there is an absence of an adequate remedy at law. The factual allegations in the IPSAC are consistent with the absence of an adequate remedy at law as to the recovery of either all or part of the Defendants\u2019 enrichment as connected to the Plaintiffs\u2019 impoverishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">In sum, the Court denies the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the 10 state unjust enrichment claims on the grounds of the availability of an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">\n<em>4. Benefit of Bargain: 20 Jurisdictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Defendants attack generally all 20 of the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining unjust enrichment claims on the grounds that unjust enrichment is unavailable as an \u201cindependent cause of action\u201d when Plaintiffs have received the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d for which they contracted. Based upon the lone two cases Defendants cite as authority for their argument, the Court discerns that Defendants are invoking the principle embodied in Section 107(1) of Restatement (First) of Restitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-11\">A person of full capacity who, pursuant to a contract with another, has performed services or transferred property to the other or otherwise has conferred a benefit upon him, is not entitled to compensation therefor other than in ac- , cordance with the terms of such bargain, unless the transaction is rescinded for fraud, mistake, duress, undue influence or illegality, or unless the other has failed to perform his part of the bargain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax0F\"><em>See also New Motor Vehicles, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 210 (citing same); <em>Intel Corp., </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 421 (citing same).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">However, Defendants do not raise appropriate grounds for such a dismissal because their argument is based upon what is essentially a model law rather than actual law. Beyond raising the principle, as articulated by the First Restatement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>and broadly contending that it should be the basis for dismissing all 21 unjust enrichment claims, Defendants have not cited any jurisdiction-specific authority to demonstrate that any of the 21 jurisdictions have actually adopted this legal principle as part of their unjust enrichment jurisprudence. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that all of those jurisdictions might have adopted the principle, Defendants have not established whether those jurisdictions apply it in the manner that Defendants propose. As repeated (and, indeed, already demonstrated) above, states have differing bodies of law on unjust enrichment. Because Defendants have expressed their argument in terms of a model principle of unjust enrichment \u2014 as opposed to the actual law of the 21 jurisdictions at issue\u2014 the Court determines that it cannot dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims on these conceptual grounds as a matter of law. The Court denies the motion in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">\n<em>5. Exhaustion of Remedies: Tennessee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Under Tennessee law, although Plaintiffs \u201cneed not be in privity with a defendant to recover under a claim of unjust enrichment,\u201d Plaintiffs must allege that they have exhausted all remedies against parties with whom Plaintiffs were in privity of contract. <em>Freeman Indus., LLC v. Eastman Chem. Co., </em>172 S.W.3d 512, 525 (Tenn.2005); <em>see also Paschall\u2019s, Inc. v. Dozier, </em>219 Tenn. 45, 407 S.W.2d 150, 155 (1966) (\u201c[Bjefore recovery can be had against the landowner on an unjust enrichment theory, the furnisher of the materials and labor must have exhausted his remedies against the person with whom he had contracted, and still has not received the reasonable value of his services.\u201d). Alternatively, such exhaustion need not be demonstrated \u201cif the pursuit of the remedies would be futile.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>172 S.W.3d at 526; <em>see also Window Gallery of Knoxville v. Davis, </em>No. 03A01-9906-CH-00225, 1999 WL 1068730, at *2, *4 (Tenn.Ct.App. Nov. 24, 1999) (observing the same). According to Defendants, dismissal of the Plaintiffs\u2019 Tennessee unjust enrichment claim is warranted because Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that plausibly suggest either the satisfaction of the \u201cexhaustion-of-remedies element\u201d or the futility of such remedial efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Courts interpreting Tennessee law have found that remedial efforts are futile in several kinds of circumstances. For example, one Tennessee court has held that remedial efforts are futile when a plaintiff can demonstrate that the party with whom it was in privity of contract is \u201cjudgment proof.\u201d <em>See Bank of Nashville v. Chipman, </em>No. M2010-01581-COA-R3-CV, 2011 WL 3433012, at *5-6 (Tenn.Ct.App. Aug. 5, 2011). In that case, the plaintiff bank had entered into a loan agreement with a husband who never repaid the loan and then transferred all of his personal assets, except for his IRA, to his wife. <em>Id. </em>at *5-6. The appellate court recognized that there was sufficient evidence that the husband had no personal assets, and hence sufficient evidence of futility, and upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that the wife was unjustly enriched. <em>Id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Some federal courts sitting in diversity have found that consumer plaintiffs have adequately pled futility of pursuing remedies under Tennessee law by alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the resellers of a product <em>(\u25a0i.e., </em>the parties in privity of contract with plaintiffs) were not involved in the producer defendants\u2019 price-fixing conspiracy, and thus not liable for or the cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged losses resulting from that conspiracy. <em>See TFT-LCD (Flat Panel), </em>599 F.Supp.2d 1179, 1192-93 (N.D.Cal.2009); <em>In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., </em>749 F.Supp.2d 224, 242 (M.D.Pa.2010). Plaintiffs argue that these cases are instructive here, and the Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>The IPSAC sets forth factual allegations that plausibly suggest that Plaintiffs suffered losses due to the Defendants\u2019 alleged conspiracy to reduce the supply of eggs and thereby increase egg prices, and the Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct in furtherance of that conspiracy. Plaintiffs have also alleged that \u201cthe parties from whom indirect purchasers bought the eggs directly were not, so far as indirect purchasers are aware, a party to, or involved in, the Defendants\u2019 illegal activities which caused the increased egg prices to Tennessee indirect purchasers.\u201d IPSAC \u00b6 505. In light of these facts pled, Plaintiffs have plausibly suggested that'the pursuit of any remedies against the parties from whom they directly purchased eggs (and thus presumably with whom Plaintiffs were in privity of contract) would be futile because those parties are, as alleged, not directly or indirectly liable for the Plaintiffs\u2019 losses due to their lack of involvement in the conspiracy. <em>Cf. TFT-LCD (Flat Panel), </em>599 F.Supp.2d at 1192-93 (\u201cPlaintiffs respond that futility is self-evident in these circumstances where the alleged price-fixing was done by the defendants in the manufacture of LCD panels and LCD products, and there has been no allegation that the resellers were involved in the conspiracy. The Court agrees that under the facts alleged in the complaint, futility is evident.\u201d).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Accordingly, the Court denies the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Tennessee unjust enrichment claim on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">\n<em>6. Unjust Enrichment Claim Prior to May 1,2006: Utah</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">In tandem with their previously-discussed argument that the Utah Antitrust Act does not permit indirect purchasers to recover damages accruing before May 1, 2006, Defendants also claim that the Plaintiffs\u2019 Utah claim for unjust enrichment arising from conduct occurring prior to May 1, 2006 should be dismissed. It appears that Defendants are contending that, as a general rule of thumb, indirect purchasers should be barred from pursuing an unjust enrichment claim in those jurisdictions where indirect purchasers cannot obtain relief under that jurisdiction\u2019s antitrust and/or consumer protection laws due to lack of standing or otherwise. Defendants contend that Utah qualifies as one such jurisdiction \u2014 at least prior to the May 1, 2006 effective date of the Utah Antitrust Act amendment that provides for indirect purchaser recovery under the Act. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-10-918. To be clear, Defendants do not challenge the Plaintiffs\u2019 pursuit of an unjust enrichment claim for alleged conduct that occurred on or after May 1, 2006. Thus, Defendants are only challenging the temporal scope of the Utah unjust enrichment claim and seeking partial dismissal of this claim.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>At this time, the Court does not find that the Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim for conduct occurring before May 1, 2006 must be dismissed as a matter of law. Simply put, Defendants have not presented this issue to the Court in a manner conducive to resolution. Indeed, no party has called upon any legal authority specific to Utah law on this issue, and this issue, by involving questions of common law preclusion and conflicts with statutory law, is one that must be addressed by examining the specific body of law of the jurisdiction at issue. <em>See Erie, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817 (requiring federal courts to apply the substantive law of the state in which the claim arose).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">This analytical approach should not be remarkable given that courts have approached similar questions as to a particular jurisdiction\u2019s preclusion of an unjust enrichment claim in the context of indirect purchasers by examining the law of the specific jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig., </em>241 F.Supp.2d 563, 565 (D.Md.2003) (concluding that because a Kentucky court \u201cheld that a more specific statute controls over a more general one [under Kentucky law],\u201d \u201ca claim for damages for antitrust violations cannot be asserted under the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act where they cannot be asserted under Kentucky\u2019s version of the Sherman Act\u201d and \u201c[t]his same reasoning equally applies to a common law claim for unjust enrichment arising from antitrust violations\u201d); <em>In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig., </em>401 F.Supp.2d 461, 464 (D.Md.2005) (determining that \u201cthe specific bar on indirect purchaser recovery incorporated into South Carolina\u2019s antitrust statutes prohibits Plaintiffs general common-law claim [for unjust enrichment]\u201d because South Carolina law recognizes that \u201cWhere conflicting provisions exist, the last in point of time or order of arrangement prevails.... Specific laws prevail over general laws\u201d); <em>Aikens v. Microsoft Corp., </em>159 Fed.Appx. 471, 477 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished) (analyzing Louisiana\u2019s Civil Code, which provides that \u201cthe unjust enrichment remedy is \u2018subsidiary\u2019 in nature and \u2018shall not be available if the law provides another remedy for the impoverishment or declares a contrary rule\u2019 \u201d and recognizing that \u201cthe [indirect purchaser] plaintiffs cannot sue to recover monetary damages under Louisiana antitrust law\u201d to conclude plaintiffs \u201ccannot employ a subsidiary unjust enrichment claim to circumvent this rule\u201d); <em>cf. Mack v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., </em>673 So.2d at 103 (concluding that the \u201cDTPA should ... be construed harmoniously and consistently with the Florida legislature\u2019s clear intent to allow only direct purchasers to sue for alleged price-fixing conspiracies\u201d because the Florida Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[c]ourts should avoid a construction which places in conflict statu[t]es which cover the same general field\u201d; rather, where two statutes \u201crelat[e] to the same purpose they should be construed in harmony\u201d) (quoting <em>City of Boca Raton v. Gidman, </em>440 So.2d 1277, 1282 (Fla.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Defendants have referenced \u2014 through citation rather than analytical discussion\u2014 the rationales of several federal courts in support of their argument. Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 43 (citing <em>Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 541-43; <em>Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v.

By invoking those authorities, Defendants appear to rely on those cases\u2019 expression of the general principle \u2014 albeit, a principle not based upon or attributed to the laws of any specific jurisdictions \u2014 that a common law claim cannot circumvent, \u201cend run,\u201d undermine, or subvert a statute. <em>See, e.g., Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 542 (\u201cCertain states have adopted <em>Illinois Brick </em>and deny indirect purchaser plaintiffs recovery under them state antitrust statutes. These states have adopted the policy of <em>Illinois Brick </em>to allow only direct purchasers, and not indirect purchasers, to recover from a defendant for antitrust violations. Allowing indirect purchasers to recover and recoup a benefit from the defendant under an unjust enrichment theory would circumvent the policy choice of <em>Illinois </em>Brick.\u201d); <em>TFT-LCD (Flat Panel), </em>599 F.Supp.2d at 1191 (recognizing that \u201ca number of cases ... stand for th[e] general proposition\u201d that indirect purchasers \u201cmay not circumvent the restrictions on antitrust claims under [certain states] by reframing those claims as unjust enrichment actions\u201d); <em>see also New Motor Vehicles, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 209 (recognizing that permitting \u201cfreestanding\u201d unjust enrichment claims \u201ccould result in restitution undermining another body of substantive law, to the extent that the scope of antitrust laws and consumer protection statutes is designed to permit unfettered economic activity in matters that are not within their proscription\u201d; and that permitting \u201cparasitic\u201d unjust enrichment claims \u201cwould subvert the statutory scheme to allow these same indirect purchasers to secure, for the statutory violation, restitutionary relief at common law (or in equity)\u201d).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">However, even if the general principles, as expressed by those cases, are recognized across various state jurisdictions, that does not mean that a given jurisdiction, such as Utah, has adopted a particular legal principle or whether that principle is the only guidance that bears consideration. <em>Compare </em>2B N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 50.1 (7th ed. 2008) (\u201cIn cases of conflict between legislation and the common law, legislation governs because it is the latest expression of the law.\u201d) <em>with id. </em>(\u201cWhere there is a limitation by statute which is capable of more than one construction the statute must be given that construction which is consistent with common law.... The legislature is presumed to know the common law before a statute was enacted. Absent an indication that the legislature intends a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>to supplant common law, courts should not give it that effect.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">The cases upon which Defendants rely in no way indicate how <em>Utah law </em>treats the interplay between its statutory and common law schemes, and when common law might be precluded by statute (and statutory interpretation). There is specific Utah law concerning statutory construction. <em>See, e.g., </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-3-1, 68-3-2 (before and after May 11, 2010 amendment); <em>Daniels v. Gamma West Brachytherapy, LLC, </em>221 P.3d 256, 270 (Utah 2009) (\u201cA statute preempts a common law claim by specifically adopting a limitation or prohibition on a claim or by comprehensively addressing a particular area of law such that it displaces the common law.\u201d). Furthermore, unjust enrichment claims have deep roots in Utah law both pre-and post-dating <em>Illinois Brick. See, e.g., Baugh v. Darley, </em>112 Utah 1, 184 P.2d 335, 337-40 (1947); <em>Desert Miriah, Inc. v. B &amp; L Auto, Inc., </em>12 P.3d 580, 582-83 (Utah 2000). Defendants have not broached such matters; nor have they addressed whether or what role, if any, equity and the court\u2019s jurisdiction in equity might bear upon or play in determining the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Moreover, Defendants have not established that the law of Utah ever affirmatively adopted the rationale of <em>Illinois Brick </em>as a \u201cpolicy\u201d, statute, or otherwise prior to May 1, 2006. <em>Cf. In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig., </em>127 F.Supp.2d 702, 723 (D.Md.2001) (\u201cSome states ... have adopted the policy that .... \u2018[allowing [plaintiffs] to sue under [the state deceptive trade practices act] on allegations that are virtually identical to the antitrust allegations ... would essentially permit an end run around the policies allowing only direct purchasers to recover under the Antitrust Act.\u2019 ... Nevertheless, this policy has not been universally adopted.... In my judgment, [defendant] Microsoft paints with too broad a brush in seeking to extend this policy to states that have not affirmatively adopted it.\u201d (internal citations omitted)).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Likewise, Defendants have not addressed whether the specific amendments to the Utah Antitrust Act have any bearing on this issue. <em>See, e.g., </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-10-918 (\u201cActions may be brought under this section regardless of whether the plaintiff dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant. This remedy is an additional remedy to any other remedies provided by law.

But in the absence of analysis of any of these matters or in the context of any law specific to Utah, the Court cannot meaningfully discern their implications, and thus cannot appropriately or confidently rule as a matter of law on the partial dismissal of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Therefore, the Court denies the Defendants\u2019 motion in this respect.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">7. <em>Standing to Assert Unjust Enrichment Claim for Egg Products: New York</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim under New York law fails insofar that the Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged losses resulting from \u201cegg products\u201d purchases of \u201cmanufactured products incorporating processed eggs such as baked goods and mayonnaise\u201d are too remote to support such a claim. Defendants previously objected under <em>Associated General Contractors </em>to the breadth of the IPSAC\u2019s definition of \u201cegg products\u201d due to its inclusion of \u201cmanufactured products incorporating processed eggs,\u201d and now invoke those arguments as grounds for dismissing the Plaintiffs\u2019 New York unjust enrichment claim as to injuries due to purchases of \u201cmanufactured products incorporating processed eggs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">As previously discussed, Plaintiffs have agreed to narrow the IPSAC\u2019s definition of \u201cegg products\u201d to not include \u201cmanufactured products incorporating processed eggs,\u201d and because this definition is central to the Defendants\u2019 arguments, the Court will refrain from considering the Defendants\u2019 argument at present without the actual amendment. Consequently, Court denies the Motion without prejudice to Defendants to raise these grounds for dismissal of the New York unjust enrichment claim based upon the amended definition of \u201cegg products\u201d as may then become appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">\n<em>8. Benefits Conferred on Defendants: 16 Jurisdictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">All parties agree that an unjust enrichment claim under the laws of 16 jurisdictions \u2014 the District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014 requires Plaintiffs to plead as an element of the claim that they conferred a benefit upon Defendants. However, the parties dispute two matters concerning the requisites for pleading this element as to the 16 claims: (1) whether the IPSAC is devoid of factual allegations that Plaintiffs <em>conferred any </em>benefit upon Defendants; and (2) whether 10 of the 16 jurisdictions at issue require (or likely would require) the conferral of a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d as opposed to an \u201cindirect benefit.\u201d The Court discusses these narrow issues in turn.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">\n<em>a. Factual Allegations of Any Benefit Conferred</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">Defendants claim that the IPSAC does not allege that Plaintiffs conferred <em>any </em>benefit upon Defendants, and as a result, all 16 claims are deficient. Defendants initially posit that the only way to satisfy this element is for Plaintiffs to allege that they either \u201c(1) purchased eggs that originated from Defendants\u2019 birds or (2) purchased eggs directly from Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>dants.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 23-24. According to Defendants, these are the only types of allegations that can show that Plaintiffs conferred a benefit on Defendants for purposes of the law of each of the 16 jurisdictions. As the parties\u2019 briefing proceeded, Defendants recalibrated and narrowed their original argument. Nonetheless, this argument in its original and modified forms does not provide appropriate grounds for dismissal of the 16 claims at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">To start, Defendants failed to cite any persuasive legal authority in support of them initial claim that the two particular types of factual allegations as to the origin of the eggs purchased are necessary in all 16 jurisdictions at issue. Defendants have generally cited in a footnote one case per jurisdiction only to show that \u201ca claim for unjust enrichment requires a plaintiff to plead and prove that it conferred a benefit upon the defendant.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 44. Instead, Defendants have only cited <em>Myzel v. Fields, </em>386 F.2d 718, 744 n. 21 (8th Cir.1967), for the proposition that \u201cPlaintiffs fail to meet this requirement [of pleading the conferral of benefit element] because no named Plaintiff alleges that it purchased eggs originally for any of the Defendants, let alone a specific Defendant.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 44. Relying on the Restatement (First) of Restitution, <em>Myzel </em>merely articulates the observation that \u201can action for money had and received or for unjust enrichment differs at common law from tortious conversion primarily on the basis that all the defendants may be held jointly liable in tort, while only those who have benefited are liable, and then only to the extent thereof, in an action for unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744 n. 21. The case simply does not do the legwork that is necessary to support Defendants\u2019 argument specific to each of the 16 jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Although Defendants appear to narrow the issue presented in their reply brief, the recalibrated argument does not comport with the IPSAC\u2019s allegations. Defendants raise no objections to the Plaintiffs\u2019 rebuttal that it is unnecessary to plead factual allegations concerning specifics about the origins of their purchases and that the 16 jurisdictions are permissive in allowing the \u201cconferral\u201d to be non-monetary form of advantage. Indeed, Defendants accept this proposition of law, stating that \u201crestitution is typically available where' \u2014 -to take a textbook example \u2014 a doctor provides medical assistance to the incapacitated victim of an automobile accident.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply at 25. Even so, Defendants argue: \u201cHowever, the IPSAC is devoid of any allegations of any such non-monetary \u2018benefit\u2019 that Plaintiffs conferred on Defendants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The Defendants\u2019 characterization of the IPSAC is incorrect as the IPSAC has alleged certain factual allegations to show that the Defendants\u2019 alleged benefit is conferred by virtue of the <em>act </em>of the named Plaintiffs\u2019 purchasing eggs. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the egg market has particular \u201cstructural features\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-7\">(a) the lack of product differentiation or high substitutability of product between different producers; (b) the prevalence of cross marketing arrangements that facilitate price communication between rivals; (c) relative concentration within the industry; and (d) high demand price inelasticity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">IPSAC \u00b6 119. Plaintiffs further plead as to each of the 16 jurisdictions that Defendants leveraged these particular facets of the egg market to advance the aims of their alleged conspiracy, thereby receiving the \u201cbenefit\u201d of increased revenues and profits because the prices in the egg market as a whole were artificially inflated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj-\">The Defendants were able to achieve their increased revenues and profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>from their sales of eggs to <em>[Name of State </em>] indirect purchasers because the demand for eggs by indirect purchasers is relatively price inelastic, as Defendants understood. Thus, the ability of Defendants to profit from their sales of eggs to indirect purchasers in <em>[Name of State </em>] was connected to and due to the increased prices paid for Defendants eggs by indirect purchasers in <em>[Name of State </em>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-4\"><em>See, e.g., </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 346, 354, 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">This narrative of factual allegations plausibly suggests that the Plaintiffs\u2019 losses in purchasing eggs at artificially-inflated prices are connected to the Defendants\u2019 benefits. A fundamental function of the egg market as alleged in the IPSAC is the demand for eggs, as manifested by consumer purchases of eggs. Thus, even if Plaintiffs did not purchase eggs from a retailer who purchased from a specific Defendant, Defendants nevertheless obtained the benefit of Plaintiffs purchasing eggs at an artificially inflated price because each and every egg purchase by consumers would contribute to increasing (or sustaining at an artificial level) egg prices in a market in which the alleged supply of eggs was artificially decreased. In other words, the claim is that Defendants allegedly manipulated the supply curve of the market recognizing that because demand was inelastic and eggs are essentially a commodity good (ie., minimal product differentiation), prices would increase in response to, and as a result of, consumer purchases regardless of whether they were purchased from a Defendant or a non-conspirator. Accordingly, any demand-side activity in the egg market, <em>ie., </em>the Plaintiffs\u2019 purchases, would financially benefit Defendants generally because their eggs would be selling at a market price that was artificially inflated. <em>See also </em>IPSAC \u00b6 56 n. 4 (describing the company, Urner Barry, Inc., as \u201ca price reporting service for the egg industry ... [which produces] newsletters [that] publish egg price quotations that are widely relied on in the setting of wholesale egg prices under spot purchasers and long-term contracts\u201d).<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Thus, contrary to the Defendants\u2019 argument otherwise, Plaintiffs have pled factual allegations that plausibly suggest that they conferred a non-monetary form of advantage \u2014 the act of purchasing eggs. As alleged, these acts, given the conditions of the egg market and the Defendants\u2019 conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy, allowed Defendants to obtain the benefit of \u201cincreased revenues and profits from their sales of eggs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">The Defendants\u2019 final retuning of their argument also does not provide sufficient grounds for dismissal. Defendants assert, \u201ceven if such allegations were found in the IPSAC, and even if Plaintiffs had explained how they \u2018conferred\u2019 this \u2018benefit\u2019 on Defendants, Plaintiffs have not cited a single authority permitting an unjust enrichment claim based on such an allegation.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply at 25 n. 18. Even assuming this is true, Defendants likewise have not cited any authority (and certainly no authorities specific to each of the 16 jurisdictions) that bars an unjust enrichment claim based upon such a factual premise as a matter of law. But Defendants have accepted the Plaintiffs\u2019 legal proposition that a \u201c \u2018benefit\u2019 conferred can be <em>any form of advantage, </em>not just the indirect payment of money.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply at 25 (emphasis added). This legal proposition embraces the notion that a plaintiff can \u201cconfer\u201d her conduct to enrich a defendant. It follows that the Court cannot conclude at this time as a matter of law as to the 16 jurisdictions at issue that the Plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations that their acts of purchasing eggs conferred the Defendants\u2019 benefit of increased revenues from their egg sales are insufficient to show that plaintiffs conferred <em>any </em>benefit upon Defendants.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In this respect, the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">\n<em>b. Conferral of a \u201cDirect Benefit\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">For reasons previously discussed, <em>supra, </em>Plaintiffs have not alleged that they directly conferred a benefit upon Defendants. In other words, Plaintiffs have not pled facts to show that the named Plaintiffs\u2019 purchased eggs directly from Defendants.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Defendants argue that this deficiency is fatal to the Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims in 10 jurisdictions-the District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. As to those jurisdictions, Defendants contend that only by pleading a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>direct purchase from Defendants can Plaintiffs maintain this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Thus, the issue presented by the Defendants\u2019 next argument is whether the law of those 10 jurisdictions require (or likely would require) the conferral of a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d as opposed to an \u201cindirect benefit.\u201d If a jurisdiction requires such a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d to state a claim, then dismissal of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is warranted. The Court proceeds to examine what the law of the 10 jurisdictions requires as to this element in terms of two categories: (1) 5 jurisdictions that Defendants claim require a \u201cdirect benefit,\u201d and (2) 5 jurisdictions that Defendants claim <em>likely </em>require a \u201cdirect benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">\n<em>i. Claimed \u201cDirect Benefit\u201d Jurisdictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Defendants claim that \u201cPlaintiffs must prove that they <em>directly </em>conferred a benefit on Defendants\u201d as to unjust enrichment claims brought under the laws of Florida, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, and Utah. The Court determines that none of these states\u2019 laws <em>necessarily </em>require as a matter of law for Plaintiffs to \u201cprove that they <em>directly </em>conferred a benefit on Defendants\u201d in order to state an unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">aa. Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Defendants rely on <em>Peoples National Bank of Commerce v. First Union National Bank of Florida, </em>667 So.2d 876 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) and several cases that adopt its rationale, including <em>Extraordinary Title Services, LLC v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., </em>1 So.3d 400 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009), to argue that Florida law requires pleading that a plaintiff directly confer a benefit upon a defendant. In <em>Peoples National, </em>the state court determined that the plaintiff \u201ccould not and did not allege that it had directly conferred a benefit on the defendants\u201d and that \u201cif any benefit was conferred upon each [defendant] in the form of overpayments, it could only have been conferred upon them by [a third-party with which plaintiff and defendants had entered into a loan agreement], not [defendant].\u201d <em>Peoples National, </em>667 So.2d at 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The Court agrees that it appears the courts in <em>Peoples National </em>and the cases cited by Defendants have determined that an allegation or evidence of a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d is required. Nonetheless, there exists other valid Florida law that does not require direct interactions between the plaintiff and defendant in order for a benefit to have been conferred. <em>See Variety Children\u2019s Hosp. v. Vigliotti, </em>385 So.2d 1052, 1053-54 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1980) (holding that a mother was unjustly enriched when a \u201cthe hospital rendered its services to her child\u201d because she received the \u201c \u2018legal\u2019 benefit\u201d of fulfilling her lawful \u201cduty to provide support for a minor child\u201d); <em>Hillman Const. Corp. v. Wainer, </em>636 So.2d 576, 577-78 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1994) (determining that a general contractor plaintiff had sufficiently stated a claim for unjust enrichment against a commercial rental property owner because contractor had made \u201cseveral improvements [to the property] which ha[d] enhanced the value of the premises and allowed the owner to relet them at an increased rent\u201d after a former commercial tenant, who had contracted with the contractor to perform the services but failed to pay the contractor and filed for bankruptcy); <em>Merkle v. Health Options, Inc., </em>940 So.2d 1190, 1199 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006) (concluding that a medical service provider plaintiff had an unjust enrichment claim against HMO defendants for medically treating the HMOs\u2019 subscribers).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\"><em>Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc. v. Beech Street Corp., </em>899 So.2d 1222 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005), illustrates how Florida law allows unjust enrichment claims to arise from the conferral of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>indirect benefit. In <em>Shands, </em>the state appellate court held that the plaintiff had sufficiently pled that the defendant \u201cwas unjustly enriched at [the plaintiffs] expense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228. The plaintiff, a hospital, alleged that it conferred a benefit on the defendant, a third-party healthcare claims administrator, by providing medical services to the members of a PPO pursuant to a hospital provider agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1227. The agreement\u2019s \u201cterms conditioned [the hospital\u2019s] obligation to give discounts on receipt of timely payments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The claims administrator who was under a separate contract with the PPO, however, \u201cdid not make timely payments\u201d and \u201cdid not make undiscounted payments,\u201d which resulted in underpayments to the hospital. <em>Id. </em>Thus, as alleged, the administrator, \u201cdespite the underpayments, ... continued to reap the full benefit of [the hospital]^ services, which enabled [the administrator] to avoid breaching [its contract with the PPO] (and incurring liability for penalties).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227-28. Based upon these allegations, the court determined that, as pled, the administrator \u201cwas unjustly enriched by the value of services [the hospital] provided (in excess of the discounted rates at which [the hospital] was paid, when paid at all) to the extent they resulted in economic benefit conferred on [the administrator] under [the contract with the PPO].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">This line of cases demonstrates that Florida courts recognize \u201cthat <em>some </em>benefit must <em>flow </em>to the party sought to be charged.\u201d <em>Coffee Pot Plaza Partnership v. Arrow Air Conditioning and Refrigeration, Inc., </em>412 So.2d 883, 884 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1982) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Variety Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>385 So.2d at 1053); <em>see also Commerce P\u2019ship 8098 LP v. Equity Contracting Co., </em>695 So.2d 383, 386 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1997) (\u201cBecause the basis for recovery does not turn on the finding of an enforceable agreement, there may be recovery under a contract implied in law even where the parties had no dealings at all with each other.\u201d (citing <em>Variety Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>385 So.2d at 1053)).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Given that Florida law does not appear to require the conferral of a direct benefit exclusively, as Defendants claim, the Court cannot dismiss the Florida unjust enrichment claims as a matter of law by reason of a failure to adequately allege that Plaintiffs conferred a direct benefit upon Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">bb. Kansas</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">The Court is not persuaded that Kansas law requires the pleading of a conferral of a direct benefit. In support of their position, Defendants cite one, unpublished decision from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, <em>Spires v. Hospital Corporation of America, </em>289 Fed.Appx. 269, 273 (10th Cir.2008) (unpublished), that the Court finds to be inapposite. That case addressed the issue of \u201cunjust enrichment against parent corporations in the context of veil-piercing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273 &amp; n. 2. No other legal authority to support such a theory of unjust enrichment under Kansas law has been cited to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Moreover, Defendants have not raised any objections to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that \u201cthere is no requirement of a \u2018direct benefit\u2019 or even an in-kind benefit passing from plaintiffs to defendants under Kansas law,\u201d nor did Defendants challenge the cases cited by Plaintiffs in support of that claim. Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 45.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Indeed, the Court confirms that the cases cited by Plaintiffs demonstrate that Kansas law does not mandate the conferral of a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>benefit under an unjust enrichment. <em>See, e.g., Peterson v. Midland Nat'l Bank, </em>242 Kan. 266, 747 P.2d 159, 166-67 (1987) (observing that unjust enrichment can \u201carise[ ] ... where an expenditure by one person adds to the property of another\u201d and that plaintiffs \u201cdelivery of hay to the cattle which otherwise would have died\u201d constituted a benefit to defendant, which had a security interest in the cattle, under circumstances where a plaintiff was hired by a third-party upon defendant\u2019s promise that it \u201cwould bear the cost\u201d of delivering the feed); <em>Sec. Ben. Life Ins. Corp. v. Fleming Cos., </em>21 Kan.App.2d 833, 908 P.2d 1315, 1323 (1995) (determining that allegations that plaintiff installed a new cash register system to improve a grocery store owned by a party that transferred the store to the defendants as collateral for an unpaid loan the day the system installation was completed were sufficient to state an unjust enrichment claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">In sum, Kansas unjust enrichment law allows claims for the conferral of indirect benefits. Thus, a failure to plead a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d cannot be appropriate grounds for dismissal, and the Court will not dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim under Kansas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">cc. New York</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">In <em>Sperry v. Crompton Corp., </em>8 N.Y.3d 204, 831 N.Y.S.2d 760, 863 N.E.2d 1012, 1018 (2007), the Court of Appeals of New York held \u201ca plaintiff need not be in privity with the defendant to state a claim for unjust enrichment,\u201d but their relationship cannot be \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d One federal court has explained that this means that \u201ca product\u2019s indirect purchaser cannot assert an unjust enrichment claim against an entity that manufactured one of that product\u2019s ingredients,\u201d but that an \u201cindirect purchaser can assert such an unjust enrichment claim against the manufacturer of the product itself.\u201d <em>Waldman v. New Chapter, Inc., </em>714 F.Supp.2d 398, 403-04 (E.D.N.Y.2010); <em>see also SMW, </em>263 F.R.D. at 216 (recognizing that \u201cstrict privity between the plaintiff and defendant is not required\u201d and discussing instances when \u201cNew York courts have found numerous relationships \u2018too attenuated\u2019 to support\u201d an unjust enrichment claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">This case law demonstrates that the Defendants\u2019 contention that \u201cPlaintiffs must prove that they <em>directly </em>conferred a benefit on Defendants\u201d is misplaced as to New York law. New York law does not require such a direct relationship. Indeed, the solitary case that Defendants cited in support of their position, <em>In re Bayou Hedge Funds Investment Litigation, </em>472 F.Supp.2d 528, 532 (S.D.N.Y.2007), was issued a month earlier than <em>Sperry, </em>and does not embody the current state of New York law. <em>Cf. Waldman, </em>714 F.Supp.2d at 403 (\u201cDefendant accurately describes New York law in 1997, as the S.D.N.Y. understood it. But this is not the law today, as promulgated by New York\u2019s own courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Thus, although Plaintiffs have not alleged facts suggesting the conferral of a direct benefit, such a deficit is not in and of itself fatal to a New York unjust enrichment claim as a matter of law. The motion to dismiss on these grounds is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">dd. North Carolina</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Defendants argue that North Carolina law requires Plaintiffs to plead the conferral of a direct benefit in order to state an unjust enrichment claim as announced by <em>Effler v. Pyles, </em>94 N.C.App. 349, 380 S.E.2d 149, 152 (N.C.Ct.App.1989). In <em>Effler, </em>in evaluating a summary judgment motion, the appellate court determined that the plaintiff did not confer a benefit upon the defendant. The plaintiff was the former mother-in-law of a man who had remarried; the defendant was the man\u2019s second wife. <em>Id. </em>at 150. The mother-in-law was the co-signer of a note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>enabled her daughter, the first wife, and her then-son-in-law to buy a house. <em>Id. </em>The man and the first wife had promised the mother-in-law that they would make the payments on the loan. <em>Id. </em>After the first wife died, the mother-in-law made loan payments for the property after the man stopped making the payments. <em>Id. </em>Later, the man conveyed the property to himself and his second wife as tenants by the entireties, and then the couple sold the house, but did not apply the proceeds to the note that plaintiff had co-signed. <em>Id. </em>The mother-in-law brought the unjust enrichment claim against the second wife, contending that the second wife benefitted from the funds that were not applied to the plaintiffs note. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-4\">Plaintiff has not shown that she conferred a benefit on defendant [second wife]. [Second wife] received title to the property through her husband. Although he had previously acquired his interest in this property with plaintiffs assistance, this does not satisfy plaintiffs burden of showing that she conferred a benefit directly on defendant [second wife].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Defendants rely on the holding\u2019s reliance on the word \u201cdirectly\u201d as an accurate embodiment of North Carolina law, and highlight that another court has recognized the same. See Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 45 n. 23 (citing <em>Baker Const. Co., Inc. v. City of Burlington, </em>200 N.C.App. 435, 683 S.E.2d 790 (N.C.Ct.App.2009) (Table) (unpublished)). In <em>Baker, </em>the appellate court remarked, citing <em>Effler, </em>that \u201cthis Court has limited the scope of a claim of unjust enrichment such that the benefit conferred must be conferred directly from plaintiff to defendant, not through a third party.\u201d 683 S.E.2d 790. Indeed, several other state courts have read <em>Effler\u2019s </em>usage of \u201cdirectly\u201d similarly. <em>See Norman Owen Trucking, Inc. v. Morkoski, </em>131 N.C.App. 168, 506 S.E.2d 267, 274 (N.C.Ct.App.1998) (recognizing that an \u201cessential element of plaintiffs claim\u201d requires showing the \u201cdirect receipt by [defendant] of any benefit in consequence of plaintiffs performance of its contract with [a third-party]\u201d and \u201cshowing] that [defendant] \u2018consciously accepted\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Town of Carolina Shores v. Continental Ins. Co., Inc., </em>No. 7:10-CV-13-D, 2010 WL 4338437, at *5 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 26, 2010) (\u201cThe benefit would not be conferred directly from [defendant] to [plaintiff]. Rather, the benefit would be conferred through a third party, the Town. Furthermore, as mentioned, [plaintiff] acquired [the property] through a foreclosure sale.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Nonetheless, the Court is not convinced at this time that the Supreme Court of North Carolina would agree with this narrow, highly technical, approach to an unjust enrichment theory of liability. First, there is some indication in <em>Effler </em>itself that its usage of the word \u201cdirectly\u201d is an aberration in North Carolina law because the decision references no case law or legal authority that might explain its specific rationale on this point or word choice. Indeed, \u201cthe <em>Effler </em>court relied on the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booe v. Shadrick, </em>322 N.C. 567, 369 S.E.2d 554 (1988). <em>Booe </em>did not, however, require that a benefit be direct to state an unjust enrichment claim.\u201d <em>TFT-LCD (Flat Panel), </em>599 F.Supp.2d at 1190. Another North Carolina court has restricted the <em>Effler </em>holding to its facts, stating that the \u201c \u2018direct benefit\u2019 rule does not address such a scenario [as presented by the facts of the case] and, accordingly, does not foreclose equitable relief on these facts.\u201d <em>Perkins v. HealthMarkets, Inc., </em>No. 06 CVS 21053, 2007 WL 2570242, at *9 (N.C.Super.Ct. July 30, 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Second, and more significantly, a Supreme Court of North Carolina decision issued subsequent to <em>Effler </em>is instructive on that court\u2019s more expansive view of unjust enrichment and the role or particulars of the conferral of a benefit element. In <em>Embree Const. Group, Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., </em>330 N.C. 487, 411 S.E.2d 916 (1992), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a general contractor plaintiff, which had entered into an agreement to build a restaurant with the property owner and completed the construction before the owner defaulted on its construction loan with bank defendant, had stated a claim for unjust enrichment against the defendant bank. The defendant bank did not allegedly \u201cbenefit directly\u201d from plaintiff within the meaning of <em>Effler. </em>The plaintiff alleged that the defendant bank was unjustly enriched at plaintiffs expense because the bank did not disburse the funds remaining in the construction loan to plaintiff, but also acquired the completed building as a security for the loan, thereby receiving the benefit it had bargained under the loan agreement with the property owner. <em>Id. </em>at 919, 922. Based upon those facts alleged, the court agreed that the bank defendant was unjustly enriched. <em>Id. </em>at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">That the claim in <em>Embree </em>arose in the context of an equitable lien is of little consequence because it is still invokes the same principles of unjust enrichment that are recognized under North Carolina law.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Indeed, both the <em>Embree </em>and <em>Effler </em>decisions rely on <em>Booe. See Embree, </em>411 S.E.2d at 923 (\u201c \u2018A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Booe, </em>369 S.E.2d at 555-56)); <em>Effler, </em>380 S.E.2d at 152 (\u201cIn order to establish a claim for unjust enrichment, a party must have conferred a benefit on the other party [and] the defendant must have consciously accepted the benefit.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Booe, </em>369 S.E.2d at 555)).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Accordingly, the Court determines that North Carolina law embraces a broader definition of \u201cconferral of a benefit\u201d beyond only the conferral of a <em>direct </em>benefit. <em>See also TFT-LCD (Flat </em>Panel), 599 F.Supp.2d at 1190 (following <em>Booe\u2019s </em>articulation of an unjust enrichment claim in lieu of <em>Effler </em>and recognizing that <em>Booe </em>\u201cdid not ... require that a benefit be direct to state an unjust enrichment claim\u201d); <em>SMW, </em>737 F.Supp.2d at 442 (\u201cBecause the cases following <em>Effler </em>place into serious question any argument that <em>Effler </em>stands for a direct benefit requirement in North Carolina, I do not believe this is a valid ground for dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 North Carolina unjust enrichment claim.\u201d); <em>Metric Constructors, Inc. v. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., </em>72 Fed.Appx. 916, 921 (4th Cir.2003) (unpublished) (recognizing that <em>Embree </em>\u201csuggests a broader approach to unjust enrichment than is indicated by <em>Effler\u2019s </em>\u2018direct benefit\u2019 rule\u201d). Therefore, the Court cannot agree that North Carolina law on unjust enrichment requires Plaintiffs to allege a \u201cdirect benefit,\u201d and denies the motion to dismiss in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">ee. Utah</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">The Court does not adopt the Defendants\u2019 claim that Utah law necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>requires a plaintiff to plead the conferral of a \u201cdirect benefit.\u201d Defendants have cited several Utah Supreme Court cases that have used the term \u201cdirect benefit\u201d in the decisions. However, in those cases the usage of the term does not conform with the Defendants\u2019 characterization of the law.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">In <em>Baugh v. Darley, </em>112 Utah 1, 184 P.2d 335 (1947), the Supreme Court determined that the real estate agent plaintiff had not unjustly enriched the defendant, a former owner of a property that was sold to plaintiff. The Court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-5\">The mere fact that a person benefits another is not of itself sufficient to require the other to make restitution therefor.... Services officiously or gratuitiously furnished are not recoverable .... <em>Nor are services performed by the plaintiff for his own advantage, and from which the defendant benefits incidentally, recoverable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-6\">Services performed by the plaintiff outside the terms of the agreement [of sale] would, of course, ordinarily be voluntary and, therefore, such services could not in any case be recoverable regardless of the statute of frauds. However, one might perform work or services intended for his own benefit, or for the benefit of another, in reliance upon as distinguished from in pursuance of an unenforceable agreement. Generally, unless such services enhance or benefit the property of the defendant or otherwise confer on him a direct benefit, they do not form the basis for a contract imposed by law because there is no \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019 as that term is used in law. Where such services operate to confer a direct benefit upon the defendant, they may be recoverable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 337 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">In another case cited by Defendants, <em>Jeffs v. Stubbs, </em>970 P.2d 1234 (Utah 1998), the Supreme Court more recently addressed the conception of \u201cdirect benefit\u201d under Utah law. In <em>Jeffs, </em>the court observed that <em>Barley </em>spoke to the third element of unjust enrichment under Utah law, \u201cthe acceptance or retention by the conferee of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the conferee to retain the benefit without payment of its value,\u201d rather than the first element, namely, \u201ca benefit conferred on one person by another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Am. Towers Owners Ass\u2019n v. CCI Mech., Inc., </em>930 P.2d 1182, 1192 (1996), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Davencourt at Pilgrims Landing Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Davencourt at Pilgrims Landing, LC, </em>221 P.3d 234 (2009)). The court further explained that \u201cdirect benefit\u201d should be understood in the broader context of the principles of unjust enrichment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-11\">We addressed the third element in <em>Baugh v. Darley, </em>112 Utah 1, 184 P.2d 335 (1947). This court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-12\">Unjust enrichment of a person occurs when he has and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another. The benefit may be ... beneficial services conferred ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Services officiously or gratuitously furnished are not recoverable. Nor are <em>services performed by the plaintiff for his own advantage, and from which the defendant benefits incidentally, recoverable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 337 (internal citations omitted). Here, the claimants improved the land in reliance upon the [owner defendant\u2019s representations that they could live on the land for the rest of their lives. Even though the claimants intended to benefit from the improvements by occupying them during their lifetimes, the claimants\u2019 services still conferred a direct, not incidental, benefit on the [owner defendant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1248 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Both of these decisions demonstrate that the use of \u201cdirect\u201d is used to draw a distinction from \u201cincidental,\u201d as in the realm of a \u201cby-product,\u201d specifically to explicate that \u201cservices performed by the plaintiff for his own advantage\u201d cannot constitute grounds for unjust enrichment. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Utah has articulated this principle another way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-7\">The benefit conferred satisfies this requirement if the defendant\u2019s retention of the benefit would be unjust without providing compensation.... [U]njust enrichment does not result if the defendant has received only an incidental benefit from the plaintiffs service ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Q\"><em>Emergency Physicians Integrated Care v. Salt Lake County, </em>167 P.3d 1080, 1086 (Utah 2007); <em>see also Berrett v. Stevens, </em>690 P.2d 553, 558 (Utah 1984) (\u201cThe value of services performed by a person for his own advantage and from which another benefits incidentally are not recoverable.\u201d). Furthermore, Utah law recognizes that benefits under unjust enrichment are broadly defined. <em>Darley, </em>184 P.2d at 337 (\u201cThe benefit may be an interest in money, land, chattels, or choses in action; beneficial services conferred; satisfaction of a debt or duty owed by him; or anything which adds to his security or advantage.\u201d). Thus, neither of the cases cited by Defendants provides sufficient support for their argument that under Utah law \u201cPlaintiffs must prove that they <em>directly </em>conferred a benefit on Defendants,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>pleading that Plaintiffs purchased directly from Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Accordingly, the Court concludes that Utah law does not mandate that a plaintiff demonstrate that she directly conferred a benefit upon a defendant. The Court denies the motion in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">\n<em>ii. Likely \u201cDirect Benefit\u201d Jurisdictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASk\">Defendants argue that the courts of five jurisdictions \u2014 the District of Columbia, Minnesota, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia \u2014 \u201chave not ruled on whether a plaintiff must directly confer a benefit upon defendant.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 46. Nonetheless, they contend that it is appropriate for the Court to predict that these five jurisdictions would require a plaintiff to confer a direct benefit on a defendant in order to field an unjust enrichment claim solely because some other jurisdictions require the same unjust enrichment elements and have held that the conferral of a direct benefit is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that when a federal court sitting in diversity must make a prediction as to a precise legal issue a certain legal standard must be satisfied. In doing so, the Court is required to consult and evaluate particular sources of legal authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-12\">In adjudicating a case under state law, we are not free to impose our own view of what state law should be; rather, we are to apply existing state law as interpreted by the state\u2019s highest court in an effort to predict how that court would decide the precise legal issues before us. <em>Kowalsky v. Long Beach Township, </em>72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>F.3d 385, 388 (3d Cir.1995). In the absence of guidance from the state\u2019s highest court, we must look to decisions of state intermediate appellate courts, of federal courts interpreting that state\u2019s law, and of other state supreme courts that have addressed the issue. <em>Wiley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>995 F.2d 457, 459-60 (3d Cir.1993). We must also consider \u201canalogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.\u201d <em>McGowan v. University of Scranton, </em>759 F.2d 287, 291 (3d Cir.1985) (quoting <em>McKenna v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>622 F.2d 657, 663 (3d Cir.1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avj\"><em>Koppers Co., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>98 F.3d 1440, 1445 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Defendants have urged the Court to predict that the five jurisdictions likely would require a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d if the issue was presented to those jurisdictions\u2019 highest courts. However, aside from arguing that the Court should look to the five jurisdictions that Defendants claim do require a direct benefit (a conclusion that the Court declined as to each of those jurisdictions, supra), - Defendants have provided no other legal authority from which the Court might predict, consistent with the Third Circuit standard, whether those five jurisdictions would require pleading a \u201cdirect benefit.\u201d Certainly, especially in a far-ranging case such as this, the task is decidedly daunting to collect and analyze non-definitive case law and then predict what various courts around the country would do with a case, recognizing that it is entirely possible that those predictions may \u2014 indeed, likely will \u2014 be not entirely consistent. But given the posture of these issues as presented to the Court at this time, it is virtually impossible for the Court to undertake this task with any certainty now. Plaintiffs have argued that \u201cin light of the general principles underlying such [unjust enrichment] actions \u2014 to prevent parties from benefitting from their wrongdoing \u2014 [which] apply in all states, absent strong evidence from the relevant state courts, this court should not imply such a requirement.\u201d Pis. Resp. at 42. Defendants have not raised any argument disagreeing with this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend the unjust enrichment claims do \u201cnot require such a direct benefit,\u201d and provide moderate analysis of the \u201cconferral of a benefit\u201d requirement on a state-by-state basis as to the District of Columbia, Minnesota, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia. Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 42-43, 47, 49-52. In their reply brief, Defendants do not address such analyses whatsoever with respect to the claims brought under the laws of the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont. Through their silence, it appears Defendants have no objections to the Plaintiffs\u2019 justifications for their claims. Insofar that Defendants have apparently protested certain of the Plaintiffs\u2019 supporting legal authority as to unjust enrichment claims of South Dakota and West Virginia, the Court does not agree with the Defendants\u2019 contention that <em>W.J. Bachman Mechanical Sheetmetal Co., Inc. v. Wal-Mart Real, </em>764 N.W.2d 722, 732-33 (S.D.2009), or <em>Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Couch, </em>180 W.Va. 210, 376 S.E.2d 104, 109 (1988), support their claim that Plaintiffs must allege that they directly conferred a benefit on Defendants.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">It follows that the Court declines at this time to make the predictions of law for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>which Defendants advocate. The Court determines that it is appropriate to deny the motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claims under the laws of the District of Columbia, Minnesota, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to allege that they conferred a direct benefit upon Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">\n<em>VI. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies in part and grants in part the Defendants\u2019 motion consistent with the terms delineated in this Opinion. Insofar that the Court grants in part the Motion without prejudice, Plaintiffs may seek leave to amend their complaint upon the appropriate motion, or stipulation, provided that they do so promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">An appropriate Order follows.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-18\">.

Before proceeding further on this Motion, the Court is compelled to comment upon the parties\u2019 approach to articulating and supporting their arguments. In many respects, the parties\u2019 respective work is indeed impressive. However, at other times, the parties\u2019 work product contained deficiencies ranging from a dearth of meaningful (indeed, sometimes even unreliable) citation to legal authority, erroneous characterizations of the opposing parties\u2019 arguments (or worse, ignoring those arguments or failing to comprehend and directly address their substance), and complete omission of legal analysis. In some respects this has led to additional challenges for the Court to try to evaluate the efficacy of the arguments. Certainly that effort has been made more time consuming as a result \u2014 albeit, there was never quite a need to resort to soliciting all of the queen\u2019s horses and all of the queen\u2019s men to piece the parties\u2019 arguments together. Such advocacy is, fortunately, uncharacteristic of the fine professionals who have, to date, appeared in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">At times, the press of business can make consistently high level performance extremely difficult. The Court urges the litigators involved in this case to rededicate themselves to presenting their clients' positions in the most compelling light appropriate whenever possible and to have the well-earned and deserved confidence to forego arguments put forth merely for arguments\u2019 sake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b922-5\">. Because the singular issue at bar is the named Plaintiffs\u2019 individual Article III standing to bring the antitrust claims under the laws of Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota, the issue presented does not arise as a result of, or invoke, issues relating to class certification or implicate the standing of proposed class members. Certainly, sometimes the factors and facts considered during a class certification inquiry overlap with Article III standing, but nonetheless Article III standing is analytically and conceptually distinct from those other matters. <em>See generally </em>Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1785.1 (\u2019'[B]oth standing and mootness also frequently appear as threshold requirements for the maintenance of federal class actions and must be considered in addition to the requirements of Rule 23 when deciding whether a particular action may be certified. It is important when considering the applicability of these two doctrines to class actions to keep in mind that these concepts serve both constitutional and prudential concerns: they ensure that a justiciable or live issue is presented, thereby satisfying the Article III requirement that federal courts only entertain cases or controversies, and they seek to ascertain whether the person asserting the claim is sufficiently interested so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>that full litigation of the issues involved can be assumed. Notably, this latter concern also is addressed through the Rule 23 requirements -that the class representative be a member of the class, and be an adequate representative for the class.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">There is long-standing precedent to the effect that when a \"class action\u201d is introduced into the standing equation, the requirement that a named plaintiff must have standing to bring it is unaltered. Insofar that a case \"may be a class action ... adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class \u2018must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.' \u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (quoting <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 40, n. 20, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)). Simply put, \"one cannot acquire individual standing by virtue of bringing a class action.\u201d <em>See </em>1 A. Conte &amp; H. Newberg, <em>Class Actions </em>\u00a7 2:5 (4th ed.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Accordingly, there is no reason to defer consideration of the particular Article III standing issue raised by Defendants until class certification. The succinct conclusion in <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>692 F.Supp.2d 524, 534 (E.D.Pa.2010), is also applicable here: \"Named plaintiffs must have case or controversy standing; the potential standing problem in this case is not created by class certification. Therefore class certification is not logically antecedent to the standing problem.\u201d Other courts similarly have held that when the issue presented in a motion to dismiss concerns solely whether the named plaintiffs have standing to assert class action claims, the named plaintiffs' standing is a threshold issue, and there is no reason to defer the named plaintiffs' standing determination until class certification. <em>See, e.g., In re Wellhutrin XL Antitrust Litig., </em>260 F.R.D. 143, 153-55 (E.D.Pa.2009); <em>Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health &amp; Welfare Plan v.

In short, the Court concludes that it is not required to defer an Article III standing inquiry as to the named Plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\">. Generally, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals considers motions to dismiss for lack of standing as Rule 12(b)(1) motions. <em>See Ballentine v. United States, </em>486 F.3d 806, 810 (3d Cir.2007). Defendants here have classified their motion as one to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Plaintiffs agree with this standard of review.

To the extent that named Plaintiffs seek the redress of injunctive relief in relation to any of their federal or state claims, it is less clear from the IPSAC's allegations whether those Plaintiffs have Article III standing for such relief.

In <em>Steamfitters, </em>the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, addressing Pennsylvania law, distinguished unjust enrichment claims based upon tort from unjust enrichment claims based upon breach of contract. The Court of Appeals determined that when an unjust enrichment claim is based upon a tort, its causation analysis is essentially the same as the tort. The court had earlier determined that the plaintiff's tort claim failed because causation was too remote. And in applying that same causation analysis to the unjust enrichment claim, the court determined that, <em>Wee the tort claim, </em>the unjust enrichment claim could be dismissed for remoteness. The court was thus treating the analyses under the two claims as if they were the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">As a result, the court held, \"We can find no justification for permitting plaintiffs to proceed on their unjust enrichment claim once we have determined that the District Court properly dismissed the traditional tort claims because of the remoteness of plaintiffs' injuries from defendants' wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>937.

However, to the extent that Plaintiffs also argue that the IPSAC has factual allegations from which it can be inferred that the eggs purchased originated with the Defendants, this approach is unsuccessful.

See </em>IPSAC \u00b6\u00b6 19-44 (\"This Plaintiff indirectly purchased shell eggs and/or egg products during the Class Period and was injured as a result of Defendants\u2019 illegal conduct.\u201d).

By highlighting this allegation, Plaintiffs attempt to imply that 95% of laying hens in the egg industry were subject to the alleged conspiracy, and as such, when Plaintiffs made any egg purchase, they more than likely were purchasing from the Defendants. However, the factual allegation cited describes UEP alone and not the named Defendants as a group, so the allegation can only stand for what it says: UEP as an organization represents 95% of domestic laying hens (by representing 198 producer members, IPSAC \u00b6 136).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">While UEP as an organization might represent that percentage of laying hens, that does not necessarily mean that 95% of laying hens were covered by the alleged conspiracy. As alleged, UEP was not an egg producer itself. <em>See also id. </em>\u00b6 283 (\"UEP has declared that it did not sell eggs to consumers.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 284 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>(\"UEP does not 'market' its members\u2019 products.\u201d).

Instead, it will incur the expenses of cleaning and maintaining curbs and gutters with no resale value or intrinsic economic worth.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b975-5\">. The Defendants' contention that these two cases support their position is contradicted by the Defendants' original position that these jurisdictions \"have not ruled on whether a plaintiff must directly confer a benefit upon defendant.\u201d Defs.' Mot. at 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
