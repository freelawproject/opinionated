SCHEINDLIN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">This consolidated putative class action, which concerns only state law claims, is part of a larger multi-district litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It arises out of plaintiffs\u2019 investments in the various Stillwater Funds<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Stillwater\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> merger agreement with Gerova Financial Group, Ltd. (\u201cGerova\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>amended complaint alleges, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty; aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; and breach of contract claims against SCP, Gerova, Net Five Holdings, LLC (\u201cNet Five\u201d), and various officers and directors of those companies. Defendants now move to dismiss all state law claims. Defendants advance three primary arguments in their motions to dismiss:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>first, </em>that the breach of fiduciary duty claims are derivative and therefore plaintiffs lack standing to bring them directly; <em>second, </em>that the claims are precluded by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act (\u201cSLUSA\u201d); and <em>third, </em>that a corporation does not owe a fiduciary duty to its shareholders. For the following reasons the motions of SCP, Ger-ova, and the individual SCP and Gerova defendants are granted in part and denied in part, and the claim against Net Five is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">II. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ArS\">A. Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The proposed class consists of those SCP investors who received restricted, unregistered Gerova shares as part of the SCP/Gerova merger<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and SCP investors who sought redemption of their SCP funds, but were not paid in full prior to the SCP/Gerova merger.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">B. Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">There are ten named defendants in this action. SCP, Inc., is a New York corporation that acts as investment manager for the Stillwater Funds,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and SCP, LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company that manages the business affairs of the Still-water Funds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Jack Doueck is a principal of SCP and sits on an investment committee that manages the Stillwater Funds under Gerova\u2019s control.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He became a director of Gerova as part of the merger with SCP.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Richard Rudy is a principal of SCP and sits on the investment committee with Doueck.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege the same six breach of fiduciary duty claims against each of these defendants: (a) imprudently investing assets and failing to properly value them; (b) failing to sell assets in a timely manner; (c) failing to pay redemptions; (d) failing to perform due diligence on Gerova prior to the merger; (e) entering into the Gerova agreement whereby SCP directors received a lucrative contract at plaintiffs\u2019 expense; and (f) failing to submit audits to Gerova so the shares could be registered (Count I(a-f)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Gerova, was a \u201cblank check company\u201d formerly known as Asia Special Situation Acquisition Corporation, which formed in March 2007.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The name was officially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>changed to Gerova in connection with its merger with SCP in 2009.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Gerova\u2019s principal offices are in Hamilton, Bermuda.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Gary Hirst was a founding director of Ger-ova and was appointed its president in October 2007; he resigned on February 10, 2011.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Michael Hlavsa has served as Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) and a director of Gerova since March 2007.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Keith Laslop was a Gerova director from May 2008 until his resignation on February 10, 2011. He also served as Gerova\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (\u201cCOO\u201d) during part of that time.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Joseph Bianco served as Gerova\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) from at least April 17, 2010 until his resignation on February 10, 2011.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege the same three breach of fiduciary duty claims against each of these defendants: (a) failing to register plaintiffs\u2019 shares; (b) allowing its assets to deteriorate; and (c) transferring substantial assets to Net Five (Count Il(a-c)).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also allege an aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claim against Ger-ova, Hirst and Hlavsa (Count III), and a breach of contract claim against Gerova (Count V).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Net Five was formed as a real estate joint venture between Gerova and two other non-parties; it is based in Florida.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege an aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claim against Net Five (Count IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">C. Stillwater Funds Management and the Gerova Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">Plaintiffs were investors in the Stillwater Funds, which were managed by SCP and contained \u201covervalued troubled assets.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As investors sought to redeem their funds, the Stillwater Funds experienced liquidity issues and SCP was unable to pay out the redemptions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In an attempt to solve the illiquidity of their assets, SCP sought a merger with Gerova.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">As part of the merger agreement, Gerova acquired all of SCP\u2019s assets and liabilities.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The investor plaintiffs received \u201crestricted convertible Preferred Stock of Gerova\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and those who sought redemptions were to be paid by Gerova.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As part of the merger, SCP received 266,667 Gerova ordinary shares, approximately $12 million in cash,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and the SCP directors\u2014 including Doueck and Rudy \u2014 received $24 million in unpaid management fees<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>quarterly management fees going forward.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Doueck became a Gerova director as part of the merger,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and both he and Rudy sat on a three-person \u201cinvestment committee\u201d; the third person was appointed by Gerova.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that this merger was not only ill-advised, but that Doueck entered into it \u201cfor his own benefit, without even performing any due diligence\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and that it was done at plaintiffs\u2019 expense.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">D. Gerova Management</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Plaintiffs fared no better after the merger. Even though the Amended Registration Rights Agreement (\u201cAm. RRA\u201d) required Gerova to register Plaintiffs\u2019 shares, the shares were never registered<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and plaintiffs\u2019 redemption requests were not honored.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Because of this, plaintiffs argue that they have been forced to \u201chold virtually worthless restricted shares,\u201d which have \u201cdeclined more than 77 percent\u201d in value.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that life insurance settlement policies and corporate loans defaulted as a result of Gerova\u2019s failure to pay premiums,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> adding to the devaluation of Gerova assets. On May 26, 2010, Gerova formed Net Five as part of a real estate joint venture with two non-parties.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Under that agreement, Gerova transferred \u201call of the owned real estate properties and real estate loan assets acquired from the Stillwater Funds\u201d to Net Five.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Gerova received a 49 percent equity interest in the joint venture.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">Between January 20, 2010 and February 15, 2011, Gerova experienced high management turnover, including three different CEOs during that time.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> On February 24, 2011, the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) ceased trading of Gerova stock and Gerova securities were delisted on April 18, 2011.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Gerova terminated its stock registration on June 15, 2011.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> SCP and Gerova are in negotiations to unwind the SCP/Gerova merger,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> however plaintiffs assert that this will not allow SCP to recoup all the assets that it originally contributed to Gerova.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">III. LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">A. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b605-19\">In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court \u201caccept[s] all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The court evaluates the sufficiency of the complaint under the \u201ctwo-pronged approach\u201d advocated by the Supreme Court in <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal.</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> First, </em>\u201c[a] court \u2018can choose to begin by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere eonclusory statements, do not suffice\u201d to withstand a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>\u201c[w]hen there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the allegations in the complaint must meet a standard of \u201cplausibility.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Plausibility \u201cis not akin to a probability requirement;\u201d rather, plausibility requires \u201cmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\u201cIn consid\u00e9ring a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a district court may consider the facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and documents incorporated by reference in the complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> However, the court may also consider a document that is not incorporated by reference, \u201cwhere the complaint \u2018relies heavily upon its terms and effect,\u2019 thereby rendering the document \u2018integral\u2019 to the complaint.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The court may also consider \u201clegally required public disclosure documents filed with the SEC.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">IV. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"A9X\">A. Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">On a motion under Rule 12(b)(2), when the issue of personal jurisdiction \u201cis decided initially on the pleadings and without discovery, the plaintiff need show only a prima facie case.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Plaintiffs \u201ccan make this showing through [their] own affidavits and supporting materials containing an averment of facts that, if credited ... would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Thus, a court may consider materials outside the pleadings,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> but must credit plaintiffs\u2019 averments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>of jurisdictional facts as true,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> \u201c[A]ll allegations are construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and doubts are resolved in the plaintiffs favor, notwithstanding a controverting presentation by the moving party.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Nonetheless, where a \u201cdefendant rebuts plaintiffs\u2019 unsupported allegations with direct, highly specific, testimonial evidence regarding a fact essential to jurisdiction \u2014 and plaintiffs do not counter that evidence \u2014 the allegation may be deemed refuted.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">1. Specific Jurisdiction Under CPLR 302(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"> Under section 302(a)(1) a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary, provided that two conditions are met: the non-domiciliary defendant transacts business within New York and the claim against the non-domiciliary defendant arises directly out of this activity.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Section 302(a)(1) \u201cis a single-act statute requiring but one transaction \u2014 albeit a purposeful transaction \u2014 to confer jurisdiction in New York.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">\u201cNew York courts define \u2018transacting] business\u2019 as purposeful activity\u2014 \u2018some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> There is no definitive test to determine if a defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in New York. Rather, the totality of the defendant\u2019s contacts must be reviewed to determine whether jurisdiction is proper.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">B. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">SCP, Gerova, and the directors and officers of SCP and Gerova argue that plaintiffs lack standing to assert direct claims for breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties, and breach of contract, because any injuries were sustained by <em>the Funds, </em>the only entities that may bring suit.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">Under New York law,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> a claim is direct if \u201c \u2018the wrongdoer has breached a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>duty owed to the shareholder independent of any duty owing to the corporation wronged.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> \u201cAllegations of mismanagement or diversion of assets by officers or directors to their own enrichment, without more, plead a wrong to the corporation only, for which a shareholder may sue derivatively but not individually.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201cNew York courts have consistently held that diminution in the value of shares is quintessentially a derivative claim.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Even though decreased share value harms the individual shareholder, it \u201cis said to <em>derive </em>from the harm suffered principally by the corporation and only collaterally to shareholders, and thus is derivative in nature.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">C. SLUSA Preclusion<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\u201cSLUSA was enacted in 1998 to prevent class action plaintiffs from circumventing the heightened pleading re-quirements under the [Private Securities Litigation Reform Act] through artful pleading.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> SLUSA-states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">No covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any State or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any State or Federal court by any private party alleging (A) a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security; or (B) that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">A complaint triggers SLUSA when it alleges \u201c \u2018(1) an explicit claim of fraud or misrepresentation (e.g., common law fraud, negligent misrepresentations, or fraudulent inducement), or (2) other garden-variety state law claims that sound in fraud.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018A claim sounds in fraud when, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>although not an essential element of the claim, the plaintiff alleges fraud as an integral part of the conduct giving rise to the claim.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Courts \u201c \u2018look beyond the face of the complaint to analyze the substance of the allegations made,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> to identify plaintiffs who attempt to avoid SLUSA preclusion through artful pleading. Therefore, \u201c[r]egardless of the words used by plaintiffs in their complaints and regardless of the labels they paste on each claim, the question is whether a material misstatement or omission in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security is a <em>necessary component </em>of the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">To qualify as a covered class action, the suit must be one in which \u201cdamages are sought on behalf of more than fifty persons or prospective class members.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Additionally, plaintiffs must allege a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with a covered security.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> A \u201c \u2018covered security is one traded nationally and listed on a regulated national exchange or issued by an investment company that is registered, or files registration statements, under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has shown a preference for \u201cinterpreting] the phrase \u2018in connection with\u2019 broadly.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> In determining whether the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement is met, a court looks at whether the covered securities are \u201cat the heart of th[e] case.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">D. Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">Under New York law, \u201c[t]he elements of a claim for breach of a fiduciary obligation are: (i) the existence of a fiduciary duty; (ii) a knowing breach of that duty; and (iii) damages resulting therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Generally, \u201c \u2018a corporation does not owe fiduciary duties to its members or shareholders,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> because recognizing such a duty \u201cwould lead to the confounding possibility that a shareholder of a corporation could bring a derivative action on behalf of the corporation against the corporation itself.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> In New York, a director is required to \u201cperform his duties ... in good faith and with that degree of care which an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>circumstances\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> and owes this \u201cobligation to [the] corporation and its shareholders.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Although Gerova is a Bermuda corporation, the analysis of the breach of fiduciary duty claims against Gerova is substantively the same under Bermuda law \u2014 which \u201cfollows English law\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> \u2014 and New York law.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> \u201cIn the absence of substantive difference ... a New York court will dispense with choice of law analysis; and if New York law is among the relevant choices, New York courts are free to apply it.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">E. Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duties Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cA claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty [under New York law] requires: (1) a breach by a fiduciary of obligations to another, (2) that the defendant knowingly induced or participated in the breach, and (3) that plaintiff suffered damage as a result of the breach.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">F. Breach of Contract Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">\u201cIn order to state a claim of breach of contract, the complaint must allege: (i) the formation of a contract between the parties; (ii) performance by the plaintiff; (iii) failure of defendant to perform; and (iv) damages.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> \u201cUnder New York law, a party\u2019s performance under a contract is excused where the other party has substantially failed to perform its side of the bargain or, synonymously, where that party has committed a material breach.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> However, \u201c[a] party cannot \u2018elect to continue with the contract, continue to receive benefits from it, and thereafter bring an action for rescission or total breach.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">V. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">A. Personal Jurisdiction over Hirst</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">Plaintiffs assert personal jurisdiction over Hirst<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> citing his position as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>president of Gerova during the time of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Hirst does not dispute that he was involved in decisions regarding the SCP/Gerova merger and the he attended two meetings in New York regarding the merger, but presents evidence that undermines plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of jurisdiction. Hirst maintains \u2014 and plaintiffs do not contest \u2014 that he has no real property in New York, does not maintain a bank account in New York, and has never been employed or compensated by a New York corporation.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> However, plaintiffs assert that Hirst, as Gerova\u2019s president at the time of SCP/Gerova merger, had sufficient ties to New York by negotiating the merger agreement in New York with SCP, a New York corporation.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Construing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and resolving all doubt in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, I conclude that plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction over Hirst based on his involvement in the SCP/Gerova merger. However, Hirst\u2019s assertions undermine plaintiffs\u2019 allegations such that it would be premature to determine conclusively that personal jurisdiction does, in fact, exist. Therefore, I conclude that limited discovery into the issue of personal jurisdiction over Hirst is appropriate.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">B. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Count I(a-f) concerns plaintiffs\u2019 breach of fiduciary claims against SCP and the SCP directors.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have adequately pled the existence of a fiduciary duty, knowing breach of that duty, and damages arising therefrom. However, under New York law, two of these claims are derivative and therefore plaintiffs lack standing to bring them directly. Count 1(a), failure to properly invest and value the assets is \u201c \u2018a classic claim of fund mismanagement that belongs to the Fund, and is therefore derivative.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Similarly, Count 1(b), the alleged failure to sell the assets in a timely manner, is also a mismanagement claim that belongs to the Fund and not to plaintiffs individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">Count Il(b-c) alleges the following breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Gerova officers and directors (Doueck, Bianco, Hirst, Hlavsa, and Laslop): allowing its assets to deteriorate and transferring substantial assets to Net Five.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> These mismanagement claims are derivative in nature and \u201c \u2018[derivative claims against corporate directors belong to the corporation itself.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Because plaintiffs lack standing to pursue these claims, they are dismissed.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>C. SLUSA</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Count I(d-f), which alleges that SCP breached its fiduciary duty regarding the merger agreement with Gerova, is precluded by SLUSA and must be dismissed.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>it is undisputed that Plaintiffs are a \u201ccovered class.\u201d <em>Second, </em>the shares that plaintiffs received as part of the SCP/Gerova merger were not listed on a national exchange or traded nationally, however, they were \u201cissued by\u201d a registered investment company, and therefore qualify as covered securities.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Even though the Amended Complaint expressly disclaims that it sounds in fraud,<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 complaint rests on the fact that the merger benefitted SCP to the plaintiffs\u2019 detriment. The merger required approval by at least fifty percent of the domestic SCP investors,<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> which was obtained. Unless plaintiffs were misled by misrepresentations or by material omissions, it is impossible to understand why they would approve a merger that provided such lucrative management fees at plaintiffs\u2019 expense. Because of this, a material misrepresentation or omission in connection with the merger is a <em>\u201cnecessary </em>component\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 claim<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> and such a claim is precluded by SLUSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Count III alleges that Gerova and its officers aided and abetted SCP\u2019s breaches of fiduciary duty through their direct participation in the SCP/Gerova. merger and \u201csubstantially assisted\u201d the breaches by: negotiating the merger terms; acquiring the assets and liabilities of SCP even though they knew SCP had not performed due diligence; and agreeing to pay SCP large management fees.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Because this claim is predicated on the same facts as the related breach of fiduciary duty claim alleged against SCP (Count 1(e)), it is also precluded by SLUSA.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Count V, plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim against Gerova, is not precluded by SLUSA as defendants suggest. The Am. RRA was entered into as part of the SCP/Gerova merger and was the contract governing the shares plaintiffs received from the merger.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> As discussed previously, the plaintiffs are a \u201ccovered class\u201d and the Gerova shares at issue in the Am. RRA are \u201ccovered securities,\u201d because they were \u201c \u2018issued by an investment company that [was] registered, or file[d] registration statements, under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">However, \u201c[breaches of contract generally fall outside the scope of the securities laws,\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> because failing \u201c \u2018to carry out a promise made in connection with a securities transaction ... does not [constitute fraud] unless, when the promise was made, the defendant secretly intended not to perform or knew that he could not perform.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Even though breach of contract does not require fraud as a necessary component, contract claims that are an integral part of an alleged fraudulent scheme may be precluded by SLUSA,<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> but plaintiffs do not allege, and the pleading does not support, any misrepresentation or omission of material fact regarding the Am. RRA. Without such fraudulent conduct, the breach of contract claim is not precluded by SLUSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">D. Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Count Il(a-c) against Gerova alleges breach of its fiduciary duty by: (a) failing to register plaintiffs\u2019 shares; (b) allowing its assets to deteriorate; and (c) transferring substantial assets to Net Five. Plaintiffs claim that Gerova owed them a fiduciary duty because plaintiffs\u2019 interests were \u201cdirectly and disproportionately tied to [the SCP/Gerova] assets,\u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> but cite no case law to support this proposition. This conclusory argument, without more is not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">Courts have held that corporate <em>directors </em>owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders where there exists a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d such as \u201cholding themselves out as agents\u201d<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> or when they are \u201cshareholders], officers], and director[s] of a closely held corporation,\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> but there is no precedent finding such a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between a corporation and its shareholders. A corporation does not owe a fiduciary duty to its shareholders;<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> for this reason, plaintiffs\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty claims against Gerova are dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">Count 1(c) concerns SCP\u2019s failure to pay investors who sought redemptions. Even though this failure arguably stemmed from SCP\u2019s mismanagement of the Funds, the claim is direct and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>fore appropriately pleaded. The failure was not felt by all SCP investors, but only those who sought such redemptions. Therefore, the failure to pay redemptions was independent of any duty owed to the corporation,<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> and survives SCP\u2019s motion to dismiss-Count 11(a), as against the Ger-ova officers and directors, alleges breach of their fiduciary duty by failing to register plaintiffs\u2019 shares. As with Count 1(c), the failure to register the shares was not felt by all Gerova shareholders, but only by those individuals who received the unregistered shares as part of the SCP/Gerova merger. Because of the \u201casymmetrical injury,\u201d felt by some, but not all, of the shareholders, this claim survives the Gerova officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">E. Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Count IV alleges that Net Five<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> substantially assisted Gerova\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty by negotiating the terms of the asset transfer, acquiring the assets, and allowing Gerova to keep the assets out of reach.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Because the underlying claim against Gerova for breach of fiduciary duty (Count 11(c)) is dismissed for failure to state a claim, the related aiding and abetting claim against Net Five is also dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">F. Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Count V alleges that Gerova breached the Am. RRA. This agreement was made for \u201cthe benefit of Gerova Shareholders\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> and provided that Gerova would \u201cprepare and file with the [SEC] a \u2018Shelf Registration Statement covering the resale of the Registrable Securities.\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> The parties agree that the Registration Statement was never filed with the SEC<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> and the shares were therefore never registered.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Gerova claims that it failed to register the shares because SCP did not provide it with the audits required for the filing. However, the parties agree that all of the required audits were delivered to Gerova by November 2010.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> Whether the audits were filed too late for Gerova to register the shares has not been sufficiently established and remains a question of fact ill-suited for decision at the motion to dismiss stage. Because of this, plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a breach of contract claim against Gerova,</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">For the foregoing reasons, Counts Rab\u00ed, and IRb-c) (as relating to the Gerova officers and directors) are dismissed as derivative; Counts Rd-f) and III are dismissed as precluded by SLUSA; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Counts Il(a-c) (as relating to Gerova) and TV are dismissed for failure to state a claim. Counts 1(c) (breach of fiduciary duty against SCP for failing to pay redemptions), 11(a) (breach of fiduciary duty against the Gerova officers and directors for failing to register the shares), and Y (breach of contract against Gerova) survive defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Hirst\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is denied with leave to renew after the completion of limited discovery.
