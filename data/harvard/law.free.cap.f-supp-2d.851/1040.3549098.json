ROSENTHAL, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-u5\">This is a consumer class action certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) for settlement. The class is large \u2014 over one hundred million payment-card<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> holders \u2014 and dispersed across the country. Despite a vigorous notice campaign, only eleven valid claims have been filed. Damages are almost entirely in the form of cy pres payments to third-party nonprofit organizations whose work is related to class interests. This opinion addresses settlement-class certification, settlement approval, and attorneys\u2019 fees. As part of determining a reasonable fee award, the court discounts the value of the cy pres payments to reflect the fact that the benefit to the class is indirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">In January 2009, Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. (\u201cHeartland\u201d) publicly disclosed that hackers had breached its computer systems and obtained confidential payment-card information for over one hundred million consumers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts across the country. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the federal cases to this court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407. (Docket Entry No. 1). Payment-card holders filed individual lawsuits and class actions, claiming that Heartland had negligently failed to protect their personal financial information from disclosure. Financial institutions that issued cards also sued Heartland, claiming that the data breach caused them to incur damages, including the costs of canceling and replacing payment cards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The cases proceeded on two tracks, one for the \u201cFinancial Institution Plaintiffs\u201d and one for the \u201cConsumer Plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">In December 2009, the Consumer Plaintiffs and Heartland reached a settlement agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d). (Docket Entry No. 57). After a hearing, (Docket Entry No. 82), the court in April 2010 certified a nationwide settlement class and approved notice of the Agreement, (Docket Entry No. 85). After an extensive notice campaign, eleven valid claims for losses and one objection have been filed. The Consumer Plaintiffs have moved for final approval of the Agreement, for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, and for incentive awards for certain plaintiffs. (Docket Entry No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>107) . The Consumer Plaintiffs filed a supporting memorandum. (Docket Entry No. 108) . Heartland filed a memorandum supporting the settlement but taking no position on the fees or incentive awards. (Docket Entry No. 109). The court held a final fairness hearing. (Docket Entry No. 110).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">Based on the memoranda in support of the proposed Agreement, the one objection, the parties\u2019 arguments at the preliminary and final fairness hearings, the remainder of the record, and the relevant law, this court: (1) reviews its preliminary certification of the settlement class; (2) approves the proposed settlement; (3) approves attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $606,192.50; (4) approves costs in the amount of $35,000; and (5) denies the proposed incentive awards. The reasons are explained in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">I. The Litigation and Proposed Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">Heartland is a payment-card processor. It contracts with businesses to process their Visa and MasterCard transactions. The Consumer Plaintiffs are payment-card holders. The factual background can be briefly summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-9\">Beginning at least as early as December 2007, three hackers \u2014 an American, Albert Gonzalez, and two unknown Russians \u2014 infiltrated Heartland\u2019s computer systems. The hackers installed programs that allowed them to capture some of the payment-card information stored on the Heartland computer systems. In late October 2008, Visa alerted Heartland to suspicious account activity. Heartland, with Visa and MasterCard and others, investigated. Heartland discovered suspicious files in its systems on January 12, 2009. A day later, Heartland uncovered the program creating those files. That program provided the hackers with access to data on the systems. On January 20, Heartland publicly announced the data breach. The hackers obtained payment-card numbers and expiration dates for approximately 130 million accounts. For some of these accounts, the hackers also obtained cardholder names. They did not obtain any cardholder addresses, however, which meant that the stolen card information generally could be used only for in-person transactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\"><em>Heartland II, </em>834 F.Supp.2d at 575, 2011 WL 6012598, at *2 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">The Consumer Plaintiffs\u2019 suits assert claims for negligence, breach of contract, various state statutory violations, and violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq. </em>(Docket Entry No. 3). Aside from motions relating to appointing class counsel, the only motions filed in the Consumer Plaintiffs track were unopposed motions for extensions of time to file the master complaint. (Docket Entry Nos. 31, 53). The master complaint was to be filed by December 18, 2009. (Docket Entry No. 55). On that date, and before the Consumer Plaintiffs had filed a master complaint, the parties submitted the proposed settlement. (Docket Entry No. 57). No formal discovery occurred. Instead, the parties engaged in what Heartland\u2019s counsel termed \u201cconfirmatory discovery.\u201d Heartland gave counsel for the Consumer Plaintiffs over 4,000 pages relating to the data breach and allowed counsel to interview Heartland\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 9-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-13\">B. The Proposed Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">The proposed settlement binds \u201call Persons in the United States who had or have a payment card that was used in the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>ed States between and including December 26, 2007 and December 31, 2008 (the \u2018Settlement Class Period\u2019), and who allege or may allege that they have suffered and of the Losses defined herein.\u201d (Docket Entry No. 57, \u00b6 1.20). The settlement excludes \u201cHeartland and its officers and directors, and those Persons who timely and validly request exclusion from the Settlement Class.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>By remaining in the class, each member gives up the right to bring any action \u201cstemming from the Heartland Intrusion\u201d against Heartland, KeyBank National Association, Heartland Bank, and any \u201cRelated Parties\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of those three entities. <em>(See id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1.16 \u2014 .18).</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Within ten days after preliminary court approval, Heartland had to deposit $1 million into an interest-bearing escrow account. That sum was to \u201cbe used to reimburse Settlement Class Members who are determined to have submitted Valid Claims[.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 2.1). If the valid claims exceeded $1 million, Heartland had to deposit into the ' account an additional $500,000; if that was exhausted, another $500,000; and finally an additional $400,000. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 2.1(a)). Heartland had to deposit at least $1 million and at most $2.4 million to fund the settlement. If any unpaid balance remained on the initial $1 million (and interest) after all valid claims were paid, that balance was to \u201cbe transferred to a non-profit organization(s) dedicated to the protection of consumers\u2019 privacy rights, with emphasis on advancing the implementation of end-to-end encryption of payment card authorization transactions or similar security enhancements.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 2.1(b)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">Under the Agreement, \u201c[a] Valid Claim shall consist of only those \u2018Losses\u2019 ... that a Settlement Class Member ... proves by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., more likely than not to be true), to have directly and proximately resulted from information relative to an Eligible Payment Card Account of such Settlement Class Member having been stolen or placed at risk as a result of the Heartland Intrusion^]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 2.2). The Agreement defines four categories of \u201cLosses\u201d: (1) out-of-pocket expenses from card cancellations or replacements; (2) out-of-pocket expenses from unauthorized and unreimbursed account charges; (3) out-of-pocket expenses from identity theft; and (4) \u201ca reasonable amount for time (calculated at $10 per hour up to five (5) hours)\u201d spent on these three types of losses. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 2.2(b)). \u201cLosses\u201d specifically exclude \u201ccredit monitoring or insurance costs incurred by Settlement Class Members, attorneys\u2019 fees, attorneys\u2019 costs or attorneys\u2019 expenses incurred by Settlement Class Members, or losses resulting from any information having been stolen or placed at risk of being stolen from an entity other than from Heartland.\u201d <em>(Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">The Agreement also creates a claims process. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2.2(c)-(d)). Any claim must be submitted by August 1, 2011. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 2.2(c)). Reimbursement is capped at $175 for any valid claim not involving identity theft and at $10,000 for any valid identity-theft claims. Each household is limited to two valid claims. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 2.2(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">The Agreement requires Heartland to pay, \u201csubject to Court approval,\u201d up to $725,000 for attorneys\u2019 fees and up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>$35,000 for attorneys\u2019 costs and expenses. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 7.2). It also requires Heartland to pay, again \u201csubject to Court approval,\u201d incentive awards of $200 to each Representative Consumer Plaintiff and $100 to all other Named Plaintiffs. The Agreement includes the following disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-4\">The Settling Parties did not discuss attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses, or incentive awards to Representative Consumer Plaintiffs and Named Plaintiffs, as provided for in \u00b6\u00b6 7.2 and 7.3, until after the substantive terms of the settlement had been agreed upon, other than that Heartland would pay reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses, and incentive awards to Representative Consumer Plaintiffs and named Plaintiffs as may be agreed to by Heartland and Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel, and/or as ordered by the Court, or, in the event of no Agreement, then as ordered by the Court. Heartland and Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel then negotiated and agreed [to these provisions.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\"><em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 7.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">The Agreement explains how class members may object, <em>(id., </em>\u00b6 5.1), and how they may opt out of the class, <em>(id., </em>\u00b6\u00b64.1-.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">C. The Record</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">After the first fairness hearing, (Docket Entry No. 82), the court preliminarily certified the settlement class and approved class notice. (Docket Entry No. 85). According to Cameron Anzari, the Director of Notice for Hilsoft Notifications, the court-appointed company tasked with helping write the notices and designing and carrying out the notice campaign, the notices \u201creached at least 81.4% of potential Settlement Class Members an estimated 2.5 times through a combination of notice placements in newspaper supplements, consumer magazines and on selected websites.\u201d (Docket Entry No. 106, \u00b6 6(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-12\">One class member, Michael Kostka, filed a pro se objection. He appears to suggest that the data breach did not actually harm most consumers in the class, making the settlement unfair to Heartland. (Docket Entry No. 100).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-13\">The Consumer Plaintiffs moved for final court approval of the settlement, fees, costs and expenses, and incentive awards. (Docket Entry No. 107). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), this court held a final fairness hearing on the Agreement on December 13, 2010. (Docket Entry No. 110). Heartland advised that as of December 9, class members had filed 290 claims. Heartland estimated that perhaps 11 of those claims were valid. (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 6). Counsel for the Consumer Plaintiffs did not disagree with this estimate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Almost all of the $1 million Heartland committed to deposit in the settlement fund would be transferred to the designated nonprofit organizations under the Agreement\u2019s cy pres provision. <em>(Id., </em>at 4-5, 17). The parties had agreed to divide the cy pres funds evenly among three nonprofit organizations: Smart Card Alliance, which promotes the use of chip- and-pin technology<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in payment cards; the Secure POS Vendor Alliance, which promotes the implementation of end-to-end encryption and other security measures for payment cards; and the Financial Services Information Sharing Analysis Center, which notifies financial institutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>about data intrusions and how to prevent them. <em>(Id., </em>at 17-22).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">After the final fairness hearing, the Consumer Plaintiffs filed detailed reports showing them attorneys\u2019 time, costs, and expenses for this case. (Docket Entry No. 113) . Heartland filed an affidavit explaining its previous contributions to the three organizations proposed as recipients of the cy pres payments. (Docket Entry No. 114) . This affidavit also explained that any cy pres funds paid to these organizations would be in addition to Heartland\u2019s normal annual contributions to them. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Class certification, settlement approval, and the fee and incentive awards are each analyzed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">II. Class Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">The Consumer Plaintiffs previously moved to certify a settlement class. (Docket Entry No. 75). The proposed class consisted of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-11\">all persons in the United States who had or have a payment card that was used in the United States between and including December 26, 2007 and December 31, 2008 (the \u201cSettlement Class Period\u201d), and who allege or may allege that they have suffered any of the Losses defined herein. Excluded from the definition of Settlement Class are Heartland and its officers and directors, and those Persons who timely and validly request exclusion from the Settlement Class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">(Docket Entry No. 75, \u00b6 7 (quoting Docket Entry No. 57, \u00b6 1.20)). After the preliminary fairness hearing, this court certified the class, noting that the evidence received at the final fairness hearing still had to be considered. (Docket Entry No. 85, \u00b6 4). Reviewing the certification on the basis of all the parties\u2019 submissions and the final fairness hearing is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">Class certification requires a \u201crigorous analysis of Rule 23 prerequisites.\u201d <em>Madison v. Chalmette Ref., L.L.C., </em>637 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982)). The rigor required does not diminish in the settlement-class context. <em>See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997). A district court may not \u201csubstitute the fairness inquiry of Rule 23(e) for the certification requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b).\u201d <em>Thomas v. Albright, </em>139 F.3d 227, 235 (D.C.Cir.1998) (discussing <em>Amchem). </em>\u201c[T]he party seeking certification [ ] bears the burden of establishing that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met.\u201d <em>Madison, </em>637 F.3d at 554-55 (internal quotation marks omitted). But \u201c[t]he fact that a settlement has been reached is, of course, relevant.\u201d <em>Smith v. Sprint Commc\u2019ns. Co., </em>387 F.3d 612, 614 (7th Cir.2004). A court need not determine under Rule 23(b)(3)(D) whether the proposed settlement class action would be manageable for trial. <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-16\">The class-certification analysis may require consideration of the suit\u2019s underlying merits. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551-52, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A merits inquiry must be \u201climited to those aspects relevant to making the certification decision on an informed basis.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. DB Invs., Inc., </em>667 F.3d 273, 305 (3d Cir.2011) (en banc) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 Committee Notes (2003)); <em>see also Taylor v. Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number><em>ed Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>554 F.3d 510, 520 (5th Cir.2008) (discussing the \u201climited inquiry\u201d into the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">The Fifth Circuit has indicated that the preponderance standard applies to the Rule 23 determination. <em>See Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. Flowserve Corp., </em>572 F.3d 221, 228-29 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam). The Second and Third Circuits require the party seeking class certification to satisfy each Rule 23 requirement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Novella v. Westchester Cnty., </em>661 F.3d 128, 148-49 (2d Cir.2011) (citing <em>In re Initial Pub. Offerings Securities Litig., </em>471 F.3d 24, 41 (2d Cir.2006)); <em>Gates v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co., </em>655 F.3d 255, 262 (3d Cir.2011) (citing <em>In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., </em>552 F.3d 305, 320 (3d Cir.2008)). Other circuits state the standard less clearly. <em>See, e.g., DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, </em>594 F.3d 1188, 1194 (10th Cir.2010) (\u201cThe party seeking class certification bears the burden of proving Rule 23\u2019s requirements are satisfied.\u201d). In this case, the Consumer Plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing the Rule 23 requirements by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">A. Rule 23(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Any proposed class must meet four requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-7\">(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">Fed. R. Crv. P. 23(a). These requirements \u201ceffectively limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiffs claims.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2550 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">1. Numerosity</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">The proposed class encompasses at least one hundred million individuals, spread throughout the United States. The numerosity requirement is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">2. Commonality</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">Under previous Fifth Circuit precedent, commonality required \u201cone common question of law or fact\u201d to the class. <em>James v. City of Dallas, Tex., </em>254 F.3d 551, 570 (5th Cir.2001). In <em>Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mere \u201craising of common \u2018questions\u2019 of law or fact\u201d is no longer sufficient. 131 S.Ct. at 2551 (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, <em>Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, </em>84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)). The <em>Dukes </em>Court explained that commonality requires classwide proceedings to have the ability \u201cto generate common <em>answers </em>apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Nagareda, <em>Class Certification, </em>84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (emphasis in original)); <em>see also </em>American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 2.02 cmt. a (2010) [\u201cAggregate Litigation\u201d] (stating that \u201ccourts should consider whether aggregate treatment of a common issue by way of a class action will materially advance the resolution of multiple civil claims by addressing the core of the dispute in a manner superior to other realistic procedural alternatives such that aggregate treatment would generate significant judicial efficiencies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-13\"><em>Dukes </em>does not require that all questions of law and fact be common, <em>Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 981, or that each class member have \u201csuffered a violation of the same provision of law,\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551. Instead, \u201c[t]heir claims must depend upon a common contention .... That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution \u2014 which means that determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commonality \u201cis informed by the defendant\u2019s conduct as to all class members and any resulting injuries common to all class members!.]\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>667 F.3d at 297. \u201cThe focus in the settlement context should be on the conduct (or misconduct) of the defendant and the injury suffered as a consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335 (Scirica, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Applying <em>Dukes, </em>two recent circuit cases have found commonality satisfied. In <em>Sullivan v. DB Investments, </em>plaintiffs filed class actions alleging that De Beers, \u201cthe dominant participant in the wholesale market for gem-quality diamonds throughout much of the twentieth century,\u201d had \u201cexploited its market dominance to artificially inflate the prices of rough diamonds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286 (majority opinion). These class-action lawsuits alleged that De Beers\u2019s conduct violated state and federal antitrust law and state consumer-protection statutes, and constituted unjust enrichment, unfair business practices, and false advertising under state law. The suits were transferred under MDL for pretrial management. The plaintiffs fell into two categories: those who bought directly from De Beers or a De Beers competitor, and those who purchased diamonds from a direct purchaser (such as consumers). De Beers reached settlements with both the direct- and indirect-purchasers classes. <em>Id. </em>at 286-88. The district court, over substantial objections, certified the nationwide classes for settlement and approved the settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 290-91. On appeal, the Third Circuit reversed based on the fact that some of the states precluded any recovery for indirect purchasers, who nonetheless would recover under the settlement. The class successfully sought en banc rehearing. The main question before the en banc court was whether these state-law variations precluded finding predominance. A subsidiary issue was whether the proposed classes could demonstrate commonality. The en banc court addressed commonality and predominance together because, under Third Circuit precedent, \u201cthe Rule 23(a) commonality requirement [is] incorporated into the more stringent Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court found both. The classes shared common questions of fact: whether De Beers engaged in anticompetitive activity, and whether that activity resulted in artificially inflated diamond prices. \u201cThese allegations are unaffected by the particularized conduct of individual class members, as proof of liability and liability itself would depend entirely upon De Beers\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. The classes also shared common questions of law: whether De Beers\u2019s anticompetitive activity violated federal and state antitrust law. <em>Id. </em>at 300 &amp; n. 23. \u201cEvidence for this legal question would entail generalized common proof as to the implementation of De Beers\u2019s conspiracy, the form of the conspiracy, and the duration and extent of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). These questions, according to the en banc court, satisfied the <em>Dukes </em>mandate that the common questions result in common answers. \u201c[T]he answers to questions about De Beers\u2019s alleged misconduct and the harm it caused would be common as to all of the class members, and would thus inform the resolution of the litigation if it were not being settled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">In <em>Ross v. RBS Citizens, N.A., </em>667 F.3d 900 (7th Cir.2012), a proposed class of over 1,000 current and former employees of Charter One, which operated over 100 banks in Illinois, alleged that the bank maintained an unofficial policy of denying overtime pay to its employees. The class asserted violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Illinois Minimum Wage Law. <em>Id. </em>at 902-03. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>certified the class for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 903. In finding that the class had demonstrated commonality, the Seventh Circuit distinguished <em>Dukes </em>because <em>Ross </em>involved a central, if unofficial, policy of denying employees\u2019 overtime pay. \u201cThis unofficial policy is the common answer that potentially drives the resolution of this litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551); <em>see also McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>672 F.3d 482, 489-91 (7th Cir.2012) (holding that commonality was satisfied by the questions of whether Merrill Lynch\u2019s companywide \u201cteaming\u201d and account-distribution policies violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition on disparate-impact employment discrimination and distinguishing these policies from the policy of conferring discretion on each store\u2019s manager at issue in <em>Dukes).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">This case is more similar to <em>Sullivan, Ross, </em>and <em>McReynolds </em>than to <em>Dukes. </em>The common factual question in this case is what actions Heartland took before, during, and after the data breach to safeguard the Consumer Plaintiffs\u2019 financial information. As in <em>Sullivan, </em>\u201cthe answers to questions about [Heartland]\u2019s alleged misconduct and the harm it caused would be common as to all of the class members, and would thus inform the resolution of the litigation if it were not being settled.\u201d 667 F.3d at 299-300; <em>see also Ross, </em>667 F.3d at 908 (\u201cTo satisfy the commonality element, it is enough for plaintiffs to present just one common claim.\u201d). Questions of law common to all class members include whether Heartland\u2019s actions violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Answering the factual and legal questions about Heartland\u2019s conduct will assist in reaching classwide resolution. Commonality is satisfied under the <em>Dukes </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">3. Typicality</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">This element of Rule 23(a) \u201crequires that the named representatives\u2019 claims be typical of those of the class.\u201d <em>Langbecker v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., </em>476 F.3d 299, 314 (5th Cir.2007). Typicality, according to the Fifth Circuit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-10\">does not require a complete identity of claims. Rather, the critical inquiry is whether the class representative\u2019s claims have the same essential characteristics of those of the putative class. If the claims arise from a similar course of conduct and share the same legal theory, factual differences will not defeat typicality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\"><em>James, </em>254 F.3d at 571 (quoting 5 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 23.24[4] (3d ed. 2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">The representative plaintiffs\u2019 Fair Credit Reporting Act claim is typical of the class claim. Whether Heartland\u2019s conduct violated the Act is common throughout the class. Because this claim revolves around Heartland\u2019s conduct, as opposed to the characteristics of a particular class member\u2019s claim, no individualized proof will be necessary to determine Heartland\u2019s liability under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">The state-law claims also meet the typicality requirement. Although the parties did not present information about the applicable laws of the fifty states and the District of Columbia, presumably variations exist among them. District courts are divided as to when variations in state law in a multistate class action defeat typicality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Stirman, </em>the Fifth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>held that significant variations in state law may preclude a finding of typicality. \u201cGiven the differences among the state laws, it cannot be said that [the class representative]^ claims are \u2018typical\u2019 of the [multistate] class as it is currently defined[.]\u201d <em>Stirman v. Exxon Corp., </em>280 F.3d 554, 562 (5th Cir.2002). The variations in <em>Stirman </em>were similar to those in <em>Sullivan: </em>certain states did not recognize the claim that the class representatives asserted. <em>See id. </em>Such claim-dispositive variations are readily distinguishable from such differences as dissimilarities in specific claim elements that must be proven at trial, or differences in burdens of proof. As in <em>Overka, </em>the state-law claims that the Consumer Plaintiffs assert in this case \u2014 -negligence, breach of contract, and violations of state consumer-protection laws \u2014 \u201care recognized in some form in all jurisdictions and therefore available for all [class members.]\u201d 265 F.R.D. at 18-19. Despite possible state-by-state variations in the elements of these claims, they arise from a single course of conduct by Heartland and a single set of legal theories. <em>James, </em>254 F.3d at 571; <em>see also Norwood v. Raytheon Co., </em>237 F.R.D. 581, 588 (W.D.Tex.2006) (finding typicality met because \u201cgeneral causation and general negligence do not depend on the nature of individual class members\u2019 claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">The typicality requirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">4. Adequate Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">\u201cTo meet Rule 23 requirements [for adequate representation], the court must find that class representatives, their counsel, and the relationship between the two are adequate to protect the interests of absent class members.\u201d <em>Unger v. Amedisys Inc., </em>401 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir.2005). Counsel must be both competent and zealous in representing class interests. <em>See, e.g., Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., </em>429 F.3d 125, 130 (5th Cir.2005). Class representatives \u201cmust satisfy the court that they, and not counsel, are directing the litigation. To do this, class representatives must show themselves sufficiently informed about the litigation to manage the litigation effort.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>401 F.3d at 321. Finally, \u201cthe Rule 23 adequacy inquiry also uncovers conflicts of interest between the named plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent.\u201d <em>Langbecker, </em>476 F.3d at 314 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 625, 117 S.Ct. 2231. \u201c[I]ntraclass conflicts may negate adequacy under Rule 23(a)(4).\u201d <em>Langbecker, </em>476 F.3d at 315. According to the Third Circuit, adequacy of representation is the most important single factor in determining whether to certify a settlement class. <em>See In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, </em>148 F.3d 283, 308 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201cIndeed, the key to <em>Amchem </em>appears to be the careful inquiry into adequacy of representatives.\u201d). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">The dual requirements of class counsel\u2019s competence and zeal are satisfied here. The three co-lead class counsel\u2014 Ben Barnow, Lance Harke, and Burton Finkelstein \u2014 each have extensive experience representing consumers, and other plaintiff classes, in class-action litigation. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. '9, Ex. A). Barnow and Finkelstein, in particular, also have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>experience representing consumer classes in similar data-breach cases. <em>(See id.) </em>The liaison counsel for the class, Harold Gold, also has significant experience serving as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in class-action and multidistrict litigation. <em>(See id., </em>Ex. B). Class counsel have been vigorous in representing the class, as demonstrated by their successful negotiation of a settlement with Heartland, which initially was reluctant to settle. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 87, at 27-28).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Analyzing adequacy of the class representatives focuses on whether there are intraclass conflicts between the class representatives and those they seek to represent. <em>See Langbecker, </em>476 F.3d at 314. A class representative must \u201cpossess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 625-26, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (internal quotation marks omitted). The class representatives have the same interests, and assert the same type of injury, as the members they seek to represent. Neither Heartland nor any objector has raised any fundamental intraclass conflict, and the record discloses none. The definition of compensable \u201cLosses\u201d in the Agreement reduces differences in damages among class members and between the representatives and absent members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Adequacy also implicates the class representatives\u2019 involvement in the litigation. In <em>Unger, </em>a securities class action, the Fifth Circuit stated that adequate representation requires the class representatives to \u201cshow themselves sufficiently informed about the litigation to manage the effort,\u201d given that they \u2014 not class counsel \u2014 must \u201cdirect[] the litigation.\u201d 401 F.3d at 321. The <em>Unger </em>court cited <em>Berger v. Compaq Computer Corp., </em>257 F.3d 475, 482 (5th Cir.2001), another securities class action. The Ninth Circuit has limited the so-called <em>Berger </em>requirement to securities cases. <em>See In re Cavanaugh, </em>306 F.3d 726, 736-37 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see also 1 </em>William B. Rubenstein et al., Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 3.52 &amp; n. 15 (5th ed. 2011); 29A Edward K. Esping et al\u201e Federal Procedure, Lawyers\u2019 Edition \u00a7 70:374 (2012). The Fifth Circuit has not similarly limited <em>Berger.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In another securities case, the Fifth Circuit interpreted <em>Berger </em>as \u201cidentifying] a generic standard for the adequacy requirement^]\u201d <em>Feder, </em>429 F.3d at 129 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Eleventh Circuit agrees that this is a \u201cgeneric standard.\u201d <em>See London v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>340 F.3d 1246, 1254 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Nonetheless, <em>Berger\u2019s </em>\u201cgeneric standard\u201d has not been applied in the Fifth Circuit outside the securities context. Although some district courts in the circuit have extended it beyond the securities cases, <em>see Ogden v. AmeriCredit Corp., </em>225 F.R.D. 529, 532 n. 2 (N.D.Tex.2005) (discussing the <em>Berger </em>requirement\u2019s applicability outside the securities context and citing cases), courts have not extended the <em>Berger </em>requirement to a negative-value consumer class action such as this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>Courts outside this circuit do not demand Berger\u2019s knowledge-and-direction requirement for consumer class actions such as this suit, instead focusing on the more traditional aspects of adequacy: ensuring no intraclass conflicts and class counsel\u2019s adequacy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cClass counsel owe a fiduciary obligation of particular significance to their clients when the class members are consumers, who ordinarily lack both the monetary stake and the sophistication in legal and commercial matters that would motivate and enable them to monitor the efforts of class counsel on their behalf.\u201d <em>Creative Montessori Learning Ctrs. v. Ashford Gear LLC, </em>662 F.3d 913, 917 (7th Cir.2011) (Posner, J.); <em>see also generally In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., </em>622 F.3d 275, 292 (3d Cir.2010); <em>Pelt v. Utah, </em>539 F.3d 1271, 1288 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">As is true in many consumer-class actions comprised of negative-value individual claims, no single class member here has a sufficient stake to be closely involved in the litigation. <em>See Creative Montessori, </em>662 F.3d at 917. Given the minimal individual stakes, Heartland\u2019s general denial of wrongdoing, and the complexities of crafting a class-action settlement, individual class members cannot plausibly be expected to have significant involvement. Far more important to the determination of adequacy than the submission of perfunctory declarations or brief deposition testimony are whether class counsel can adequately represent the class (yes), and whether any intraclass conflicts make the class representatives inadequate representatives of the class (no). Given the nature of this case, the record as to class counsel, and the absence of intraclass conflicts, there is no basis to find inadequate representation merely because the Consumer Plaintiffs have not submitted evidence on the class representatives\u2019 involvement in the litigation and the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">B. Rule 23(b)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">In addition to satisfying the Rule 23(a) requirements, \u201c[t]he proposed class must also satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3).\u201d <em>In re Wilborn, </em>609 F.3d 748, 755 (5th Cir.2010). Under (b)(3), the Consumer Plaintiffs must establish that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>tions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">1. Predominance</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">\u201cThe Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 623, 117 S.Ct. 2231; <em>cf. </em>Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.06 emt. a (\u201cSo long as there is sufficient commonality to establish that the class is generally cohesive, the propriety of a settlement need not depend on satisfaction of a \u2018predominance\u2019 requirement.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit recently compared this inquiry to the commonality question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-6\">The question of predominance is more demanding than the Rule 23(a) requirement of commonality. It requires the court to assess how the matter will be tried on the merits, which entails identifying the substantive issues that will control the outcome, assessing which issues will predominate, and then determining whether the issues are common to the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\"><em>Wilborn, </em>609 F.3d at 755 (internal quotation marks, footnotes, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">A threshold issue is whether variations in state law \u201cswamp any common issues and defeat predominance.\u201d <em>Cole v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>484 F.3d 717, 724 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court\u2019s \u201c[fjailure to engage in an analysis of state law variations is grounds for decertification.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., </em>150 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cVariations in state law do not necessarily preclude a 23(b)(3) action, but class counsel should be prepared to demonstrate the commonality of substantive law applicable to all class members.\u201d (citing <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

In <em>Sullivan, </em>the question before the en banc Third Circuit was whether variations in state law that kept class members in certain states from recovering on the class claims defeated predominance. The original panel held that the case could not be certified for settlement because such variations in the applicable law meant that the claim did \u201cnot give rise to a legal right to recovery in all of the jurisdictions implicated by a nationwide class.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. DB Invs., Inc., </em>613 F.3d 134, 151 (3d Cir.2010). On rehearing, the en banc court explained that predominance was nonetheless satisfied. The fact that the <em>Sullivan </em>class was certified for settlement, rather than litigation, was \u201ca particularly important point[.]\u201d 667 F.3d at 303. The en banc majority found that those objecting to the predominance conclusion \u201cseem to conflate the predicate predominance analysis for certification of a settlement class with that required for certification of a litigation class, relying exclusively upon cases implicating the manageability obstacles inherent in class litigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">One of the cases cited was the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Cole, </em>a nationwide class action arising from General Motors\u2019s voluntary recall of certain models due to airbag defects. Three affected owners sued the auto manufacturer for breach of express and implied warranties and sought to represent everyone in the nation who owned a recalled model. 484 F.3d at 718-20. General Motors argued that the state-law variations on reliance and recovery for a latent defect defeated predominance. <em>Id. </em>at 725. The Fifth Circuit agreed that the class could not be certified for the purpose of litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-11\">[M]any of the variations in state law raise the potential for the application of multiple and diverse legal standards and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>a related need for multiple jury instructions. For some issues, variations in state law also multiply the individualized factual determinations that the court would be required to undertake in individualized hearings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 726. The Fifth Circuit decertified the class. The en banc court in <em>Sullivan </em>emphasized that because the certification was for settlement only, unlike in <em>Cole, </em>\u201cthe concern for manageability that is a central tenet of a litigation class is removed from the equation.\u201d 667 F.3d at 302. The <em>Sullivan </em>court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlS\">Because we are presented with a settlement class certification, \u201cwe are not as concerned with formulating some prediction as to how [variances in state law] would play out at trial, for the proposal is that there be no trial.\u201d <em>[In re </em>] <em>Ins.

The court conceded that there may be some cases in which \u201cvariations in state laws are so significant so as to defeat commonality and predominance even in a settlement class action[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304 n. 30 (internal quotation marks omitted). But when \u201cthe several common questions of law or fact aris[e] from a single central issue \u2014 namely, De Beers\u2019s alleged anticompetitive conduct and the resulting injury caused to each class member\u201d\u2014 common issues clearly predominated over individual issues. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">The present case is more like <em>Sullivan </em>than <em>Cole, </em>but the certification issue is much easier here than it was in <em>Sullivan. </em>Like <em>Sullivan, </em>this class is certified for settlement. Unlike <em>Sullivan, </em>in which numerous members objected, this proposed settlement drew only one objector. Also unlike <em>Sullivan, </em>any state-law variations here do not approach the level of precluding the ability of class members in certain states even to state a claim. Instead, any variations that might be present are well within the range of those affecting only trial manageability. When \u201c[c]on-fronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court need not inquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems\u201d \u2014 such as the need to present differing proof state-by-state or for the court to formulate differing jury instructions state-by-state \u2014 \u201cfor the proposal is that there be no trial.\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">As in <em>Sullivan, </em>this case presents several common questions of law and fact arising from a central issue: Heartland\u2019s conduct before, during, and following the data breach, and the resulting injury to each class member from that conduct. Given the settlement posture of this case and the Fair Credit Reporting Act claim, the common questions predominate over individual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">2. Superiority</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">Superiority examines whether a class action is a better vehicle for resolving a ease than other possible methods, such as individual litigation or consolidation. The Rule lists four nonexhaustive factors relevant to superiority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-12\">(A) the class members\u2019 interest in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-13\">(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-14\">(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).

Humana Military Healthcare Servs., Inc., </em>601 F.3d 1159, 1184 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cThe most compelling rationale for finding superiority in a class action\u201d is \u201cthe existence of a negative value suit[.]\u201d <em>Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>84 F.3d 734, 748 (5th Cir.1996). The finding that common issues of law and fact predominate over individual issues, and the fact that this suit is a consumer class action comprised of negative-value suits, are important. Superiority is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">C. Conclusion as to Rule 23 Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">The proposed class meets the Rule 23 requirements for certification as a settlement-only class action. The motion for class certification, for the purpose of settlement, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">III. Settlement Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) requires court approval of a class settlement and establishes certain procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-10\">(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-11\">(2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-12\">(3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-13\">(4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-15\">(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may be withdrawn only with the court\u2019s approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-16\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The court addresses each of these five requirements, with the (e)(2) fairness requirement discussed last.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-17\">A. Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-18\">\u201cThere are no rigid rules to determine whether a settlement notice satisfies constitutional or Rule 23(e) requirements[.]\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 96, 114 (2d Cir.2005). Instead, \u201ca settlement notice need only satisfy the broad reasonableness standards imposed by due process.\u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>628 F.3d 185, 197 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Due process is satisfied if the notice provides class members with the \u201cinformation reasonably necessary for them to make a decision whether to object to the settlement.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Wal-Mart Stores, </em>396 F.3d at 114 (explaining that \u201cthe settlement notice must fairly apprise the prospective members of the class of the terms of the proposed settlement and of the options that are open to them in connection with the proceedings\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.04(a) (\u201cThe purpose of a notice of a proposed class settlement is to set forth the major contours of the proposal and to inform class members of their right to attend the fairness hearing and to lodge written objections by a prescribed date should they so desire.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-19\">In moving for preliminary approval of the settlement, the Consumer Plaintiffs submitted proposed summary and detailed notices.

B). After a preliminary fairness hearing, (Docket Entry No. 82), the court approved the proposed notice and notice plan as \u201cthe best notice practicable under the circumstances[.]\u201d (Docket Entry No. 85, \u00b6 12). Individual notice could not be provided through reasonable efforts. Heartland did not have the names and addresses of those affected by the data breach and could not reasonably request this information for 130 million accounts from the issuer banks. (Docket Entry No. 87, at 31-32). Consistent with prevailing standards, the court ordered the \u201cSummary Notice\u201d form to reach a minimum of 80 percent of the proposed class. (Docket Entry No. 85, \u00b611).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">The notice that has been given clearly complies with Rule 23(e)(l)\u2019s reasonableness requirement. The plan proposed by Hilsoft Notifications, <em>(see </em>Docket Entry No. 76, Ex. 2), included summary notices placed in the two most popular Sunday newspaper supplements, <em>Parade </em>and <em>USA Weekend, </em>as well as in four popular national magazines; Internet advertisements on <em>2U/7 Real Media, </em>Yahoo.com, and MSN.com; and a press release submitted to nearly 4,500 major U.S. press outlets. <em>(Id., </em>at 6).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Each of these published notices directed potential class members to \u201can easy to remember domain name (www.hpscardholdersettlement.com) where Settlement Class Members can obtain information and documents about the settlement, including the Detailed Notice, Claim Forms, and Settlement Agreement, as well as other documents and information deemed necessary.\u201d <em>(Id.). </em>Hilsoft Notifications analyzed the notice plan after its implementation and conservatively estimated that notice reached 81.4 percent of the class members. (Docket Entry No. 106, \u00b6 32).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">Both the summary notice and the detailed notice provided the information reasonably necessary for the presumptive class members to determine whether to object to the proposed settlement. <em>See Katrina Canal Breaches, </em>628 F.3d at 197. Both the summary notice and the detailed notice \u201cwere written in easy-to-understand plain English.\u201d <em>In re Black Farmers Discrimination Litig., </em>856 F.Supp.2d 1, 29, 2011 WL 5117058, at *23 (D.D.C.2011); <em>accord </em>Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.04(c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The notice provided \u201csatisfies] the broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>reasonableness standards imposed by due process\u201d and Rule 23. <em>Katrina Canal Breaches, </em>628 F.3d at 197 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">B. Side Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Rule 23(e) requires \u201c[t]he parties seeking approval [to] file a statement identifying any Agreement made in connection with the proposal.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(3). This requirement does not concern disclosure of the basic settlement terms; \u201c[i]t aims instead at related undertakings that, although seemingly separate, may have influenced the terms of the settlement by trading away possible advantages for the class in return for advantages for others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Committee Notes (2003). \u201cThe spirit of [formerly numbered] Rule 23(e)(2) is to compel identification of any agreement or understanding,\u201d written or oral, \u201cthat might have affected the interests of class members by altering what they may be receiving or foregoing.\u201d Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) \u00a7 21.631 (2004) [\u201cManual\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">Aside from the general settlement terms, Heartland has agreed to pay class counsel up to $725,000 and $35,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, respectively; and to pay $200 and $100 to each representative plaintiff and named plaintiff, respectively, in incentive awards. (Docket Entry No. 57, \u00b6\u00b67.2-3). The parties have stated that they did not discuss the specific amounts of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and incentive awards \u201cuntil after the substantive terms of the settlement had been agreed upon, other than that Heartland would pay\u201d such reasonable fees, costs, and awards. <em>{Id., </em>\u00b6 7.1). All the amounts are subject to court review and approval. <em>{See id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7.1-.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">C. An Additional Opt-Out Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">A certifying court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it provides an additional opportunity for class members to opt out. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(4); <em>Tardiff v. Knox Cnty., </em>567 F.Supp.2d 201, 209 (D.Me.2008). The 2003 amendments to the Federal Rules explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-11\">Rule 23(e)(3) [now (e)(4) ] authorizes the court to refuse to approve a settlement unless the settlement affords a new opportunity to elect exclusion in a case that settles after a certification decision if the earlier opportunity to elect exclusion provided with the certification notice has expired by the time of the settlement notice. A decision to remain in the class is likely to be more carefully considered and is better informed when settlement terms are known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(4) Committee Notes (2003). Rule 23(e)(4) comes into play when the opt-out opportunity expired before the members received notice of a proposed settlement. It is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">D. Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">Class members must be provided an opportunity to object to the proposed settlement. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(5). The order preliminarily approving the settlement outlined the process for objecting. (Docket Entry No. 85, \u00b6 19). Both the summary notice and detailed notice informed class members of their right to object. (Docket Entry No. 76, Ex. 2). Only one person objected. It appears that he believes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>the settlement is unfair to Heartland because the breach actually did not harm most of the class members. (Docket Entry No. 100). The fact that only one objection was filed is itself significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">E. Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Finally, \u201cthe court may approve [the proposed settlement] only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). This court held a final fairness hearing on December 13, 2010. (Docket Entry No. 110). The lone objector informed the court that he did not intend to appear. (Docket Entry No. 100, at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">The Fifth Circuit lists six factors that a district court must consider in determining the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of a proposed settlement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsG\">(1) evidence that the settlement was obtained by fraud or collusion; (2) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the stage of the litigation and available discovery; (4) the probability of plaintiffs\u2019 prevailing on the merits; (5) the range of possible recovery and certainty of damages; and (6) the opinions of class counsel, class representatives, and absent class members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\"><em>All Plaintiffs v. All Defendants, </em>645 F.3d 329, 334 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These six factors are known as the <em>\u201cReed </em>factors,\u201d after <em>Reed v. General Motors Corp., </em>703 F.2d 170 (5th Cir.1983). <em>See id. </em>at 172. \u201cA \u2018presumption of fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness may attach to a class settlement reached in arm\u2019s-length negotiations between experienced, capable counsel after meaningful discovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, </em>396 F.3d at 116 (quoting Manual for Complex Litigation, Third \u00a7 30.42 (1995)); <em>accord Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Chain Drug Stores v.

O\u2019Neal, Inc., </em>705 F.Supp.2d 632, 650 (N.D.Tex.2010) (\u201cWhen considering the <em>Reed </em>factors, the court should keep in mind the strong presumption in favor of finding a settlement fair.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). This presumption notwithstanding, the settlement proponents bear the burden of demonstrating the settlement\u2019s fairness. See <em>Katrina Canal Breaches, </em>628 F.3d at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">\u201cA proposed settlement need not obtain the largest conceivable recovery for the class to be worthy of approval; it must simply be fair and adequate considering all the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Klein, </em>705 F.Supp.2d at 649. At the same time, \u201ca proposed settlement in which the class receives an insubstantial payment while the fees requested by counsel are substantial could raise fairness concerns.\u201d Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.05 cmt. b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">The <em>Reed </em>factors are examined below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-13\">1. Evidence of Fraud or Collusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-14\">\u201cThe Court may presume that no fraud or collusion occurred between counsel, in the absence of any evidence to the cpntrary.\u201d <em>Klein, </em>705 F.Supp.2d at 651 (quoting <em>Liger v. New Orleans Hornets NBA Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>Civ. A. No. 05-1969, 2009 WL 2856246, at *3 (E.D.La. Aug. 28, 2009)). There has been no suggestion of any fraud or collusion. Nor does the record support such a finding. <em>See DeHoyos v. Allstate Corp., </em>240 F.R.D. 269, 287 (W.D.Tex.2007) (\u201c[T]here are no allegations or indications of fraud or collusion.\u201d). Counsel for Heartland has described the arm\u2019s-length negotiations that resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>this settlement. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 87, at 22, 27-28; Docket Entry No. Ill, at 6). The initial negotiations occurred over approximately one-and-a-half months, resulting in a memorandum of understanding outlining the proposed settlement. (Docket Entry No. 87, at 27-28). Negotiations continued for another two months. (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 9). Given these representations, the lack of evidence showing any fraud or collusion, and Heartland\u2019s initial position that it would not settle, this factor supports a finding that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">\u201cIt is common practice today for class counsel to negotiate a specific fee award after they have successfully negotiated the class\u2019s recovery.\u201d <em>Turner v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., </em>472 F.Supp.2d 830, 844 (E.D.La.2007) (citing cases). \u201cBecause the parties have not agreed to an amount or even a range of attorneys\u2019 fees, there is no threat of the issue explicitly tainting the fairness of settlement bargaining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845; <em>see also In re Combustion, Inc., </em>968 F.Supp. 1116, 1127 (W.D.La.1997) (\u201cFurther, testimony was presented that the matter of attorneys\u2019 fees was not negotiated in conjunction with the settlement agreements but left for separate determination by the Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Here, as in <em>Turner, </em>the parties negotiated and agreed to the proposed settlement before reaching the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees. Their agreement on attorneys\u2019 fees is subject to court review and approval. This factor supports approval of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">2. Complexity, Expense, and Duration of Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">\u201cWhen the prospect of ongoing litigation threatens to impose high costs of time and money on the parties, the reasonableness of approving a mutually-agreeable settlement is strengthened.\u201d <em>Klein, </em>705 F.Supp.2d at 651 (citing <em>Ayers v. Thompson, </em>358 F.3d 356, 369 (5th Cir.2004)). Although this case was settled less than four months after this court ordered a master complaint filed, (Docket Entry No. 21), and before dispositive motions, Heartland repeatedly denied its liability and planned to file a motion to dismiss. Likely motions would have raised choice-of-law issues and required resolving somewhat novel questions of state law. Litigating this case to trial would be time consuming, and \u201c[inevitable appeals would likely prolong the litigation, and any recovery by class members, for years.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. West Pub\u2019g Corp., </em>563 F.3d 948, 966 (9th Cir.2009); <em>see also Wal-Mart Stores, </em>396 F.3d at 118. This second factor supports approving the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">3. The Stage of Litigation and the Available Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">Under the third <em>Reed </em>factor, the key issue is whether \u201cthe parties and the district court possess ample information with which to evaluate the merits of the competing positions.\u201d <em>Ayers, </em>358 F.3d at 369. \u201cA settlement can be approved under this factor even if the parties have not conducted much formal discovery.\u201d <em>Klein, </em>705 F.Supp.2d at 653 (citing, for example, <em>Cotton v. Hinton, </em>559 F.2d 1326, 1332 (5th Cir.1977)); <em>see also Union Asset Mgmt. Holding A.G. v. Dell, Inc., </em>669 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir.2012) (agreeing with district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cformal discovery is not a prerequisite to approving a settlement as reasonable\u201d). The \u201cSufficiency of information does not depend on the amount of formal discovery which has been taken because other sources of information may be available to show the settlement may be approved even when little or no formal discovery has been completed.\u201d <em>San Antonio Hispanic Police Officers\u2019 Org., Inc. v. City of San Antonio, </em>188 F.R.D. 433, 459 (W.D.Tex.1999). \u201cThe Court should consider all information which has been available to all parties.\u201d <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>The parties engaged in what Heartland\u2019s counsel termed \u201cconfirmatory discovery\u201d: Heartland shared with' counsel for the Consumer Plaintiffs over 4,000 pages about the breach and allowed an interview of its Chief Technology Officer. (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 9-10). Class counsel drew on their previous experience in similar data-breach class-action litigation. (Docket Entry No. 87, at 44). The parties have shown that they possessed sufficient information to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and defenses. Class counsel were able to determine the settlement\u2019s adequacy in relation to the probability of success on the merits were this litigation to continue. The court is well aware of the parties\u2019 positions in this case, the legal issues, and the risks to the Consumer Plaintiffs should litigation continue. <em>See Stott v. Capital Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>277 F.R.D. 316, 344 (N.D.Tex.2011). This factor favors approval of the proposed settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">4. The Probability of Success on the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">The probability of success on the merits is the most important <em>Reed </em>factor. <em>Smith v. Crystian, </em>91 Fed.Appx. 952, 954 n. 3 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citing <em>Parker v. Anderson, </em>667 F.2d 1204, 1209 (5th Cir.1982)); <em>accord, e.g., Poplar Creek Dev. Co. v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 235, 245 (6th Cir.2011). \u201cIn evaluating the likelihood of success, the Court must compare the terms of the settlement with the rewards the class would have been likely to receive following a successful trial.\u201d <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 287 (citing <em>Reed, </em>703 F.2d at 172); <em>see also Poplar Creek, </em>636 F.3d at 245 (\u201cThe likelihood of success, in turn, provides a gauge from which the benefits of the settlement must be measured.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). At the same time, a district court \u201cmust not try the case in the settlement hearings because the very purpose of the compromise is to avoid the delay and expense of such a trial.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>703 F.2d at 172 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This factor favors approval of the settlement when the class\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits is questionable. <em>See In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., </em>659 F.2d 1322, 1326-27 (5th Cir.1981) (affirming district court\u2019s finding that this factor favored approving the settlement when the class faced major obstacles in, establishing proof of liability and damages); <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 290 (\u201cBecause the laws of numerous states may be relevant to individual class member claims, plaintiffs would apparently face a further significant challenge to certifying the class outside the settlement context.\u201d); <em>Combustion, </em>968 F.Supp. at 1128 (\u201cOn the other hand, Plaintiffs will have very serious legal and evidentiary hurdles to meet in order to get their case to the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">In this case, it is uncertain whether the Consumer Plaintiffs could succeed at trial, let alone reach it. Heartland\u2019s counsel explained that they were planning to move to dismiss or, failing that, for summary judgment when counsel for the Consumer Plaintiffs \u201cdragged us, perhaps kicking and screaming, to a settlement[.]\u201d (Docket Entry No. 87, at 46). Heartland\u2019s dispositive motions would have raised legal issues difficult for the Consumer Plaintiffs to overcome. For example, the Consumer Plaintiffs assert a cause of action for breach of contract, but they were not parties to those contracts. These allegedly breached contracts were between Heartland and merchants whose goods and services the consumers bought using payment cards. The Consumer Plaintiffs would have to show that they were third-party beneficiaries to those contracts. <em>See generally Heartland II, </em>834 F.Supp.2d at 577-81, 2011 WL 6012598, at *5-8 (dismissing the Financial Institution Plaintiffs\u2019 similar breach-of-contract claim). The Consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Plaintiffs also allege negligence. The Consumer Plaintiffs would have to establish that Heartland owed them a duty of care that it breached by failing to exercise reasonable care in protecting its data from a determined and sophisticated hacker. Even assuming a duty of care, a factfinder could \u25a0 have determined that Heartland\u2019s security measures were reasonable, given current technology and industry standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">A similar problem arises with respect to the Consumer Plaintiffs\u2019 Fair Credit Reporting Act claim. One of the Act\u2019s requirements is that \u201c[a]ny person who maintains or otherwise possesses consumer information for a business purpose must properly dispose of such information <em>by taking reasonable measures </em>to protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information in connection with its disposal.\u201d 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.3(a) (emphasis added). This regulation provides examples of \u201creasonable measures,\u201d including \u201c[i]mplementing and monitoring compliance with policies and procedures that protect against unauthorized or unintentional disposal of consumer information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 682.3(b)(4). A factfinder could conclude that Heartland had implemented reasonable policies and procedures to protect against data breaches. In sum, the Consumer Plaintiffs face numerous legal obstacles in establishing liability on the merits of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Class certification for litigation also presented uncertainties. The Consumer Plaintiffs asserted claims under the laws of the fifty states- and the District of Columbia. Absent settlement, the state-law variations would have to be analyzed carefully to be sure they did not make trial unmanageable. This would present \u201ca further significant challenge to certifying the class.\u201d <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 290 (citing <em>Castano, </em>84 F.3d at 741).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">\u25a0 Against these risks are the concrete benefits that the proposed settlement provides the Consumer Plaintiffs. For those class members with valid claims \u2014 whether for fraudulent charges, identity theft, or lost time \u2014 this settlement allows them to recover without the risks or delays of continued litigation. The amounts likely will not be significantly less than the amounts they would recover were this case to proceed to trial. Because of the class\u2019s sheer size, a claims process similar to the one called for in the proposed settlement would be required. That process would result in class members with valid claims recovering either the same or slightly more than the amount they would get under the settlement. But the settlement provides an efficient and certain result that outweighs slightly higher recovery, accompanied by significant risks of no recovery whatsoever and a certainty of delay.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The proposed settlement\u2019s ey pres provision confers an indirect benefit on the vast majority of the class members \u2014 those who have suffered no personal damages from the data breach or who simply did not file any claim and thus would otherwise recover nothing. In sum, this factor strongly supports settlement approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>5. The Range of Possible Recovery and Certainty of Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">This factor requires the district court to \u201cestablish the range of possible damages that could be recovered at trial and, then, by evaluating the likelihood of prevailing at trial and other relevant factors, determine whether the settlement is pegged at a point in the range that is fair to the plaintiff settlors.\u201d <em>Maher v. Zapata Corp., </em>714 F.2d 436, 460 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., </em>643 F.2d 195, 213 (5th Cir.1981)). The district court\u2019s consideration of this factor \u201ccan take into account the challenges to recovery at trial that could preclude the class from collecting altogether, or from only obtaining a small amount.\u201d <em>Klein, </em>705 F.Supp.2d at 656. The question is not whether the parties have reached \u201cexactly the remedy they would have asked the Court to enter absent the settlement,\u201d but instead \u201cwhether the settlement\u2019s terms fall within <em>a reasonable range of recovery, </em>given the likelihood of the plaintiffs\u2019 success on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">A district court\u2019s failure or inability to establish the range of possible recovery is not necessarily error. In <em>Maher, </em>the parties did not \u201cprovide the court with an express estimate of the range of monetary recovery should plaintiffs prevail at trial.\u201d 714 F.2d at 460. Instead, the parties \u201cprovided the district court with their arguments and positions respecting the merits of the claims being asserted and compromised, the risks of litigation, and the benefits of the compromise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under such circumstances, and given the district court\u2019s otherwise \u201csufficient\u201d analysis of the proposed settlement\u2019s fairness, the Fifth Circuit refused to overturn the settlement because the district court had not given an estimate. <em>Id. </em>at 461; <em>accord San Antonio Hispanic Police Officers\u2019 Org., </em>188 F.R.D. at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">In this case, estimating the range of possible recovery \u2014 in particular, the upper band of recovery \u2014 -is difficult. As the analysis of the fourth <em>Reed </em>factor (probability of success on the merits) demonstrates, the lower band of the Consumer Plaintiffs\u2019 range of recovery is zero: a nationwide or multistate class perhaps could not be certified under Rule 23, or a judge or jury could conclude that Heartland was not liable. Although neither the Consumer Plaintiffs nor Heartland provided this court with an estimate of the maximum amount of class recovery, the upper band is likely to be far less than what the proposed settlement provides. As of the final fairness hearing, fewer than 300 class members had filed a claim. Only 11 were valid. (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 6). Given that the Consumer Plaintiffs\u2019 claims require each class member to prove individual damages, even if a trial resulted in a liability finding, the damages exposure is not properly measured by taking some number and multiplying it by the number of class members because there were so few claims filed, even after the extensive notice campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">The cy pres provision is essentially the damage award. Because no cy pres payments are to be made until class members had ample opportunity to file claims, the cy pres provision did not divert funds that class members otherwise were entitled to recover. The cy pres provision will indirectly benefit not just the class members, but all payment-card holders. <em>See DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 290 (\u201cThe undisputed record reveals the settlement will not only provide significant benefits to members of the plaintiffs\u2019 class, but to policyholders throughout the country as well.\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>on the very small number of claims filed after an extensive settlement notice campaign, the upper band of recovery after trial likely would be much smaller, and almost certainly no higher, than the upper amount offered in the settlement. This factor favors approving the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">6. The Opinions of Class Counsel, Class Representatives, and Absent Class Members about the Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">\u201cThe endorsement of class counsel is entitled to deference, especially in light of class counsel\u2019s significant experience in complex civil litigation and their lengthy opportunity to evaluate the merits of the claims.\u201d <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 292; <em>see also Stott, </em>277 F.R.D. at 346 (\u201cAs class counsel tends to be the most familiar with the intricacies of a class action lawsuit and settlement, \u2018the trial court is entitled to rely upon the judgment of experienced counsel for the parties.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cotton, </em>559 F.2d at 1330)). But a court should not blindly defer to class counsel\u2019s opinion. \u201cRather, the Court must give class counsel\u2019s recommendations appropriate weight in light of all the factors surrounding the settlement.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>472 F.Supp.2d at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">Class counsel have enthusiastically endorsed the settlement. One of the co-lead class counsel has called the settlement \u201cex-eellent\u201d because \u201cit maximizes what could have been obtained for the consumers, and it delivers a real remedy.\u201d (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 42). Class counsel are experienced not just in class-action litigation generally but in data-breach class-action litigation specifically.

Heartland does not dispute the estimate that approximately 81 % of the class received notice of the proposed settlement. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 106, \u00b6 6(a)).

A court must carefully review a proposed fee award to ensure reasonableness. <em>See id. </em>Such scrutiny is necessary to \u201cguard[] against the public perception that attorneys exploit the class action device to obtain large fees at the expense of the class.\u201d <em>In re High Sulfur Content Gasoline Prods.

Litig., </em>517 F.3d 220, 228 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">One district court in this circuit has suggested that a presumption of reasonableness applies when a requested fee award is independent from the class-recovery fund and the parties did not negotiate the fee until after they agreed on other terms. <em>See DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 322-23. For this proposition, <em>DeHoyos </em>cited two cases: <em>McBean v. City of New York, </em>233 F.R.D. 377, 392 (S.D.N.Y.2006), and <em>In re First Capital Holdings Corp. Fin. Prods.

No Fifth Circuit case, however, supports a presumption of reasonableness for a fee award, even if the award was agreed to after the settlement terms were negotiated and is to be paid separate from the class recovery. In <em>Strong v. BellSouth Telecommunications, </em>the Fifth Circuit expressly rejected class counsel\u2019s contention \u201cthat the district court\u2019s responsibility to address attorneys\u2019 fees is circumscribed when the parties agree to the amount of fees[.]\u201d 137 F.3d at 849. BellSouth had agreed to a settlement in which it would deposit up to $64 million into a common fund and agreed to pay $6 million to class counsel for fees and costs. The district court, however, awarded $4.5 million in fees. <em>Id. </em>at 847-48. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-11\">a \u201cdistrict court is not bound by the Agreement of the parties as to the amount of attorney\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Piambino [v. Bailey </em>], 610 F.2d [1306] at 1328 [ (5th Cir.1980)]; <em>Foster v. Boise-Cascade, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 335, 336 (5th Cir.1978). The court must scrutinize the agreed-to fees under the standards set forth in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974), and not merely \u201cratify a pre-arranged compact.\u201d <em>Piambino, </em>610 F.2d at 1328 (holding that by summarily approving attorneys\u2019 fees presented in an unopposed settlement agreement, the district court \u201cabdicated its responsibility to assess the reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees proposed under a settlement of a class action, and its approval of the settlement must be reversed on this ground alone\u201d). That the defendant will pay the attorneys\u2019 fees from its own funds likewise does not limit the court\u2019s obligation to review the reasonableness of the agreed-to fees. Restricting the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>discretion to a perfunctory review in such a circumstance would disregard the economic reality that a settling defendant is concerned only with its total liability. <em>See In re GM Trucks, </em>55 F.3d at 819-20 (requiring \u201ca thorough judicial review of fee applications ... in all class action settlements\u201d because \u201c \u2018a defendant is interested only in disposing of the total claim asserted against it\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the allocation between the class payment and the attorneys\u2019 fees is of little or no interest to the defense\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Prandini v. National Tea Co., </em>557 F.2d 1015, 1020 (3rd Cir.1977)). Because the defendant\u2019s adversarial role with regard to the attorneys\u2019 fees is thus diminished, the court must strive to minimize the conflict of interest between the class and its attorney inherent in such an arrangement. <em>See Foster [v. Boise-Cascade, Inc.], </em>420 F.Supp. [674] at 687-88 [(S.D.Tex.1976)]; <em>see also Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., </em>925 F.2d 518, 524 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that when fees are paid from the defendant\u2019s own funds, a conflict results from \u201cthe danger that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a less-than-optimal basis in exchange for red-carpet treatment on fees\u201d); <em>Court Awarded Attorney Fees, Report of the Third Circuit Task Force, </em>108 F.R.D. 237, 266 (1985) (\u201cEven if the plaintiffs attorney does not consciously or explicitly bargain for a higher fee at the expense of the beneficiaries, it is very likely that this situation has indirect or subliminal effects on the negotiations. And, in any event, there is an appearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d) The court\u2019s review of the attorneys\u2019 fees component of a settlement agreement is thus an essential part of its role as guardian of the interests of class members. To properly fulfill its Rule 23(e) duty, the district court must not cursorily approve the attorney\u2019s fees provision of a class settlement or delegate that duty to the parties. Even when the district court finds the settlement agreement to be untainted by collusion, fraud, and other irregularities, the court must thoroughly review the attorneys\u2019 fees agreed to by the parties in the proposed settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 849-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">In this case, class counsel have moved for $725,000 in fees and $35,000 in costs. (Docket Entry No. 107, \u00b6 6). Heartland agreed to pay up to these amounts. (Docket Entry No. 57, \u00b6 7.2). Class counsel has explained that they arrived at these amounts using a lodestar analysis, crosschecked by the <em>Johnson </em>factors. (Docket Entry No. 107, \u00b6 6). According to the most recent fees-and-costs reports, class counsel billed over 1,960 hours on this case. Multiplied by the various hourly rates charged by class counsel, their lodestar fees exceeded $866,000 and actual costs totaled over $43,000. (Docket Entry No. 113, Ex. 2). The requested award of $725,000 results from a 0.837 negative multiplier. (Docket Entry No. 108, at 20).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Class counsel\u2019s analysis of the <em>Johnson </em>factors, however, is inconsistent with any negative adjustment. In any event, class counsel\u2019s fee request assumes that the value of the settlement to the Consumer Plaintiffs exceeds $4.85 million. (Docket Entry No. 107, \u00b6 5). The value was discussed at length during the final fairness hearing. <em>(See generally </em>Docket Entry No. 111).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>With this background, this court carefully reviews the proposed fee award for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">A. Methodology</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">In common-fund cases-in which class counsel is compensated from the general fund used to pay class members\u2019 damages and claims <footnotemark>20</footnotemark>-district courts generally award attorneys\u2019 fees using one of two methods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-7\">(1) the percentage method, in which the court awards fees as a reasonable percentage of the common fund; or (2) the lodestar method, in which the court computes fees by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate and, in its discretion, applying an upward or downward multiplier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\"><em>Dell, </em>669 F.3d at 642-43. Under the lodestar method as applied in this circuit, the upward or downward adjustment is based on the court\u2019s review of the factors set out in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d at 717-19. The twelve <em>Johnson </em>factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-11\">(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the issues; (3) the skill required to perform the legal service adequately; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney because he accepted the case; (5) the customary fee for similar work in the community; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the undesirability of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-12\"><em>Dell, </em>669 F.3d at 642 n. 25. \u201cThe <em>Johnson </em>factors are intended to ensure \u2018a reasonable fee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson </em>).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In <em>Dell, </em>the Fifth Circuit confirmed that' dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>trict courts have discretion to determine the proper fee award in common-fund cases by using either the percentage or lodestar methods, cross-checked with the <em>Johnson </em>factors. <em>Id. </em>at 642-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">Having two funds \u2014 one for the claimants, one for the attorneys \u2014 is a well-recognized variant of a common-fund arrangement. \u201cA variant on the traditional common-fund case occurs frequently in mass tort litigation \u2014 in both class actions and large consolidations \u2014 where a separate fund to pay attorney fees is created as a part of the settlement.\u201d Manual \u00a7 14.11. Such an arrangement is sometimes called a \u201cconstructive common fund.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cSeveral courts have embraced the constructive common fund approach, warning that \u2018private arrangements to structure artificially separate fee and settlement arrangements\u2019 should not enable parties to circumvent the 25% benchmark requirement on \u2018what is in economic reality a common fund situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bluetooth Headset, </em>654 F.3d at 943 (quoting <em>In re Gen. Motors, </em>55 F.3d at 821). Courts recognize this approach even if they do not use the common-fund label. For example, in <em>Johnston v. Comerica Mortgage Corp., </em>83 F.3d 241, 246 (8th Cir.1996), the Eighth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-7\">The district court concluded that because the attorney fees were to be paid by the defendants separate and apart from the settlement funds, the fees did not come from a \u201ccommon fund\u201d belonging to the plaintiffs, and thus the percentage of the benefit approach was inappropriate. We disagree. Although under the terms of each settlement agreement, attorney fees technically derive from the defendant rather than out of the class\u2019 recovery, in essence the entire settlement amount comes from the same source. The award to the class and the agreement on attorney fees represent a package deal. Even if the fees are paid directly to the attorneys, those fees are still best viewed as an aspect of the class\u2019 recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\"><em>Johnston, </em>83 F.3d at 245-46 (citing <em>In re Gen. Motors </em>).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cIf an agreement is reached on the amount of a settlement fund and a separate amount for attorney fees and expenses, .... the sum of the two amounts ordinarily should be treated as a settlement fund for the benefit of the class, with the agreed-on fee amount constituting the upper limit on the fees that can be awarded to counsel.\u201d Manual \u00a7 21.7.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">Many courts and commentators have concluded that the best approach is to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>the percentage method in a common-fund or variant case with the lodestar method as a cross-check. This approach is particularly appropriate when the value of the judgment or settlement is uncertain.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In this case, the percentage method, crosschecked by the lodestar method, is the appropriate method for scrutinizing the proposed attorneys\u2019 fees award under Rule 23(h). The fact that a minuscule amount of the settlement fund was actually distributed to class members, and the vast majority instead paid to three nonprofit organizations for efforts to improve data security and privacy protection, makes the value of the benefit the class received uncertain. That uncertainty makes it appropriate to use the lodestar method as a cross-check. Using the percentage method, crosschecked by the lodestar method, reduces the risk that the amount of the fee award either overcompensates counsel in relation to the class benefits obtained or undercompensates counsel for their work. Under either method, a fee award is reasonable only if it is proportionate to the actual value created for, and received by, the class. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h) Committee Notes (2003) (\u201cOne fundamental focus is the result actually achieved for class members, a basic consideration in any case in which fees are sought on the basis of a benefit achieved for class members.\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>This approach is consistent with the statements in another federal district court\u2019s opinion in a similar case. In <em>In re TJX Companies Retail Security Breach Litigation, </em>584 F.Supp.2d 395 (D.Mass. 2008), consumers filed a nationwide class action after the same hackers in this case breached TJX Companies\u2019s computer systems and obtained access to 45 million payment-card accounts\u2019 information.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Some of the class counsel in that litigation were the same as the co-lead class counsel in this case. The parties reached a settlement agreement, under which TJX Companies agreed to reimburse consumers for valid claims. Although caps were placed on certain categories of claims, the parties did not place an overall cap on the settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 400-01. Class counsel used the lodestar method to reach their proposed fee award of $6.5 million. The district court was greatly troubled by this award because it was disproportionately large in relation to the very small \u201cvalue actually transferred to class members!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. Calling \u201cthe class action vehicle [ ] broken!,]\u201d the court emphasized that \u201ctying the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to claims made by class members is one step that judges can take toward repair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406. The court nevertheless approved the fee request for two main reasons: first, the court valued the potential benefits of the settlement at $177 million, which could be used as a guidepost for measuring attorneys\u2019 fees; and second, the court \u201cdid not give class counsel any indication prior to the Fairness Hearing that its award of attorneys\u2019 fees might be made with reference to this criterion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. The court concluded with a cautionary note to class counsel: \u201cIn the future, however, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel can expect that this Court, when confronted with reversionary common fund or claims-made settlements, will award attorneys\u2019 fees <em>by reference to the value of benefits actually put in the hands of the class members.\u201d Id. </em>at 410 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">In this case, class counsel had the benefit of the warning issued in the <em>TJX Companies </em>settlement. Counsel also had the benefit of the guidance provided by the cases and authorities cited above. In this case, unlike <em>TJX Companies, </em>class counsel were put on notice at the preliminary fairness hearing that the court was very concerned about the lack of \u201cdirect benefits\u201d to class members under the proposed settlement. (Docket Entry No. 87, at 56). This court also noted that \u201cthe amount of fees ... does not depend for its justification as reasonable entirely on the amount of money made either available or distributed directly, but also on the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>work that the lawyers actually did and the reasonableness of those hours and hourly charges as well.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>These statements are consistent with using the percentage-of-fund approach, with a lodestar crosscheck, to determine the reasonableness of the fee award sought, tied appropriately to the value of the benefits actually provided to the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">B. The Percentage Method</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">\u201cThe first step under the [percentage] method requires determining the actual monetary value conferred to the class members by the settlement.\u201d <em>Bussie v. Allamerica Fin. Corp., </em>No. Civ. A. 97-40204-NMG, 1999 WL 342042, at *2 (D.Mass. May 19, 1999). The court then sets the benchmark percentage to be applied to this value. After setting the benchmark, the district court in <em>In re Dell Inc., </em>No. A-06-CA-726-SS, 2010 WL 2371834 (W.D.Tex. June 11, 2010), applied the <em>Johnson </em>factors to determine whether a positive or negative adjustment of the benchmark was warranted. <em>Id. </em>at *13. Affirming <em>Dell, </em>the Fifth Circuit approved of the district court\u2019s application of this \u201cblended percentage method\u201d or \u201chybrid percentage method.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> 669 F.3d at 642-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">1. Valuing the Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">\u201cIn eases involving a claims procedure or a distribution of benefits over time, the court should not base the attorney fee award on the amount of money set aside to satisfy potential claims. Rather, the fee awards should be based only on the benefits actually delivered.\u201d Manual \u00a7 21.71. Class counsel\u2019s valuation of the benefits as exceeding $4.85 million includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-10\">the reimbursement of Losses suffered by Settlement Class Members in connection with the Heartland Intrusion [$2.4 million], the anticipated costs of notice [$1.5 million], the anticipated costs of the dispute resolution process provided for resolving contested Settlement Class Member claims [$270,000], and the attorneys\u2019 fees [$725,000], costs[ ] and expenses [$35,000], and incentive awards being paid for by Heartland [$200 and $100 per qualified class representative].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGO\">(Docket Entry No. 107, \u00b6 5). The court discusses each component below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">a. Reimbursement of Losses</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">Class counsel values this component at $2.4 million. Heartland deposited $1 million in escrow for reimbursing claimants. Although Heartland agreed that it would deposit up to an additional $1.4 million into the fund (for a total of $2.4 million) if needed to pay the class claims, that proved wholly unnecessary. (Docket Entry No. 57, \u00b6 2.1(a)). As of December 2010, class members had filed 11 valid claims for out-of-pocket expenses resulting from the breach. (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 6). Neither counsel indicated that any of these claims were identity-theft-related. Assuming that each of these claims received the maximum amount for out-of-pocket expenses ($175), that would amount to a total cash payment to class members of $1,925. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 57, \u00b6 2.2(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-13\">The deadline for filing claims, August 2011, has long passed. <em>(See id., </em>\u00b6 2.2(c)). Since the final fairness hearing held in December 2010, neither party has submitted information about any other valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>claims submitted or paid. Although $2.4 million was the maximum amount of direct benefits that the class could receive, the class received a negligible fraction of that amount in direct benefits. Heartland will pay approximately $998,075 \u2014 $1 million less the amount paid directly to class members who submitted valid claims, conservatively estimated to be $1,925 \u2014 to the three organizations under cy pres. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. Ill, at 16-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The record is clear that $2.4 million was never distributed to the class, directly or indirectly. Heartland deposited $1 million, and the Agreement capped its liability at that amount if the claims did not exceed it. That distinguishes this case from <em>TJX Companies, </em>in which the parties agreed to no cap on the possible settlement amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The answer to the first step is clear: the total amount Heartland made available to the class is $1 million. It is also clear that only $1,925 of the $1 million has gone directly to the class members. The issue is the value of the benefit conferred by the cy pres award of $998,075 paid to third-party organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">b. The Propriety and Value of the Cy Pres Payment</p>\n<p id=\"ARu\">The cy pres payment is proper because the recipients \u201creasonably approximate [the interests] being pursued by the class.\u201d Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.07(c); <em>see also, e.g., Nachshin v. AOL, LLC, </em>663 F.3d 1034, 1036 (9th Cir.2011) <em>(\u201cCy pres </em>distributions must account for the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, the objectives of the underlying statutes, and the interests of the silent class members, including their geographic diversity.\u201d); <em>Klier v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., </em>658 F.3d 468, 474-75 (5th Cir.2011) (explaining that \u201ca <em>cy pres </em>distribution is designed to be a way for the court to put any unclaimed settlement funds to their next best compensation use, e.g., for the aggregate, indirect, prospective benefit of the class\u201d in the class-action context only when it is infeasible to make further distributions to the class (internal quotation marks omitted)). Cy pres distributions have been criticized for \u201cviolating the ideal that litigation is meant to compensate individuals who were harmed.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Judge Posner, writing for a panel of the Seventh Circuit, has questioned whether such payments in fact benefit class members: \u201cThere is no indirect benefit to the class from the defendants giving the money to someone else. In such a case the \u2018cy pres\u2019 remedy ... is purely punitive.\u201d <em>Mirfasihi, </em>356 F.3d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">Despite these criticisms, there is ample precedent for cy pres relief here. Under <em>Klier, </em>the Fifth Circuit confirmed that cy pres awards in class actions might be appropriate under two circumstances: first, it must be infeasible to distribute further proceeds from the settlement fund directly to class members; and second, \u201cthe unclaimed funds should be distributed for a purpose as near as possible to the legitimate objectives underlying the lawsuit, the interests of class members, and the interests of those similarly situated.\u201d 658 F.3d at 474-75 (quoting <em>In re Airline Ticket Comm\u2019n Antitrust Litig., </em>307 F.3d 679, 682 (8th Cir.2002)). Both circumstances are present here. First, \u201cit is not possible to put those funds to their very best use: benefitting the class members directly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 475, because the vast majority of class members did not file claims, whether from lack of interest or the absence of losses. The Agreement is organized so cy pres relief is triggered only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>after class members have ample opportunity to file claims. Cy pres is the only way to avoid having the unclaimed funds\u2014 $998,075 \u2014 revert to Heartland, escheat to the government, or provide a huge windfall to the few who filed valid claims. Second, the organizations class counsel selected to receive the cy pres distribution reasonably approximate the interests pursued by the class. These organizations work to create more secure payment-card technology that will help prevent data breaches, and work to help financial institutions minimize the consequences if such breaches occur. The underlying basis of this class action is that Heartland should have had better policies, procedures, and technological measures to prevent this data breach. The interests of class members, and other similarly situated payment-card holders, are served by distributing the unclaimed funds to these organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Finding the cy pres provision appropriate does not determine its value for the purpose of calculating attorneys\u2019 fees. The class benefit conferred by cy pres payments is indirect and attenuated. That makes it inappropriate to value cy pres on a dollar-for-dollar basis. \u201c[Bjecause cy pres payments ... only indirectly benefit the class, the court need not give such payments the same full value for purposes of setting attorneys\u2019 fees as would be given to direct recoveries by the class.\u201d Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.13 cmt. a; <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h) Committee Notes (\u201cSettlements involving nonmonetary provisions for class members also deserve careful scrutiny to ensure that these provisions have actual value to the class.\u201d). Even when, as here, there is a valid relationship between the class interests and the recipients of cy pres funds, those funds do not provide a direct benefit to class members and should not be valued as equal to direct payments to the class members. Discounting the amount of the cy pres payment in determining its value to the class is consistent with the nature of the indirect benefit cy pres provides to the class.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">The question is how much to discount the $998,075 cy pres payment for the purpose of determining attorneys\u2019 fees. After careful consideration, the court has concluded that discounting the payment by 50% best values the benefit conferred on the class. Although the cy pres award will assist the three organizations in working on improved payment-card security, whether, when, and how much improvement will result are all speculative. Although the cy pres award is appropriate, the indirect, speculative, and deferred nature of the benefit strongly support valuing that benefit at one-half of the payment amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">The benefit conferred on the class by the cy pres payment is valued at $499,037.50. Added to the $1,925 paid directly to class members for valid claims, the value conferred on class members by the $1 million fund the Agreement creates amounts to $500,962.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">c. Notice Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">Class counsel includes the approximately $1.5 million cost of implementing the notice program in valuing the settlement. When a (b)(3) class action is certified for trial rather than settlement, the plaintiffs normally bear the notice costs. <em>See Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>U.S. 156, 178-79, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> When a (b)(3) class action is certified for settlement, \u201c[t]he defendant, as the party with the greatest interest in obtaining a res judicata effect for the settlement decree, should normally bear the costs of settlement notice.\u201d 4 Rubenstein et al, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 11:53; <em>see also </em>Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.04 cmt. a (reporters\u2019 notes) (\u201cdefendants typically pay for the cost of notice as part of a class settlement\u201d). Courts often include the costs of notice in valuing a class-action settlement.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">The cost of notice here is $1.5 million. A nationwide notice campaign intended to reach 80% of a class of over 100 million individuals is expensive. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 85, \u00b6 11). Including the notice costs in the value helps ensure that counsel work to make the notice effective and that such settlements are public and that damages are pursued. On the present record and under current law, it is appropriate to include the $1.5 million figure in valuing the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">d. Claims-Processing Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Class counsel includes the approximate cost of administering the claims process\u2014 $270,000 \u2014 in valuing the settlement. District courts routinely include such administrative costs in calculating attorneys\u2019 fees awards. <em>See, e.g., Amunrud v. Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co., </em>No. CV 10-57-BLG-CSO, 2012 WL 443751, at *2 (D.Mont. Feb. 10, 2012); <em>Gomez v. H &amp; R Gunlund Ranches, Inc., </em>No. CV F 10-1163 LJO MJS, 2011 WL 5884224, at *5 (E.D.Cal. Nov. 23, 2011); <em>Ky. Grilled Chicken, </em>280 F.R.D. at 385-86, 2011 WL 5599129, at*18; <em>Serrano v. Sterling Testing Sys., Inc., </em>711 F.Supp.2d 402, 419 (E.D.Pa.2010). The $270,000 cost is properly included in valuing the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">e. Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">Class counsel asks for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of $760,000 \u2014 the maximum amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs Heartland agreed to pay. Because this settlement is a variation on a common fund, the fees and costs are properly included in the settlement valuation. <em>See, e.g., Johnston, </em>83 F.3d at 245-46; Manual \u00a7 21.7. \u201cThe award to the class and the agreement on attorney fees [and costs] represent a package deal. Even if the fees are paid directly to the attorneys, those fees are still best viewed as an aspect of the class\u2019 recovery.\u201d <em>Johnston, </em>83 F.3d at 246 (citing <em>Gen. Motors, </em>55 F.3d at 821); <em>see also, e.g., Vista Healthplan, Inc. v. Warner Holdings Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number><em>III, </em>246 F.R.D. 349, 364 (D.D.C.2007) (explaining that \u201cbecause the attorneys\u2019 fees are borne by defendants and not plaintiffs, they represent a valuable part of the settlement\u201d).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Although only part of the fees and costs sought are approved, to be conservative, the requested figures are included in valuing the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">f. Incentive Awards</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Class counsel also includes the $200 and $100 incentive awards to the representative and named plaintiffs in calculating the settlement benefits. As set out in more detail below, the record does not provide a basis for incentive awards. Despite Heartland\u2019s agreement, the proposed incentive payments are not included in valuing the benefits the class received from the settlement because there is no basis in the record for approving those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"A_h\"><em>g. </em>The Benefit Provided by a \u201cSense of Security\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">During the final fairness hearing, class counsel argued that the settlement value should be enhanced to reflect a \u201csense of security\u201d provided to the Consumer Plaintiffs.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Counsel also characterized the settlement as providing what was in effect free credit monitoring for three- and-a-half years. (Docket Entry No. Ill, at 41-42). Counsel, however, cited neither the \u201csense of security\u201d value nor effective credit monitoring in calculating the $4.85 million settlement value. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 107, \u00b6 5). Even had counsel done so, the record lacks any basis to increase the settlement\u2019s value based for either of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">The settlement provided no credit-monitoring services. The Agreement expressly excludes the costs of credit monitoring from what a class member may claim as a \u201cLoss.\u201d (Docket Entry No. 57, \u00b6 2.2(b)). The Consumer Plaintiffs received an opportunity to make valid claims for defined losses resulting from stolen payment-card information. That is far different from credit monitoring that would include alerts notifying the Consumer Plaintiffs of any problem, to minimize the potential harm caused by the data breach. Heartland did not agree to provide three-and-a-half years of free credit monitoring to the roughly one hundred million consumers in this class. That would have cost Heartland approximately $62.79 billion.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">There is no indication in the record that class members in fact received any \u201csense of security.\u201d The evidence is that the extensive nationwide notice campaign provided class members an opportunity to file claims for defined \u201cLosses.\u201d Only 11 valid claims resulted. This paltry result suggests that the breach had a scant impact on the consumers whose data was compro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>mised. The limited information the hackers obtained did not result in claims by those consumers in this case of identity theft or even of fraudulent payment-card transactions in any significant number. Neither a \u201csense of security\u201d nor the value of credit monitoring is included in valuing the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">h. Conclusion as to Valuation</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">The court values the settlement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-6\">\u2022 <em>Direct Relief to Claimants: </em>$1,925.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-7\"><em>\u2022 Indirect Relief to Class through Cy Pres: </em>$499,037.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-8\">\u2022 <em>{Total Relief to Class: </em>$500,962.50}</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-9\">\u2022 <em>Notice: </em>$1,500,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-10\"><em>\u2022 Administrative Costs for Claims Process: </em>$270,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-11\"><em>\u2022 Requested Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs: </em>$760,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-12\">\u2022 <em>Total Value of Settlement: </em>$3,030,962.50</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">2. Calculating the Benchmark</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-15\">The next step is to determine the appropriate percentage benchmark. \u201cThe \u2018majority of common fund fee awards fall between 20% and 30% of the fund.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gooch v. Life Invs. Co. of Am., </em>672 F.3d 402, 426 (6th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Waters v. Int\u2019l Precious Metals Corp., </em>190 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.1999)); <em>see also </em>Manual \u00a7 14.121 (\u201cAttorney fees awarded under the percentage method are often between 25% and 30% of the fund.\u201d). The Ninth and Eleventh Circuit generally use a 25% benchmark for common-fund cases. <em>E.g., Faught, </em>668 F.3d at 1243 (citing <em>Camden I Condominium Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Dunkle, </em>946 F.2d 768, 774-75 (11th Cir.1991); <em>In re Mercury Interactive Corp. Securities Litig., </em>618 F.3d 988, 992 n. 1 (9th Cir.2010)). The Second and Third Circuits caution district courts not to use a rigid benchmark but instead to consider the particular circumstances of each case based on factors similar to this circuit\u2019s <em>Johnson </em>factors. <em>See Sullivan, </em>667 F.3d at 333; <em>Goldberger, </em>209 F.3d at 51-52. A benchmark may be used as a starting point and then adjusted up or down under the <em>Johnson </em>factors, or those factors can be applied as part of deciding the benchmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-19\">District courts increasingly consider empirical studies analyzing class-action-settlement fee awards<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> to set the appropriate percentage benchmark<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> or to test the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>sonableness of a given benchmark.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cThe tables included in the [Eisenberg and Miller] study are good indicators of what the market would pay for class counsel\u2019s services because the tables show what attorneys have been paid in similar cases, and thus what class counsel could have expected when they decided to invest their resources in this case.\u201d <em>Lawnmower Engine Horsepower, </em>733 F.Supp.2d at 1014 (citing <em>Taubenfeld v. Aon Corp., </em>415 F.3d 597, 600 (7th Cir.2005) and <em>Turner, </em>472 F.Supp.2d at 864 n. 30). Using these studies alleviates the concern that the number selected is arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">The most recent empirical study by Professors Eisenberg and Miller examined data from nearly 700 common-fund settlements between 1993 and 2008.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> A study by Professor Fitzpatrick sampled data from nearly 700 common-fund settlements in 2006 and 2007.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As in <em>Turner, </em>the \u201cclass recovery\u201d is this court\u2019s previous valuation of the settlement: $3,200,635.25. <em>See </em>472 F.Supp.2d at 864. This value falls into the third decile on the Eisenberg and Miller tables. For this decile, the mean fee percentage is 26.4%, with a standard-deviation percentage of 9.8%.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Eisenberg and Miller propose that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnME\">fee requests falling within one standard deviation above or below the mean should be viewed as generally reasonable and approved by the court unless reasons are shown to question the fee. Fee requests falling within one and two standard deviations above or below the mean should be viewed as potentially reasonable but in need of affirmative justification. Fee requests falling more than two standard deviations above or below the mean should be viewed as presumptively unreasonable; attorneys seeking fees above this amount should be required to come forward with compelling reasons to support their request.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">The $3.2 million value in this case falls into the fourth decile in the Fitzpatrick table\u2014 which correlates with a mean percentage of 26.0% and a standard-deviation percentage of 6.3%.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">Both these studies also examined benchmarks for different types of class actions. For consumer class actions such as this case, Eisenberg and Miller found the mean percentage to be 25%<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>; Fitzpatrick found it to be 23.5%.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Fitzpatrick also organized the data by circuit. The mean for the Fifth Circuit was 26.4%.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">Data from the Eisenberg and Miller as well as the Fitzpatrick studies allow this court to set a more accurate benchmark by averaging their tables. <em>See In re Educ. Testing Serv. Praxis Principles of Learning &amp; Teaching: Grades 7-12 Litig., </em>447 F.Supp.2d 612, 630 (E.D.La.2006) (setting the benchmark by averaging the mean fee percentages from two tables reported in Eisenberg &amp; Miller I). Using the settlement value as the baseline, an average of the means from the second Eisenberg and Miller study and from the Fitzpatrick study results in a fee percentage of 26.2%. Averaging the means from the two studies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>for consumer class actions results in a fee percentage of 24.3%. Averaging those two fee percentages (26.2% and 24.3%) results in a fee percentage of 25.3%. That percentage approximately reflects the prevailing market rate that both class members and class counsel could have expected when initiating the litigation. <em>See Lawnmower Engine Horsepower, </em>733 F.Supp.2d at 1014. It also is consistent with the mean fee percentage in the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">Using 25.3% as the benchmark, and before any positive or negative adjustment, the result is a fee award of $766,833.51. This award is approximately $30,000 greater than that requested by class counsel. Class counsel properly recognizes that a negative adjustment, using the <em>Johnson </em>factors, is appropriate to avoid a fee award that is disproportionately high in relation to the benefit the class received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">3. Applying the <em>Johnson </em>Factors to the Benchmark</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">a. The Time and Labor Required</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Examining this factor under the lodestar method requires the court to determine the reasonableness of the hours billed by class counsel. As the Fifth Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-8\">[Plaintiffs seeking attorney\u2019s fees are charged with the burden of showing the reasonableness of the hours billed and, therefore, are also charged with proving that they exercised billing judgment. Billing judgment requires documentation of the hours charged and of the hours written off as unproductive, excessive, or redundant. The proper remedy for omitting evidence of billing judgment does not include a denial of fees but, rather, a reduction of the award by a percentage intended to substitute for the exercise of billing judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\"><em>Saizan v. Delta Concrete Prods. Co., </em>448 F.3d 795, 799 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (internal footnotes omitted). The lodestar calculation, before the <em>Johnson </em>crosscheck, accounts for billing judgment. The percentage method, by contrast, does not account for billing judgment. Billing judgment is appropriately considered in the cross-check, looking at whether the time and labor spent were required. <em>See Dell, </em>2010 WL 2371834, at *15 (considering \u201call time that is excessive, duplicative, or inadequately documented\u201d with respect to this factor (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-11\">According to the most recent fees-and-costs report submitted to this court, class counsel spent over 1,960 hours on this case \u2014 which, at each attorney\u2019s and staff member\u2019s billing rate, equals approximately $866,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. (Docket Entry No. Ill, Ex. 2, at 5). Counsel state that they \u201chave devoted a significant portion of their available time to the investigation, prosecution, and settlement of this case on behalf of the Settlement class[.]\u201d (Docket Entry No. 108, at 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">The fees-and-costs reports do not show that counsel \u201cwrote off\u2019 time in a way that shows billing judgment.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> For example, one day\u2019s entry for one co-lead counsel shows billed time for a call from one attorney about an expert\u2019s review, followed by billed time for a call to another attorney about the same review, followed by billed time for a call to those two attorneys about the same review. (Docket Entry No. 113, Barnow <em>&amp; </em>Assocs. Ex., at 24). Each lawyer billed all the time spent for each call. On the current record, the court cannot conclude that the time spent by multiple lawyers on multiple calls on the same subject \u2014 calls that at a minimum appear to be duplicative \u2014 was reasonably spent or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>billing judgment was used. The billing summary is full of similar instances of time spent by multiple lawyers on the same subject, for vaguely summarized phone calls, emails, or \u201creviews.\u201d <em>(Compare, e.g., </em>Docket Entry No. 113, Finkelstein Thompson Ex., at 3; <em>with </em>Docket Entry No. 113, Barnow &amp; Assocs. Ex., at 6-8). Billing judgment requires adequate documentation of the hours spent and work done. <em>See, e.g., Walker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>99 F.3d 761, 769 (5th Cir.1996). The fees-and-costs reports provide no basis for this court to discern billing judgment. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Docket Entry No. 113, Barnow <em>&amp; </em>Assocs. Ex., at 6 (\u201cCalls and emails re: status of litigation\u201d); Finkelstein Thompson Ex., at 3, 5 (\u201cTelecon w/co-counsel/FTL attys Barnow re review\u201d; \u201cResearch class definition and notice issues\u201d); Sheller Ex., at 1 (\u201cE-mails and blogs re clients and phone call\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">The court does not question the number of hours that class counsel spent. The issue is whether the time and labor were reasonable. Even recognizing that this ease required confirmatory discovery, settlement negotiations, and class-action administration, the number of entries for similar work by different attorneys and the absence of any evidence of the exercise of billing judgment support a negative adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">b. The Novelty and Difficulty of the Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">Class counsel state that \u201c[t]he issues presented by this litigation are novel and difficult\u201d and that \u201cliability, negligence, actual damages, and punitive damages created complex issues[.]\u201d (Docket Entry No. 108, at 20). The case clearly presented risks of not succeeding. But none of these issues can be described as particularly novel for class counsel. Although data-breach litigation is itself relatively new, <em>see generally </em>Timothy H. Madden, <em>Data Breach Class Action Litigation </em>\u2014 A <em>Tough Road for Plaintiffs, </em>Boston Bar J., Fall 2011, at 27 (generally discussing data-breach litigation), class counsel previously litigated two very similar data-breach class actions: <em>In re Countrywide Financial Corp. Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, </em>No. 3:08-MD-01998, 2010 WL 3341200 (W.D.Ky. Aug. 23, 2010), and <em>In re TJX Companies Retail Security Breach Litigation, </em>246 F.R.D. 389 (D.Mass.2007). And, most important, the early settlement in this case meant that counsel did not have to wrestle with the difficult issues that likely would have been presented had the litigation reached the dispositive-motions stage. This factor is at best neutral or supports some negative adjustment,</p>\n<p id=\"AN_\">c. The Skill Required</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">\u201cThis factor is evidenced where \u2018counsel performed diligently and skillfully, achieving a speedy and fair settlement, distinguished by the use of informal discovery and cooperative investigation to provide the information necessary to analyze the case and reach a resolution.\u2019\u201d <em>King v. United SA Fed. Credit Union, </em>744 F.Supp.2d 607, 614 (W.D.Tex.2010) (quoting <em>Di Giacomo v. Plains All Am. Pipeline, </em>No. Civ. A. H-99-4137, H-99-4212, 2001 WL 34633373, at *12 (S.D.Tex. Dec. 19, 2001)). Another \u201chighly important\u201d aspect is \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s expertise gained from past experience as a lawyer and [her] observation from the bench of lawyers at work[.]\u201d <em>In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative &amp; \u201cERISA\u201d Litig. (\u201cEnron II\u201d), </em>586 F.Supp.2d 732, 789 (S.D.Tex.2008) (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 718).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">In certifying the class and approving the settlement, the court has discussed the numerous obstacles facing this class action in litigation. Class counsel\u2019s skill and experience with prior similar litigation clearly helped achieve an earlier resolution of this case. But this case never proceeded to formal discovery, dispositive motions, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>opposed class-certification motions. This factor is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">d. Preclusion of Other Legal Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Class counsel explain at greater length how this factor favors approval of its fee request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-6\">The efforts of Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel in the management of this class action necessarily infringed upon the time and opportunity they would have had available to accept other employment. The reality of complex cases is that work is not easily shifted to other attorneys in a firm not familiar with the matter, with the result that substantially less time becomes available to Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel to attend to other matters. Time devoted to this litigation and its resolution necessarily limited the time available for other litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">(Docket Entry No. 108, at 21). This statement, though logically true, is incomplete, for there is no information about the \u201cother employment.\u201d As the district judge noted in <em>Dell, </em>\u201c[Tjhere is no evidence, such as an affidavit, cited to support this claim. There is no doubt that the attorneys did pass up other work in order to prosecute this case, but the Court cannot assume that legal work would have been more lucrative than this case without any evidence so indicating.\u201d 2010 WL 2371884, at *17. The same is true here. Moreover, much of the work in this case took place during relatively short periods. This factor is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">e. Customary Fees for Similar Work in The Community</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">In setting the 25.3% benchmark, the court already has discussed at length the empirical data supporting the reasonableness of that percentage. The court also has noted the Fitzpatrick study, which shows the mean fee percentage award in the Fifth Circuit to be 26.4%.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> According to class counsel, \u201c[t]he customary contingency fee for representation of many contingency cases within the same geographic area, in much less complex cases than this class action, often ranges from 33 1/3% to 40% of the gross award plus costs[.]\u201d (Docket Entry No. 108, at 21). Class counsel cite a 1995 study on attorney compensation by the State Bar of Texas and a 1992 Seventh Circuit opinion, <em>In re Continental Illinois Securities Litigation, </em>962 F.2d 566. The empirical studies to which this court refers are much more recent; both were published in 2010. And these empirical studies are more focused on the type of fee and fee analysis at issue here. This factor supports the benchmark set by the court, not the higher benchmark that class counsel advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">f. Counsels\u2019 Preexisting Fee Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">\u201cThe fee quoted to the client or the percentage of the recovery agreed to is helpful in demonstrating the attorney\u2019s fee expectations when he accepted the case.\u201d <em>Forbush v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>98 F.3d 817, 824 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). District courts within this circuit have found upward adjustments appropriate if counsel took the case on a contingency basis. <em>See, e.g., Klein, </em>705 F.Supp.2d at 678 (percentage); <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 330 (lodestar). But merely taking a case on a contingency basis does not merit an upward adjustment if the benchmark reflects the market rate. <em>See Dell, </em>2010 WL 2371834, at *17. Although class counsel took this case on a contingency-fee basis, (Docket Entry No. 108, at 22), the benchmark reflects the market rate. This factor is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>g. Time Limitations Imposed by the Client or by Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">According to class counsel, \u201c[t]his case has required significant attention by Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel. Frequently, issues requiring immediate attention arose, and such matters were attended to expeditiously and properly.\u201d (Docket Entry No. 108, at 22). This statement is unsupported by record evidence. The record discloses no external time limitations or pressures outside of the complaint filing deadline, which was extended twice without Heartland\u2019s opposition. This factor supports a slight negative adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">h. The Amount Involved and the Results Obtained</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have held that the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.\u201d <em>Enron II, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 796 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 114, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992); <em>Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc., </em>135 F.3d 1041, 1047 (5th Cir.1998)). Class counsel contend that they \u201cnegotiated a monetary settlement that represents an excellent result for the Settlement Class,\u201d listing the components to the settlement that class counsel valued at $4.85 million. (Docket Entry No. 108, at 21-22). This court has valued the settlement as worth over $3 million, but that includes $2 million in indirect and attenuated benefits to individual class members: $500,000 through the cy pres distribution and $1.5 million in notice costs. On the other hand, the settlement is a good result for the Consumer Plaintiffs given the legal and evidentiary hurdles litigation would have presented and given class members\u2019 lack of interest or losses. Through the settlement and its claims-administration process, those class members who legitimately suffered losses as a result of the data breach, whether due to fraudulent charges or identity theft, were provided with an efficient avenue for compensation. The cy pres payments will fund efforts toward better data protection, though the ultimate results are speculative. The results obtained are a neutral factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">i. The Experience, Reputation, and Ability of the Attorneys</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">The extensive experience and fine reputation and ability of class counsel are clear and unquestioned. See, <em>e.g., Dell, </em>2010 WL 2371834, at *18; <em>Enron II, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 797; <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 331. At the same time, these attributes are to be expected: Rule 23(g) requires them of lawyers appointed as class counsel. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crv. P. 23(g)(1)(A); Manual \u00a7 21.271; <em>see also </em>Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 1.05 cmt. g. This factor is neutral,</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">j. Undesirability of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-12\">Class counsel explains at length why taking on this case was undesirable. The reasons are typical of consumer class-action lawsuits: the defendant is a large corporation with substantial resources, financial and otherwise, for a vigorous defense; and the legal and factual issues presented risks to recovery absent settlement. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 108, at 23). But there were a large number of lawyers who believed the case was attractive. Many lawyers filed numerous class-action and individual suits based on the data breach. <em>(See </em>Docket Entry No. 3). This case was desirable <em>from </em>the standpoint of many plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. <em>See Dell, </em>2010 WL 2371834, at *19; <em>Di Giacomo, </em>2001 WL 34633373, at *12. This factor is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-13\">k. The Relationship with the Clients</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-14\">According to class counsel, all class members \u201cwere kept abreast of the developments in this litigation throughout its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>pendency and by way of the notice program, all as applicable and appropriate.\u201d (Docket Entry No. 108, at 22). This factor, however, appears to address factors other than notice to absent class members. Given the absence of any record evidence showing other communications between class counsel and representative or named plaintiffs, or any class members, this factor supports a slight negative adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">1. Awards in Similar Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">\u201cCourts often look at fees awarded in comparable cases to determine if the fee requested is reasonable.\u201d <em>DeHoyos, </em>240 F.R.D. at 333 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 719 &amp; n. 5). The empirical studies cited by the court provide helpful information. Specific cases also can be examined. Because class-action litigation involving data breaches is relatively new, there are few settlements to examine: three, to be precise. In one case, the court calculated fees using the percentage method, approving a requested fee award amounting to 7.7% of the fund. <em>In re TD Ameritrade Account Holder Litig., </em>Nos. C 07-2858 SBA, C 07-4903 SBA, 2011 WL 4079226, at *16 (N.D.Cal. Sep. 13, 2011). In the two other settlements, the courts calculated fees using the lodestar method. <em>See Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>2010 WL 3341200, at *9; <em>TJX Cos., </em>584 F.Supp.2d at 408. Had these cases used the percentage method, the percentage would be lower than in this case. <em>See Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>2010 WL 3341200, at *9 (approving lodestar award of $3.5 million, but noting that had the court used the percentage method, the $3.5 million fee award would be 20% of the settlement\u2019s value); <em>TJX Cos., </em>584 F.Supp.2d at 409-10 ($6.5 million (attorneys\u2019 fees awarded using lodestar) / $177 million (value of settlement) = 3.7%). The present benchmark of 25.3%, if unadjusted, would stand as the highest percentage recovery of any of the data-breach settlements to date. This factor supports a negative adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">4. Adjustment of the Benchmark in Light of the <em>Johnson </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">The final step in applying the percentage method is to determine whether the benchmark \u2014 25.3%\u2014should be adjusted in light of the <em>Johnson </em>factors. Four of the factors support a negative adjustment. Six support no adjustment. One supports either a negative adjustment or no adjustment. No factor favors a positive adjustment. After careful consideration, the court concludes that a negative adjustment of the benchmark, to 20%, is appropriate. A 5.3% negative adjustment accurately reflects the balance of the <em>Johnson </em>factors and results in a reasonable fee award to class counsel. The resulting fee award under the percentage method, with the <em>Johnson-isLctovs </em>adjustment, is $606,192.50.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">C. The Lodestar Cross-Check</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">The lodestar cross-check is usually applied \u201cto avoid windfall fees, i.e., to \u2018ensure that the percentage approach does not lead to a fee that represents an extraordinary lodestar multiple.\u2019 \u201d <em>Enron II, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 751 (quoting <em>Cendant II, </em>404 F.3d at 188); <em>accord, e.g., </em>Eisenberg &amp; Miller I, <em>supra, </em>at 39 (\u201cThe idea is that if the percentage fee grossly exceeds the lodestar amount, the attorney would be receiving a windfall, and the courts should adjust the fee downward to a more reasonable range.\u201d). The purpose of the lodestar cross-check, however, is to verify the reasonableness of the award calculated under the percentage method, to avoid both over- and under-compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>Applying the lodestar method can be an extraordinarily time-consuming process for a district court tasked with carefully reviewing counsel\u2019s billing records. Those circuits approving the lodestar cross-check have made it clear that district courts need not scrutinize counsel\u2019s billing records with the thoroughness required were the lodestar method applied by itself. <em>See In re Rite Aid Corp. Securities Litig., </em>396 F.3d 294, 306-07 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Goldberger, </em>209 F.3d at 50.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Before <em>Dell </em>was decided, one district court within this circuit conducted what perhaps can be called a detailed spot check of class counsel\u2019s billing records, in addition to relying on the summaries provided by class counsel. <em>See Enron II, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 753 (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit has never indicated that it would relax a lodestar calculation, so this Court has performed a detailed examination in spot checks of the records, though not exhaustive examination of each entry, relying also on the affidavits and declarations submitted by Class Counsel, and has used the <em>Johnson </em>factors endorsed by the Fifth Circuit.\u201d). In this case, the court has reviewed the fees-and-costs reports that counsel submitted and has examined many of the pages thoroughly. It has not taken the extraordinary amount of time needed, however, for a thorough examination of all the time and billing records that counsel generated for purposes of a standalone lodestar analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">The lodestar method requires the court to multiply the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate and to apply an upward or downward multiplier if necessary. <em>Dell, </em>669 F.3d at 642-44. Under the most recent billing summary submitted, class counsel spent 1,963.60 hours on this action. (Docket Entry No. 113, Ex. 2, at 5). If this court had applied the lodestar as the primary method, as opposed to a cross-check, the number of hours reasonably spent would be reduced because the record does not adequately show billing judgment. Under Fifth Circuit precedent, \u201cplaintiffs seeking attorney\u2019s fees are charged with the burden of showing the reasonableness of the hours billed and, therefore, are also charged with proving that they exercised billing judgment.\u201d <em>Saizan, </em>448 F.3d at 799. The lack of such evidence supports a 10% reduction in the number of hours used in a lodestar crosscheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">The hourly rates used are reasonable. \u201cAn attorney\u2019s requested hourly rate is prima facie reasonable when he requests that the lodestar be computed at his or her customary billing rate, the rate is within the range of prevailing market rates[,] and the rate is not contested.\u201d <em>Altier, </em>2012 WL 161824, at *22 (citing <em>La. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Kellstrom, </em>50 F.3d 319, 328 (5th Cir.1995)); <em>see also High Sulfur Content, </em>517 F.3d at 228 (\u201cThe district court must first determine the reasonable number of hours expended on the litigation <em>and the reasonable hourly rate for the participating attorney.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). In this case, the rates ranged from as high as $825 per hour for one the colead class counsel to as low as $90 per hour for a paralegal. (Docket Entry No. 113, Ex. 2, at 1, 5). The mean hourly rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>was $400.81.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The hourly rates are within the \u201cprevailing market rates for lawyers with comparable experience and expertise\u201d in complex class-action litigation and thus are reasonable. <em>Altier, </em>2012 WL 161824, at *22 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Multiplying the hours expended by class counsel (1,963.60) by each attorney\u2019s hourly rate results in total fees of $866,412.50. (Docket Entry No. 113, Ex. 2, at 5). Of course, the lodestar method does not take into account the settlement value to the class. Attorneys\u2019 fees of $866,412.50 would equal 28.9% of the settlement\u2019s approximately $3 million value. At face value, that figure does not appear unreasonable; in addition, it is within the standard deviation of both the Eisenberg and Miller and Fitzpatrick tables. But when the 28.9% percentage is compared to the value of the $1 million fund made available to the claimants \u2014 whether directly or through cy pres \u2014 attorneys\u2019 fees of $866,412.50 would far exceed that fund\u2019s value of $500,962.30. Class counsel, indeed, recognizes the unreasonable nature of this relationship in reducing the requested fee award in the settlement below the lodestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">The $725,000 requested results from applying a 16.3% negative adjustment to the lodestar that counsel submitted. Two things stand out. First, most applications of the lodestar method result in a positive, not a negative, adjustment.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Second, an adjustment is supposed to occur if the <em>Johnson </em>factors, on balance, support that result.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Class counsel\u2019s approach \u2014 asking for a negative adjustment, but implicitly arguing for a positive adjustment under the <em>Johnson </em>factors \u2014 is inconsistent logically, with the record, and with the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-11\">This court applied the <em>Johnson </em>factors as part of the percentage method and concluded that the balance supports a negative adjustment. Although the analysis would differ slightly had the court applied the lodestar method and then the <em>Johnson </em>cross-check, <em>see, e.g., Migis, </em>135 F.3d at 1047 (\u201cSome of these <em>[Johnson </em>] factors are subsumed in the initial lodestar calculation and should not be double counted.\u201d), the result would not be significantly different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-12\">The record and law support reducing the lodestar by a negative multiplier to avoid a windfall to class counsel, given the value of the settlement obtained. The issue is the amount of the multiplier. Class counsel\u2019s requested award of $725,000, which amounts to 28.9% of the settlement value, is disproportionately high. Under the lodestar cross-check, reducing the number of hours reasonably expended and applying a negative multiplier of 0.95 to account for the <em>Johnson </em>factors results in a fee award of $635,527.14.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> That is rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>sonably close to the $606,192.50 figure calculated under the percentage method.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">The lodestar cross-check, in this case, has confirmed the reasonableness of the fee award using the percentage method. Class counsel is entitled to be compensated for its successful efforts in representing the Consumer Plaintiffs and in negotiating a settlement. That compensation, however, must be reasonable based on the value of that settlement to the class. Awarding fees of $606,192.50, calculated and adjusted under the percentage method and <em>Johnson </em>factors, and through the lodestar crosscheck, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">D. Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">Class counsel request an award of $35,000 for the costs expended in this action. (Docket Entry No. 107, \u00b6 6). \u201cIn addition to being entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, class counsel in common fund cases are also entitled to reasonable litigation expenses from that fund.\u201d <em>Radosti, </em>760 F.Supp.2d at 79 (quoting <em>Wells v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>557 F.Supp.2d 1, 8 (D.D.C.2008)) (internal alteration omitted). In <em>Radosti, </em>the district court approved the costs requested because (1) class counsel provided the court documents showing the costs, (2) the court found the costs to be typical expenses, (8) no class member objected to the costs, and (4) the defendant did not object. <em>Id. </em>All four circumstances are present here. Class counsel have provided this court with documentation supporting the costs. The court has carefully reviewed those costs and finds them appropriate for a case of this nature. There are no objections. The costs requested are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">E. Incentive Awards</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">Finally, class counsel seek approval of incentive awards of $200 to the representative plaintiffs and $100 to the named plaintiffs. (Docket Entry No. 107, \u00b6 6). During the preliminary fairness hearing, class counsel explained the rationale behind seeking these awards: \u201cI am a believer in having people to come forward because they have time and expense and that there should be some reasonable incentive because they advanced society\u2019s interest in the truth of the matter in solving problems.\u201d (Docket Entry No. 87, at 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-12\">\u201cCourts \u2018commonly permit payments to class representatives above those received in settlement by class members generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner, </em>472 F.Supp.2d at 870 (quoting <em>Smith v. Tower Loan of Miss., Inc., </em>216 F.R.D. 388, 367-68 (S.D.Miss.2003)). That does not mean, however, that incentive awards are always merited. \u201cIn deciding whether an .incentive award is warranted, courts look to: (1) \u2018the actions the plaintiff has taken to protect the interests of the class\u2019; (2) \u2018the degree to which the class has benefitted from those actions\u2019; and (3) \u2018the amount of time and effort the plaintiff expended in pursuing the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ky. Grilled Chicken, </em>280 F.R.D. at 382-83, 2011 WL 5599129, at *15 (quoting <em>Cook v. Niedert, </em>142 F.3d 1004, 1016 (7th Cir.1998)).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>The court agrees with class counsel\u2019s statement at the preliminary-fairness hearing about the purpose of incentive awards. They reward representative plaintiffs (and named plaintiffs) for their time and expenses spent advocating on behalf of the class. In this case, however, there is no evidence of such involvement, time, or expenses. For the court to approve the incentive awards \u2014 even if they are nominal, and even if the defendant does not object \u2014 there must be some evidence in the record demonstrating that the representative plaintiffs were involved. Absent such evidence, the court lacks an adequate basis to approve the incentive awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">The Consumer Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for final approval of the settlement, for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and for incentive awards, (Docket Entry No. 107), is granted in part and denied in part. The settlement class is certified. The proposed settlement is approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate. Attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded in the amount of $606,192.50. Costs are awarded in the amount of $35,000.00. Incentive awards to named and representative plaintiffs are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">. \"Payment cards\u201d refers to both credit and debit cards issued by issuer banks. <em>See In re Heartland Payment Sys., Inc.
