I have no doubt but that defendants\u2019 witnesses are honest in their judgments; but I think the appraisers\u2019 judgment is confirmed by the values of the ground and the house ten (10) years ago as given by Mr. Ryan, if those values be taken as a factor in connection with the marked depreciation in all real estate in the last seven years, and to this he added the percentage of depreciation of the house that is yearly made and allowed because of wear and tear and the effect of time and the elements. My judgment is that the sheriff\u2019s appraisers-made a fair estimate of the present value of both ground and house; and defendants\u2019 motion will consequently-be overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-26\">Scott Bonham; C.
