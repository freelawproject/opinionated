Cyr, appeals from the judgment of the trial court revoking his probation pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 <em>53&amp;-32,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>and from the denial of his motions to correct an illegal sentence and to open the judgment of violation of probation. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) imposed an unauthorized condition of probation and (2) found that he violated his probation and sentenced him to a term of incarceration. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The court reasonably could have found the following facts. On September 27, 1997, the defendant entered pleas of guilty<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 and one count of prostitution in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-82. He was sentenced by the court, <em>Zarella, </em>J., pursuant to an agreement, to a total effective sentence of five years, execution suspended, with five years of probation. There were three specific conditions of probation. The defendant was (1) to have no contact with the victims, (2) to cooperate with any evaluation and treatment, including sex offender treatment, deemed necessary by the office of adult probation and (3) to have no unsupervised contact with any boys younger than sixteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Supervision of the defendant was assigned to a probation officer with eleven years experience and specialized training for treatment of sex offender cases. After meeting with the defendant and explaining the conditions of probation, the probation officer referred the defendant for a sexual offender treatment evaluation for the purpose of determining whether he would be eligible and benefit from sexual offender treatment. When it was deemed necessary, the defendant was referred and ordered to participate in an authorized sexual offender treatment program. When he failed to comply with the court-ordered special condition, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>was charged with violation <em>of </em>probation. Following a hearing, the court, <em>T. Sullivan, J., </em>found that the defendant wilfully had failed to comply with that special condition of probation, and revoked his probation and sentenced him to serve two years of the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The defendant first claims that \u201cthe trial court lacked the jurisdiction or authority to include a condition for sexual treatment as a probation condition for the defendant\u2019s conduct and that that portion of his sentence was illegal and, [therefore] his failure or inability to secure that treatment to the satisfaction of the probation officer could not legally sustain a violation of his probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The defendant argues that because General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (11), now (12),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not include \u00a7 53-21 (1) as an enumerated offense for which express authority is given to the court to impose specialized sexual offender treatment as a condition of probation, the court was without authority to do so. The court disagreed, as do we, and determined that under the broad authority of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (12), now (13),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it legally could impose a condition of specialized sexual offender treatment when it determines that such treatment is reasonably related to rehabilitation of the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Statutory construction is a matter of law and therefore subject to plenary review on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22, 670 A.2d 851 (1996). When we interpret a statute, our fundamental objective is to give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature, and in doing so we interpret statutory language in light of the purpose and policy behind the enactment. <em>Skakel </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>54 Conn. App. 663, 678, 738 A.2d 170 (1999). \u201cWe first look to the language of the statute and to the general goals of probation in order to discern the intent of the legislature . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>240 Conn. 639, 646, 692 A.2d 1273 (1997). Probation is a penal alternative to incarceration, and its objectives are to foster the offender\u2019s reformation and to preserve the public\u2019s safety. Id., 647. A probation officer shall use all suitable methods to aid and encourage a probationer, and to bring about improvements in his or her conduct and condition. <em>State </em>v. <em>Misiorski, </em>250 Conn. 280, 288, 738 A.2d 595 (1999). In discerning the intent of the legislature, we view these general goals of probation, and conclude that the trial court has the broad authority and flexibility to impose conditions to reach the desired ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (11), now (12), the only provision specifically authorizing specialized sexual offender treatment, does not list the offense for which the defendant was convicted. General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (12), now (13), however, grants the court broad authority to impose \u201cany other conditions reasonably related to [the probationer\u2019s] rehabilitation.\u201d The broad authority to impose condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>tions of probation in subdivision (12), now (13), gives the court, in its discretion, the authority to do what it deems reasonably necessary to rehabilitate the probationer and to protect prospective victims of such probationers.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The court noted that \u201c[d]uring the second phase of the violation of probation hearing, this court reviewed the facts alleged in the risk of impairing morals of a child charges and concluded that given the sexual nature and circumstances of the crimes for which the defendant was on probation, and the fact that the victims were children, the sexual offender evaluation and treatment condition imposed by the sentencing court was reasonable, justified and clearly related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs and the protection of society. Indeed, it was even more apparent to this court after considering and weighing the evidence produced during the hearing that the defendant\u2019s participation in a sexual offender treatment program was an important component of his rehabilitation, given the nature of the crimes and the attitude and lack of insight of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We conclude that the sexual offender treatment condition imposed by the sentencing court was authorized pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (12), now (13), regardless of the fact that the crimes for which the defendant was convicted did not fall within the purview of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (11), now (12).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly found him to be in violation of the terms of his probation and ordered him incarcerated for two years. He alleges that the court committed abuses of discretion and \u201csuggests that he was the recipient of unanticipated and unintentional prejudice [as a result of] the fact that the trial judge for the violation of probation proceeding was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>different from the trial judge at the original [sentencing] and additionally, to a lesser extent, [as a result of] the fact that he was represented by a different attorney at each of those separate proceedings.\u201d The defendant argues that the court should not have found him to be in violation of his probation and, even if it did so find, it should have considered ordering him into a \u201crecently started denials group for therapy\u201d instead of incarceration. We find the defendant\u2019s claims to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\u201c [U]nder \u00a7 53a-32, a probation revocation hearing has two distinct components. . . . The trial court must first conduct an adversarial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant has in fact violated a condition of probation. At such hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which he is alleged to have violated the conditions of his probation or conditional discharge . . . and shall have the light to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in his own behalf. ... If the trial court determines that the evidence has established a violation of a condition of probation, then it proceeds to the second component of probation revocation, the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s probationary status should be revoked. On the basis of its consideration of the whole record, the trial court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. . . . In making this second determination, the trial court is vested with broad discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 289-90, 641 A.2d 370 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The defendant claims that he was found to be in violation of his probation solely because he refused to admit to intentionally committing the acts for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>entered the pleas of guilty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found, however, that the treatment contract had no requirement that the defendant admit that he intentionally committed the acts. In addition to refusing to sign the required contract, the defendant failed to get the specialized sexual offender treatment and indicated his desire to reinstate contact with one of the child victims. The court concluded that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation, stating: \u201cI find that the condition of probation, which was imposed by the court based upon the facts and circumstances of this case, was a reasonable and rational condition. It was an essential and integral component of his rehabilitative program.\u201d The defendant wilfully failed to enroll in specialized sexual offender treatment as required. \u201cIn aprobation violation proceeding, all that is required is enough to satisfy the court within its sound judicial discretion that the probationer has not met the terms of his probation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Rollins, 51 Conn. App. 478, 484, 723 A.2d 817 (1999). The court, therefore, properly terminated the defendant\u2019s probation and did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The defendant also claims that the court, in sentencing him to incarceration, improperly failed to order him to attend a recently started denials group for therapy. The record does not show that the defendant was eligible for such a group or even that such a group was accepted by the probation office.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In determining whether the defendant\u2019s probationary status should be revoked and whether the original sentence should be reinstated with an order of incarceration, the court is vested with broad discretion. See <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 167, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling; reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>52 Conn. App. 557, 563-64, 728 A.2d 10, appeal dismissed, 251 Conn. 117, 740 A.2d 381 (1999). We cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and sentencing him to incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-13\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-32 (b) provides: \u201cIf such violation is established, the court may: (1) Continue the sentence of probation or conditional discharge; (2) modify or enlarge the conditions of probation or conditional discharge; (3) extend the period of probation or conditional discharge, provided the original period with any extensions shall not exceed the periods authorized by section 53a-29; or (4) revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge. If such sentence is revoked, the court shall require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. No such revocation shall be ordered, except upon consideration of the whole record and unless such violation is established by the introduction of reliable and probative evidence and by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\"> The pleas were entered under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
