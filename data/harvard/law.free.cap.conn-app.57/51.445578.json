We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-19\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff was married to the decedent from 1962 until his death on September 28, 1993. The decedent was employed by the defendant, United Illuminating Company, from 1970 until the date of his death. On September 28,1993, the decedent committed suicide by hanging himself in the hallway of his home. At the time of his death, the decedent had an open, compensable workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>compensation claim for injuries to his neck and back that occurred on July 24, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The plaintiff argued before the commissioner that the decedent\u2019s 1987 injury, and the resulting surgeries, chronic pain and depression contributed substantially to the decedent\u2019s suicide. The commissioner, in a comprehensive decision, concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the decedent\u2019s suicide was causally related to his 1987 compensable injury. The commissioner concluded, rather, that the \u201csubstantial, continued, lifelong alcohol abuse of [the decedent] was the significant contributing factor in his alleged depression and/or psychiatric condition, and ultimately resulted in his suicide . . . .\u201d The commissioner therefore dismissed the claim. This decision was affirmed by the board, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that the commissioner improperly (1) allowed Georgann Witte, a clinical psychologist, to testify as an expert regarding whether the decedent\u2019s 1987 workplace injury was a substantial factor contributing to his suicide, (2) failed to apply the substantial contributing factor test and (3) failed to apply the preponderance of the evidence standar d. The plaintiff additionally raises several issues related to the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that the board improperly upheld the decision of the commissioner with regard to each of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The plaintiff first argues that the board improperly held that the commissioner was entitled to rely on Wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>te\u2019s testimony in determining whether chronic pain was a substantial contributing factor in the suicide of the decedent. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We initially note the standards that govern our review of this claim. \u201cThe determination of whether an injury arose out of and in the course of employment is a question of fact for the commissioner.\u201d <em>Spatafore </em>v. <em>Yale </em>University, 239 Conn. 408, 418, 684 A.2d 1155 (1996). \u201cThe appropriate standard applicable to the board when reviewing a decision of a commissioner is well established. [T]he review [board\u2019s] hearing of an appeal from the commissioner is not a de novo hearing of the facts. . . . [I]t is obligated to hear the appeal on the record and not retry the facts. . . . [T]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>52 Conn. App. 813, 815-16, 728 A.2d 527 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201cOur role is to determine whether the review [board\u2019s] decision results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . This standard clearly applies to conflicting expert medical testimony. It [is] the province of the commissioner to accept the evidence which impress[es] him as being most credible and more weighty.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u201cExpert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em>228 Conn. 582, 591, 637 A.2d 1088 (1994). \u201cOnce the threshold question of usefulness . . . has been satisfied, any other questions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>expert\u2019s qualifications properly go to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of his testimony.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Margolis, </em>215 Conn. 408, 417, 576 A.2d 489 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Several witnesses testified at the hearing before the commissioner. The plaintiff presented two medical expert witnesses, James Alexander and Thomas R. Rosten, in support; of her claim that the decedent\u2019s suicide was causally related to his 1987 work-related injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alexander, a board certified physician in pain management, saw the decedent on August 17, 1993. Alexander opined that it was reasonably medically probable that the decedent\u2019s suicide was related to and motivated by feelings of helplessness or hopelessness due to chronic pain and major depression. The commissioner, however, did not credit Alexander\u2019s testimony for the reason that it was based on an incomplete and inaccurate medical history. In this regard, the commissioner noted that Alexander was not advised of the decedent\u2019s extensive prior psychiatric history and treatment, nor did he review the decedent\u2019s work records or personal journal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Rosten, a physician board certified in neurology and psychiatry,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified that he believed that the decedent\u2019s depressive disorder was related to the original injuiy and the sequelae of that injury. He based his opinion on reasonable medical probability that depressive disorder, in addition to the chronic pain syndrome, was a substantial contributing factor in the etiology of the decedent\u2019s suicide. The commissioner, however, credited only part of Rosten\u2019s testimony. The commissioner reasoned that Rosten testified without ever treating the decedent, did not review the decedent\u2019s journal and did not understand or know that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>decedent\u2019s job in 1993 did not require physical strength. The commissioner further stated that Kosten based many of his conclusions on a history that began with a work accident and not on a history of approximately twenty years of alcohol abuse and depression prior to the work accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The defendant presented evidence at the hearing that the decedent\u2019s suicide was not related to his compensable injury, arguing, rather, that the decedent\u2019s lifelong battle with alcoholism and depression resulted in his suicide. In support of this theory, the defendant presented Witte. The commissioner accepted Witte as an expert in the area of clinical psychology and substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The plaintiff argues that the commissioner improperly accepted Witte as an expert. According to the plaintiff, Witte does not qualify as an expert regarding the specific issue in this case, namely, whether chronic pain was a substantial contributing factor in the decedent\u2019s death. The plaintiff contends that to qualify as an expert in this regard, Witte was required to have expertise in chronic pain and the etiology of suicide, which she did not have. In support of this argument, the plaintiff notes that the commissioner accepted Witte as an expert in the areas of clinical psychology and substance abuse, not in the areas of chronic pain and suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">We conclude that the commissioner properly permitted Witte to testify as an expert, and that this decision was properly upheld by the board. The issue, as framed by the commissioner, was \u201cwhether [the decedent\u2019s] compensable injury to his back and neck of July 24, 1987 and the alleged sequelae of that accident, including cervical and lumbar spine fusions, alleged chronic pain and depression were substantial contributing factors in [the decedent\u2019s] death by suicide . . . .\u201d The record reflects that Witte was qualified to testify regarding this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>issue. Specifically, Witte was qualified to testify that the decedent\u2019s lifelong battle with alcoholism and depression, rather than chronic pain resulting from his 1987 injury, contributed substantially to the decedent\u2019s death. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Pommier, </em>5 Conn. App. 29, 37, 496 A.2d 975 (1985) (distinction between psychiatrists and psychologists \u201cdoes not make one an expert and the other not an expert\u201d); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Lovallo, </em>2 Conn. App. 579, 586-87, 481 A.2d 1286 (1984) (psychiatrist should have been permitted to testify regarding causal relationship between suicide attempt and prior surgery).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">With regard to her qualifications, Witte testified that she had received a doctorate in clinical psychology from Rutgers University, where her major training focus was substance abuse, primarily alcoholism. Her postgraduate clinical internship focused on depression, and she worked at the substance abuse treatment unit of the Yale Medical School department of psychology. Witte testified that since 1989, her private practice has specialized in \u201cdual diagnosis\u201d patients, alcoholism and chronic pain, along with depression. She indicated that because her practice is well known for chronic pain work, she has had considerable experience with chronic pain patients. She further indicated that she has extensive clinical experience with suicides.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The commissioner found that Witte did the most thorough review of the entire body of evidence concerning the life of the decedent. Witte opined, on the basis of her review of all of the records, testimony at earlier hearings, the histories provided to each of the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>dent\u2019s medical providers, and the decedent\u2019s personal journal, that the decedent\u2019s 1987 injury was not a substantial factor in causing his suicide. She concluded that alcohol abuse was a life threatening problem for the decedent long before his employment with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Regarding the decedent\u2019s drinking problem, Witte noted that the decedent had a twenty-eight year history of alcohol abuse. Witte found from the records that the decedent reported his father to be an alcoholic and that his mother had a drinking problem. Witte concluded that a family history of alcohol abuse is a very clear predisposing factor for later alcoholism, either because of genetics, learned behaviors or both. She further testified that alcoholism is a significant risk factor for suicide and that middle-aged alcoholic males are particularly prone to suicide. According to Witte, a review of the decedent\u2019s various medical records* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> indicated stress from his son\u2019s illness,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> tremendous work responsibilities and a stressful home life as the reasons for the decedent\u2019s increased drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The commissioner found that in October, 1989, the plaintiff and her son arranged a meeting with the decedent\u2019s supervisor, John Buffa, to discuss the decedent\u2019s alcohol problem. After meeting with the plaintiff, Buffa learned of the decedent\u2019s absences and operating errors. Buffa suspended the decedent on October 24, 1989, and requested that the decedent seek substance abuse counseling. The defendant thereafter placed the decedent on a continuing drug and alcohol screening program. The commissioner accepted Witte\u2019s testimony that the plaintiffs meeting with Buffa created a crisis for the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On March 9,1990, the decedent met with a counselor at the Southern Connecticut Substance Abuse Center. According to Witte, the records from the March 9,1990 visit, revealed the decedent\u2019s panic, and the fact that he threatened suicide and harm to others that day. Two days later, on March 11, 1990, the decedent threatened the plaintiff with a kitchen knife and the police were called to the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Witte defined chronic pain as \u201cpain which is experienced daily on a continuing basis for a period of time (for many months or years) where there is an underlying medical condition.\u201d She indicated that a chronic pain patient generally cannot work full-time on a regular basis because the pain is disabling by definition. Witte reviewed the decedent\u2019s journal and indicated that it did not focus on physical pain or possible surgery. The decedent\u2019s journal revealed, rather, that for the last six months of his life, the decedent was frustrated, angry and preoccupied with perceived conflicts with supervisors, equipment malfunctions and other work problems. The commissioner accepted Witte\u2019s testimony that the decedent\u2019s performance problems during 1993 were very threatening to the decedent and made him feel vulnerable. Witte concluded that the decedent did not have continuous pain from the time of his work accident in 1987 to the end of his life. She further indicated that there was no evidence that the decedent was psychotic when he committed suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It was within the commissioner\u2019s discretion to credit all, part or none of the expert testimony presented at the hearing. <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 819. The board did not abuse its discretion in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision to allow Witte to testify regarding the claimed causal relationship between the decedent\u2019s 1987 injury and his suicide, and to rely on that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The plaintiff next argues that the commissioner\u2019s decision should be reversed because she failed to apply the substantial contributing factor test. We disagree with the plaintiffs characterization of the commissioner\u2019s decision, and conclude that the commissioner applied the proper standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We begin by noting that traditional concepts of proximate cause furnish the appropriate analysis for determining causation in workers\u2019 compensation cases. See <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>204 Conn. 104, 118, 527 A.2d 664 (1987); see also <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 449, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989). \u201c[T]he test for determining whether particular conduct is a proximate cause of an injury [is] whether it was a substantial factor in producing the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <em>omitted.) Paternostro </em>v. <em>Arborio Corp., </em>56 Conn. App. 215, 222, 742 A.2d 409 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 928, 746 A.2d 788 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The plaintiff refers to the commissioner\u2019s statement that \u201cthe medical evidence and treatment records submitted demonstrated that the substantial continued lifelong alcohol abuse [by the decedent] was <em>the </em>significant contributing factor in his alleged depression and/or psychiatric condition, and ultimately resulted in his suicide . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to the plaintiff, this conclusion implies that only one factor can be <em>the </em>significant factor. The plaintiff contends that she did not need to prove that chronic pain was the <em>sole </em>factor in the suicide, only that it was a substantial factor. In this regard, the plaintiff argues that a finding that alcoholism played a role in the decedent\u2019s suicide did not preclude a finding that his 1987 injury and resulting chronic pain were <em>also </em>substantial factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">A review of the commissioner\u2019s decision reveals that she properly applied the substantial factor test in con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>eluding that the decedent\u2019s lifelong battle with alcoholism and depression rather than his 1987 injury, caused the decedent to commit suicide. Although the plaintiff argues that the commissioner applied a standard requiring her to prove that the employment was the sole factor in the decedent\u2019s suicide, rather than a substantial contributing factor in the suicide, the decision clearly indicates that this is not the case. At the outset of the decision, the commissioner phrased the issue before her by referring to the substantial factor test.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The commissioner later stated in the decision that \u201c[t]he work-related injuries and the sequelae of those injuries, including the alleged chronic pain, <em>were not substantial contributing factors </em>in [the decedent\u2019s] death . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The commissioner further indicated that \u201c[the decedent\u2019s] 1987 compensable work injury, subsequent surgeries, sequelae of the surgeries or the alleged chronic pain <em>was notin any way a contributing factor </em>in that suicide . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contrary to the plaintiffs argument, she was not required to prove that the 1987 injury and the resulting chronic pain was the sole factor in the decedent\u2019s suicide.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The plaintiff next argues that the commissioner failed to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard. The plaintiff again refers to the commissioner\u2019s statement that \u201cthe evidence presented also fail[s] to establish by a preponderance of evidence that but for his work-related injury [the decedent] would not have committed suicide . . . .\u201d The plaintiff again argues that she was required to prove only that the decedent\u2019s injury was a substantial contributing factor in his suicide, and that she did not need to negate all other possibilities. We disagree with the plaintiffs characterization of the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">As previously discussed, the commissioner properly applied the substantial contributing factor test. The commissioner also properly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard. The commissioner stated that the plaintiff \u201cfailed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the decedent . . . suffered from a psychiatric condition and/or chronic pain syndrome which was causally related to the compensable July 24, 1987 work injury . . . .\u201d The commissioner further found that \u201cthe evidence in this case failed to establish by a preponderance of evidence that the suicide of [the decedent] arose out of and in the course of his employment . . . .\u201d Contrary to the plaintiffs argument, the commissioner did not require her to negate all other possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We consider the plaintiffs final three arguments together because they all involve challenges to the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the decision of the commissioner includes findings unsupported by the facts. She also contends that the commissioner failed to include uncontroverted material facts in the decision. Finally, the plaintiff argues that the commissioner\u2019s conclusions cannot stand because they are inconsistent with the subordinate findings and underlying facts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u201c[T]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988). \u201cWhere the subordinate facts allow for diverse inferences, the commissioner\u2019s selection of the inference to be drawn must stand unless it is based on an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d <em>Paternostro </em>v. <em>Arborio Corp., </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 219. \u201cOnce the commissioner makes a factual finding, [we are] bound by that finding if there is evidence in the record to support it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The plaintiff argues that the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact regarding the decedent\u2019s histoiy of alcohol abuse, complaints of pain, the weight of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, the possible relationship of the decedent\u2019s drinking to his death and work performance, and the defendant\u2019s response to the decedent\u2019s 1987 injury claim are not supported by the evidence. She further argues that certain material, undisputed facts that were not included in the commissioner\u2019s decision establish that the decedent suffered from chronic pain resulting from the 1987 injury, which contributed to his depression and suicide. She additionally contends that the pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>was a substantial contributing factor in the decedent\u2019s suicide and that Witte did not qualify as an expert in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The evidence presented to the commissioner, as previously indicated, supports the commissioner\u2019s finding that the decedent\u2019s suicide was the result of his alcoholism and depression, rather than his 1987 injury. This conclusion was properly based on inferences reasonably drawn from the subordinate facts and was a correct application of the law. See id., 222. The board, therefore, properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\"> The plaintiff raises three arguments related to the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact. Specifically, she argues that the decision of the commissioner should be reversed because (1) if includes findings unsupported by the facts, (2) the commissioner failed to include uneontroverted material facts in the finding and (3) the commissioner made inferences inconsistent with subordinate facts, and, therefore, the conclusions of the commissioner cannot stand. These issues will be considered together in part IV of the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> The plaintiff also produced documentary evidence, including medical records of the decedent and testimony from several other nonexpert witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\"> Kosten is a professor of psychiatry and the director of the division of substance abuse at Yale University.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> Witte testified as follows during her voir dire examination: \u201cClinically, [suicide is] something that I have to deal with all the time.
