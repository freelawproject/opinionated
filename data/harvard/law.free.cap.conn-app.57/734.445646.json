The sole issue raised on appeal is that \u201c[t]he habeas court erred when it denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus.\u201d Following a review of the record and briefs and after hearing the parties at oral argument, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing that he has been denied a state or federal constitutional right. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The record discloses that the petitioner was convicted of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) on November 9, 1989. The conviction was affirmed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Diggs, </em>219 Conn. 295, 592 A.2d 949 (1991). The petitioner then filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s petition was predicated on a factual review of the petitioner\u2019s claim. \u201cThis court does not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McClam, </em>44 Conn. App. 198, 208, 689 A.2d 475, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 912, 690 A.2d 400 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision, the habeas court analyzed the petitioner\u2019s claims and the law applicable thereto. <em>Diggs </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>46 Conn. Sup. 344, 750 A.2d 1161 (1999). Because the habeas court\u2019s memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>of decision fully addresses the sole issue raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Salinas, </em>57 Conn. App. 649, 749 A.2d 1228 (2000). We conclude that the habeas court had before it sufficient evidence to find as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
