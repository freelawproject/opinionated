On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court acted improperly (1) in finding that the record established that his plea of guilty was knowing, intelligent and voluntary,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) in rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in the underlying criminal proceeding, and (3) in rejecting his claim that the trial court and the trial court clerk deprived him of his right to appeal.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The petitioner was arrested in March, 1988, and charged under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a with the March 19, 1988 murder of Marcel Malcolm. Attorney Michael A. Peck was retained on March 20, 1988, to represent him. On May 27, 1988, the petitioner was scheduled for a probable cause hearing on the murder charge. On that date, Peck informed the court that the probable cause hearing was being waived and requested the court to make a finding of probable cause preliminary to the petitioner\u2019s entering a plea to the murder charge. After the court, <em>Kline, J., </em>inquired of the petitioner concerning Peck\u2019s statement, the court made a finding that probable cause existed to prosecute the petitioner for murder under \u00a7 53a-54a. On May 27,1988, the petitioner entered a plea of not guilty to the charge of murder and elected a jury trial. On July 14, 1989, however, the petitioner entered a plea of guilty, and, following a plea canvass, the trial court, <em>Norko, J., </em>accepted his guilty plea and made a finding of guilty. The petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was entered pursuant to an agreement that assistant state\u2019s attorney Warren Maxwell would recommend a sentence of forty years. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the time of his plea, the petitioner, upon inquiry of the court, stated that he felt Peck had been effective in representing his interests and that he knew of no reason why the court should not accept his plea. On August 31, 1989, the court imposed a total effective sentence of forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">We first take up the claim that the habeas court acted improperly in finding that the petitioner\u2019s plea canvass was adequate to demonstrate a knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the petitioner objects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>to the trial court\u2019s (1) dismissing as \u201cinsignificant\u201d his objection to certain of the facts proffered by the prosecutor at the time of the plea, (2) statement that \u201cthe only thing that mattered, [was] the \u2018gravamen\u2019 of the offense [which was] the act of pulling the trigger\u201d and (3) failure to advise him of the intent element of the crime of murder under \u00a7 53a-54a.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\u201cA guilty plea . . . that is not both voluntary and knowing is in violation of due process and thus void. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>197 Conn. 337, 341, 497 A.2d 390 (1985). For a guilty plea to be truly voluntary, the defendant must understand the law in relation to the facts. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 466. Moreover, since a defendant waives several constitutional rights when he elects to plead guilty to a criminal offense, the choice of a guilty plea is of profound significance. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 120, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). In pleading guilty, a defendant waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury and his right to confront his accusers. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra [243]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra [341]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra [120]; see Practice Book \u00a7 711 (5) [now \u00a7 39-19 (5)]. A guilty plea, therefore, is constitutionally valid only if the record affirmatively discloses that the plea was entered voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 242; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra [342]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 340, 387 A.2d 550 (1978); <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 373, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977).\u201d <em>Oppel </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>200 Conn. 553, 556, 512 A.2d 888 (1986). A guilty plea may satisfy constitutional requirements even in the absence of literal compliance with the prophylactic safeguards of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 31-19 and 31-20, respectively. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 418, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>107 S.

When the prosecutor presented the factual basis for the plea, he recited the following: \u201cThe [petitioner] and the victim had been engaged in illegal business activities, and a dispute erupted over the\u2014a debt of four hundred dollars, which the victim claimed [the petitioner] owed him. . . . What happened was there was a prearranged meeting between [the petitioner] and the victim to meet on Lyme Street in Hartford. The victim arrived there in a white Nissan. In the car with him was one of the state\u2019s witnesses [Robert Gordon]. . . . Earlier that day, [the petitioner] had called another state\u2019s witness by the name of Mark Osborne. Now, Mr. Osborne was the owner\u2014and I believe legitimate owner\u2014of a shotgun. . . . [The petitioner] called Mr. Osborne, told him he wanted to borrow his rifle. [When] Osborne inquired why he wanted it, [the petitioner] responded that he wanted to\u2014he was going to meet with the victim and he wanted to scare him. There was no indication it was going to be used other than to scare the victim. Osborne consented to its use for that purpose. [The petitioner] went to Tower Avenue, where Osborne lived, and was greeted by Osborne, who had the shotgun in a box in the first floor of that apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>[with] some twelve gauge shotgun shells. And he delivered possession of that weapon and the\u2014some shells to [the petitioner], who promptly put it into the pant leg of a sweat suit he was wearing. He invited Osborne to join him, and Osborne said he would. The two of them proceeded to walk west of Tower Avenue toward Lyme Street. As they were walking on Lyme Street, an RX-7 Mazda pulled up\u2014stolen. Another man by the name of [Robert Grant] was driving that car. Both of these parties got into the Mazda and proceeded . . . to Lyme Street. When they got there, they saw the white Nissan parked and they knew the victim was in it. Both Osborne and [the petitioner] exited the Mazda and proceeded to walk toward the white Nissan. The RX-7, with [Grant] driving it, left. At this point, the passenger in the victim\u2019s car got out of the white Nissan, went around to the passenger side, off to the side of it. The other two continued to approach the car. At this point, [the petitioner] went to the car window. Both witnesses . . . then saw [the petitioner] unzip his jacket, remove the shotgun from the pant leg, point it into the window, [make] some threatening comment, and [say] he had five seconds and proceeded to count a down count\u2014 five, four, three, two and then fired point blank at close range with that shotgun, striking the victim in the face. He racked the shotgun, fired a second time, striking the trachea, racked the shotgun, fired a third time, striking the left shoulder area. The body was torn apart. The witnesses were shocked, they never thought this was going to happen. Right after the shooting occurred, the Mazda returned. Now all three of them get into the Mazda and they leave the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Upon inquiry by the trial court, the prosecutor also informed the court that the $400 debt referred to arose out of an ongoing arrangement whereby the petitioner would sell drugs for the victim, and the petitioner failed to remit $400 to the victim. At that time, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>also informed the court that Osborne and the passenger in the Nissan were available to testify against the petitioner, but that Grant was unavailable because criminal charges were pending against him arising from the same incident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">At that point, the trial court made the following inquiries of the defendant and received the following responses:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">\u201cThe Court: Thank you, Mr. Maxwell. Mr. Daniel, the facts indicated by the state on the record\u2014you\u2019ve [pleaded] guilty to murder before this court, based upon the recitation of Mr. Maxwell of the facts, do you dispute any of the facts as indicated by the state on the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: What I just heard?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">\u201cThe Court: Which facts do you dispute, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: That\u2019s not what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">\u201cThe Court: Now, you\u2019re being charged with murder, you\u2019ve just [pleaded] guilty to murder. And the gravamen obviously is the moment when, according to the state, you shot the victim here on three\u2014three different occasions. Are those facts accurate?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">\u201cThe Court: So you did have the shotgun in your hand, the facts as far as the state has alleged on the record of shooting the victim here, [racking] the gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>after the first time two other times\u2014you shot him three times?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Now, as far as the factual basis which you dispute, tell me about that.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: As far as what happened between me and [Osborne], and [Gordon], the witness who was in the white [Nissan], that\u2019s not trae.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">\u201cThe Court: Explain further, what do you mean it\u2019s not true? Why isn\u2019t it true?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: As far as\u2014I mean, what happened, or is it just\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">\u201cThe Court: Tell me. Sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: The call that Robert Gordon got, he didn\u2019t get a call from me telling him to meet me on Lyme Street. As far as Mark Osborne telling me about the gun and I\u2019m inviting him along, I didn\u2019t invite [Osborne] anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">\u201cThe Court: He just came along?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: Just came.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">\u201cThe Court: Is there anything else you dispute about the facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">\u201cThe [Petitioner]: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">The petitioner argues that the trial court \u201cdismisses\u201d his objections to the recited facts as \u201cinsignificant in the face of the later reading of the murder [statute], including the element of intent to kill.\u201d He maintains that the trial court\u2019s response to his dispute with the factual basis \u201cwas to inform him that the only thing that mattered, the \u2018gravamen\u2019 of the offense was the pulling of the trigger\u201d and that he was not informed that the court intended to draw an inference to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>death from <em>that </em>factual basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He claims also that the \u201cdefect\u201d in the plea is not overcome by the trial court\u2019s reading of the murder statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In context, it is not quite correct for the petitioner to argue that the court dismissed his objection as insignificant in the face of its later reading of the murder statute. In making this argument, the petitioner does not analyze the quality of his objections in the first instance with reference to the matter at hand, i.e., his plea to murder. The state\u2019s proffer said that the petitioner invited Osborne to join him. The petitioner denied this, saying that he \u201cdidn\u2019t invite [Osborne] anywhere.\u201d That is a wholly peripheral matter; it is not material to the validity of the canvass. The state\u2019s second proffer that the petitioner disputes is of the same quality, i.e., that Gordon got a call from the petitioner to meet him on Lyme Street. Parenthetically, the prosecutor, at the time of the plea, informed the trial court that Gordon, who observed \u201cthis whole thing,\u201d was not even arrested and was prepared to testify for the state in this case. Moreover, after the court listened to the petitioner on his \u201cdispute\u201d as to the facts, the court then asked him, \u201cIs there anything else you dispute about the facts?\u201d and the answer was, \u201cNo.\u201d Even if we assume that the petitioner was correct in the two instances of \u201cdispute\u201d to which he refers, the recitation of the facts by the prosecutor still provided a valid factual basis for the plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The petitioner\u2019s allusion to the trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201cgravamen\u201d as somehow misleading him lacks merit. Again, when this \u201cgravamen\u201d language is read in context, coming as it does after the prosecutor\u2019s long recitation of the proffered factual basis of the charge of murder, it is clear that the court is directing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>petitioner\u2019s attention to the most material<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> part of the charge so that the court can determine whether these facts were also in dispute. The use of the term \u201cgravamen\u201d cannot fairly be said to be misleading. It directed his attention to facts that directly implicated his intent. The petitioner\u2019s claim that \u201che was not informed that the court intended to draw an inference to cause death from that factual basis,\u201d including the \u201cgravamen,\u201d is advanced as going to the validity of his plea. That argument lacks merit. \u201cThe description of the charges need not come directly from the court so long as the record reveals that the defendant understood them. ... If, during the plea colloquy, the [state\u2019s] statement or the defendant\u2019s own version of the facts sets forth all elements and conduct of the offense, admission to that conduct sufficiently establishes the defendant\u2019s understanding of the charge.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Martinez, </em>69 F.3d 1215, 1220 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1115, 116 S. Ct. 1343, 134 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1996). Here, not only does the state\u2019s proffer satisfy this requirement, but it is buttressed by the petitioner\u2019s agreement with it, keeping in mind that his \u201cdispute\u201d with it was with two immaterial aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In addition, the petitioner claims that the \u201cdefect\u201d in his plea was not \u201covercome\u201d by the trial court\u2019s reading the murder statute. It is not required, however, that the trial court read the charging statute to the petitioner if there are other reasons to believe that the petitioner understands that statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wideman, </em>38 Conn. App. 581, 586, 663 A.2d 409, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 907, 665 A.2d 906 (1995). Moreover, the court did read the murder statute, which included the element of intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The court, after reading the statute and having before it the petitioner\u2019s admission to the strong factual basis for the crime charged, made the specific finding that the petitioner \u201chas admitted the factual basis, specifically the factual basis constituting the murder.\u201d The court knew also, after its inquiry, that the petitioner had had no drugs, alcohol or medicine that day, and that no notice of mental disease or defect had been filed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In canvassing the matter with the petitioner, the trial court must make sure that he had a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 244. We are aware that although a guilty plea is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal charge, it still is not truly voluntary unless the defendant can be said to possess an understanding of the law in relation to the facts. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 394 U.S. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The record here justifies the conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. On the guilty plea, the court had the authority to draw the inference of intent; it properly did so here. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[o]ne who uses a deadly weapon upon a vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act, and from such a circumstance a proper inference may be drawn in some cases that there was an intent to kill. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>174 Conn. 22, 26, 381 A.2d 539 (1977). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 680, 613 A.2d 788 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>233 Conn. 215, 225, 658 A.2d 571 (1995). This is one such instance, given, inter alia, the shooting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>three twelve gauge shotgun shells into the victim from a pistol-grip shotgun at close range by the petitioner, who had borrowed the shotgun, carried it concealed to the scene of the homicide, told the victim that he had five seconds and then racked the shotgun three separate times, killing the victim. We conclude that the habeas court properly decided that the plea canvass was adequate and that the petitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We now take up the petitioner\u2019s claim that the habeas court acted improperly in rejecting his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in the underlying criminal proceeding. Included in this claim are the petitioner\u2019s arguments that the habeas court acted improperly in that it used a subjective standard to decide whether he had proven actual prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), and that the habeas court should have concluded that he had proven actual prejudice in that it was reasonably likely that there would have been a different outcome absent the ineffective assistance of counsel. He claims specifically that he proved actual prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the facts and to understand the law not only prior to entry of his guilty plea but also at the time of entry of his guilty plea. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cWhether the representation a defendant received at trial was constitutionally inadequate is a mixed question of law and fact. ... As such, that question requires plenary review by this court unfettered by the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>55 Conn. App. 426, 435-36, 739 A.2d 701, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 904, 743 A.2d 614 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Initially, we recognize that \u201c[a] criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 686. . . . Pretrial negotiations implicating the decision of whether to plead guilty is a critical stage . . . and plea bargaining is an integral component of the criminal justice system . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 153, 662 A.2d 718 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">For a criminal defendant to prevail on a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must establish both (1) deficient performance and (2) actual prejudice. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 132, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991). Thus, he must establish not only that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, but that as a result thereof he suffered actual prejudice, namely, \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 694. In this context, a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d does not require the petitioner to show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.\u201d Id., 693. \u201cRather, it merely requires the petitioner to establish \u2018a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 Id., 694.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 445-46, 610 A.2d 598 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\u201cIn <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>[474 U.S. 52, 57-58, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985)], the court determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the same two-part standard applies to claims arising from the plea negotiation process and that the same justifications for imposing the prejudice requirement in <em>Strickland </em>were relevant in the context of guilty pleas. Although the first half of the <em>Strickland </em>test remains the same for determining ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea negotiation stage, the court modified the prejudice standard. As in <em>Strickland, </em>the prejudice standard for plea negotiations is intended to determine whether, but for counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient performance, the outcome of the plea process would have been different. The court went on to require that in order to satisfy the prejudice requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Id., 59.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 156. The <em>Hill </em>court, in discussing the \u201cprejudice\u201d inquiry in guilty plea cases, indicated that the assessment of whether an \u201cineffective\u201d counsel may have \u201cdeprived\u201d a petitioner \u201cwill depend in large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>supra, 59. It went on to state that \u201c[a]s we explained in <em>Strickland, . . </em>. these predictions of the outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made objectively, without regard for the \u2018idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.\u2019 \u201d Id., 59-60.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The petitioner, while agreeing that the habeas court quoted correctly in its decision \u201cthe objective standard [for prejudice] set out in <em>Strickland, Hill </em>and <em>Copas,\u201d </em>argues that when the court ruled on prejudice, it did so solely by reference to its own confidence in the outcome, refusing to predict by reference to a jury. He claims that by allegedly doing so, the habeas court was substituting its own reaction to the evidence for that of the hypothetical jury, \u201cthus erroneously applying a subjective measure of the evidence on the question of prejudice.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">\u201cWe . . . examine the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision to understand better the basis of its decision and to determine the reasoning used by it in reaching its conclusion.\u201d <em>Barra </em>v. <em>Ridgefield Card &amp; Gift Gallery, Ltd., </em>194 Conn. 400, 404, 480 A.2d 552 (1984). The petitioner states that the habeas court acted improperly when it stated, \u201c[i]t is not the court\u2019s function to speculate whether the proffer, at trial, of the evidence adduced at the habeas trial might have affected the factual decision makers, but rather, whether there is a sufficient probability of a different outcome so as to undermine the court\u2019s confidence in the judgment of guilt.\u201d Any fair discussion of this contention must be put in context by considering the sentence that precedes the challenged sentence as well as the sentences that follow it. The preceding sentence states: \u201cWhile habeas counsel has diligently presented evidence to suggest areas of reasonable doubt, including forensic evidence concerning the victim\u2019s gunshot wounds, opinion evidence regarding the trajectory and distance from which the mortal shots were fired, inconsistent statements from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>witnesses, and information concerning the victim\u2019s propensity for violence, the court is unpersuaded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the cumulative effect of this evidence would have resulted in a different verdict, had the petitioner chosen to go to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The sentences following the challenged sentence state: \u201cGiven the operative physical facts of this shooting, combined with the availability of witness testimony consistent with the state\u2019s theory of the case, the court is unpersuaded that there is a reasonable probability that a trial would have resulted in a more beneficial outcome to the petitioner. Counsel\u2019s failures do not undermine the court\u2019s confidence in the court\u2019s judgment of guilt.\u201d It is apparent from a reading of the challenged sentence in context that the habeas court, having earlier laid out the controlling law, did not apply a subjective standard as claimed, but rather applied the operable legal standard. Even in the challenge, the court correctly speaks of the requirement of the existence of a probability of a different outcome so as to undermine the court\u2019s confidence in the judgment of guilt. That, the habeas court stated, is its function. The preceding sentence states that the court is \u201cunpersuaded\u201d of a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d of a \u201cdifferent verdict\u201d had the petitioner chosen to go to trial, again invoking applicable legal principles. The sentence following the challenged sentence states again that it is \u201cunpersuaded\u201d that there is \u201ca reasonable probability that a trial would have resulted in a more beneficial outcome to the petitioner,\u201d again applying correctly the relevant law. Finally, the next sentence concludes that the failures of counsel at the entering of the guilty plea \u201cdo not undermine the court\u2019s confidence in the court\u2019s judgment of guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The petitioner, in his \u201csubjective standard\u201d claim, suggests that the habeas court ran afoul of the <em>Hill </em>and <em>Strickland </em>courts that the \u201cpredictions\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>prejudice aspect should be made objectively without regard for the \u201c \u2018idiosyncracies of the particular decisionmaker.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill </em>v. Lockhart, supra, 474 U.S. 59-60; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 695. The contention lacks merit. The petitioner has not proven any \u201cidiosyncracy\u201d as that term appears to be perceived by the <em>Hill </em>and <em>Strickland </em>courts. We conclude that the habeas court applied properly the objective standard to decide whether the petitioner had proved prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Next, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly found that he had not proven actual prejudice after it found that counsel\u2019s representation was inadequate. To obtain relief under the <em>Strickland </em>test on a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must meet both \u201cdeficient performance\u201d and \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>52 Conn. App. 385, 393, 726 A.2d 657, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 233 (1999); see <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 445. Here, the habeas court<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> found that his counsel\u2019s representation was inadequate, finding specifically that counsel had essentially conducted no investigation, spoke to no witnesses, did not speak with the medical examiner or with any forensic expert relating to the gunshot wounds or other physical aspects of the shooting, and did not pursue the question of whether the petitioner was drug-dependent at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>offense. In finding that counsel\u2019s performance was inadequate, the habeas court referred to it as \u201csuperficial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The matter, however, does not end there because, according to the aforementioned <em>Strickland </em>test, the petitioner now must prove actual prejudice. To this end, the petitioner argues that counsel failed to investigate the facts adequately and to advance valid defenses. We will examine these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">An examination of the transcript of the proceedings in the habeas court discloses that petitioner\u2019s counsel,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in that court, presented testimony from the petitioner\u2019s counsel in the underlying criminal proceedings, the petitioner\u2019s mother, certain Hartford police officers, forensic experts, an attorney expert, the prosecutor who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>present at the time of plea and sentencing, the physician who performed the autopsy on the victim, and a psychiatrist and certain lay testimony. A large number of exhibits were also admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Reference to proceedings in the habeas court and evidence presented there is helpful on this branch of the case. The statements of Osborne and Gordon, consistent with the state\u2019s case, disclose the following.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At 5:45 p.m. on March 19, 1988, the petitioner called Osborne and asked to borrow Osborne\u2019s shotgun. At first Osborne refused. About one-half hour later, the petitioner called again and repeated his request. When asked why he wanted to do so, the petitioner said that he and \u201cRobert\u201d wanted to use it to scare someone and would not shoot it. He also told Osborne that he was tired of owing money to this person, was not going to pay him anymore and was going to stab him. Thereafter, he went to Osborne\u2019s home where Osborne handed the shotgun together with three rounds of shells to the petitioner who, thereupon, stuffed the shotgun down his pant leg and put the shells in his pocket. Osborne and the petitioner then started walking to Lyme Street where the petitioner had told Osborne that he was to meet the person in question. On the way there, a Mazda, operated by Grant, drove up. The petitioner signaled the Mazda, it stopped, and the petitioner and Osborne got in. The petitioner told the driver, \u201cRob, we have to hurry up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Gordon knew that the petitioner used and sold cocaine supplied by the victim. Earlier on the night of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>March 18, the petitioner had called Gordon telling him that the victim would pick up Gordon at his house and that Gordon was to tell the victim how to get to Lyme Street. The victim arrived at Gordon\u2019s house in a white Nissan. When Gordon and the victim got to Lyme Street, Gordon got out of the Nissan on the passenger side. The petitioner, who was already standing on Lyme Street with Osborne, walked around the Nissan and approached the driver\u2019s door. While Osborne and Gordon remained by the passenger\u2019s door, Osborne heard the petitioner tell the driver in a loud voice, \u201cI\u2019m not giving you any more money; I\u2019m tired of giving you money.\u201d Then both Osborne and Gordon saw the petitioner pull the shotgun out of his pants. He then told the victim, \u201cyou have five seconds, don\u2019t move.\u201d After counting down, \u201cfive, four, three, two, one\u201d the petitioner fired the shotgun into the car. He racked the shotgun and fired a second round, then racking it again, he fired a third round. In all, the petitioner fired three shots into the Nissan.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Immediately after the shooting, the Mazda, operated by Grant, reappeared at the scene. The petitioner got in the passenger side of the Mazda, having thrown the gun into the car. Grant told the petitioner to check the victim\u2019s body for drugs and cash. After the petitioner did this, Grant drove the petitioner and Osborne away from the scene and dropped them off separately a few blocks from the scene. Later, the petitioner called Osborne and told him to wipe the fingerprints off the shotgun, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The petitioner argues that this version of the shooting offered by statements of Osborne and Gordon is not reliable. Moreover, he appeal\u2019s to claim that the following statements by Cornell Wright<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Bernard Hamp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ton are more probative, and that had counsel presented their testimony, the outcome of the plea process would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Wright, who resided in the Lyme Street neighborhood, said that he was looking out his living room window before the shooting when he saw a white Nissan occupied by two males pull up and park. He then saw a light blue hatchback arrive and the driver and a passenger get out. They approached the Nissan and \u201cappeared to argue with the driver.\u201d In the meantime, the passenger in the white car had gotten out and had gone to the comer of Harold and Lyme Streets, which was nearby. Then Wright said that he looked away from the scene to look at his television. The next thing he heard was the male on the corner yell, \u201cNo,\u201d and Wright looked out and saw one of the males by the Nissan reach inside his jacket and pull out something. Wright then heard one shot and the male on the comer yelled, \u201cNo, no.\u201d Two more shots followed. The two males in the street jumped into the blue car, as did the male on the comer, and the blue car fled the scene. These three men were all black males and all wearing stonewashed jackets, jeans and sneakers. A second incident report compiled by Detective Nicholas Russo indicates that Wright said that he could not see which of the males was the shooter<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because his view was blocked. In this report, Russo made the observation that Wright had been drinking although he was not intoxicated. At the trial, the petitioner argued that a supplemental report filed by Detective Madison Bolden of the Hartford police department<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of his interview of Hampton sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>ports his claims. According to Hampton, at about 7:45 p.m. on the night of the shooting, Hampton was visiting friends who lived on Lyme Street. He saw a small white car parked on that street. Three black males were leaning against the car with their backs to the driver\u2019s side. To him, these men \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to be arguing. They were just talking like old friends.\u201d He visited his friends for only a few minutes and the three men were still standing by the white car. Hampton could not see if anyone was seated in the white car. Hampton drove home, picked up something and returned to his friends\u2019 house on Lyme Street. When he returned, however, the police had the area marked off as a crime scene. Hampton\u2019s general description of the three men and their clothing were offered as similar to that given by Wright. Hampton, however, did not witness the shooting or what happened immediately thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Edward McDonough, the deputy chief medical examiner, performed the autopsy on the victim. He testified that the victim was shot three times\u2014in the face, neck and left shoulder. It was his opinion that the shots were fired from about three to four feet from the victim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It appears that the petitioner seems to argue that, given his alleged mental state of fear and pressure, as well as being \u201cintoxicated on cocaine,\u201d the alleged reputation of the victim of often carrying a gun and the victim\u2019s alleged movement in his car as if reaching for a weapon, all these circumstances contributed to his firing the three shots at the victim. The petitioner sought through McDonough to demonstrate that the evidence of the movements of the victim, as those appeared to the petitioner under the circumstances, were such as to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Mm to protect himself. Despite the petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary, however, we determine, on the basis of the foregoing evidence, specifically, the witness\u2019 testimony that was consistent with the state\u2019s theory of the case, as well as the physical facts of the shooting as set forth by the deputy chief medical examiner\u2019s testimony, that the habeas court correctly found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, there would have been a more beneficial result for the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">We turn now to the petitioner\u2019s claim that a different and better outcome would have come about if Ms counsel had investigated and advanced the defense of justification (self-defense), wMch was a valid defense. TMs different outcome, he suggests, could be an acquittal by a jury, a conviction on a lesser included offense, a less severe sentence or an agreement by the prosecutor to reduce the nature of the crime charged down from murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">\u201cTo evaluate such a claim properly, it is customary for the reviewing court to decide whether the affirmative defense at issue would have succeeded at trial. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>supra, 474 U.S. 59; <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>[supra, 234 Conn. 162-63]. If it is likely that the affirmative [defense] of self-defense . . . would have succeeded at trial, then the petitioner has demonstrated the required prejudice to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">\u201cWhen reviewing this claim, we must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under these circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. . . . <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Man</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>son, 195 Conn. 636, 640, 490 A.2d 82 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Constantopoulos </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 47 Conn. App. 828, 836, 708 A.2d 588, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 927, 711 A.2d 726 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">It is our law that under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201ca person may justifiably use <em>deadly </em>physical force in self-defense only if he <em>reasonably </em>believes <em>both </em>that (1) his attacker is using or is about to use deadly physical force against him, or is inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm, <em>and </em>(2) that deadly physical force is necessary to repel such attack.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 285-86, 664 A.2d 743 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>(1995). Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe test [a trier of fact] must apply in analyzing the second requirement, i.e., that the defendant reasonably believed that deadly force, as opposed to some lesser degree of force, was necessary to repel the victim\u2019s alleged attack, is a \u2018subjective-objective\u2019 one.\u201d Id., 286. This subjective-objective inquiry \u201crequires that the [trier of fact] make two separate affirmative determinations in order for the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense to succeed. First, the [trier of fact] must determine whether, on the basis of all the evidence presented, the defendant in fact had [subjectively] believed that he had needed to use deadly physical force, as opposed to some lesser degree of force, in order to repel the victim\u2019s alleged attack. . . . [Second] if . . . the [trier of fact] determines that the defendant in fact had believed that the use of deadly force was necessary, the [trier of fact] must make a further determination [objectively] as to whether <em>that belief was </em>reasonable, from the perspective of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 286-87. The trier of fact must resolve <em>both </em>of these questions in favor of a defendant to entitle him to the protection of \u00a7 53a-19. Of course, a defendant who acts as an initial aggressor<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or as a person who responds with excessive force is not entitled to the protection of the defense of justification. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a) and (c). \u201cThe defense of self-defense does not encompass apreemptive strike.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 620, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Here, the accounts of the shooting given to the police by Osborne and Gordon show that the petitioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>not only the initial aggressor but also the one who arranged circumstances of the shooting in advance. As the respondent, the commissioner of correction, argues, the petitioner told Osborne of his dislike for the victim and that he wanted to borrow Osborne\u2019s shotgun just to scare the victim and that he would not shoot it. Yet, in the petitioner\u2019s proffered \u201cscare\u201d scenario he not only obtained Osborne\u2019s shotgun but also three twelve gauge shotgun shells for it from Osborne. He had set up the meeting with the victim, and, using the ruse of an alleged repayment of his debt, engaged Gordon to guide the victim to the scene. He also told Osborne that he would present him to the victim as a potential drug buyer. In addition, the petitioner had loaded the shotgun before the victim arrived. This planning by the petitioner adduces a mentally culpable intent toward the victim\u2019s safety in preparing for a potentially legal confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Neither Osborne nor Gordon indicated that the victim said or did anything of an aggressive nature, although the victim did demand that the petitioner pay him the debt he was owed. The petitioner displayed the shotgun, issued his grim \u201cfive seconds\u201d statement and shot the victim three times, having to rack the shotgun three times to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The petitioner\u2019s evidence does not really address the initial aggressor issue. It endeavors to denigrate the statements of Osborne and Gordon, suggesting that their own circumstances, including their immunity status, contribute to compromising their credibility.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> He does, however, point to the statement of Wright, arguing that it, supported by that of Hampton, does not support his conviction as the actual shooter but is \u201cconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>with Osborne, Grant and Gordon participating.\u201d This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Wright was in his living room at his home at about 7:30 p.m. on March 18, 1988, watching his television.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Glancing out his window, he saw the victim\u2019s white car arrive and also \u201ca light blue hatchback,\u201d which was apparently the Mazda operated by Grant. He said that the passenger in the light blue hatchback \u201cgot out\u201d and \u201cappeared to argue with the driver\u201d of the white car. Wright then looked away. He heard a male on the comer yell, \u201cNo,\u201d and he again looked out. Wright then saw one of the males by the white car reach inside his jacket and pull out something. He heard two more shots and he saw the blue car flee the scene with three males who were at the scene. Wright told the police that he did not see which man shot a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Likewise, Hampton\u2019s statement does not avail the petitioner. When Hampton came to visit his friends on Lyme Street, he saw three males leaning against the driver\u2019s side of a \u201csmall white vehicle\u201d parked on Lyme Street. He said that \u201cthey did not appear to be arguing\u201d and that they all seemed to know each other and \u201cwere just talking like old friends.\u201d He left Lyme Street before any shooting started, and, when he returned to his friends\u2019 house there, the police had already marked off the area as a crime scene. It seems clear that Wright\u2019s statement would be of dubious value and that of Hampton of marginal utility, if any, in supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim that both would have supported his claim that he was not the shooter, but rather that both Wright\u2019s and Hampton\u2019s statements are consistent with Osborne, Grant and Gordon participating.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>In advancing his self-defense argument, the petitioner claims that he feared that the victim was reaching for a gun and that he felt that he was in danger of the victim imminently using physical force upon him. Here, he invoked not only his fear of the use of imminent physical force, but also that he was nervous and under stress at the time of this confrontation because of the victim\u2019s propensity to violence. The evidence demonstrates, however, that the petitioner was hardly too nervous or stressed not to have carefully planned and staged this incident. The fact is that no weapon was found in the victim\u2019s car or on his person. The petitioner\u2019s theory that he fired in self-defense reasonably believing that the victim was reaching for a weapon is questionable, keeping in mind that he was armed with a twelve gauge shotgun pointed at the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">This theory is also questionable, even when one considers the petitioner\u2019s claim that the victim had a propensity for violence. The victim\u2019s girlfriend, Sabrina Reynolds, did tell a detective that the victim \u201cused to carry a gun often or have it in the trunk of his vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s sister, Sophie Taylor, however, told the same detective that the victim \u201cnever carried or owned a firearm as far as she knew.\u201d On the basis of the foregoing, we determine that the petitioner could not have successfully claimed that he was not the initial aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The petitioner\u2019s self-defense claim would also fail because the facts clearly demonstrated that he had used excessive force. His evidence on this issue is seriously wanting. He argues that \u201cthe physical evidence was inconsistent with the claim that the shotgun had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>fired at point blank range.\u201d He claims also that had his counsel inquired of the medical examiner how far from the victim the muzzle of the shotgun was when fired that the medical examiner would have testified that it was fired between three and four feet from the victim. In fact, the medical examiner so testified. The term \u201cpoint blank\u201d was not defined during the proceeding. Webster\u2019s, however, defines the adjective \u201cpoint blank\u201d to mean \u201cfired straight at a target without having to allow for appreciable drop in the fine of flight of the missile shot . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Here, each shot hit the target, the victim, in the face, neck and shoulder, and photographs show the blood and brain tissue of the victim on the windshield of the victim\u2019s Nissan. The petitioner\u2019s counsel would have also learned from the medical examiner and his autopsy report that there was \u201cextensive\u201d damage to the victim\u2019s facial structures and fractures of the frontal portion of the skull as well. Common sense cannot refute that the victim was shot at point blank range, not to mention by a twelve gauge shotgun. Even if we assume that the petitioner genuinely feared for his life, that still is not sufficient to validate his self-defense claim. That is because that \u201cwould not, however, have allowed [the jury] to find that <em>at the time he killed the victim, </em>it was reasonable for him to believe that the victim was about to use deadly physical force or inflict great bodily harm, and that it was necessary to kill the victim to prevent such conduct.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 620. This is so viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We conclude, on the basis of the foregoing, that a reasonable investigation by the petitioner\u2019s counsel would have disclosed that on the evidence, the state reasonably could have defeated a claim of self-defense by demonstrating that the degree of force used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>petitioner was excessive. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullard, </em>5 Conn. App. 338, 342-43, 497 A.2d 1041 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Next, the petitioner claims that he has proven that, but for his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, there was a reasonable probability of a better outcome based on the theory that he acted without the intent to kill. We do not agree. In making this claim, he refers to the influence upon him of drugs, his fear of the victim, his interest at most to injure, rather than kill the victim, all of which point to a lesser included offense of murder, an acquittal or a more favorable recommendation by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">As to his mental state, the petitioner claims that \u201cinvestigation of school records or even family history would have disclosed a substance abuse history.\u201d There was expert testimony that he was drug and alcohol dependent at the time of the shooting. There is, however, no evidence<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the shooting. Neither Gordon nor Osborne, who both knew the petitioner for a number of years prior to the shooting mentioned in their statements that he was under the influence of either drugs or alcohol. We do not agree with the petitioner\u2019s claim that Gordon\u2019s statement to the police corroborated<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cthat the petitioner was under the influence at [the] time of the shooting.\u201d In any event, the state of being intoxicated does not, without more, establish the lack of intent to cause death. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>45 Conn. App. 148, 156-57, 694 A.2d 1367, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 909, 697 A.2d 367 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>44 Conn. App. 818, 821-22, 692 A.2d 846, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 902, 697 A.2d 363 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Touching upon his mental state, the petitioner\u2019s brief notes that the evidence a reasonable investigation would have disclosed included \u201cevidence that the victim survived for some period of time in the hospital [and that that] could be construed by a jury to support an inference that injury, not death, was intended.\u201d That this would contribute to a better outcome is a genuinely unusual claim. We do note, however, that the victim was pronounced dead within one hour after his hospital admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">It is not all clear what a reasonable investigation would have unearthed to contribute to a reasonable probability on his intent claim given the petitioner\u2019s declared animosity toward the victim, his borrowing of the shotgun, his loading of that shotgun and the other aspects of his planning on the evening of the shooting. The evidence on intent that a reasonable investigation should have uncovered could have included the petitioner\u2019s checking the victim\u2019s body at the scene for money or drugs, his fleeing the scene, his instructing Osborne to wipe the fingerprints off the shotgun and his telling Gordon that the other three would be against whoever reported the homicide. Such conduct mitigates strongly against the reasonable probability of a better outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\u201cIn a criminal trial, it is relevant to show the conduct of an accused, as well as any statement made by him subsequent to the alleged criminal act, which may fairly be inferred to have been influenced by the criminal act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 655, 480 A.2d 463 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joly, </em>219 Conn. 234, 250, 593 A.2d 96 (1991). In <em>Joly, </em>our Supreme Court, quoting Wigmore, stated: \u201cNo one doubts that the state of mind which we call guilty consciousness is perhaps the strongest evidence . . . that the person is indeed the guilty doer . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 250-51, quoting 3A J. Wigmore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Evidence (Chadboume Rev. 1979) \u00a7 273 (1). Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s planning of the shooting and its execution must be factored into a consideration of the reasonable probability of a better outcome. Even had counsel more fully developed the matter of intent to kill, the evidence referred to would not demonstrate a reasonable probability of a better outcome either by way of an acquittal, being found guilty of a lesser included offense or a lesser sentence by negotiation with the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The petitioner claims also that the doctrine of \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d raises a reasonable probability that, but for the ineffectiveness of his counsel, he would have achieved a better outcome. We do not agree. Contrary to his claim in this court, that doctrine is not a viable defense in this jurisdiction. In <em>State </em>v. Abdalaziz, 248 Conn. 430, 434, 729 A.2d 725 (1999), our Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe conclude that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense is not recognized in Connecticut, and, therefore, was not available to the defendant.\u201d It goes without saying, therefore, that doctrine was not a defense that the petitioner could properly advance at the relevant times in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">5</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The petitioner also argues that he has demonstrated that there was a reasonable probability that he would have achieved a better outcome based on the theory of third party culpability. In making this claim, the petitioner maintains that the essentials of the state\u2019s claim, except the identity of the shooter, was answered by the physical evidence<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and the statement of uninvolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>witnesses.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He appears to contend that \u201cadditional strength\u201d to all his defenses is given by the unnamed \u201ctwo bystander witnesses\u201d in their impeachment of the state\u2019s witnesses Osborne and Gordon. These \u201cbystanders,\u201d he argues \u201cdescribed the events and identified the shooter <em>completely </em>differently\u201d from the way Gordon and Osborne described him. (Emphasis added.) We agree with the petitioner that his \u201cbystanders\u201d evidence was \u201ccompletely different\u201d from that of Osborne and Gordon. Nevertheless, as noted, we determine that the evidence of Osborne and Gordon was much more reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Because of the nature of his briefing of this claim, we assume that the \u201ctwo bystander witnesses\u201d were Wright and Hampton, both of whose statements we have discussed earlier. That discussion need not be repeated, although we incorporate it here. We also note, however, certain aspects. Hampton, of course, never actually witnessed the shooting, nor did he even know who the males were that he observed leaning against the white car. Wright testified inconsistently at the probable cause hearing on material matters, whereas Osborne and Gordon, who also testified at that hearing, did so substantially in accord with their police statements, which in turn were consistent with each other on material matters. Wright\u2019s statement to the police itself was inconsistent as to the identity of the shooter. This \u201cbystander\u201d evidence was at best, of minimal quality, even in combination with the \u201cphysical evidence.\u201d The evidence of alleged third party culpability was not such as to raise a reasonable probability of a better outcome as the petitioner claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>6</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We now turn to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he did prove that, but for his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, he demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have pleaded not guilty and gone to trial and achieved a better outcome. We do not agree that he would have gone to trial had he had the benefit of the credible evidence adduced in the habeas court. The habeas court found specifically that \u201cthe petitioner adduced <em>no </em>credible evidence [in the habeas court] that he would have elected to go to trial, even if fully informed, and risk incarceration for sixty years.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have been given no real reason to set aside this finding. We concur with the habeas court\u2019s citation to <em>Copas, </em>a murder case, where the court, in accepting that petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, \u201cgave the petitioner no assurance or indication of what it would do at sentencing.\u201d <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 144.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In that case, the court, in awarding habeas relief, felt it was likely that the petitioner, but for the ineffectiveness of his counsel, would have elected a trial as, given the circumstances, he had no incentive to plead guilty. See id., 166. We believe that the present case presents a dissimilar scenario. First, from all the evidence adduced in the habeas court, the petitioner has not demonstrated the reasonable probability of a different outcome. Second, we agree with the court that the petitioner has \u201cbenefited substantially\u201d from the plea bargain of an agreed recommendation of a forty year sentence, which is effectively twenty years less than the maximum in a strong case for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Finally, the petitioner claims that the habeas court acted improperly and denied him his due process rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>in holding that he did not have a right to appeal. Specifically, he alleges that neither the trial court nor the trial court clerk informed him of the right to appeal from his plea-based conviction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Moreover, he also alleges that he \u201cwas not aware\u201d of the right to appeal within the time to appeal.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Initially, we note that in the fourth count, paragraph eighteen alleges that \u201c[t]he trial court did not inform the petitioner of his right to appeal the judgment in [the underlying criminal case],\u201d and that paragraph nineteen of that count alleges that \u201c[t]he court clerk did not inform the petitioner of his right to appeal the judgment in [the underlying criminal case].\u201d The respondent filed identical responses to these two paragraphs of the petition, which were, \u201crespondent denies the allegations in paragraph 18 [and paragraph 19] <em>and also denies that there is any such right to appeal on the facts of this case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cIn recent years the application [for a writ of habeas corpus] has come to be regarded as a pleading in the nature of a complaint . . . and the return in the nature of an answer. The pleadings in this case are so framed. Once the issues have been joined the evidence proffered must be relevant to these issues.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>187 Conn. 324, 332, 445 A.2d 916 (1982); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>6 Conn.

In doing so, the habeas court stated that the petitioner\u2019s plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily despite the petitioner\u2019s claim, as the habeas court stated it, \u201cthat [the petitioner] was wrongfully denied the right to appeal his conviction because he was not informed by the court or clerk of his right to appeal . . . .\u201d That claim, the habeas court stated, was \u201cunavailing.\u201d It pointed out that the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea \u201cwas unconditionally made without any references to reservations of any issues\u201d and then noted relevant Supreme Court decisions.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> That \u201cunconditional\u201d plea, the habeas court stated, \u201cconstituted a waiver of any nonsubject matter jurisdictional defects in the pretrial proceedings.\u201d The habeas court then concluded that \u201c[t]he petitioner had no right to appeal from the court\u2019s finding of guilt and its subsequent judgment.\u201d We agree with that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Neither <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 97-97, 503 A.2d 136 (1985), nor <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 327, 537 A.2d 483 (1988), to which the habeas court referred involves the scenario of a guilty plea before trial where the trial court had found the guilty plea to be knowing and voluntary. Both <em>Madera </em>and <em>Kelley, </em>however, remain viable law in this jurisdiction. It is apparent that the habeas court, having concluded that the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>he had no right to appeal under the circumstances of this case. Nor has the petitioner shown that he has this right. On this issue, we point out that the issue is framed by the petitioner\u2019s pleading in paragraphs eighteen and nineteen of the fourth count by the petitioner\u2019s own allegations of the duty of the trial court and the trial court clerk to inform him of the right to appeal, which was denied.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Even if the habeas court\u2019s method of reaching its ultimate decision on this issue might be said to be \u201cfaulty\u201d or \u201cquestionable,\u201d it must stand as its judgment is responsive to the issues and is properly supported on other grounds. See <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Turlick, </em>164 Conn. 75, 86, 316 A.2d 759 (1972); <em>Baram </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>151 Conn. 315, 317, 197 A.2d 334 (1964); <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 718, 723, 89 A.2d 213 (1952). Such analysis falls fairly within the penumbra of such cases as <em>Johnny Cake, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>180 Conn. 296, 301, 429 A.2d 883 (1980); <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>174 Conn. 592, 597, 392 A.2d 468 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-12\"> The respondent, the commissioner of correction, claims that the petitioner\u2019s objection to the plea canvass was clearly defaulted because he did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court and did not challenge the adequacy on appeal. The petitioner disagrees, arguing that such a claim of default was never made by the respondent in the habeas court. The respondent does not claim that it was raised in the habeas court. Further, in deciding whether the respondent did actually raise such a claim in the habeas court we are also disadvantaged by the fact that the respondent did not file a posttrial brief with that court. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the respondent has shown that there is a procedural defect affecting our review of the trial court\u2019s canvass of the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, and we will review that canvass.</p>\n<p id=\"AFDv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The respondent apparently recognizes his problems in urging that we deny review on his foregoing procedural default claim because, in his brief, he argues \u2022\u2018alternatively\u2019' that the canvass was adequate and he briefs that claim at some length. In any event, we will review the adequacy of the canvass of the guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\"> In the habeas court, the petitioner claimed that he was denied a fair trial by the late disclosure of exculpatory evidence. That court rejected that, claim, stating that \u201cthe petitioner failed to establish his burden of proof that his decision to plead guilty resulted from the state\u2019s failure to provide timely disclosure of exculpatory information.\u201d The petitioner does not press this claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> We note that the second count of the amended petition goes to the petitioner\u2019s claim that the habeas court acted improperly in holding that the record established a knowing, intelligent and voluntary guilty plea.

The application for a writ of habeas corpus is regarded as a pleading in the nature of a complaint; <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>187 Conn. 324, 332, 445 A.2d 916 (1982); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>6 Conn.

The pleadings in this case are so framed and when issue is joined the evidence must be relevant to those issues. <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 332. When our rules speak of the \u201clegal grounds\u201d upon which the petition is based, \u201cground must mean a sufficient legal basis for granting the relief sought.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Negron v.

That is the manner in which the habeas court construed the second count in deciding the ground of an improper canvass. The respondent is correct when he states that the petitioner has neither alleged nor briefed this claim \u201cunder the rubric of ineffectiveness of counsel.\u201d The allegations set the parameters for the evidence that may be adduced to obtain the relief justified thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The fact that one paragraph of the second count alleges that \u201cdefense counsel did not inform the petitioner of his right to appeal the validity of his guilty plea\u201d does not change our view. This paragraph is incorporated, word for word, from the first count, which alleges in fifty-two paragraphs the ineffectiveness of counsel. Fairness, in reviewing the habeas court\u2019s action on the second count, leads us to treat it for what it is: a challenge to the trial court\u2019s canvass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"><em> </em>The taking of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea by the trial court covers sixteen pages of transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b680-16\"> Grant was found guilty after a jury trial of the crime of accessory to murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-8 and was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison.

If anything, it eliminates Grant as the actual shooter. Moreover, on the evidence adduced in the habeas court, it is sheer speculation for the petitioner to suggest, without appropriate evidentiary basis, that either Osborne or Gordon was the actual shooter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> Reynolds also told the detective that one or two weeks earlier the victim had discharged a gun at a funeral in accordance with a Jamaican tradition. The victim was Jamaican.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> The petitioner\u2019s presentence investigation report did make a statement suggesting an impairment at the time of the shooting; however, this self-serving statement was uncorroborated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> In making this claim, the petitioner does not explain what evidence in Gordon\u2019s statement was \u201ccorroborated\u201d in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b705-10\"> We have already considered the matter of the physical evidence claim earlier and will not discuss it again. In any event, in advancing that argument, the petitioner\u2019s briefing does not refer to what physical evidence he means here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\"> In speaking of \u201cuninvolved \u25a0witnesses\u201d here, the petitioner does not identify these \u201cuninvolved witnesses.\u201d This constitutes inadequate briefing. We will, however, assume that he means to refer to Wright and Hampton as we have earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> In <em>Copas, </em>the petitioner pleaded guilty, although the state had said that it intended to recommend the maximum sentence even if the petitioner were to plead guilty. <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> We note that the petitioner incorporates by reference into the fourth count, which concerns the right to appeal, seventeen paragraphs from the first count (alleging ineffectiveness) one of which alleges that \u201c[d]efense counsel did not inform the petitioner of his right to appeal the validity of his guilty plea.\u201d The habeas court made no specific finding on this allegation. In any event, there is neither evidence to the effect that the petitioner became dissatisfied with the conviction on his guilty plea within the time limited for taking an appeal, which was communicated to his counsel, nor is there any evidence of his attorney speaking to him, after his guilty plea, within the time period limited for taking an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> There is no evidence as to whether he was \u201caware\u201d of the time limitation within which to take an appeal as he alleges because he did not testify in the habeas court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> At this point, the habeas court\u2019s decision noted: \u201cIt is well established that, an unconditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, intelligently and voluntarily made, operates as a waiver of all nonjurisdietional defects and bars the later assertion of constitutional challenges to pretrial proceedings. . . . Therefore, only those issues fully disclosed in the record which relate either to the exercise of jurisdiction by the court or to the voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea are ordinarily appealable. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 97-98, 503 A.2d 136 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>206 Conn. 323, 537 A.2d 483 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b710-11\"> We find it somewhat disingenuous for the petitioner to say as he does in his reply brief that \u201c[he] has never claimed that the trial court or clerk is obliged to advise a [petitioner] of the right to appeal from a guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
