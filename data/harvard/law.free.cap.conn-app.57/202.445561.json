On September 16,1996, the victim, Ralph Hickey, and several other persons were visiting Laura Blumberg and James Blumberg in Waterbury. At approximately 6:30 p.m. that evening, the defendant, who was known to the Blumbergs, knocked on the door of their apartment. The defendant, after being invited in by James Blumberg, walked straight over to the victim. After the defendant and the victim began arguing about an incident involving the defendant\u2019s dog, the defendant punched the victim in the face and a scuffle ensued. During the struggle, the defendant picked up a knife and stabbed the victim several times.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Shortly after the fight, the victim left with Laura Blumberg to go to Southbury. During the trip, the victim began to suffer the effects of the several stab wounds, and he decided to drive into the Southbury Food Center parking lot in Southbury. Police and medical personnel were called, and they transported the victim to St. Maiy\u2019s Hospital in Waterbury, where he died the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The jury found the defendant guilty of one count of manslaughter in the first degree and one count of assault in the first degree. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The defendant first claims that the prosecutor made numerous improper statements during closing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ment that were so egregious that they deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u201c \u2018[Our Supreme Court has] previously acknowledged that prosecutorial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 768-69, 670 A.2d 276 (1996).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 564, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998). \u201cSuch argument may be, \u2018in light of all of the facts and circumstances, so egregious that no curative instruction could reasonably be expected to remove [its] prejudicial impact.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 585, 484 A.2d 435 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 539, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">To review a claim of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, \u201cwe ask whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, [our Supreme Court] in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 540. With these factors as a guide, we now review whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct denied the defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The record in this case discloses a pattern of misconduct during closing argument that was in no way invited by the conduct or argument of the defense. The severity and frequency of the conduct is demonstrated by the fact that the prosecutor continued on his improper course after successful objections by defense counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state\u2019s case in support of the original murder and assault charges was relatively weak. The numerous requests for reinstruction show that the jury had difficulty reaching its decision. Although the defendant was convicted of two lesser offenses, this does not excuse the prosecutor\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s actions were so severe that he was admonished by the court outside the hearing of the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In his misguided zeal to convict the defendant, the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal opinions, appealed to the passions and emotions of the jurors, and injected extraneous matters into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Expression of Personal Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The prosecutor may not express his opinion, directly or indirectly as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 541. \u201cSuch expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony.\u201d Id. Furthermore, it is not the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s right or duty to stigmatize a defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 562, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In his closing and rebuttal arguments, the state\u2019s attorney improperly gave his personal opinion on numerous occasions. First, he expressed his opinion that society would be in trouble if the defendant were not found guilty of murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prosecutor also attempted to stigmatize the defendant by constantly referring to his acts as vicious or heinous, and by suggesting that the word \u201cback-stabber\u201d was coined because of people such as the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During his initial closing and again in his rebuttal, the prosecutor stated that justice would require a murder conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The prosecutor also emphatically gave his opinion that the police had done good work in getting their man.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u201cThese expressions of opinion are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the special position held by the prosecutor. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>[96 Conn. 160, 168-69, 113 A. 452 (1921)]. The jury is aware that he has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>[663 F.2d 1173, 1178-79 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 2269, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1284 (1982)]; which the jury may infer to have precipitated the personal opinions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 542-44. \u201cAs we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>[supra, 168-69,] \u2018[b]y reason of his office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 564-65. The prosecutor is held in high esteem by the jury because \u201c \u2018[h]e is not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>[supra, 168-69].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 537-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s repeated appeals to the jury that justice required a conviction coupled with the repeated vitriolic references to the defendant could reasonably have been a factor in the jury\u2019s decision to convict. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>opinion that society would be in trouble if the defendant were not convicted might also have played a part in the juiy\u2019s decision to convict because of a fear1 that the defendant might strike again if acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Appeals to Emotion</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u201cA prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . [S]uch appeals should be avoided because they have the effect of diverting the jury\u2019s attention from [its] duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 545. \u201cWhen the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal.\u201d Id., 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">In this case the prosecutor improperly appealed to the emotions and sympathies of the jury on several occasions. In one such appeal, he asked that the jury not victimize the victim again.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Later in his rebuttal argument, he appealed to the jurors to convict so that evil would not triumph by their inaction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By using such dramatic words, the prosecutor was attempting to color the jurors\u2019 minds with such emotion that they would consider it their duty to convict regardless of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>dence. On occasions throughout the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, he spoke the victim\u2019s name with such repetition and used such strong, inappropriate language that it could only be inferred that his intent was to appeal to the sympathies and emotions of the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Injection of Extraneous Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u201c[A] prosecutor should not inject extraneous issues into the case that divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence. ... It is improper for the prosecutor to encourage the jury to identify with the victim and to predict the effect of a not guilty verdict . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 547. Although in <em>Williams, </em>the victim was not killed, the rationale for precluding such an appeal to the jury is the same and should not be countenanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">In this case, the prosecutor consistently encouraged the jury to identify with the victim. He argued that \u201c[y]ou [the jury] wake up, you\u2019re in a cold sweat. What\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong? Had a nightmare? What was the nightmare? Being accosted by a knife-wielding assailant. There he is. That\u2019s the nightmare that Mr. Hickey, Ralph Hickey, lived. The only difference is, you wake up from your nightmares. Ralph Hickey isn\u2019t ever going to wake up from his, ever.\u201d In his continuing effort to persuade the jury to identify with the victim, the prosecutor argued that the jury should not victimize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>him twice, that the victim wants justice, that the victim is not a \u201cslab with a toe tag,\u201d that he could not come today to court and tell his story, and that \u201cjustice requires for Ralph Hickey a conviction for murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We have scrutinized the entire record of this case. There is no evidence suggesting that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was invited by the defense conduct or argument. The errors were severe and frequent, and bore directly on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The court did, however, give curative instructions directing the jury to disregard the improper argument.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>While we do recognize that \u201c[t]he jury, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, is presumed to have followed the instructions of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Washing</em>ton, 182 Conn. 419, 429, 438 A.2d 1144 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 155-57, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977)\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 497, 481 A.2d 741 (1984); because of the severity and frequency of the offensive misconduct, this is not a case where we can rely on that presumption. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 549. The strength of the court\u2019s curative instruction in this case could not overcome the prosecutor\u2019s assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In the court\u2019s curative instruction, it suggested that the prosecutor, in his exuberance, misspoke. To misspeak in the excitement of a closing argument is not an inexcusable or uncommon occurrence; however, our constitution does not permit a state\u2019s attorney to proffer a veritable plethora of offending remarks intended to incite an emotional response rather than rational reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The state argues that the facts of this case square with <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson-Bey, </em>21 Conn. App. 162, 171, 572 A.2d 372, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 806, 576 A.2d 537 (1990), where we noted that all but one of the prosecutor\u2019s objectionable arguments referred to a charge of which the defendant was acquitted and held that, therefore, the defendant had not been prejudiced by the offensive remarks. The state claims that all of the objectionable statements in this case were aimed at the counts of intentional murder and intentional assault. The state then claims under <em>Wilson-Bey </em>that because the defendant was acquitted of these charges, he was not aggrieved and cannot meet his burden of showing prejudice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The state\u2019s argument that all of the offensive remarks were aimed at the element of intent and did not affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the overall fairness of the trial misses the mark. First, in this case, we do not agree that all of the remarks can be attributed to the intent element of murder. We point especially to the prosecutor\u2019s appeals to the emotions of the jury. See footnotes 12-14. Furthermore, as stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 543-44, the prosecutor in a criminal trial commands great influence on the jury by reason of his office. It is his influence that can lead the jury to decide the case, not on the evidence presented at trial, but on the jury\u2019s reaction to the improper arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\"><em>In State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983), our Supreme Court exercised its supervisory authority to order a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct. The court\u2019s words are also apropos where the misconduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial: \u201cWe are mindful of the sage admonition that appellate rebuke without reversal ignores the reality of the adversary system of justice. The deprecatory words we use in our opinions . . . are purely ceremonial. Government counsel, employing such tactics, are the kind who, eager to win victories, will gladly pay the small price of a ritualistic verbal spanking. The practice [of verbal criticism without judicial action]\u2014recalling the bitter tear shed by the Walrus as he ate the oysters\u2014breeds a deplorably cynical attitude towards the judiciary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 571. We conclude that a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Although we will remand this case for a new trial, we will address the defendant\u2019s claim challenging the denial of his motion to suppress because that issue will undoubtedly arise in the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The defendant claims that it was improper for the court to deny his motion to suppress all evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>was acquired as a result of an allegedly unlawful, warrantless arrest.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that probable cause for his arrest existed; however, he claims the warrantless arrest inside a private residence and the evidence flowing therefrom constitute an unconstitutional seizure in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights. U.S. Const., amends. IV, XTV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> After examining the totality of the circumstances, the court found that there were exigent circumstances permitting the police to act as they did. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">After an evidentiary hearing, the court found the following facts. The Southbury police were summoned to assist the victim at the Southbury Food Center parking lot. The police arrived at approximately 7:45 p.m. and found the dying victim going into shock on the parking lot pavement. Before losing consciousness, the victim revealed that he had been stabbed in Waterbury on Angel Drive by a Jamaican male. Laura Blumberg, a witness to the altercation, was also present at the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The police responded to the scene of the crime and seized evidence. The victim was transported to the hospital and taken immediately to the operating room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Waterbmy police officers first arrived at the hospital at about 8:35 p.m. The officers realized that the victim\u2019s wounds were life threatening and subsequently spoke to two eyewitnesses to the stabbing. The two witnesses went immediately to the Waterbury police department, and both identified the defendant as the assailant from a photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">After the identification, four officers proceeded to a Waterbuiy address that the defendant had given when he was arrested earlier that year-. At approximately 9:30 p.m., the police arrived at the Dorchester Avenue apartment. Officer Lawrence Smith and Sergeant Steve Flaherty positioned themselves at the front entrance, and Officer Michael Gugliotti and Sergeant Richard Brown went to the back door. Brown peered through a rear window and recognized the defendant from a photograph that he had observed earlier. When Smith and Flaherty knocked on the front door, Brown observed the defendant run upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The defendant\u2019s sister, Lorna Mills, answered the door with a pit bull at her side, prompting the officers to draw their guns. The dog subsequently was restrained. The officers put their weapons back into their holsters and asked who had run upstairs. Mills responded by asking why the officers were there. Smith told her that Brown, who was at the back door, would explain if she let him in. She proceeded to the back door and let Brown into her home. After a short discussion, the officers determined that the defendant had gone upstairs. Mills allowed all the police officers to enter the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Smith and Gugliotti proceeded to the second floor of the apartment to look for the defendant. There they saw a fully clothed woman standing in a running shower. She asked them to leave, but at that time the officers obseived the defendant\u2019s leg sticking out at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>bottom of the shower. The defendant, wearing only his boxer shorts, was crouched on the floor of the shower enclosure. Jeans belonging to the defendant also were lying on the shower floor. The defendant was taken into custody, transported to Waterbury police headquarters and read his Miranda<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> rights. Later that evening, he gave a statement to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The fourth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d \u201cSince article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution is couched in the same language as the fourth amendment, it should be accorded the same interpretation. <em>Hing Wan Wong </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>160 Conn. 1, 6 [273 A.2d 709 (1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 938, 91 S.

Having recognized a number of practical problems with the <em>Dorman </em>factors, however, but without disapproving of their use, our Supreme Court has adopted the test for exigent circumstances enunciated by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in <em>State </em>v. <em>Canby, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>162 W.

This is an objective test; its preeminent criterion is what a <em>reasonable, </em>well-trained police officer would believe, not what the arresting officer actually did believe.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Canby, </em>[supra, 669].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Guertin, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The court, following <em>Guertin, </em>found that exigent circumstances did exist. The defendant was accused of committing an assault, a violent crime. The knife used in the stabbing had not been located. Thus, the defendant might still have been armed with it. On the basis of identifications of the defendant by two eyewitnesses, there was probable cause to arrest the defendant. An officer also observed through an open window that the defendant was present in the apartment and that it was likely that he might escape through the open attics of the building. Finally, a family member allowed the police to enter the premises peaceably. Giving particular consideration to the above factors, the court further stated, on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, that there was a real danger of flight. Furthermore, the court stated that because the stabbing could have left blood on the clothing and body of the perpetrator, the defendant, given enough time, would have been able to destroy evidence. Addressing the final <em>Guertin </em>factor regarding the fear that the defendant might endanger the safety or property of others, the court stated: \u201cNot knowing the other occupants of the apartment and knowing that there was probable cause for the arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>of an assault suspect in their midst, the police had the right, indeed, the duty to intervene. Had they not intervened and had an innocent tenant become harmed by the defendant, the police might even have been civilly liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The totality of the circumstances, including evidence that satisfies the <em>Dorman </em>factors, would have led a reasonable police officer to reasonably believe that if an immediate arrest of the defendant were not made, he might escape capture, destroy evidence or harm others or their property. We conclude that the court properly found that the evidence satisfied the test adopted in <em>Guertin. </em>Because the entry was proper, based on exigency, the trial court properly refused to suppress the evidence that was seized as a result of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The judgment is reversed, except as to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">In this opinion VERTEFEUILLE, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part,: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when . . .

Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980); see Practice Book \u00a7 [42-43]. When a mistrial is sought on the ground that a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law the same standard applies. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>[supra, 488-89]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>176 Conn. 367, 372, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978). The burden on the defendant is to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial in light of the entire proceeding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>supra, 488-89; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>supra, 372; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 348-49, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977). The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>supra, 488-89, citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>[supra, 219].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The following additional procedural facts are necessary to put this case in proper context. The defendant was charged, by way of a long form, substitute information, with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>59 (a) (1) and (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel argued to the jury that it could not find the defendant guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury acquitted the defendant of murder, manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). The jury found the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The majority relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 529 A.2d 653 (1987), for the law concerning prosecutorial misconduct. <em>Williams </em>is a case in which our Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the trial court due to a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct. The facts of <em>Williams </em>are substantially different from the facts of this case. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant was charged with assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. Id., 524. All of the evidence was circumstantial, and the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses was greatly in dispute; one of them was a child. Id., 550. Defense counsel did not preserve the error, and our Supreme Court heard the case pursuant to the second exceptional circumstance of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The <em>Williams </em>court stated: \u201cThe record in this case discloses a pattern of misconduct, repeated and strident, by the assistant state\u2019s attorney during both the cross-examination of the defendant and of his key defense witness, and during closing argument. This misconduct falls within at least four categories of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>scribed behavior: (1) expressions of opinion by the prosecutor as to witness credibility and the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt; (2) suggestions that the jury draw inferences from facts not in evidence; (3) appeals to the passions and emotions of the jurors; and (4) injection of extraneous matters.\u201d Id., 540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The case before us now does not reveal a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct. The defendant\u2019s claims relate to final argument only. Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s conduct and moved for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial based in part on the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. The claims were properly preserved for appellate review. Furthermore, in response to defense counsel\u2019s objections, the court gave curative instructions at the time objections were made and during final argument. In her closing argument, defense counsel addressed the prosecutor\u2019s comments, reminding the jury that the trial was about the defendant, not the victim, and that the defendant was innocent until proven guilty. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument acknowledges that there was an altercation between the defendant and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Perhaps the most important distinction between the facts here and in <em>Williams </em>is that the fight between the defendant and the victim was witnessed. None of the witnesses in this case saw a knife, but their testimony was not seriously called into question. There was expert testimony that the victim died as the result of stab wounds. The police captured the defendant fully clothed standing under a shower. The jury convicted the defendant of the lesser manslaughter and assault counts, not murder and the intentional manslaughter and assault counts. The conviction demonstrates that the jury listened to the evidence and to defense counsel. These facts do not demonstrate, in my opinion, that the defendant was not afforded a fair trial and that his constitutional due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>I concur with the majority that prosecutors hold an important position in our judicial system and that they have an obligation to abide unfailingly to our rules of law and practice. Although the prosecutor here may have lost sight of this paradigm in the heat of final argument, I do not believe the facts of this case present us with an appropriate occasion to reverse the judgment of conviction. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person ... or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant pari,: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such ii\\jury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument ... or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of death to another person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
