In its counterstatement of the issues, the town claims that the trial court\u2019s judgment can be affirmed on important and clearly defined public policy grounds. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of the town\u2019s public policy argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The following facts are necessary for our review. For approximately nine years prior to January 8,1992, John Marchesseault (grievant) was employed by the town as a police officer. On that date, the grievant worked the 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift alone in a radio police vehicle. Toward the end of his shift, the grievant was informed of a complaint that several young men had tried to gain access to the Ellsworth School to play basketball at the conclusion of an organized basketball game. Believing that the young men would later try to gain access to the building with a key one of them said he had, the director of the recreation department (director) asked the police to patrol the school to look for unauthorized activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The grievant proceeded to the school, observed lights in the hallway and found a broken window at the rear of the gymnasium. He reported his obseivations to the police dispatcher, who asked a second radio patrol officer to go to the school. The grievant knocked on the door but received no response. When the second officer and the director arrived, the director opened the door and the three entered the building. The grievant saw seven young men playing basketball. He then entered the gymnasium with his weapon drawn and ordered the basketball players to the floor. The grievant asked the second officer to frisk the players for weapons. The grievant\u2019s weapon was drawn for approximately one minute, but it was never pointed at anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">After asking each of the young men for identification and talking with one of them about the key used to gain access to the school, the second officer decided to charge the young men with simple trespass and to issue each of them a citation, which would result in a mail-in fine of $50. While the officers were writing the citations, the second officer suggested to the grievant that he had overreacted to the situation (hereafter referred to as the basketball incident). The grievant agreed that there was no need for him to have pulled his weapon and acknowledged the danger inherent in having done so. When he returned to the police station, the grievant reported to the sergeant and described what he had done. The grievant\u2019s supervisor, however, already had ended his shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On his next work day, the grievant spoke to his lieutenant saying, \u201cI fucked up last night.\u201d The lieutenant and the grievant had two discussions to determine what might have influenced the grievant\u2019s inappropriate behavior. The grievant was unable to come to a conclusion about his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">On or about January 13, 1992, the police chief received a letter of complaint from the mother of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of the seven young men who had been in the gymnasium playing basketball.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The police chief assigned a sergeant to investigate the basketball incident. The grievant temporarily was relieved of duty with pay pending the investigation, which included an evaluation of his fitness for duty. On January 23, 1992, the police chief reviewed the basketball incident with the grievant. Again, the grievant admitted that his behavior was not proper. The investigating sergeant interviewed and took statements from the parties involved, including the grievant, and filed a report. The police chief reviewed the report and discussed the situation with the town manager. They concluded that the grievant should submit to a fitness for duty examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">On approximately February 24,1992, the town asked Peter Zeman, a psychiatrist, to determine the grievant\u2019s fitness for duty. The town supplied Zeman with all of the information in the grievant\u2019s file, including information concerning an incident that occurred in 1983, which also resulted in a fitness for duty evaluation. After he met with the grievant, Zeman asked Leslie Lothstein, a psychologist, to administer psychological tests and render an opinion concerning the grievant\u2019s fitness for duty. Both Zeman<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Lothstein<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> submitted reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>to the police chief, who shared them with the town manager. The town manager held a hearing on April 15, 1992, to discuss the basketball incident and the results of the fitness evaluation. By letter dated April 28, 1992, the town manager informed the grievant that the town was going to terminate his employment as of May 1, 1992, because during the basketball incident, he had violated \u00a7\u00a7 2.3.5 (unnecessary force), 2.3.2 (conduct unbecoming an officer) and 4.7.16 (guidelines and procedures for the use of firearms) of the South Windsor police manual, and because he was unfit for duty in Zeman\u2019s and Lothstein\u2019s opinions.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The union filed a grievance with the town, claiming that the grievant\u2019s termination was without just cause, which the town manager denied. On or about January 25, 1993, the grievant\u2019s attorney received a letter from David Johnson, an individual who claimed that he was counseling the grievant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Johnson\u2019s letter stated that there was \u201cno reason why [the grievant] should not return to duty as an officer with the ability to carry and handle firearms. I will continue to work with [the grievant] once he returns to active duty.\u201d Later, the grievant obtained repoxts from Ronald Anderson, a psychologist, and Kenneth Selig, a psychiatrist with a law degree, who opined that the grievant was fit for duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The dispute was submitted to a three person arbitration panel (arbitrators). The arbitrators were to decide the following issues: (1) Was the grievant terminated by the town for just cause? and (2) If not, what shall the remedy be? The arbitrators held a hearing on numerous days on and between July 15, 1993, and March 4, 1994. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>While the hearing was pending, the parties agreed that Ezra Griffith, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University, should evaluate the grievant for fitness for duty. Griffith concluded that the grievant was fit for duty. In February, 1994, Zeman reviewed all of the reports and evaluation materials from the grievant\u2019s experts, including Griffith, but did not change his opinion that the grievant was not fit for duty in early 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The arbitrators issued their award on June 11, 1996, sustaining the grievance in part and denying it in part, concluding that the grievant was not terminated for just cause. The arbitrators\u2019 award stated that the grievant \u201cshall be reinstated to his position as a South Windsor police officer subject to retraining; a current fitness for duty statement; retraining in firearms; and, counseling as outlined in the analysis and discussion section of the award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The town filed an application to vacate the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3) and (4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The union moved to confirm the award. The trial court denied the motion to confirm and granted the application to vacate, concluding that the arbitrators (1) improperly imposed an excessive standard of proof on the town, (2) failed to allow evidence of the grievant\u2019s purported search for mental health assistance, (3) relied on what the arbitrators termed \u201cuniversally recognized\u201d tests of just cause on which the parties had never agreed and (4) evaluated the grievant\u2019s fitness for duty and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>town\u2019s actions with information that was not available at the time the town terminated the grievant\u2019s employment. Additional facts will be addressed as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201c \u2018The scope of review by the court of an arbitrator\u2019s power to make an award is limited. Arbitration is a creature of contract between the parties and its autonomy requires a minimum of judicial intrusion. . . . The parties themselves, by the agreement of the submission, define the powers of the arbitrator. . . . The submission constitutes the charter of the entire arbitration proceedings and defines and limits the issues to be decided. . . . When the parties have agreed to a procedure and have delineated the authority of the arbitrator, they must be bound by those limits. ... An application to vacate or correct an award should be granted where an arbitrator has exceeded his power. In deciding whether an arbitrator has exceeded his power, we need only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission.\u2019 . . . <em>Bic Pen Corp. </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>183 Conn. 579, 583-84, 440 A.2d 774 (1981).\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, Local 760, </em>49 Conn. App. 805, 811-12, 717 A.2d 258, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 920, 722 A.2d 809 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201cIn determining whether a submission is unrestricted, we look at the authority of an arbitrator. The authority of an arbitrator to adjudicate the controversy is limited only if the agreement contains express language restricting the breadth of issues, reserving explicit rights, or conditioning the award on court review. In the absence of such qualifications, an agreement is unrestricted. . . . Even in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have, however, recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear public policy ... or (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u00a7 52-418.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We first address the union\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly granted the town\u2019s application to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The first set of issues raised by the union concerns its claim that the trial court substituted its interpretation of the agreement for the arbitrators\u2019 interpretation. We agree with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">The first issue of interpretation concerns the standard of proof that the town was required to meet to prove that the grievant\u2019s termination was for just cause. The town claims that it is not the standard of proof the arbitrators used that is at issue, but rather, the fact that the arbitrators did not tell the town until after the hearing that they required the town to prove by more than a preponderance of the evidence that the grievant was terminated for just cause. The town claimed before the trial court that the arbitrators\u2019 failure to provide notice of the heightened standard of proof or to permit the town to be heard on the standard of proof deprived the town of a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The agreement is silent as to the standard of proof by which the town was required to prove that it terminated the grievant for just cause. Apparently, prior to and during the arbitration, the parties did not discuss or agree on the standard of proof required. In rendering their award, the arbitrators let it be known that they imposed a standard higher than a preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that in so doing, the arbitrators had improperly added a provision to the agreement. The court reasoned that because article XXX of the agreement states that \u201c[n]o amendment, alteration or variation of the terms of this Agreement shall bind the parties hereto unless made and agreed to in writing by both parties,\u201d and because article XVII<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the agreement implies that the union has the burden of proof when it questions disciplinary action, the arbitrators exceeded their authority under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3) and prejudiced the town by adding to the agreement a standard of proof provision to which the parties never agreed in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201cWe have consistently stated that arbitration is the favored means of settling differences and arbitration awards are generally upheld unless an award clearly falls within the proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 of the General Statutes. ... A challenge of the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to a comparison of the award to the submis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>sion. . . . An award, therefore, will normally be vacated only if it fails to conform to the submission, and the party challenging it has the burden of producing evidence sufficient to show that it does not conform to the submission. . . . Where the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotations marks omitted.) <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>210 Conn. 333, 338-39, 555 A.2d 406 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u201cJudicial rulings in Connecticut and elsewhere generally have not reviewed the procedural or substantive merits of an arbitrated decision. <em>General Drivers Local No. 120 </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>535 F.2d 1072, 1076 (8th Cir. 1976). Here, we are faced with a challenge to the standard of proof utilized by a panel of arbitrators. Because collective bargaining agreements are generally silent on procedural matters such as rules of evidence, an arbitration panel must be vested with the inherent authority to make procedural rulings. Otherwise, the national policy favoring arbitration of collective bargaining grievances would be frustrated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local </em>530, 9 Conn. App. 396, 399, 519 A.2d 93 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 806, 520 A.2d 1287 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Standards of proof generally are a question of law. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>242 Conn. 745, 799, 700 A.2d 1108 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 418, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996); <em>State v. Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 293, 641 A.2d 370 (1994); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-AB), </em>189 Conn. 58, 60, 454 A.2d 271 (1983); <em>Issler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>v. <em>Issler, </em>50 Conn. App. 58, 74, 716 A.2d 938 (1998), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 250 Conn. 226, 737 A.2d 383 (1999); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>18 Conn. App. 316, 323, 559 A.2d 220 (1989). Connecticut\u2019s appellate courts have not established the standard of proof to be used to determine whether an employer had just cause to terminate a police officer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Courts do not review legal questions involved in an arbitration, save for those set forth in \u00a7 52-418 (a). Because the agreement was silent as to the standard of proof by which the town had to prove its termination of the grievant was for just cause, the arbitrators properly established the standard of proof required. Because the agreement did not contain a provision as to the standard of proof required, the town was on notice that the arbitrators could establish the standard of proof and was, therefore, not denied a full and fair hearing. Consequently, the trial court improperly vacated the award on the grounds of lack of notice and the standard of proof the ar bitrators applied to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Next, the union claims that the trial court improperly substituted its interpretation of the agreement for that of the arbitrators with respect to the just cause basis for discipline. The trial court concluded that the arbitrators applied the improper test for determining just cause. Although the town included that claim in its application to vacate, we conclude, on the basis of our review of the record, that the parties did not brief this issue for the trial court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The issue, therefore, was not properly before the trial court, which improperly vacated the award on that ground. See <em>Commission on Human </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 344 n.11, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The union\u2019s third claim is that the trial court improperly interpreted the agreement by concluding that the arbitrators considered expert opinions regarding the grievant\u2019s fitness for duty rendered subsequent to April 28, 1992, the date the town terminated the grievant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The basketball incident occurred on January 8, 1992. Zeman and Lothstein met with the grievant in February and March, 1992. The first contrary opinion was received by the grievant\u2019s counsel in late January, 1993. On July 12, 1993, Anderson rendered an opinion that the grievant was fit for duty. Selig conducted interviews with the grievant in June and July, 1993, and rendered an opinion in November of that year, stating that because no one had diagnosed the grievant as suffering from any particular mental illness, the grievant must be fit for duty. Griffith rendered his opinion in late December, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The arbitrators determined that the town had to prove that the grievant was not fit for duty by more than the preponderance of the evidence and that the standard was to be met \u201cby evidence supported by . a clinical conclusion, with reasonable medical certainty, that the grievant is not able to continue to work as a gun-carrying police officer, and that he presents a foreseeable risk to his own health and safety and that of the citizenry of [the town].\u201d The arbitrators noted that a review of the opinions of the parties\u2019 evaluators and of Griffith, the psychiatrist on whom the parties agreed, raised \u201cthe question as to whether or not the findings provided a conclusion, with reasonable medical certainty, that the grievant would not have been able to return to his position as a police officer if he had been allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>opportunity to seek counseling, retraining and appropriate treatment. In other words, was his termination the only reasonable avenue available to the town or was termination based on the evaluation results excessive?\u201d The arbitrators also found that the town did not provide the grievant with an opportunity to overcome the opinions of Zeman and Lothstein before deciding to terminate the grievant.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Before both the trial court and this court, the town argued that the arbitrators chose to believe expert opinions rendered eighteen months after the basketball incident rather than the opinions of experts who examined the grievant within two months of the event. The trial court, too, made much of the tense of the verb to be used by the arbitrators, i.e., <em>was </em>the grievant fit for duty or <em>is </em>the grievant fit for duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201c[T]he credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>[171 Conn. 705, 708, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S.

Rather, we are limited to determining whether the commission\u2019s conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>fact were unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 332, 732 A.2d 144 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Although it was well within the scope of arbitration for the arbitrators to determine which expert opinions to credit and which to disregard, the arbitrators in the case before us did not say that they chose to believe the opinions of the union\u2019s experts rather than the opinions of Zeman and Lothstein. The arbitrators found that on the basis of their review of the evaluations and Griffith\u2019s opinion, there was a question as to whether Zeman and Lothstein\u2019s opinions were conclusive within a degree of medical certainty. The issue for the arbitrators was not the substance of Zeman and Lothstein\u2019s opinions but the quality of their opinions. Because, according to the arbitrators, the town\u2019s expert opinions did not meet the standard of proof, the town did not meet its burden of proof. The trial court improperly vacated the award on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Next, the union claims that the trial court improperly vacated the award by concluding that the town was deprived of a full and fair hearing because the arbitrators excluded evidence of the efforts the grievant made to secure a favorable fitness for duty report prior to November 30, 1993. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">During the hearing, the town asked the grievant on cross-examination whether he had sought other opinions of his fitness for duty between the time that he saw Zeman and the time he saw Selig. The union\u2019s counsel objected, and the arbitrators sustained the objection. When asked for a clarification of their ruling, the arbitrators gave two reasons: First, the arbitrators did not believe they had the authority to require the grievant to respond and, second, they had sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>medical evidence so that any additional contradictory evidence would be cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cHearings before administrative agencies . . . although informal and conducted without regard to the strict rules of evidence, must be conducted so as not to violate the fundamental rules of natural justice. . . . Due process of law requires not only that there be due notice of the hearing but that at the hear ing the parties involved have a right to produce relevant evidence, and an opportunity to know the facts on which the agency is asked to act, to cross-examine witnesses and to offer rebuttal evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u201c[Arbitrators are accorded substantial discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, particularly in the case of an unrestricted submission, which \u2018relieve[sj the arbitrators of the obligation to follow strict rules of law and evidence in reaching their decision.\u2019 <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation </em>v. <em>Southern New England Contracting Co., </em>[164 Conn. 472, 477, 325 A.2d 274 (1973)]; <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Police Local 1159, </em>[183 Conn. 102, 106, 438 A.2d 1171 (1981)].

A trial court reviewing an arbitration award, therefore, must consider all of the evidence placed before it concerning the alleged error in order to determine whether the challenging party has proved that the alleged error, <em>in fact, </em>denied it a full and fair hearing. Id. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision, an appellate court must determine whether, on the basis of the record before it, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the challenging party was, <em>in fact, </em>denied such a full and fair hearing.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Clairol, Inc. </em>v. <em>Enertrac Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 506, 514, 690 A.2d 418, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 906, 695 A.2d 537 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The arbitrators\u2019 award demonstrates that the town was not prejudiced by the arbitrators\u2019 decision not to compel the grievant to answer the town\u2019s question concerning efforts he had made to obtain a favorable fitness for duty opinion prior to November, 1993. During the course of the hearing, the arbitrators were concerned that they, as laypersons, were faced with opposing expert opinions from the town and the union concerning the grievant\u2019s fitness for duty. The arbitrators, therefore, initiated a discussion between the parties that a neutral expert review the grievant\u2019s records and the expert opinions submitted to them. Griffith was the person the parties agreed should review the conflicting materials. Because the town agreed to submit the conflicting evidence to Griffith, whose opinion broke the deadlock and formed the basis of the arbitrators\u2019 award, we cannot say that the town did not receive a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and fair hearing because the evidence in question was excluded. The trial court improperly vacated the award on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The town, in its counterstatement of the issues, claims that the trial court\u2019s vacating the arbitrators\u2019 award can be affirmed on important and clearly defined public policy grounds. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The submission to the arbitrators consisted of two parts. If the arbitrators concluded that the grievant was not terminated for just cause, they were asked to determine the remedy. Because they determined that the grievant was not terminated for just cause, the arbitrators ordered his \u201creinstatement to his position as a police officer subject to retraining required by [General Statutes \u00a7 7-294d (b)] and subject to training on the use and possession of firearms. Further, he shall provide to the town a <em>current fitness for duty statement provided by a medical expert of his choice </em>and shall continue counseling as determined by said professional surrounding the type of judgment he made on January 8th [1992] which resulted in this arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The town claims that by giving the grievant the option to choose the medical expert to provide his fitness for duty statement, the arbitrators violated \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) by exceeding their powers in that the town\u2019s board of police commissioners is solely responsible for the appointment of police officers. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-276. The town argues that the grievant\u2019s interest in continued employment as a police officer must be weighed against the town\u2019s interest in protecting public safety and public confidence in its police department. The town notes that the grievant himself admitted that his behavior during the basketball incident was inappropriate. It also points out that the arbitrators found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u201cthe grievant acted in ... an inappropriate manner based upon the expectations of the town and his own knowledge of what was required during\u201d the basketball incident, and that \u201c[t]he town acted reasonably and within its responsibilities by initiating an investigation of the\u201d basketball incident. The town concludes that by giving the grievant the right to select the fitness evaluator, the arbitrators placed the grievant\u2019s employment rights over the rights of the town\u2019s citizens to be protected by a police force whose members are psychologically sound and fit for duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u201c[T]he public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and a court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s inteipretation of [collective bargaining agreements] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests. . . . <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>[supra, 210 Conn. 340]. [W]ith respect to matters of public policy generally, arbitrators exceed their authority if their award orders a party to engage in conduct that is patently illegal or in clear violation of public policy. <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>Local 134, IFPTE, </em>[201 Conn. 577, 585, 519 A.2d 1 (1986)]; <em>Board of Trastees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>179 Conn. 184, 195, 425 A.2d 1247 (1979); [R.] Gorman, Basic Text on Labor Law, Unionization and Collective Bargaining (1976) p. 593. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 416-17, 544 A.2d 186 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u201cA public policy challenge to an arbitration award is rooted in the principle that the parties cannot expect conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, Local 760, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 812-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">To trigger the public policy exception of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), the award must violate an explicit public policy or statute. <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 340-41 n.4; see <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 195; <em>State </em>v. <em>Connecticut Council 4, CEU, AFSCME, </em>7 Conn. App. 286, 508 A.2d 806 (1986) (awards set aside pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-418 [a] [4] because found in direct conflict with provisions of state statute); <em>International Brotherhood of Police Officers </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>40 Conn.

The police officer standards and training council (council) has authority \u201c[t]o establish uniform minimum educational and training standards for employment as a police officer in full-time positions . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-294d (a) (10). \u201cThe Police Officer Standards and Training Council requires, as a condition of appointment to a position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of probationary candidate in a law enforcement unit in the State of Connecticut, on or after January 1, 1995, that the candidate has been the subject of a psychological examination during the selection process and that a written report of that examination is on file with the appropriate officials at the law enforcement unit. The Police Officer Standards and Training Council requires that the examination be conducted by a psychologist/ psychiatrist currently licensed by a qualified state board, who provides the law enforcement unit with documentation of the examination and who provides a written opinion of the candidate\u2019s overall psychological stability to fill a position as a police officer.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 7-294e-16 (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The union argues that the balance between the town\u2019s public safety concerns and the grievant\u2019s employment interest is too vague a public policy on which to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award. We disagree, as the legislature made it perfectly clear that the town\u2019s board of police commissioners alone is responsible for hiring police officers. The legislature also specifically empowered the council to establish entry level requirements that all police officers must meet. The public policy issue concerning public safety and a police officer\u2019s fitness for duty is quite specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The union argues that because the applicable regulation, \u00a7 7-294e-16 (j), is limited to probationary candidates, it does not apply to the grievant. We will not construe the regulation in a manner that produces an absurd result.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 7-276, the town must nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>essarily be concerned with every police officer\u2019s fitness for duty, whether a probationary or established officer. Because the arbitrators\u2019 award violates the specific public policy of a town\u2019s control over the fitness for duty of its police force, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining the town\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> The court denied the union\u2019s motion to confirm the arbitrators\u2019 award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> The union also claimed that the court improperly failed to confirm the arbitration award.
