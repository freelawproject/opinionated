Scott, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing his appeal from the decision of the defendant, Jose Salinas, the commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner). The commissioner had suspended the plaintiffs motor vehicle operator\u2019s license for ninety days for operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol content was in excess of the statutory limit. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly admitted an unsigned report into evidence and that there was no probable cause for his arrest. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The facts necessary for a determination of this appeal are as follows. On June 24, 1998, a state police trooper observed a vehicle operating erratically in the right southbound lane of Interstate 91 in Hartford. He stopped the vehicle and upon approaching it, detected a strong odor of alcohol on the operator\u2019s breath. The operator, who proved to be the plaintiff, answered the trooper\u2019s questions in slurred speech and failed roadside sobriety tests. As a result, the trooper arrested him on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and transported him to the state police barracks, where he was advised of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights and given the opportunity to telephone an attorney. The plaintiff was given one breath test at 10:26 p.m., which showed a 0.218 percent blood alcohol content and a second breath test at 11:08 p.m., which showed a 0.205 percent blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The commissioner sent a notice to the plaintiff advising him that due to the results of the blood alcohol tests his license to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended for ninety days. The notice offered the plaintiff an opportunity, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 14-227b (d), now (e), to attend a hearing to contest the suspension prior to its going into effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff requested and received an administrative hearing and attended it with counsel. Following the hearing before a duly appointed hearing officer, the commissioner rendered his decision suspending the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license for ninety days. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>tiff appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Our examination of the record and briefs of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues regarding the underlying factual disputes were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Salinas, </em>46 Conn. Sup. 337, 750 A.2d 513 (1998). Because the memorandum of decision fully addresses the dispositive issues raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on that issue. It would seive no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Greg C.\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>56 Conn. App. 439, 440, 744 A.2d 914, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 901, 753 A.2d 936 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.
