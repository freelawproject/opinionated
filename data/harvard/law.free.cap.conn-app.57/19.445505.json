We reject the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On October 19, 1994, Ernest Herold drove to the Dunbar Cafe in New Haven with two friends. Herold parked his car behind the bar and proceeded to the front of the bar, where he began talking with the owner of the bar, Robert Williams. Herold then observed a tan Lincoln being parked in front of the bar. Three men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>exited the vehicle, walked to the bar entrance and began talking with Williams. The three men were Andre Provite, who is the defendant\u2019s cousin, Phil Young and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The three men entered the bar, and Herold followed shortly thereafter. Herold ordered a beer and watched the defendant, Williams and another man playing poker. After the card game, Herold heard the defendant ask Williams for money, which Williams refused. Herold then approached the bar, and the defendant turned toward him and asked Williams whether Herold was his nephew or bodyguard or had some other relation to him. Herold then left the bar. He walked to a nearby after-hours club, entered it briefly and decided to leave. Herold then headed toward his car to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">As he approached the Dunbar Cafe, Herold saw the defendant, Provite, Young and two other men standing together near the entrance to the bar. As Herold passed by the group, he heard the defendant say to one of the men: \u201cWhat the fuck is this? Who the fuck is this guy?\u201d Herold responded: \u201cWhy you keep asking who I am? Who are you to keep asking who I am? What is your problem?\u201d The defendant then told Herold, \u201cI will show you,\u201d and pulled out a chrome-colored pistol, which he pointed at Herold. Herold then turned to run, heard a gunshot and fell to the ground with a head wound. The bullet penetrated the back of his head, shattered his jaw and exited near his left cheek. Herold was then rushed to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The defendant fled the scene with Provite and Young and, subsequently, fled the state. He was apprehended in July, 1995, in Kansas City, Missouri, and was brought back to Connecticut to face criminal charges pertaining to these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">The defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201cA mistrial is appropriate only where it is apparent to the court that as a result of some occurrence during the trial a party has been deprived of an opportunity for a fair trial. . . . The trial court . . . has great latitude in ruling on a motion for a mistrial. . . . The question on appeal is . . . whether the trial court, in refusing to grant a new trial, so far exceeded or abused its discretion so as to warrant granting a new trial. . . . In reviewing motions for mistrial, our Supreme Court has determined that [i]f curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of mistrial should be avoided.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Melillo, </em>17 Conn. App. 114, 119, 550 A.2d 319 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly allowed the state to impeach him on the basis of his postarrest custodial silence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The following additional facts are necessary for a resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">At trial, Provite testified that although he was at the Dunbar Cafe, he was in his car at the time of the shooting and did not witness it. Provite testified that moments after he heard a shot being fired, he saw the defendant, who was not carrying a gun, approach his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Provite\u2019s testimony was impeached with a taped statement that he gave police the day after the shooting. In Provite\u2019s taped statement, he said that the defendant shot Herold, that he saw Herold fall to the ground with the defendant standing over him with a gun, and that he drove the defendant from the scene because he was afraid that otherwise the defendant would shoot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">The defendant testified that an unidentified person bought drugs from Herold and then stood behind him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and shot him in the head. Further, the defendant testified that he fled the scene with his cousin because he was so disturbed by the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to discredit the defendant\u2019s testimony by asking numerous questions about why the defendant did not contact Provite, his cousin, subsequent to his arrest. The prosecutor questioned the defendant\u2019s failure to ask his cousin to confirm for the police his version of the events on the night of the shooting. Both the defendant and Provite testified that they had not spoken after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">During redirect examination, defense counsel established that she had specifically instructed the defendant not to talk to Provite or any other witnesses. The state then advised the court that it intended to put on evidence concerning the amount of time that had passed between the defendant\u2019s arrest and when he began being represented by defense counsel. Defense counsel objected to this evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The prosecutor, however, elicited during recross-examination that defense counsel did not represent the defendant and therefore did not instruct him to be silent until approximately two months after his arrest. The defendant subsequently moved for a mistrial, claiming that the state\u2019s questions concerning his postarrest silence were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The court determined that a mistrial was not necessary and gave the jury a curative instruction to remedy any possible prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court reasoned that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning was proper because it was relevant to the credibility of the defendant and Provite, and had nothing to do with the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The curative instruction cautioned the jury that the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to call Provite could be considered only with respect to the credibility of Provite and the defendant. The court further cautioned the jury that if it found that the defendant did not contact Provite because of the advice of his counsel, it should not draw any unfavorable inferences from this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>97 Conn. 258, 116 A. 336 (1922), to support his claim that the prosecutor\u2019s questions on the defendant\u2019s silence were improper. In <em>Ferrone, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen the accused is <em>in custody, </em>our law accords [the accused] the right to reply to question or statement, or to remain silent. [The accused\u2019s] silence under such circumstances cannot be laid in evidence against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 266. The defendant\u2019s silence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the present case did not occur while he was in custody or while being questioned by the police. Therefore, the rule in <em>Ferrone </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The defendant also relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>140 Conn. 326, 99 A.2d 133 (1953). In <em>Bates, </em>the Supreme Court applied <em>Ferrone </em>and held that although the defendant was not physically in custody because he had been released on bail, he was in constructive custody, and his silence in the face of an accusation concerning his guilt was inadmissible. Id., 330. In the present case, however, the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to contact his cousin was not admitted to prove guilt. The court instructed the jury immediately after the defendant testified, and the court stated that the evidence was to be used only for credibility purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We conclude that the court properly limited to the issue of credibility the admission of the state\u2019s questioning concerning the defendant\u2019s silence. The court, therefore, properly denied the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial because it allowed the state to impeach him for remaining silent without determining outside the jury\u2019s presence whether his silence was due to the advice of counsel. The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 523 A.2d 451 (1987), in support of his claim. Our Supreme Court in <em>Bryant, </em>however, established guidelines for the cross-examination of alibi witnesses, not defendants, in criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">In <em>Bryant, </em>the court ruled that to lay a proper foundation for the impeachment of an alibi witness on the basis of his or her failure to come forward prior to trial to tell the police about a defendant\u2019s alibi, it may be necessary to establish that the witness (1) was aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of the nature of the charges, (2) had reason to recognize that he or she possessed exculpatory information, (3) had a reasonable motive for acting to exonerate the defendant and (4) was familiar with the means to make such information available to the authorities. Id., 705. The court in <em>Bryant </em>reasoned that laying a proper foundation for an alibi witness\u2019 silence may aid the trier of fact in determining whether the witness\u2019 testimony is accurate or a recent fabrication. Id. Further, the court reasoned that \u201c[c]ommon sense and human experience may indicate, in a given case, that there may be explanations for a witness\u2019 pretrial silence that are entirely consistent with that witness\u2019 posture at trial.\u201d Id. Thus, the court in <em>Bryant </em>was concerned with a \u201cwitness [who] is cast in the posture of having been silent as to claimed exculpatory testimony and <em>is not given a real opportunity to explain that silence </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 704. The court\u2019s holding in <em>Bryant, </em>however, is not applicable to the facts of this case. <em>Bryant </em>addressed the impeachment of alibi witnesses for failing to come forward before trial and tell the police about a defendant\u2019s alibi. <em>Bryant </em>does not concern the impeachment of a defendant. In this case, the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s silence was elicited through the defendant\u2019s own testimony, and the defendant gave an explanation for his failure to contact his cousin. We therefore conclude that the rule in <em>Bryant </em>does not apply to the facts of this case and that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly charged the jury on the definition of reasonable doubt and on identification. We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The defendant claims that the court improperly instructed the jury that reasonable doubt is not a \u201cdoubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>suggested by the ingenuity of counsel\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the court\u2019s use of that language warrants a reversal of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The standard of review for constitutional claims of improper jury instructions is well settled. \u201cIn determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 171, 728 A.2d 466 (1999); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>250 Conn. 466, 470, 736 A.2d 125 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Recently, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 475, ora: Supreme Court rejected the claim that the use of \u201cingenuity of counsel\u201d language was violative of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel and to a fair trial or that it was plain error. The <em>Delvalle </em>court reasoned that the Supreme Court has repeatedly \u201cupheld similar language on the ground that [it] did not, when properly considered in the broader context of the trial court\u2019s instructions in their entirety, [dilute] the state\u2019s burden of proof or otherwise misle[ad] the jury in any way. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 504-505, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1997); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>247 Conn. 318, 329-30, 721 A.2d 519 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 817-20, 709 A.2d 522 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>supra, 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Although the court in <em>Delvalle </em>rejected the constitutional challenge to the \u201cingenuity of counsel\u201d instruction, the court stated that \u201c[t]o avoid any possibility of juror confusion arising from the use of the phrase, we invoke our supervisory authority over the administration of justice to direct our trial courts to refrain from using the \u2018ingenuity of counsel\u2019 language in the future.\u201d Id., 475-76. The court\u2019s jury instruction in this case was given before the <em>Delvalle </em>court\u2019s direction about the future use of the \u201cingenuity of counsel\u201d language, and, when viewed in the context of the instructions as a whole, could not have misled the jury. See id., 474; <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>56 Conn. App. 831, 843, 746 A.2d 795 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the issue of identification in that it failed to include in its instructions his requested charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Telfaire, </em>469 F.2d 552 (D.C. Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u201cOur standard of review on this [nonconstitutional] claim is whether it is reasonably probable that the jury was misled. . . . The test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Therefore, jury instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect, or technically accurate. Nonetheless, the trial court must correctly adapt the law to the case in question and must provide the jury with sufficient guidance in reaching a correct verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thames River Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>50 Conn. App. 767, 774, 720 A.2d 242 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201c[W]e note that there is no constitutional right to an instruction on the fallibility of eyewitness identifications. . . . Although such an instruction may be given in an appropriate case ... it is not reversible error for a trial court to refuse to give a <em>Telfaire </em>instruction where the conviction of the defendant did not turn upon the testimony of eyewitnesses who were uncertain, unclear or inconsistent. . . . The ultimate test of a court\u2019s instructions is whether, taken as a whole, they fairly and adequately present the case to a jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>20 Conn.

App. 247, 254, 661 A.2d 612 (1995). Although the court\u2019s instruction in this case did not mirror the defendant\u2019s request to charge, it did cover the substantive points that he requested.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>gave general instructions on the credibility of witnesses that reiterated some of those same points.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Our review of the charge as a whole reveals that the court\u2019s instructions were accurate and comprehensive, and furnished adequate guidance to the jury. See id., 255; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardison, </em>16 Conn. App. 142, 146-47, 546 A.2d 968 (1988).

You know and can recall all the different testimony. Now, you know that Mr. Provite testified and gave two versions of the event, and I have given you instructions on how to evaluate that testimony. You heard the defendant testify and, under one version of Mr. Provite\u2019s and [the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>dant\u2019s] testimony, the thrust of that testimony is that this crime was committed by others, and [the prosecutor] on cross-examination asked [the defendant] why he didn\u2019t call his cousin right away to help him, to exculpate him, to explain all this because there was, or there is, a version which you are entitled to accept\u2014that is what jurors do\u2014which has another man or group of men committing this crime. What I want to caution you about [is] that [this] evidence is offered only on the question of [the] credibility of [the defendant] and Mr. Provite, and [that the defendant] testified that his reason, a portion of his reason for not calling his cousin, was that his attorney had told him not to. A person acting on advice of counsel, if you choose to believe that reason for not calling, you should draw no unfavorable inference from the fact that [the defendant] did not make any [telephone] call after he had been advised not to speak to anyone by his lawyer. Draw no unfavorable inference from that. All right, do you understand that? Okay. It might be a minor point, but the message that I want to get to you is that whenever anybody exercises their constitutional right to remain silent, whenever anyone does not communicate with someone on the advice of counsel, that is not a negative factor at all in a trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> The court\u2019s instruction on the concept of reasonable doubt was as follows: \u201cReasonable doubt. The meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable. It is not a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture. Nor is it doubt suggested by the ingenuity of counsel or a juror not warranted by the evidence. It is such a doubt as in serious matters that concern you, you would heed. That is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance. It is not hesitation springing from any feelings of pity or sympathy for the accused or any other person who might be affected by your decision. It is, in other words, a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence. It is doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in light of the evidence after a fair comparison and careful examination of the entire evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all doubt. The law does not require absolute certainty on the part of the jury before it returns a verdict of guilty. The law requires that after hearing all the evidence, if there is something in the evidence or lack of evidence that leaves in the minds of the jurors as reasonable men and women a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt and acquitted. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except guilt and is inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\"> A charge under <em>United States </em>v. Telfaire, supra, 469 F.2d 558-59, instructs the jury to consider, in evaluating the identification testimony of a witness, the following factors: The adequacy of the witness\u2019 opportunity and capacity to observe the perpetrator, the length of time to observe the peipelrator, the proximity of the witness to the perpetrator, whether the witness knew or saw the perpetrator prior to the incident, whether the identification was the product of the witness\u2019 own recollection and the credibility of the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> The court charged the jury in relevant part as follows: \u201cIn arriving at a determination as to the matter of identification, you should consider all the facts and circumstances that existed at the <em>time </em>of the observation of the perpetrator by each witness. In this regard, the reliability of each witness is of paramount importance, since identification testimony is an expression of belief orimpression by the witness. Its value depends upon the opportunity and ability of the witness to observe the offender at the time of the event and to make an accurate identification later. It is for you to decide how much weight to place upon such testimony. In appraising the identification of any witness, you should take into account whether the witness had adequate opportunity and ability to observe the perpetrator on the date in question. This will be affected by such considerations as the length of time available to make the observations, the distance between the witness and the perpetrator, the lighting conditions at the time of the offense, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the witness had known or seen the person in the past and whether anything distracted the attention of the witness during 1he incident. You should also consider the witness\u2019 physical and emotional condition at the time of the incident, and the witness\u2019 powers of observation in general. In short, you must consider the totality of the circumstances affecting the identification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b53-14\"> As to the credibility or believability of witnesses, the court stated: \u201cIn deciding what the facts are, you must consider all of the evidence. In doing this, you must decide which testimony to believe and which testimony not to believe. You may believe all, none or any part of any witness\u2019 testimony. In making that decision, you may take into account a number of factors, including the following. One, was the witness able to see or hear or know the things about which that witness testified? Two, how well was the witness able to recall and describe those things? Three, what was the witness\u2019 manner while testifying? Four, did the witness have an interest in the outcome of this case or any bias or prejudice concerning any party or any matter involved in this case? Five, how reasonable was the witness\u2019 testimony considered in light, of all of the evidence in the case? Six, was the witness\u2019 testimony contradicted by what that witness has said or done at another time, or by the testimony of other witnesses or by other evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">\u201cIf you should think that that witness has deliberately testified falsely in some respect, you should carefully consider whether you should rely upon any of that witness\u2019 testimony. In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, keep in mind that people sometimes forget things. You need to consider, therefore, whether a contradiction is an important lapse of memory or an intentional falsehood, and that may depend on whether it has to do with an important fact or with only a small detail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
