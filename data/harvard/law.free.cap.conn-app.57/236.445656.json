We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">This case is unique. The issue is what legal consequences flow from the fact that some of the land in question is inaccessible due to the taking by the state of Connecticut of land by right of eminent domain and due also to a natural disaster not contemplated at the time the state conveyed the subject parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The following facts, as found by the court, are relevant to this appeal. At some time prior to 1962, the state acquired by eminent domain certain real property in the town of Darien to construct the Connecticut Turnpike (turnpike). In 1962, the state, acting through the commissioner of the department of highways, reconveyed 9.8 acres of the land, which was in excess of the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>needs, to the late F. Francis D\u2019Addario. At the time, the 9.8 acres were bounded on the north by railroad tracks, on the south<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and east by land owned by the state, and</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>on the west by land owned by Louis J. Kuriansky, trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The deed conveying the 9.8 acres to D\u2019Addario limited D\u2019Addario\u2019s access to the land. \u201cIt is expressly understood and agreed that all rights of access are specifically denied directly to and from other land of the [state], located on the southerly and easterly sides of the premises herein conveyed, from and to the land herein conveyed.\u201d The deed did, however, provide a grant of right-of-way, to wit: \u201cAnd the [state] does hereby give and grant unto [D\u2019Addario], his heirs and assigns forever, a full and perpetual right of way located on land of the [state], situated in the Town of Darien, County of Fairfield and State of Connecticut, on the westerly side of Hollow Tree Ridge Road. . . . The purpose of the easement herein granted is to provide access to and from the land herein conveyed, from and to Hollow Tree Ridge Road. It is expressly understood and agreed that all rights of access are specifically denied directly to and from other land of the [state] located on the southerly side of the easement area herein granted, from and to the said area.\u201d Without the right-of-way, the 9.8 acres was not accessible. The defendants do not contest the plaintiffs\u2019 right to use the easement to get to and from their 9.8 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In August, 1965, the defendants\u2019 predecessor in title acquired 3.6 acres of the previously condemned land, which was also in excess of the state\u2019s needs. The defendants\u2019 3.6 acres is adjacent to and directly to the east of the plaintiffs\u2019 9.8 acres. The deed conveying the defendants\u2019 land from the state provides: \u201cThe above described premises are conveyed subject to such rights and easements as may appear of record and to any state of facts which an inspection of the premises may show, and especially to an easement in favor of the Town of Darien for a sanitary sewer, and to an easement in favor of F. Francis D\u2019Addario for Ingress and Egress to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>from Hollow Tree Ridge Road, both of said easements being located on the northerly 50 feet of the above described premises as shown on the map hereinafter referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In June, 1982, D\u2019Addario acquired approximately twenty-two acres (Kuriansky land) from Kuriansky and the Bi-Cultural Day School, Inc. The Kuriansky land is adjacent to and directly to the west of the plaintiffs\u2019 9.8 acres. The Kuriansky land is bounded on the south by land owned by the state and to the west by the Noroton River. Prior to 1972, access to the Kuriansky land was obtained by a bridge across the river leading to Lenox Avenue in Stamford. The bridge was destroyed by a storm in 1955 and temporarily replaced by a bridge that was also destroyed by a storm in 1972. The bridge has not been replaced, and there are no plans to replace it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Since 1972, trucks belonging to the town of Darien and the owner of a business located on the Kuriansky land have used the right-oi-way for ingress and egress from Hollow Tree Ridge Road. Although the plaintiffs produced considerable evidence to support their claim of a prescriptive easement over the right-of-way to the Kuriansky land, the court found that an easement by prescription did not exist, but that there was express or implied permission to use this right-of-way because a considerable number of trucks traveled over the 9.8 acres on a daily basis to reach the Kuriansky land prior to D\u2019Addario\u2019s buying the Kuriansky land and with D\u2019Addario\u2019s consent. By affidavit, Hector Nevard attested that he had worked on the Kuriansky property since 1937 and that \u201csince 1972, all trucks have used the Hollow Tree Ridge Road access.\u201d The town of Darien also crossed the right-of-way and the 9.8 acres to reach its pumping station on the Kuriansky property. The court concluded with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a prescriptive easement that a license or express or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>implied permission cannot ripen into an easement by prescription, and that without an adverse use, prescriptive rights cannot be acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The dispute between the parties arose over the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed development of their contiguous 9.8 acres and the Kuriansky land.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs proposed a residential development consistent with the Darien designed multiple family residential zone (residential development).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants maintain that the right-of-way may not be used to benefit the Kuriansky land. The plaintiffs, therefore, commenced a declaratory judgment action to determine the parties\u2019 rights with respect to use of the right-of-way and more specifically to establish that the right-of-way may be used to reach the residential development from Hollow Tree Ridge Road. The complaint alleged three counts: (1) easement by grant; (2) easement by implication and by reasonable necessity;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) easement by prescription. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>found for the defendants on the first and third counts, and for the plaintiffs on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u201cThe construction of a deed in order to ascertain the intent expressed in the deed presents a question of law and requires construction of all its relevant provisions in the light of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Dennehy, </em>136 Conn. 398, 402, 71 A.2d 596 (1950). On appeal the scope of review of such a question is plenary . . . .\u201d <em>Carbone </em>v. <em>Vigliotti, </em>222 Conn. 216, 222, 610 A.2d 565 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The defendants\u2019 first claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that the state did not intend to convey a right-of-way that would benefit anything other than the 9.8 acre parcel of land. We conclude that the court properly granted the plaintiffs an easement over the right-of-way to benefit the Kuriansky land.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The essence of the defendants\u2019 argument is that this case must be resolved by the language creating the easement in the deed by which the state reconveyed the 9.8 acres to D\u2019Addario. The law of this state, since the early nineteenth century, has been that \u201c[t]o ascertain the proper construction to be given the deed the trial court sought to discover the intent of the parties to the deed by permitting evidence to be introduced of the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances at the time of the conveyance, and then looking at the terms of the deed in the light of the situation and surrounding circumstances. This accorded with our rule. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Muzzy, </em>61 Conn. 387, 392, 23 Atl. 604 [1892]; <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Landers, Frary &amp; Clark, </em>80 Conn. 575, 578, 69 Atl. 566 [1908]; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>16 Conn. 474, 486 [1844]; <em>Strong </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Benedict, 5 Conn. 210, 220 [1824].\u201d <em>Luce </em>v. <em>Niantic Menhaden Oil &amp; Guano Co., </em>86 Conn. 147, 149, 84 A. 521 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The situation and surrounding circumstances that influenced the state\u2019s conveyance of the right-of-way at issue was the creation of the turnpike. The turnpike landlocked some parcels of land that the state originally had taken but did not need after the turnpike was constructed. The state reconveyed the 9.8 acres with a right-of-way so that the land was accessible. At the time, the Kuriansky land was accessible by the Lenox Avenue bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The case law of this jurisdiction demonstrates that Anglo-American common law has recognized for centuries that the owner of land shall not be denied the enjoyment and use of the land. During the nineteenth century, courts used the term <em>right-of-way by necessity. </em>See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>15 Conn. 39 (1842). \u201cIt is well settled, as a part of the common law of England, that, if a man having a close, to which he has no access, except over his other lands, sell that close, the grantee shall have a way to it, as incident to the grant; for without it, he cannot derive any benefit from the grant. This rule has been established for more than two centuries .... [I]f the grantor had reserved that close to himself, and sold his other lands, a right of way would have been reserved. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u201cThe way, in the one case, in contemplation of law, is granted by deed; and in the other case, reserved. . . . For the law will not presume, that it was the intention of the parties, that one should convey land to the other, in such manner that the grantee could derive no benefit from the conveyance, nor that he should so convey a portion as to deprive himself of the enjoyment of the remainder. The law, under such circumstances, will give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>effect to the grant according to the presumed intent of the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Where the administrators of an estate conveyed a piece of land from the estate that \u201cneither touched any public way, nor had appurtenant to it any such right to pass over the adjoining land of strangers to and from a public way as would secure to him the most beneficial enjoyment of his grant; they retained the locus in quo extending from the granted land to the public way. Here are all the requisite conditions for a way of necessity for all purposes over the reserved premises, there being no waiver by the grantee of his right to it.\u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>49 Conn. 71, 77 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The terms <em>easement of necessity </em>and <em>easement by implication </em>seem to have come together in an opinion written in the early part of the twentieth century. \u201cThe basis of this right is the presumption of a grant arising from the circumstances of the case. Necessity does not of itself create a right . . . but it is evidence of the grantor\u2019s intention to convey one, and raises an implication of a grant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>107 Conn. 32, 36, 139 A. 348 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In each of these early cases,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court imposed an easement of necessity where the grantor conveyed to the grantee \u201ca parcel inaccessible save over the lands of the grantor, or where the grantor retains an adjoining parcel which he can reach only through the lands conveyed to the <em>grantee.\u201dHollywyle Assn., Inc. v.Hollister, </em>164 Conn. 389, 398-99, 324 A.2d 247 (1973). Previously, this rule applied only where there was a unity of interest. Id., 399. Our Supreme Court, however, recently abro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>gated the unity of interest, or of title, doctrine<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in <em>Bolan </em>v. <em>Avalon Farms Property Owners Assn., Inc., </em>250 Conn. 135, 735 A.2d 798 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Here, the trial court made no finding that the defendants\u2019 and plaintiffs\u2019 lands were once held in common ownership, although evidence to that effect may have been presented at trial. The court did find that the Kuriansky land was landlocked by the unusual circumstances of the state\u2019s taking land to the south for the turnpike, the railroad tracks to the north and the natural disaster that destroyed the bridge over the Noroton River. The court also found that multiple local, state and federal agencies would have to approve replacement of the bridge and that there was no reasonable probability that the necessary approvals could be obtained. In addition, the court found that since the Lenox Avenue bridge was destroyed, many trucks used the right-of-way on a daily basis to reach a business operation or a pumping station on the Kuriansky land.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The court granted an easement of necessity over the right-of-way to the Kuriansky land, citing <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 107 Conn. 32. \u201cIt may be, however, that while access to the property is not absolutely cut off, the circumstances of the case are such that the means of access available would not afford the landowner any real beneficial enjoyment of his property. Such a situation would arise when the expense of making the means of access available would exceed the entire value of the property to which access was sought. Such a means of access would be no better than none at all and there would seem to be equal reason for presuming a grant under such circumstances as in the case where there was no access. Although there are cases which hold that the way must be one of strict necessity, the weight of authority supports what seems to us to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the better rule\u2014that the necessity need only be a reasonable one.\u201d Id., 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We agree that equity requires that the plaintiffs be permitted to use the right-of-way for the beneficial enjoyment of the Kuriansky land. For centuries, our law has held that no person shall be denied the beneficial enjoyment and use of land because it is not accessible. The plaintiffs did not create the situation that has made the Kuriansky land inaccessible. The court found that the residential development, as permitted by the Darien zoning laws, will not overburden the right-of-way and that in the recent past many trucks crossed the right-of-way on a daily basis to which the defendants apparently did not object. The court, therefore, properly granted the plaintiffs an easement over the right-of-way to the Kuriansky land.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The defendants also claim that the court failed to find that the plaintiffs had sustained their burden of proof as required by <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Occhionero, </em>239 Conn. 199, 681 A.2d 306 (1996). Specifically, the defendants claim that the plaintiffs failed to prove their chain of title free of encumbrances back to root title. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">We first observe that there does not appear to have been any dispute over the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the Kuriansky land at trial, as the defendants do not cite any pleading, exhibit or portion of the transcript in support of this claim. The plaintiffs\u2019 title is not in issue, and the easement granted to them by the trial court is not dependent on proving the absence or presence of encumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Branch </em>is misplaced because that case is factually distinct from the facts before us. In <em>Branch, </em>the defendants claimed a right-of-way over the Branch property by deed executed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>H. Pascal Beckwith in 1886. The deed reserved a right-of-way over the property to John Gardner. The Branch property separated two parcels of land belonging to Gardner. The defendants owned the parcel to the north, but none of the deeds in their chain of title made any reference to the right-of-way over the Branch property, and there was insufficient evidence to determine the dominant estate. Id., 201-203. No such situation exists in this case where the subject deed clearly identifies the dominant and servient estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-14\"> The defendants are Lucien Truskoski, Ernest Duhaime, Barbara Brown, Karen Park, Martha DiVincenzo, David Duhaime, John T.
