Butler filed a negligence action against Appellees in Louisiana state coiu\u2019t. After removing to federal court, Appellees moved for summary judgment. The district court granted this motion. Butler appeals the district court\u2019s decision, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-20\">On February 27, 2013, Roger D. Butler was working at a mill in Dequincy, Louisiana. Around 9:30 PM, he received a message from his supervisor instructing him to clear a board jam from a chipping machine. While clearing this board jam, he allegedly slipped and fell down a set of stairs, Butler alleges that the fall was caused by the presence of wood chips and other debris produced by the chipping machine, on the stairs. Butler suffered serious injuries as a result of the fall. He and his wife subsequently filed a negligence action against Appellees in state court. After removing to federal court, Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. They argued that they owed no duty to Butler because the presence of wood chips on the stairs was an \u201copen and obvious\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>hazard. The district court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees. The court concluded that Butler had not created a genuine dispute of fact as to the duty element of his claim because \u201c[t]he presence of debris on the stairs was open and obvious to all who would have encountered it.\u201d Butler timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201cWe review summary judgment de novo, using the same standards as the district court. Summary judgment is proper when \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 We view the evidence and all justifiable inferences in the light most favorable of the nonmov-ing party.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The parties agree that Louisiana law governs this diversity action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Louisiana law, \u201c[t]he owner of a building is not responsible for all injuries resulting from any risk posed by the building. Rather, the owner is only responsible for those injuries caused by a ruinous condition or defective component part that presents an unreasonable risk of harm to others.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Louisiana Supreme Court has \u201crecognized that defendants generally have no duty to protect against an open and obvious hazard. If the facts of a particular case show that the complained-of condition should be obvious to all, the condition may not be unreasonably dangerous, and the defendant may owe no duty to the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Butler alleges that the district court committed two errors in applying this doctrine: (1) the court improperly concluded that the wood chips were open and obvious <em>to all </em>on the basis of Butler\u2019s knowledge alone; and (2) the court failed to apply the risk-utility balancing test. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">In order for a defect to be \u201copen and obvious,\u201d it \u201cshould be apparent to all who encounter the dangerous condition,\u201d not just the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Louisiana Supreme Court has cautioned that this principle is \u201cnot a hollow maxim.\u201d To the contrary, \u201cit serves an invaluable function, preventing concepts such as assumption of the risk from infiltrating our jurisprudence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Butler argues that the district court contravened this rule by granting summary judgment \u201cdespite there being <em>no evidence whatsoever </em>that the wood chips on the stairs were a condition that was open and obvious\u201d to anyone save himself. He points to <em>Pitre v. Louisiana Tech University </em>\u2014 where several witnesses testified that they were aware of the alleged defect <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 as establishing the type of evidence that is needed to demonstrate that a defect is \u201copen and obvious\u201d <em>to all.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>We disagree with this interpretation of <em>Pitre. </em>Though the evidence in <em>Pitre </em>that others were aware of the alleged defect was <em>sufficient </em>to establish that it was \u201copen and obvious,\u201d this evidence was not <em>necessary </em>to establish that the alleged defect was \u201copen and obvious.\u201d As Appellees note, the Louisiana Supreme Court has relied upon the plaintiffs testimony or photographs of the scene to establish that a condition is \u201copen and obvious\u201d in several different cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case, Butler testified that he was aware of the wood chips and other debris on the stairs. Though this evidence of knowledge is not dispositive, it leads to the inference that the wood chips would have been \u201copen and obvious\u201d to others using the stairs. Appellees also offered a video of the incident that provides a clear view of the debris on the stairs. Butler contends that this video does not resolve whether the wood chips are \u201copen and obvious\u201d \u2014 and that we should allow a jury to decide this question. Nevertheless, we have reviewed the video and agree with Appellees that it establishes that the wood chips were so numerous and prominent that no reasonable juror could conclude that they were not \u201copen and obvious.\u201d With due regard for the role of the jury, we thus conclude that Appellees did not need to offer any additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Butler\u2019s second argument relies on the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Broussard v. State ex rel. Office of State </em>Buildings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Broussard, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court observed that \u201cwhether a defect presents an unreasonable risk of harm is a matter wed to the facts and must be determined in light of facts and circumstances of each particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, the court explained it has adopted a four-factor \u201crisk-utility balancing test\u201d in order \u201c[t]o aid the trier-of-fact in. making this unscientific, factual determination.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The fact-finder should consider whether the alleged defect is \u201copen and obvious\u201d as part of this test, but only as it relates to one of these four factors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Butler urges that the district court ignored this legal framework and granted summary judgment solely on the basis that the alleged defect is \u201copen and obvious.\u201d He argues that we should, at the very least, remand and order the application of the risk-utility balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The Louisiana Supreme Court, however, recently clarified that the application of the risk-utility balancing test is not necessary at the summary judgment stage. In <em>Allen v. Lockwood, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court granted review in order \u201cto provide much needed guidance to both the practitioners and the Judiciary of this State on the proper interpretation and application of our holding in Broussard.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Reviewing the proceedings below, the court explained that the lower court had failed to appreciate that <em>\u201cBroussard </em>was a three-day jury trial involving a fact-intensive determination as to whether the defect posed an unreasonable risk of harm or constituted an open and obvious defect.\u201d The court clarified that \u2014 given this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>text \u2014 its \u201ccomments under [the] discussion\u201d of the risk-utility balancing test in <em>Broussard </em>\u201cclearly pertained to cases that were tried either by judge or jury.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Turning back to the case under review, the court then concluded that summary judgment should be granted for the defendants because the \u201ccomplained-of condition ... was obvious and apparent to anyone who may potentially encounter it.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The district court did not err by following this guidance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">But even assuming the district court should have applied the risk-utility balancing test, there was no reversible error.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The, risk-utility balancing test requires \u201cconsideration of four pertinent factors: (1) the utility of the complained-of condition; (2) the likelihood and magnitude of harm, including the obviousness and apparentness of the condition; (3) the cost of preventing the harm; and (4) the nature of the plaintiffs activities in terms .of its social utility or whether it is dangerous by nature.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Butler argues that the utility of the complained-of condition, the cost of preventing the harm, and the nature of the plaintiffs activities all weigh in his favor. Nevertheless, even if this is true, the second factor is dispositive in this case. \u201c[W]hen-the risk is open and obvious to everyone, the probability of injury is low and the thing\u2019s utility may outweigh the risks caused by its defective condition.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The video submitted by Appellees establishes that the wood chips were \u201copen and obvious\u201d and posed a very low risk of injury.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the utility of the chipping machine and stairs outweighed any minimal risk posed by the wood chips.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The minimal risk of harm also limits the relevance of the other two factors.- Appellees may have been able to prevent the harm at a low cost, but a property owner does not necessarily need to expend any money to prevent a negligible risk of injury that can easily be avoided.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In the same vein, Butler\u2019s activity may have great social value, but a minimal risk of harm does not appreciably interfere with this activity. Butler may complain that this analysis is little different from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>district court\u2019s approach, but the Louisiana Supreme Court has instructed that one factor may often be determinative under the risk-utility balancing test.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, the Louisiana Supreme Court has concluded in several cases that the balancing \u201crevolve[d] around the second factor, namely, the substantial likelihood and magnitude of harm from the [defect], with consideration to whether the [defect] was apparent or obvious.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We conclude that this is true here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Based on the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
