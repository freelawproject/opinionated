He seeks automatic re-sentencing because the district court erroneously believed that it was constrained by our precedent to deny a cultural assimilation downward departure because of his extensive, violent criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">At sentencing, the district court conducted a thorough review of the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the relevant case law. The district court concluded that Jiminez\u2019s motion for a downward departure should be denied in light of his history of violent offenses. Contrary to Jiminez\u2019s assertion, however, the district court did not state that our prior precedent <em>prevented </em>it from granting the motion. Rather, it treated those cases as persuasive authority and concluded that a downward departure was not warranted in this case. The district court\u2019s denial was not \u201cbased on the mistaken belief that the court lacked discretion to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Garay, </em>235 F.3d 230, 232 (5th Cir.2000), Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision that a downward departure was unwarranted. <em>United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 612 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-20\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
