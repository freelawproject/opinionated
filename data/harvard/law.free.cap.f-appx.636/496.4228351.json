After the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied his benefits claim, he sought review from the. Appeals Council and submitted new evidence \u2014 specifically, the evaluations of Dr. Prince and Dr. Wilson, doctors who examined Clough after the ALJ denied his claims. On appeal, Clough argues that the Appeals Council erred when it refused to consider this new evidence. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">\u201cWith a few exceptions, the claimant is allowed to present new evidence at each stage of this administrative process,\u201d including before the Appeals Council. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.2007). The Appeals Council has the discretion not to review the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>See Keeton v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>21 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.1994). But the Appeals Council \u201cmust consider new, material, and chronologically relevant evidence\u201d that the claimant submits. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b), 416.1470(b). Whether evidence is \u201cnew, material, and chronologically relevant\u201d is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Washington v. Soc. Sec. Admin., Comm\u2019r, </em>806 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2015) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">New evidence is chronologically relevant if \u201cit relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b), 416.1470(b). The ALJ issued an order denying Clough benefits on June 15, 2012. The Appeals Council denied review, finding that both Dr. Prince\u2019s physical evaluation, dated August 31, 2012, and Dr. Wilson\u2019s psychological evaluation, dated September 5, 2012, concerned \u201ca later time\u201d than the ALJ\u2019s decision covered and thus were not chronologically relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">Examinations conducted after the ALJ\u2019s decision may still be chronologically relevant if they \u201crelate back to the period before the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>See Washington, </em>806 F.3d at 1323. In addition to conducting a physical examination, Dr. Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>relied on evidence of: (1) Clough\u2019s epilepsy \u201csince being a child\u201d; (2) his hip surgery in 2000 and a spinal injury in 2009; and (3) his last gainful employment in August 2009. All of these issues predate the ALJ\u2019s June 2012 determination. Dr. Wilson\u2019s opinions about Clough\u2019s cognitive limitations, borderline intelligence, and depression also relate to issues that manifested before the ALJ\u2019s decision. Even though neither doctor specified that his opinion applied to the time period before the ALJ\u2019s decision, we find that Dr. Wilson and Dr. Prince\u2019s evaluations were chronologically relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">However, we affirm the district court because Dr. Prince and Dr. Wilson\u2019s evaluations did not provide new, noncumulative evidence. <em>See Caulder v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 872, 877 (11th Cir.1986). Dr. Prince diagnosed Clough as suffering from \u201cmultiple fractures, epilepsy, grand mal seizure activity, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning.\u201d This diagnosis is consistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Clough had \u201csevere\u201d impairments that included epileptic seizures, multiple spinal fractures, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. In addition, Dr. Jack Bently, whose psychological evaluation was presented to the ALJ, estimated that Clough had borderline intellectual functioning. We note that Dr. Prince diagnosed Clough with \u201ctotal disability,\u201d which the ALJ did not. However, this diagnosis does not change our outcome because whether a claimant is disabled is not a medical opinion but rather a legal determination to be made by the SSA. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Clough argues that Dr. Wilson\u2019s psychological evaluation is new evidence \u201cshow[ing] a severity of depression.\u201d However, the ALJ already found that Clough had severe depression and incorporated a number of mental limitations into Clough\u2019s residual functional capacity assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Wilson\u2019s observations of Clough\u2019s appearance, mood, and mental capabilities were also largely cumulative of the observations made by Dr. Bently prior to the ALJ\u2019s decision. Since Dr. Prince and Dr. Wilson\u2019s evaluations do not provide new evidence, there is not a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that they \u201cwould change the administrative outcome.\u201d <em>Hyde v. Bowen, </em>823 F.2d 456, 459 (11th Cir.1987). We affirm the district court\u2019s order upholding the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\">.
