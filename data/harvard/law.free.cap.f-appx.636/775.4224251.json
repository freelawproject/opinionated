He contends that the district court \u201coffered no explanation whatsoever\u201d for the 3-year term of supervised release. He argues that because his case is ordinary it should be governed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) and that no need exists for the additional deterrent provided by supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">We review the district court\u2019s imposition of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir,2003). Where the defendant is an alien likely to be deported after imprisonment, the district court should not ordinarily impose a term of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). According to the application notes to \u00a7 5D1.1, the need to afford adequate deterrence and to protect the public ordinarily is adequately served by a new prosecution. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n. 5). However, the district court should consider imposing a term of supervised release where the court finds that it would \u201cprovide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Mendez-Perez\u2019s three-year supervised release sentence is reasonable. Mendez-Perez\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion because it offered \u201cno reason whatsoever\u201d for imposing a three-year term of supervised release is without basis. During the sentencing hearing, the court clearly considered Mendez-Perez\u2019s recidivism and the need to deter him from attempting to reenter the United States when imposing the supervised release sentence. In light of Mendez-Perez\u2019s multiple illegal reentries into the United States,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court reasonably concluded that this was an unordinary case that required an extra measure of deterrence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n. 5). Mendez-Perez\u2019s sentence is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-18\">. Mendez-Perez also received a prison term of 27 months. That term is not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-19\">.
