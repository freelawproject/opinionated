In 1995, Leonard was sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) after he was convicted for various drug-related offenses. He seeks relief from this sentence under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, Leonard argues his sentence is unlawful because, under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) does not apply to him and, consequently, the district court erred in refusing to grant him relief.However, under the present procedural posture, Leonard cannot challenge the original sentencing court\u2019s \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) decision. In addition, Leonard is not otherwise eligible for relief under Amendment 782. Therefore, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-24\">Section 3582(c)(2) only \u201cpermits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by\u201d the guideline amendment at issue. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). \u201cIn making [a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other [sentencing] decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Hence, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous [non-guidelines] resentencing issues such as\u201d whether the original sentencing court erred in applying \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) to Leon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>ard. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782. Moreover, Leonard is not otherwise eligible for relief under Amendment 782 because he \u201cwas sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-19\">. Leonard also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. We likewise affirm that denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
