The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Maxwell\u2019s sentence had already been reduced to the mandatory statutory minimum and no further reduction was authorized by law. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-22\">At Maxwell\u2019s original 2010 sentencing, the district court calculated an offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), and an advisory guidelines range of 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a 121-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-23\">In March 2015, the district court granted Maxwell\u2019s first <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 782, which reduced the base offense level for most drug offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 782. After Amendment 782, Maxwell\u2019s new offense level was 30 and his advisory guidelines range was 97 to 121 months. However, because Maxwell was subject to a 120-month statutory mandatory minimum, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>suant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B), Maxwell\u2019s advisory guidelines range became 120 to 121 months, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c). Thus, the district court imposed the mandatory minimum 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In May 2015; Maxwell filed <em>pro se </em>this second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 782, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court was not bound by the mandatory minimum sentence. The district court denied Maxwell\u2019s second \u00a7 3583(c)(2), explaining that it had already reduced Maxwell\u2019s sentence to the statutory minimum and was not authorized to reduce it any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The district court correctly concluded that Maxwell was not eligible for a further sentence reduction. Maxwell\u2019s 120-month sentence is at the mandatory minimum required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B). After Amendment 782, the 120-month mandatory minimum served as the floor for Maxwell\u2019s amended guidelines range, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2), and the district court did not have authority to sentence him to a term less than that amended guidelines range. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]hen the mandatory minimum exceeds some portion of the [guideline] range for the base offense level, the \u2018applicable guideline range\u2019 would be from that minimum to the upper end of the original guideline range.\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A), (B) (prohibiting the district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence under- \u00a7 3582(c)(2) below the amended guidelines range). This is true even after <em>Booker. See United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cEven after <em>Booker, </em>the district court is bound by the statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-24\">.
