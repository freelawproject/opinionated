Bivins appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment order dismissing her race and age discrimination claim under Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Because Bivins\u2019s various arguments on appeal are meritless and the district court correctly granted summary judgment, we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-24\">Bivins, a 63-year-old African-American woman, filed a charge of discrimination with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the Mississippi Regional Housing Authority VIII (MRHA), alleging race and age discrimination. She claims that she applied for five positions with MRHA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> yet was interviewed for none. Bivins alleges that her age and race were decisive factors in her failure to receive an interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-25\">MRHA moved for summary judgment, arguing not only that was there no evidence indicating discrimination, but also that Bivins had not actually applied for the positions. Alternatively, MRHA argued that Bivins\u2019s revoked broker\u2019s license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>would have provided a legitimate nondis-eriminatory ground to decline to interview Bivins even if her applications had been received and reviewed. The district court granted MRHA\u2019s summary motion and entered final judgment for MRHA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Bivins appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment, and also conclusorily argues that the district court abused its discretion by: (1) allowing her to be deposed in the magistrate judge\u2019s chambers; (2) allowing MRHA to refuse to answer questions during discovery; (3) allowing MRHA to avoid submitting a Notice of Appearance of Counsel; and (4) imposing a tax on her for an expert witness. Bivins does not present any legal authority in support of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Reed v. Neopost USA, Inc., </em>701 F.3d 434, 438 (5th Cir.2012). Although we apply less stringent standards to <em>pro se </em>litigants than to parties represented by counsel, <em>pro se </em>litigants are still expected to brief the issues and reasonably comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). An appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument, which in turn must contain her \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d and \u201cfor each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review.\u201d Fed. ,R.App. P. 28(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In arguing that the district court\u2019s summary judgment was improper, Bivins\u2019s brief does not provide \u201ceven the slightest identification of any error in [the district court\u2019s] legal analysis.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (affirming summary judgment where appellant had not meaningfully challenged the merits of the district court\u2019s ruling); <em>see also, e.g., Sheldon v. Smith Cty. Jail Med. Clinic, </em>439 Fed.Appx. 343, 344 (5th Cir.2011) (\u201c[W]hen an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that judgment.\u201d). In any event, we are not persuaded to disturb the district court\u2019s findings on the merits; Bivins has not produced summary judgment evidence to raise a fact issue as to whether she applied for or was qualified for the positions at issue, or to rebut MRHA\u2019s nondiscriminatory reasons for not hiring her. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Bivins\u2019s discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Bivins cites no legal authority in support of her remaining conclusory arguments, and they plainly lack merit. Bivins\u2019s challenge to the magistrate judge\u2019s actions regarding Bivins\u2019s deposition is not properly before us because she did not first raise it before the district court. <em>Singletary v. B.R.X., Inc., </em>828 F.2d 1135, 1137 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that challenge to magistrate judge\u2019s discovery ruling was not properly before court of appeals because \u201cpretrial matters referred by a trial, judge to a magistrate must be appealed first to the district court\u201d). The record forecloses Bivins\u2019s remaining claims: Bivins has not identified any instance in which the district court permitted MRHA to refuse to answer questions in discovery, and MRHA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>responded to Bivins\u2019s discovery requests; MRHA\u2019s counsel properly made their appearance at the time of their first filing in the district court; and the district court revised the bill of costs to exclude the expert expenses Bivins now challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of MRHA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-27\">. Bivins\u2019s motion to strike MRHA\u2019s brief is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-28\">. Bivins also applied for a job in 2010 with the MRHA, and was interviewed, but she was not hired. The 2010 application is not the subject of this lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">. The district court also ruled that even if summary judgment were not warranted, it would have granted MRHA\u2019s Rule 37 motion to dismiss, because Bivins had failed to obey the court\u2019s discovery orders and refused to answer numerous questions and because \"Plaintiff\u2019s actions and the tone and content of her pleadings throughout this litigation have been abusive towards both Defense counsel and the Magistrate Judge. Plaintiff has exhibited a clear record of contumacious conduct, which would warrant dismissal of her claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
