We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: whether the state court erred in denying Cordera\u2019s motion to suppress <em>un-Mirandized </em>statements made to the police while he was hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Cordera was taken to the hospital after the police found him in his bedroom lying next to a dead woman. He was holding a knife, his body was bloody, and he was not moving. An officer rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital, where an emergency room doctor treated him for extensive self-inflicted lacerations on both wrists. Cordera was responding to commands and did not appear to be in shock. Tests were negative for ingestion of alcohol or medication. The only medication he received was a tetanus shot (which would not have affected his mental abilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Two detectives interviewed Cordera in the emergency room that day. Although he appeared to be unconscious before the interview, he became alert when a nurse placed smelling salts under his nose. He was not given Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings. One of the detectives told Cordera that he was a homicide detective and that they were trying to figure out what happened to his wrists (they also told him that they had a search warrant for his home). They began asking him about his relationship with the victim and what had happened at his home that morning. Cordera was alert and able to answer their questions, but repeatedly maintained that he could not remember anything that happened after the victim arrived at his home that morning. He was never handcuffed or placed under arrest during the interview, which was recorded and lasted about 41 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Cordera was arrested several hours after the interview. He was indicted for first degree murder with a weapon, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 782.04(1) and 775.087(1). He moved to suppress the statements he made at the hospital, contending that he was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings because he was in custody and that his statements were involuntary. The state circuit court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">A jury found Cordera guilty and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He appealed his conviction and the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal affirmed without opinion (and denied his motion for rehearing and a written opinion). He then filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in federal district court, contending that the state court erred in denying his motion to suppress. The district court denied his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.2010). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) prohibits federal courts from granting habeas relief on claims previously adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless the state court decision: (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">\u201cClearly established federaUlaw\u201d refers \u201cto the holdings ... of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>592 F.3d at 1155 (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted). For a state court decision to be contrary to clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>lished federal law, it \u201cmust either (1) apply a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) reach a different result from the Supreme Court when faced with materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). A state court decision is an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law where the court \u201cunreasonably extends or fails to extend a clearly established legal principle to a new context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). A state court makes an unreasonable determination of the facts only where the petitioner rebuts \u201cthe presumption of correctness of a state court\u2019s factual findings by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Cordera first contends that the state court\u2019s determination that he was not under the influence of alcohol or medication was unreasonable. That contention is meritless. Although he claims that he had taken medication earlier that day, hospital tests were negative for alcohol or drugs. Because Cordera has not provided \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to rebut the \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d of the state court\u2019s factfinding, he cannot show that it was unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 1155-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Cordera\u2019s second contention is that his statements should have been suppressed because he was \u201cin custody\u201d when the detectives interviewed him and he therefore should have received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings are required only where there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him \u2018in custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 714, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977). To determine whether someone is \u201cin custody,\u201d we first look at the \u201ccircumstances surrounding the interrogation.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 465, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995). \u201cGiven those circumstances,\u201d we then consider whether a \u201creasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>California v. Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 3520, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Some facts do suggest that Cordera was in custody. For example, the detectives never told him that he was free to leave and he was brought to the hospital by an ambulance (instead of arriving on his own). <em>See Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 665, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 2150, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (noting that those or similar facts \u201cweigh in favor of the view\u201d that a suspect is in custody). But other facts \u201cweigh against a finding that [Cordera] was in custody.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 664, 124 S.Ct. at 2149. The police did not take him to the hospital (although an officer accompanied him in the ambulance), the detectives who interviewed him did not place him under arrest or threaten to do so, the interview lasted only 41 minutes, and he was not arrested until several hours after the interview. <em>See id. </em>at 664-65, 124 S.Ct. at 2149-50; <em>see also Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. at 714 (noting the fact that an interview lasted only 30 minutes in deciding that a suspect was not in custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Because there are enough facts going either way on the issue, \u201cfairminded jurists could disagree over whether [Cordera] was in custody.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>541 U.S. at 664, 124 S.Ct. at 2149. The state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See id. </em>at 665, 124 S.Ct. at 2150 (\u201cWe cannot grant relief [under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) ] ... by conducting our own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>independent inquiry into whether the state court was correct as a <em>de novo </em>matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Cordera\u2019s final contention is that his statements were involuntary. For a statement to be involuntary there must be \u201ccoercive police activity.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 522, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). We gauge volun-tariness \u201cin light of the totality of the circumstances\u201d to determine whether the statements were \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Haley, </em>317 F.3d 1245, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Cordera relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Beecher v. Alabama, </em>389 U.S. 35, 88 S.Ct. 189, 19 L.Ed.2d 35 (1967), and <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978), to argue that his statements were involuntary. In the <em>Beecher </em>case, the police obtained a confession from the defendant only after he was shot in the leg, two officers each pointed loaded guns toward his head, one of the officers threatened to kill him, and the other officer fired his rifle next to his ear. <em>Beecher, </em>389 U.S. at 36-37, 88 S.Ct. at 190. The defendant reaffirmed his confession in the prison hospital while in intense pain and heavily sedated from frequent morphine injections. <em>Id. </em>The police obtained a confession from the defendant in the <em>Min-cey </em>case while he was in the hospital with a gunshot wound, hooked up to various tubes to help him breath, receiving intravenous drugs, and unable to talk because of the tubes (he wrote down his responses). <em>Mincey, </em>437 U.S. at 396, 398-401, 98 S.Ct. at 2415-18. The defendant confessed only after the officer had interviewed him for four hours, ' even though he repeatedly asked the officer to stop the interrogation until he could get a lawyer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The facts surrounding Cordera\u2019s interview differ significantly from the facts of those cases. The detectives\u2019 conduct does not even begin to approach that of the officers in the <em>Beecher </em>case. The <em>Min-cey </em>case is also not on point. Cordera was alert and able to speak, he never asked for the interview to stop, and he never asked for a lawyer, The fact that he was depressed at the time of the interview is not enough, without more, to render his statements involuntary. <em>See Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 162-67, 107 S.Ct. at 519-22. Because the facts do not indicate that his statements were the product of \u201ccoercive police activity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 167, 107 S.Ct. at 522, the state court\u2019s decision that his statements were voluntary was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">. <em>Miranda v.
