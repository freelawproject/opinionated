After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b793-22\">In 1998, a federal grand jury charged Defendant with: (1) manufacturing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (\u201cCount 1\u201d); (2) possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201cCount 2\u201d), in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1); and (3) possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) (\u201cCount 3\u201d). Prior to trial, the Government filed a notice of en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>hancement based on Defendant\u2019s prior convictions pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). Defendant proceeded to trial and a jury convicted him on all three counts in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In anticipation of sentencing, the probation officer prepared Defendant\u2019s Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR indicated that Defendant was a. career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he had two prior convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. Because'the statutory maximum for at least one of the Defendant\u2019s present offenses was life imprisonment, Defendant\u2019s career offender status resulted in a base offense level of 37. Receiving no reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Defendant\u2019s total offense level was 37. Due to his numerous prior convictions and his career offender designation, the PSR assigned Defendant a criminal history category of VI. Based on a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, the PSR calculated Defendant\u2019s initial guideline range as 360 months to life. However, because the statutory mandatory minimum for Counts 1 and 2 was life, Defendant\u2019s guideline range for those counts was life imprisonment. As to Count 3, which carried a statutory maximum of 360 months, Defendant\u2019s guideline range was 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The district court sentenced Defendant to life imprisonment as to Counts 1 and 2, and 360 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 3, to run concurrently with each other. On appeal, we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In January 2015, Defendant filed a letter with the district court regarding his eligibility for a sentence reduction. The district court construed his letter as a motion for sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, and appointed the Office of the Federal Public Defender to represent Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The district court ultimately denied Defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that, as a career offender, Defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction. Defendant moved for reconsideration, which was denied by the district court. Defendant now appeals from that decision, arguing that he is eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. He contends that the district court improperly relied on his status as a career offender in finding that he was ineligible for relief because one of his predicate offenses was not a crime of violence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">When determining whether a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, a district court is to consider only the effect of the applicable guideline amendment, and all other original sentencing determinations are to remain the same. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that the alleged sentencing errors that the Defendant sought to correct were not affected by the applicable guideline amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>and were therefore outside the scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In order to be eligible for a sentence reduction, a defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, a district court may not use a guideline amendment to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence unless the amendment actually lowers the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). Moreover, in cases where a guideline amendment would lower a defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable guideline range, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion if the defendant\u2019s guideline range was based on a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1076-78 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Amendment 782 reduced the base offense level for most drug offenses by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782 (2014). Amendment 782 did not make any changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, not under the Drug Quantity Table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Moore, </em>we considered whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(e)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which like Amendment 782, lowered the \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine. 541 F.3d at 1325. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their applicable guideline ranges, which had been calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330; <em>see also United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent and that Amendment 750 did not lower the guideline range for career offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Defendant\u2019s total offense level and applicable guideline range were not based on the drug quantity offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, but instead were based on the career offender level in \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Defendant\u2019s guideline range was not based on the drug quantity guidelines, Amendment 782 did not lower the sentencing range upon which Defendant\u2019s sentence was based.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28, 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Defendant argues for the first time on appeal that his amended guideline range should be calculated without respect to his career offender designation given the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson. </em>We review sentencing challenges raised for the first time on appeal for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). But Defendant cannot show that the district court erred plainly, or otherwise, because the district court was only permitted to consider the effect of the guideline amendment and was required to leave all original sentencing determinations intact. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81; <em>see also Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683. In short, Defendant cannot challenge his career offender designation in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Accordingly, the district court committed no error in concluding that Defendant was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\">. Notwithstanding Defendant\u2019s career offender designation, Defendant would also be ineligible for a sentence reduction with respect to Counts 1 and 2 because his applicable guideline range was based on the statutory mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. <em>Li-berse, </em>688 F.3d at 1201. He would, however, be eligible for a sentence reduction as to Count 3 because his guideline range was not based on any statutory mandatory minimum sentence,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-14\">. Under plain error review, we will reverse where there is \"(1) an error (2) that is plain and (3) that has affected the defendant's substantial rights; and ... (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>v. Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir. 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
