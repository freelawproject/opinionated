Petrucelli\u2019s sentence was enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based on prior Florida convictions for burglary of a dwelling, aggravated assault, and aggravated fleeing and eluding! <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Petrucelli argues for the first time in his appellate brief \u2014 filed prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) \u2014 that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague, and he incorporates by reference the argument presented to the Supreme Court by the petitioner in <em>Johnson. </em>He also argues that he does not qualify for an ACCA enhancement because his burglary-of-a-dwelling and aggravated-assault convictions were not separate predicate violent felonies because they were charged as part of the same continuous criminal episode. Finally, he argues that his 180-month sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of mitigating evidence presented at sentencing. The government filed its response after the Supreme Court decided <em>Johnson </em>and concedes that the district court plainly erred in enhancing Petrucelli\u2019s sentence under the ACCA because his aggravated-fleeing-and-eluding conviction qualified as a predicate violent felony only under the invalidated residual clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a statute is unconstitutionally vague. <em>United States v. Duran, </em>596 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir.2010). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular offense is a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>286 F.3d 1324, 1325 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">We review sentencing errors that were not raised in the district court for plain error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>743 F.3d 826, 828 (11th Cir.2014).' To satisfy this standard, a defendant must show there is (1) error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">An intervening decision of this Court or the Supreme Court that is \u201csquarely on point\u201d can make an error plain. <em>United States v. Pielago, </em>135 F.3d 703, 711 (11th Cir.1998). Errors may also be plain if they are \u201cparticularly egregious, and strike at a core principle which the violated rule or law embodies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To show that an error affected his substantial rights, a defendant must show a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that he would have received a lighter sentence but for the error.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>743 F.3d at 830. To make this showing, the defendant \u201cmust point to something in the record showing that the most likely result on remand is for the sentencing judge to give him a shorter sentence than he originally received.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">Under the ACCA, a person convicted of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) who has three prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious' drug offense\u201d is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), The ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>punishable by imprisonment of more than one year that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another [the \u201celements clause\u201d]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives [the \u201cenumerated crimes clause\u201d], or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another [the \u201cresidual clause\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\"><em>Id, </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). A person who does not qualify for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA faces a 10-year maximum sentence for a \u00a7 922(g) conviction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Johnson, </em>576 U.S. at -, 135 S.Ct. at 2557-58. The Supreme Court did not call into question the remainder of the ACCA\u2019s definition of a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at-, 135 S.Ct. at 2563.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Upon review of the entire record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand for resentencing. Petrucelli has shown that the district court plainly erred in enhancing his sentence under the ACCA. Petrucelli\u2019s sentence would not have been enhanced but for his prior Florida aggravated-fleeing-and-eluding conviction, which was considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. The Supreme Court held in <em>Johnson </em>that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague, so this prior conviction cannot be considered a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Because he no longer qualifies for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA, Pe-trucelli has shown that this error affected his substantial rights. We therefore vacate Petrucelli\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing without the ACCA enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\">. Because Petrucelli does not qualify for a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA, we do not reach his two remaining arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
