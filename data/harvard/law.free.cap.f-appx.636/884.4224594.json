Duque filed this motion after his conviction was affirmed on appeal and the expiration of the time for seeking certiorari. Because the criminal proceedings were no longer pending, this motion was unauthorized and without a jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Because Duque was not challenging his sentence, his motion could not be construed as arising under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 or Fed.R.CrimP. 35. Moreover, it cannot be construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence because Duque has already filed one \u00a7 2255 motion that was addressed on the merits and a new motion would be subject to the jurisdictional bar of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-21\">Duque has thus \u201cappealed from the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court denying relief on Duque\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
