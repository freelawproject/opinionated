Marin appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Western District of Pennsylvania, which dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We will, affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In October 2011, Marin submitted to the District Court a lengthy complaint including \u201ccauses of action for conversion, fraud and deceit, assault and battery, section 1983 civil rights, interference with business, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, invasion of privacy, and wrongful death.\u201d Dist. Ct. Mem. Op. at 1. Along with his complaint, Marin filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). The docket does not reflect any activity until September 29, 2014, when the Court granted Marin\u2019s IFP motion, but also dismissed the complaint \u201cpursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for lack of jurisdiction, <em>forum non-conveniens, </em>and as otherwise based on fanciful allegations and indisputably meritless legal theory.\u201d Dist. Ct. Order at 1-2. The Court also stated that it found \u201cthat the action is vexatious and was filed for vindictive and obstructive purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Marin timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review of a district court decision dismissing a complaint as frivolous or for failure to state a claim. <em>Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 (3d Cir.1990); <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000), A complaint fails to state a claim if, accepting all well-pled factual allegations as true, the allegations do not \u201cplausibly give rise .to an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Bistrian v. Levi, </em>696 F.3d 352, 365 (3d Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 675, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). We may affirm a district court for any reason supported by the record. <em>Brightwell v. Lehman, </em>637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2011) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">We agree with the District Court that Marin\u2019s complaint \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\u201d because the District Court \u201clacks jurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d Dist. Ct. Mem. Op. at 9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Marin argues that, at least as to the libel claim, his complaint states a claim upon which relief could be granted. But even if we credit the allegations of his complaint, those allegations are insufficient to demonstrate that the nonresident Defendants \u201cmaintained systematic and continuous contacts with the forum state,\u201d <em>Kehm Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>537 F.3d 290, 300 (3d Cir.2008) (discussing general personal jurisdiction), or that they \u201cpurposefully directed [their] activities at a resident of the forum,\u201d <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Deutz AG, </em>270 F.3d 144, 150 (3d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted) (describing requirements for establishing specific personal jurisdiction). The complaint states that the Defendants, who are not Pennsylvania residents, published the allegedly defamatory statements in California and does not indicate that the Defendants were in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>involved in re-publishing the information in Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the lack of a connection between the Defendants and Pennsylvania, apparent from the face of the complaint, the District Court properly dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-13\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">. As explained below, we agree that the District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the Defendants. We note, however, that to the extent the District Court sought to dismiss the complaint for failure to prosecute, the dismissal would have been premature, as the complaint was not due to be served until the Court ruled on Marin's application to proceed IFP. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(3) (if plaintiff is granted privilege of proceeding IFP, District Court <em>must </em>enter an order \u201cthat service be made by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed by the court\u201d); <em>see also Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 195 (3d Cir.1990) (\u201cthe appropriate time to make a decision to dismiss a case pursuant to \u00a7 1915(d) [now \u00a7 1915(e)] is before service of a complaint\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\">. Given our holding, we have not examined Marin's other litigation to determine whether his current complaint is sufficiently repetitive and vexatious to warrant dismissal on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-14\">. Marin does not explain how any of his other counts have a connection with Pennsylvania.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b610-15\">. While a district court generally must give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend a complaint before dismissing it for failure to state a claim, opportunity to amend is not required if, as here, amendment would be futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002),</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
