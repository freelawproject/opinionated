Tillmon, appeals his 87-months\u2019 sentence imposed following his guilty plea to three counts of transporting a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1), and one count of soliciting a minor for a sex act, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). On appeal, Defendant contends that the first three counts of transporting child pornography involved only one victim \u2014 society in general \u2014 and that therefore the district court erred in refusing to group them for sentencing purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we follow the majority of circuits who have decided this issue and hold that the primary victims of these offenses were the multiple minors depicted and that therefore the district court did not err in refusing to group. Thus, we affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-17\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-18\">In June of 1998, Defendant engaged in a series of e-mail and \u201creal time\u201d conversations on the Internet with a person using the screen name \u201cTAMIJOANN.\u201d Defendant believed \u201cTAMIJOANN\u201d to be a fourteen year old girl, however, she was actually a government informant. During these conversations, Defendant repeatedly attempted to persuade \u201cTAMIJOANN\u201d to meet him in a motel room in order to engage in various sexual acts. In addition, on June 30, 1998, on three separate occasions, Defendant transmitted three different images of minors involved in sexually explicit conduct to \u201cTAMIJOANN\u201d via computer. Specifically, at 6:09 a.m., Defendant sent an image entitled \u201c10YOS-LUT.JPG\u201d that depicts a young prepubescent female having her genitalia penetrated by a white male adult subject. Then, at 6:10 a.m., Defendant sent an image labeled \u201c10YRWHOR.JPG.\u201d This is a compilation of seven pictures, five of which depict a prepubescent female having oral and anal sex with an adult male subject, one depicting the same prepubescent female displaying her genitalia while lying on top of an adult male, and one depicting two adult males and one prepubescent male urinating on the prepubescent female. Finally, at 6:14 a.m., Defendant sent an image entitled \u201c12YOFFUK.JPG\u201d which depicts a prepubescent female having sexual intercourse with a male subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-19\">After Defendant\u2019s guilty plea to all counts in the indictment, the probation officer filed a presentence report in which she recommended that the first three offenses not be grouped for the purposes of sentencing. After receiving that report, Defendant filed written objections, including an objection to the Probation Officer\u2019s failure to group the first three charges. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Defendant objected to the failure to group solely on the ground that \u201c[t]here are <em>no victims </em>under Counts One, Two and Three. All three counts ... involve the transmission of visual depictions of minors engaged in sexual activities. Contrary to what the Probation office states, the children depicted in the photos are not \u2018victims.\u2019 \u201d At the sentencing hearing, the court explicitly relied upon <em>United States v. Norris, </em>159 F.3d 926 (5th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 1153, 143 L.Ed.2d 219 (1999), in finding that the children in the photographs were the victims and therefore the counts should not be grouped. Consequently, the district court overruled Defendant\u2019s objection and sentenced him to concurrent terms of eighty-seven months\u2019 incarceration on each count. Defendant appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">\n<em>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In sentencing appeals, this Court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and reviews the application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Bagwell, </em>30 F.3d 1454, 1458 (11th Cir.1994). Further, this court views the district court\u2019s refusal to group multiple counts under United States Sentencing Guidelines section 3D1.2 with due deference. <em>United States v. Bonner, </em>85 F.3d 522, 525 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"A7i\">\n<em>III. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-17\">\n<em>A. Grouping Under the Sentencing Guidelines</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">Section 3D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that the first step in the process of determining the sentence of a defendant convicted of more than one count is for the court to group the counts of conviction into groups of \u201cClosely Related Counts\u201d pursuant to section 3D1.2. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 3D1.2, in turn, provides that all counts \u201cinvolving substantially the same harm\u201d shall be grouped together, and describes four situations in which counts are considered to involve substantially the same harm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Defendant relies on only the first situation described in subsection (a) of section 3D1.2. Specifically, subsection (a) of section 3D1.2 provides that counts involve substantially the same harm and should therefore be grouped \u201c[w]hen counts involve the same victim and the same act or transaction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a). In addition, the application note corresponding to this provision explains that the victim is the person \u201cdirectly and most seriously affected by the offense\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"And\">The term \u201cvictim\u201d is not intended to include indirect or secondary victims. Generally there will be one person who is directly and most seriously affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>by the offense and is therefore identifiable as the victim. For offenses in which there are no identifiable victims ... the \u201cvictim\u201d for the purposes of subsections (a) and (b) is the societal interest that is harmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Our task in this case, therefore, is to decide whether society was the primary victim of Defendant\u2019s offenses, or whether the minors depicted were the primary victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">\n<em>B. Primary Victim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AtR\">Although this Court has not addressed this precise issue, the majority of circuits that have faced the question have held that the minor depicted in child pornography is the primary victim of the offense for the purposes of grouping. <em>See United States v. Hibbler, </em>159 F.3d 233 (6th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 1278, 143 L.Ed.2d 372 (1999); <em>United States v. Norris, </em>159 F.3d 926 (5th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 1153, 143 L.Ed.2d 219 (1999); <em>United States v. Boos, </em>127 F.3d 1207 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Ketcham, </em>80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rugh, </em>968 F.2d 750 (8th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Specifically, these circuit courts concluded that the legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 made clear that the primary objective of the provision was to lessen the harm suffered by children. <em>See Hibbler, </em>159 F.3d at 237 (concluding that the legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 makes it clear that the primary victims are the children involved); <em>Boos, </em>127 F.3d at 1213 (relying upon both the Senate\u2019s statement in Rep. No. 95-438, at 14 (1978), that \u201c[o]f deep concern to the committee is the effect of child pornography ... on the children who become involved\u201d and the fact that the report refers to child pornography as a form of child abuse to find that children are the primary victims); <em>Ketcham, </em>80 F.3d at 793 (relying upon Senate Report 95^438 and the fact that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 was enacted as part of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act to find that the children depicted are the primary victims); <em>Rugh, </em>968 F.2d at 755 (same). We agree with this majority position. <em>See also Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990) (recognizing that children exploited in pornographic materials are the victims of child-pornography offenses); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>146 F.3d 1281, 1285 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that Congress amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 to include those who received and redistributed pornography without commercial motive because \u201cthe harm to the child exists regardless of the viewer\u2019s motivation\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 915, 142 L.Ed.2d 912 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">In urging a contrary conclusion, Defendant relies primarily upon the minority view expressed in <em>United States v. Toler, </em>901 F.2d 399 (4th Cir.1990). In <em>Toler, </em>the defendant was convicted of one count of interstate transportation of a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1) and two counts of interstate transportation of a minor with the intent to engage in prohibited sexual conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423. The Fourth Circuit also relied upon the legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 but concluded that while the primary victim of the transportation of a minor charge was the minor herself, the primary victim of the transportation of child pornography count was society in general. <em>Id. </em>at 403. Based upon the reasoning in <em>Toler, </em>Defendant argues that the primary victim of his three counts was society.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">As stated above, the majority of courts have expressly rejected the <em>Toler </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. Specifically, these courts concluded that while the Fourth Circuit was correct that the Senate Report noted the effect of child pornography on society\u2019s \u201cmoral fabric,\u201d the report as a whole made clear that the primary objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tive of the provision was to lessen the harm suffered by children. <em>See Boos, </em>127 F.3d at 1213; <em>Ketcham, </em>80 F.3d at 793; <em>Rugh, </em>968 F.2d at 755. As noted above, we agree with this reading of the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Defendant further contends that while the minor depicted was victimized when the photographs were taken, the interstate transportation of the photograph does not further harm that child. Rather, according to Defendant, such dissemination of the photograph primarily offends society\u2019s distaste for pornographic materials. As a result, Defendant asserts that the minors depicted were not \u201cdirectly and most seriously affected\u201d by his transmission of the pictures as required by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Like our sister circuits, we also reject Defendant\u2019s argument distinguishing between the victim of production of child pornography and the victim of the dissemination of the images. Although an argument can be made that the production of child pornography may be more immediately harmful to the child involved, the dissemination of that material certainly exacerbates that harm, not only by constituting a continuing invasion of privacy but by providing the very market that led to the creation of the images in the first place. <em>See Norris, </em>159 F.3d at 929; <em>Boos, </em>127 F.3d at 1211 n.1; <em>Ketcham, </em>80 F.3d at 793. Thus, the children depicted remain the primary victims not only when the pictures are taken or purchased, but also when they are subsequently transported or distributed from one person to another. As stated by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Norris, </em>\u201cthe victimization of the children involved does not end when the pornographer\u2019s camera is put away ... \u2018the pornography\u2019s continued existence causes the child victims continuing harm by haunting those children in future years.\u2019 \u201d <em>Norris, </em>159 F.3d at 930-31 <em>(citing Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 111, 110 S.Ct. 1691).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">\n<em>C. Identifiable Victim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">Defendant also asserts that there is no evidence from which the minors in the pictures involved here can be identified. Consequently, he argues that there is no \u201cidentifiable\u201d victim as discussed in the application note to Guidelines section 3D1.2. As a result, according to Defendant, the victim should be deemed to be society as a whole. We find this argument equally misguided. The application note is not properly interpreted as requiring that the victim actually be named. Rather, it is sufficient that a specific victim can be shown, whether or not the court knows that victim\u2019s actual identity. <em>See Kibbler, </em>159 F.3d at 237. In this case, the victims identified are the children portrayed in each of the three transmissions at issue, and that victimization is not diminished by the fact that the actual names of the minor victims are not known.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">\n<em>D. Number of Minors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">Defendant also appears to argue that some of the minors involved in the three transmissions charged could possibly be the same child, and therefore there may not be three different minor victims. At sentencing, however, Defendant objected to the failure to group solely on the ground that society was the primary victim of all three counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, because De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>fendant did not object on the ground that the minors were not three different individuals, we will review the question only if failure to do so would result in manifest injustice. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1102 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds, United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136, 1137 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>144 F.3d 1397 (11th Cir.1998). This Court equates manifest injustice with review for plain error. <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>998 F.2d 1571, 1579 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Paragraph fifty of the presentence report expressly states that the \u201cminor victim depicted is different in each count.\u201d At sentencing, the district court specifically stated that it adopted the factual statements contained in the presentence report. Defendant filed no written objection to that paragraph. At sentencing, Defendant\u2019s counsel initially conceded that the minors depicted were different individuals. After further thought, however, Defendant\u2019s counsel later stated that \u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can concede that they are three different individuals because we don\u2019t know when these photographs were taken.... These could have been taken at different times during the same child\u2019s \u2014 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Despite this statement at sentencing, Defendant has not presented any evidence to contest the district court\u2019s finding that the minor victims in each count were different. Thus, Defendant has not shown that a failure to review this point will result in a manifest injustice and we cannot say that the district court plainly erred in refusing to group the three counts based upon a finding of multiple victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>IV. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">For the purpose of sentencing pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines section 3D1.2 for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, we find that the primary identifiable victim of the transportation of child pornography is the minor depicted in the image. In addition, the district court did not plainly err in finding that the first three counts involved different individuals. Accordingly, the district court did not err in declining to group Defendant\u2019s three counts of transportation of child pornography for the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-13\">. The grouping of these offenses would lower Defendant\u2019s offense level, after adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, from 28 to 25. This would reduce his sentencing range from 87 to 108 months to a range of 63 to 78 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">.
