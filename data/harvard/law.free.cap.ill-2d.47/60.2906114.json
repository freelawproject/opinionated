On December 8, 1965, he was brought before the circuit court, accompanied by a court-appointed public defender, John J. McDonnell, who informed the court that the defendant desired to plead guilty to the charges against him. A stipulation of facts was filed, which disclosed that on September 16, 1965, a special employee of the Chicago Police Department bought .05 grams of heroin from defendant, using $15 in prerecorded funds.</p> <p id=\"b71-9\" pgmap=\"71\">The proceedings were short and are set forth verbatim as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b71-10\" pgmap=\"71\">\u201cMr. McDonnell : Judge, this is the defendant, Edward Moore, he is here in Indictment No. 65-2585 and 86, and on both indictments at this time, Your Honor\u2014 on Indictment No. 65-2586 Eddie is now withdrawing his plea of not guilty heretofore entered and entering a plea of guilty to possession of narcotics. Is that correct ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b71-11\" pgmap=\"71\">Defendant Moore : Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-2\" pgmap=\"72\">Mr. McDonnell : You are doing this freely and voluntarily ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-3\" pgmap=\"72\">Defendant Moore: Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-4\" pgmap=\"72\">Mr. McDonnell : And at this time he would like to state for the record he is completely satisfied with the representation he has received. Is that correct ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-5\" pgmap=\"72\">Defendant Moore: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-6\" pgmap=\"72\">Mr. McDonnell: Also, Judge, in 65-2585, the charge of unlawful sale of narcotics, at this time he wishes to withdraw the plea of not guilty heretofore entered and enter a plea of guilty, generally, to the charge and all lesser counts therein. Is that correct ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-7\" pgmap=\"72\">Defendant Moore: Yes, sir.'</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-8\" pgmap=\"72\">Mr. McDonnell : And are you completely satisfied with your representation at this time ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-9\" pgmap=\"72\">Defendant Moore: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-10\" pgmap=\"72\">The Court: Mr. Moore, your counsel advises me you wish to change your plea of not guilty in indictment No. 65-2582 [sic], which charges you with the possession of narcotic drugs. Is that correct?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-11\" pgmap=\"72\">Defendant Moore: Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-12\" pgmap=\"72\">Q. And when you plead guilty you automatically waive your right to a jury trial, you understand that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-13\" pgmap=\"72\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-14\" pgmap=\"72\">Q. Before accepting your plea of guilty it is my duty to advise you on your plea of guilty to this indictment which charges you with possession of narcotic drugs, the Court may sentence you for a term of years not less than two nor more than 10 in the Illinois State Penitentiary. Knowing that do you still persist in your plea of guilty ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-15\" pgmap=\"72\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b72-16\" pgmap=\"72(42) 73(26)\">The Court : Let the record show that the defendant has been advised of the consequences of his plea of guilty to this indictment and after being so advised persists in his plea, the plea therefore will be accepted and there will be a finding of guilty of possession, unlawful possession of narcotic drugs in manner and form as charged in this indictment and judgment on the finding.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-5\" pgmap=\"73\">Now, as to indictment No. 65-2585 which charges you with the unlawful sale of narcotic drugs, Mr. Moore, your counsel advises me you wish to change your plea of not guilty to a plea of guilty, generally, to the indictment. Is that correct?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-6\" pgmap=\"73\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-7\" pgmap=\"73\">Q. When you plead guilty, again I state to you, that you waive your right to a jury trial.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-8\" pgmap=\"73\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-9\" pgmap=\"73\">Q. Now, before accepting your plea of guilty to this indictment which charges you with unlawful sale of narcotic drugs the Court may sentence you to the Illinois State Penitentiary for a term of not less than 10 years nor more than life. Knowing that do you still persist in your plea of guilty?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-10\" pgmap=\"73\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-11\" pgmap=\"73\">The Court : Let the record show the defendant has been advised of the consequences of his plea of guilty to this indictment and after being so advised persists in his plea, the plea therefore will be accepted and we will reserve the finding until we have a hearing of the facts in the case so we may make a determination what the finding will be.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b73-12\" pgmap=\"73\">The Court : The Court will make a finding in connection with 65-2585, and on these facts will make a finding of guilty of possession of narcotics, the lesser included offense.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b73-13\" pgmap=\"73(55) 74(35)\">Defendant filed a pro se post-conviction petition, and his court-appointed attorney filed a supplemental petition and brief for post-conviction relief, alleging as constitutional issues that \u201cthe court had a duty to make a factual inquiry on the record as to whether the defendant entered his guilty plea voluntarily and with an understanding of both the nature of the charges and the consequences of the plea.\u201d He also asked \u201cwhether the court had a duty to inquire on the record as to the factual basis for the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b74-5\" pgmap=\"74\">The State filed a motion to dismiss and, after hearing on the motion, both the original and supplemental petitions were dismissed.</p> <p id=\"b74-6\" pgmap=\"74\">The basis for the defendant\u2019s position is that the record does not sufficiently disclose that he knowingly and voluntarily entered his guilty pleas. He contends that \u201cunless it appears in the record that the Court itself, or through the prosecutor, has made a rather detailed factual inquiry into the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s plea, such voluntariness cannot be constitutionally presumed.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b74-7\" pgmap=\"74\">Defendant relies principally upon cases which have developed in the United States Supreme Court since these pleas of guilty were accepted in 1965.</p> <p id=\"b74-8\" pgmap=\"74\">In the case of Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274, 89 S. Ct. 1709, decided June 2, 1969, it was held that the court should require a showing on the record that such Federal constitutional rights as the right to trial by jury, the right to confront one\u2019s accusers, and the right against compulsory self-incrimination are waived knowingly. The Boykin case followed closely after McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418, 89 S. Ct. 1166. In that case the court did not reach constitutional issues but based its decision upon an analysis of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which deals with a Federal judge\u2019s duty when accepting a plea of guilty. That rule, said the court, requires that a Federal judge address personal inquiries to a defendant \u201cto ascertain directly his understanding of the nature of the charge against him.\u201d This court has held in People v. Mims, 42 Ill.2d 441, 444, that the underlying reasons apply equally to Rule 401 of this court. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1967, ch. 110A, par. 401.</p> <p id=\"b74-9\" pgmap=\"74(11) 75(42)\">In the case of People v. Williams (1970), 44 Ill.2d 334, this court noted that McCarthy v. United States had been limited to prospective use in Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 23 L. Ed. 2d 16, 89 S. Ct. 1498, and held that Boykin v. Alabama should not be applied retroactively.</p> <p id=\"b75-5\" pgmap=\"75\">In the Williams case the procedure upon taking the plea of guilty and the court\u2019s admonition to the defendant as to the consequences of the plea were very similar and the court sustained the conviction and dismissed the post-conviction petition.</p> <p id=\"b75-6\" pgmap=\"75\">In Williams, the proceedings surrounding the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, a pre-Boykin plea, were as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"Ap\" pgmap=\"75\">\u201cThe Court : Is there a motion, counsel?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-7\" pgmap=\"75\">Mr. Cogan: Yes, Judge, in this indictment, I have spoken to my' client and he told me that he wishes to withdraw the plea of not guilty that was entered on the arraignment. and to enter a plea of guilty in manner and form as charged in the indictment. Is that right, Mr. Williams ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-8\" pgmap=\"75\">The Defendant : Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-9\" pgmap=\"75\">The Court : Now Mr. Williams, I want to be sure you understand. When you plead guilty to the charge of murder, the Court can sentence you to the penitentiary for not less than, fourteen years and it could be life imprisonment or could be death in the electric chair depending upon how aggravated the facts are. You understand that, the range of penalty provided by law?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-10\" pgmap=\"75\">The Defendant: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Ap7\" pgmap=\"75\">The Court : Understanding that, you desire to plead guilty ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-12\" pgmap=\"75\">The Defendant: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-13\" pgmap=\"75\">The Court: I take it then you are pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-14\" pgmap=\"75\">The Defendant : I am.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-15\" pgmap=\"75\">The Court : Very well. Let the plea be accepted and enter judgment on the plea.\u201d 44 Ill.2d at 337.</blockquote> <p id=\"b75-16\" pgmap=\"75(10) 76(33)\">The court then held that the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty was properly accepted and his petition for a post-conviction hearing properly dismissed by the circuit court. In the case at bar, the waiver of jury trial was pointed out to the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b76-5\" pgmap=\"76\">We are of the opinion that the record in the case at bar is sufficiently complete under pre-Boykin rules and under the Supreme Court Rule 26 then in effect. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, ch. no, par. 101.26.) It is also noted that the defendant here stated he was fully satisfied with his trial counsel.</p> <p id=\"b76-6\" pgmap=\"76\">The second point raised by the defendant, that there was no factual basis for the pleas of guilty, we think is without merit particularly in view of the stipulation of facts shown in the record, which clearly indicates that the defendant was guilty of the charges against him.</p> <p id=\"b76-7\" pgmap=\"76\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b76-8\" pgmap=\"76\">Mr. Justice Ward took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
