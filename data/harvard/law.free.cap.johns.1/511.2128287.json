This action can be maintained only by the person who has the possession in fact of file land.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\">THIS was an action of trespass, <em>quare clausum fregit. </em>1 <em>1 </em>. <em>J </em>\u00b0 The cause was tried at the <em>Washington </em>circuit, the 11th Jutte, 1806. On the trial the plaintiff proved that, in the year 1776 he was in the actual possession of the premises on \u2022 . which the trespass was <em>committed; </em>that the defendant entered on the land in question, and cut down, took and carried away, thirteen pine trees j that at the time of the trespass, one <em>Archibald </em>was in possession of the land, as a tenant under the plaintiff, to whose agent he paid rent. The counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground, that as the plaintiff was not in the actual possession of the premises, which were in the occupation of his tenant, at the time the trespass was committed, he could not maintain the present action. The objection was overruled by the judge, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-18\">A motion was now made to set aside the verdict for the misdirection of the judge.

The tenant or immediate occupier alone can maintain <em>trespass'; </em>the landlord or reversioner may have his action on the case for the injury done to the reversion, but not trespass.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The possession of the plaintiff must be entire and exclusive.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> A lessor cannot maintain trespass for an injury done to his trees.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> All the cases recognise this distinction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-20\">Crary, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7Vh\">The tenancy here was a tenancy at will, for as it is undefined, it must be presumed to be at will. The cases cited, were those where the tenants held leases. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>entitle a person to bring trespass, it is sufficient, if he have the constructive possession. The landlord may determine the estate at will, but if he does nothing to put an end to it, the possession of the tenant is construed to be the possession of the landlord.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The remedy by an action of xvaste, which the landlord has, is by virtue of the statute of <em>Gloucester. </em>He has no remedy against a tenant at will for trespass by a a stranger. In the case of <em>West </em>v. <em>Freude,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided, that the landlord might have either an action on the case, or <em>trespass </em>againt a tenant at will, or at sufferance, for spoiling the <em>premises; &amp; fortiori, </em>he ought to have an action of trespass against a stranger. A judgment obtained against another for the same injury would be a good plea in bar to this action. <footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> A lessee has only a special property in the trees growing on the land; and though he might maintain <em>trespass </em>for breaking his close, and spoiling his shade, he cannot for the <em>trees </em>themselves, for they belong to the landlord or reversioner.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-21\"> 3 <em>Woodeson, </em>193, 194.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b527-22\"> 1 Term, 430. <em>Stocks </em>v. <em>Booth </em>3 <em>Burrows, </em>1556, 1824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"Aco\"> <em>Ld.
