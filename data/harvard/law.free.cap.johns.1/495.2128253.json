Whereof 44 make a return,\u201d &amp;c? .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-9\">The line between these two ranges of lots was accordingly run pursuant to the <em>warrant; </em>and it was found, that the line before run, gave to. the \u25a0 lots in one tier about sixty-eight acres more than six hundred acres, while the lots in the other tier, fell so many acres short of six hundred. The new line of division run by the surveyor, Mr. <em>Annin, </em>according to the directions of the surveyor general, gave to the lots in each tier, a square of six hundred acres. It appeared in evidence,' on- comparison with the field book of the survey of the township of <em>Aurelius </em>in the clerk\u2019s office, that one of the distances run, exceeded the true distance, upon actual survey, above twelve chains.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-10\">The <em>patents </em>which were issued for the lots in question, did not describe them by any metes or bounds, courses or-distances of lines run, but described them generally, as known and distinguished on a map of the said township, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>'\u2022 filed by the surveyor-general in the office of the secretary 66 of- state agreeable to law.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-4\"><em>Emott </em>argued the case for the lessors of the plaintiff, and <em>Woodworth, </em>attorney general, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-5\">By the laws<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> referred to in the argument, it appears, that on the 28th <em>February, </em>1789, the commissioners of.the land-office were authorised to direct the surveyor-general to lay out certain lands, comprehending the premises in question, into townships of60,000 acres\" each, and these townships into one hundred lots each, and each lot to be as nearly square as possible, and to contain 600 acres each, and to be num\u201e ber\u00e9d in numerical order. One copy of such map was to be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and another in the office of the s\u00fcrveyor-gcneral. The lots were to be then balloted for, by the persons who were entitled to them.\u2014= And the surveyor-general was directed to run the <em>out-lines </em>of each township, at the expense of the state.,- and make a map thereof; and on the same map to subdivide the townships into lots of six hundred acres each, one copy of which map was to be filed in the secretary\u2019s office, and another in the office of the clerk of the county where the lands were situated ; and patents were to issue for each lot agreeably to such map on file in the secretary\u2019s office.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AgWT\"> <em>Greenleaf\u2019s </em>edition of the <em>Laws of N. </em>Y. vol. 2. p. 281. \u00a7 <em>1. \u00a7 </em>2. <em>\u00a7 3. \u00a7 5. \u00a7 7. </em>vol. 2. p. 332. \u00a7 2. \u00a7 3. \u00a7 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Au9f\">There is an evident mistake made by the* deputy-surveyor first employed to run the lines, and he was appointed without the consent of the parties. The map filed in the office of the secretary of state, and referred to in the patents for the lots, is correct and agreeable to law. The-defendant has got more land,-and the plaintiff less, than they ought to have had, by their respective patents. Nothing appears to have been done or\u00ed the part of the plaintiff, by which he is concluded as to his right to have this mistake corrected. We are, therefore, of opinion, that the plaintiff as entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AoQ\">Judgment for the plaintiff;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
