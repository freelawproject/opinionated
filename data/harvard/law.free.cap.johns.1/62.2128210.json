From the affidavits produced, it appeared, that, A. Hulbert, one of the defendants only, had been taken on the <em>capias ad- </em>respondendum, issued against both at -1 . . . _ u the suit of the plaintiff.

Though the general practice may be to issue a special execution in such cases, yet there was no necessity of inserting such special clause, as the directions of the act would be complied with, if such of the joint defendants as were taken and 'brought into court, on the <em>mesne </em>process, were alone taken in execution. The words, \u201c shall not issue or execute,\u201d used in the act, when taken in connexion with what followed, must be understood to mean no more than that the execution should not be executed against such defendants as were not brought into court, but the execution might be general and against all, according to the judgment.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AqT\"> Revised Laws, Vol. 1.
