The declaration stated, that whereas, &amp;c. the plaintiff had sued out of the court of common picas of the said county, before the judges, &amp;c. the said court then being held at Johnstown, <em>in said </em>county, a certain writ, &amp;c. It then stated the arrest and that the defendants became bail to the sheriff, and executed a bail-bond with a condition, that the defendant, Steevens, should appear <em>before the judges and assistant justices of the court of common </em>pleas, <em>to be held at the </em>court-house, <em>in </em>Johnstown, <em>on the second Tuesday in .June then next, </em>'fife, and then avers the breach, &amp;c. that the defendant did not appear, according to the exigency of the writ, and according to the form and effect of the condition of the said obligation, &amp;c.

As the statute prescribes the style of the court,, this ought to be strictly fol - lowed. The place appointed for holding the court,, is atibe court-house in <em>J ohnstown. </em>The bail-bond must be taken in the form of the writ, and if not pursuant to the form prescribed by the act, it is void. 2.- The allegation of the breach does not state that the defendant was to appear before <em>a </em>court, but merely to appear before the justices, \u00a1kc. The words \u201c according to the exigency of the writ,\u201d will not help this-defect- 3- There is not sufficient certainty as to the place ; it ought to have been averred that <em>Johnstown? </em>was in <em>Montgomery </em>County, for there are other towns, in different counties, of that name.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A75G\">Hildreth, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoUT\">The averment that the party was to appear before the justices, and at the place mention--d in the act- where the court was to be held, was sufficient. The defendant is bound to appear according to the exigency of the Writ.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The bail ought to look at the writ, to know for what lie undertakes. The bail-bond need not be precisely accurate and <em>formal; </em>it is sufficient if it substantially appear, in what suit, and at what place, the defendant is to appear.
