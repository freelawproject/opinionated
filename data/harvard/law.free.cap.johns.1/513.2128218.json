The defendant requested an adjournment, that he might procure two witnesses from the state of Vermont, to prove that he practised physic for more than two years before the 1st <em>March, 1797, </em>which was objected to, unless the defendant made the oath, and gave the security required by the 18th section of the act.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The justice proceeded to try the cause. It was proved that the defendant had administered medicine within six months before. The justice gave judgment for the penalty, in favour of the plaintiff, who prosecuted as well for himself, as for the people of the county of <em>Cayuga.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-5\"><em>W. Woods, </em>for the plaintiffin error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aut4\">1. The declaration is defective in not stating any time or place, and it does not negative any of the provisos in the act.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> 2. The justice proceeded to the trial of the cause, without granting the adjournment requested by the defendant, 3. The evidence docs not show any offence committed within the state, or that it was within the jurisdiction of the court. 4. The justice docs not adjudge that the defendant has been guilty of any offence, nor does he order one half of the penalty to be paid to the people of the county of <em>Cayuga.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-7\"><em>Gold, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A52B\">1. The authorities cited, relate only to <em>summary </em>convictions where a greater strictness is observed. 2. The evidence wanted was immaterial, and was to be obtained from <em>Vermont, </em>and was no good reason for the adjournment of the cause. 3. On the return, it appears that. the town of <em>Dry den </em>is stated to be in the county \u00f3f <em>Cayuga, </em>and when <em>Dry den </em>is referred to, it must be intended to be in that county. 4. The act is merely <em>directory </em>as it regards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the paying over the penalty, and it was not necessary that it should be so ordered in the judgment. It was not requisite for the plaintiff to negative any of the provisos. The defendant, by resting his defence on a practice for two years, negatived every other ground of defence.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b529-13\"> <em>Laws of N.
