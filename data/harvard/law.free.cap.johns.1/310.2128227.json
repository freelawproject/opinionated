According to the <em>English </em>practice, the certificate to stay proceedings amounts to an enlargment of the <em>four </em>day-rule <em>nisi. </em>If it were otherwise, the defendant would for ever preclude himself from making his motion, for a new trial, unless time were given by a special rule ; for that motion, according to the course of business, can never be brought on within the first four days; so that these special rules would be requisite in every case, and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>come rules of course ; and We may as well, at once, con- . , , <em>-nr \u25a0 </em>j. \u2022 sider the certificate for staying- proceedings, as amounting to an enlargement of the rule <em>nisi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AY3U\">EL B.
