The horse had been sold by Defreeze, as <em>executrix in her cmni </em>wrong, to Trumper, and the administrators of the estate of the intestate, afterwards, recovered the value of the horse ' j .. vsV of the vendee. Before the trial of that cause, <em>Trumper </em>gave notice to Defreeze, to come forward and defend the suit.

This rule is laid down in <em>the commentaries of Sir William </em>Blackstone, who says, <em>Vol </em>2, 451, \u201c that by the civil law, an implied warranty was annexed to every sale, in respect to the <em>title </em>of the vendor ; and so too in our law, a purchaser of goods and chattels may have a satisfaction from the seller, if he sells them as his own, and the title prove deficient, without any express warranty for that purpose. But with regard to the goodness.of the wares so purchased, the vendor is not bound to answer, unless he expressly warrants them to be sound and good, or unless he knew them to be otherwise, and hath used any art to disguise them, or unless they turn out to be different from what he represented them to the buyer.\u201d The present decision does not, therefore, interfere with that of <em>Seixas </em>v. <em>Woods; </em>(2 <em>Caines </em>48,<em>) </em>for the question in that c\u00e1se, arose upon the quality and not upon the title of the chattel sold, and the two cases are discriminated by the distinction taken by Blackstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
