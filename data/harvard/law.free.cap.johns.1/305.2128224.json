There did not appear to have been any carelessness to be imputed to the pilot, or the defendant, who was the master of the <em>Amphion. </em>The <em>Amphion </em>had made sail-from the wharf, bound up the river to pass through the sound, and had taken on board a branch-pilot to conduct her through <em>Hell-Gate. </em>The defendant was not on board at the time the accident happened,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-30\">\u2022 \u2022 The judge stated to the jury that he was inclined to belie ve, that as the master was not on board, and the <em>Amphion </em>. was under the direction and charge of the <em>pilot, </em>that no action could be maintained against the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-34\">The point of law was reserved, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs; but it was agreed that if the court should be of opinion, on the question of law, against the plaintiffs, then a judgment of nonsuit was to be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-35\"><em>W. Morton, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6G\">The only question in this case is, whether the <em>pilot </em>on board of a ship has such an entire and exclusive command, and direction of the ship, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the master is not to be responsible for any thing happening during the time the pilot is on board. Jacob, in his law-dictionary,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> defines <em>a pilot </em>to be a person, who has the government of the ship <em>under the </em>master.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> this be correct, and the master has any controul over 'the conduct of the pilot, he must be answerable'fot: his acts, and it makes no difference whether the master was on board or not.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-11\">Bogert, for the defendant.'</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amp\">Every man is answerable for-his own acts, or those of his agent. Here the pilot acted for the owner. The plaintiffs must look? either to the pilot, or the owner. The <em>pilot </em>has the entire controul and management of the ship, and is answerable for her safety, while on board ; he supersedes the master in the command. Here, in fact, the master was not on board, and the acts of the pilot, cannot, in any sense, be imputed to him. The master is an intermediate person, a middle man, against whom no action lies.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"> <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>edition, <em>Voc.
