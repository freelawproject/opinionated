It may be said, however, that <em>Jamaica </em>was a part of the British empire, and the stamp duty a matter of revenue. In that case, Ld. <em>Keny n </em>went no further than to say, that the note, not being stamped, could not be received in evidence <em>; </em>but that the party might, notwithstanding, recover on the <em>quantum </em>meruit, and awarded a new trial to give the plaintiff an opportunity of availing himself of that count.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">If a contract, on the face of it, appears to be valid, our courts will not undertake to enforce the <em>revenue laws </em>of a foreign country,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> by declaring it void.

If it were otherwise, it might well be said, that the parties never contemplated exacting the payment of this note in that country, and this would form a sufficient excuse here, for not adhering rigidly to a matter, extrinsic and formal as to the contract, though it might be necessary, in order to sustain an action in the courts of <em>France.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJV\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
