From the affidavit it appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that the rule for judgment was entered the 15th day of , 7 <em>May </em>last, and the judgment roll filed the 21st day of <em>June. </em>A recognizance of bail in error, had been duly entered into i.i <em>February </em>term last, and on the twenty-third day of <em>June </em>last, a writ of error was filed with the clerk of this court, and on the game day notice of the writ, and of the bail in error was served on the <em>agent </em>of attorney of the plaintiff, in <em>Albany ; </em>and a like notice was afterwards, on the 4th of July, served on the attorney himself, who resides in the county of <em>Washington. </em>The <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued the 26th day of June, on which the defendant was taken the 9th day of <em>July, </em>and imprisoned. It was contended, 1. That the writ of error was a <em>supersedeas </em>in this case, and the execution, therefore, irregular. Seel <em>Term, </em>279. <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Nixon.

The recognizance was entered into during <em>February </em>term, and as the statute requires the bail to be in double the amount recovered, he should have waited until the judgment was perfected. The bail here, xvas put in too soon, and could have no effect; a xvrit of error is a nullity unless bail be put in within 4 days after the allowance. 1 Term, 279. 2 Term, 44. 1 <em>Sel</em>lon, 578.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-13\"><em>Russel, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfD\">It xvas sufficient to give notice that , bail was put in, and it xvas not necessary to state before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>whom it was taken. The plaintiff, if dissatisfied, might have ... , i ,, \u201e , , . applied to the clerk\u2019s office, where the recognizance was filed. A writ of error may be brought before the judgment is entered up. Here the judgment has relation to the first day of <em>February </em>term, as will appear from the record.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AhdE\">The writ of error was a <em>supersedeas </em>to the execu\u00edion. A recognizance taken before a judge at his chimbers, is a sufficient compliance with t &gt;e directions of the act. Th iugh taken after the inquisition and before the rale for judgment, it is not vitiated. It was during the term, at which the inquisition was returned, and the motion made for judgment. The penalty was to the amount of the judgment, and the bail are estopped from gainsaying their recognizance. It will be deemed as taking effect fro n the judg neat. As the attorney of the plaintiff is supposed to have acted <em>bona fide, </em>we shall save him from the consequences of his act. The rule is, therefore, granted with the costs of this application, on condition that no action for false imprisonment be brought by fhe defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
