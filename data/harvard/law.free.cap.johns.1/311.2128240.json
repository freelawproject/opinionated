The present defendant and <em>Cunningham </em>were co-sureties for <em>James </em>Mavor, in the bond taken by the Surrogate, on granting administration to <em>Manor, </em>on the estate <em>o\u00ed Robert W. Hal-stead, </em>deceased. The bond is in the usual form, conditioned, among other things, to make and file an inventory of the goods, chattels and credits of the deceased, with the surrogate, within six months, in the manner prescribed <em>by </em>the act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The administrator neglected to file the inventory within the time, and the suit was brought for the breach of the condition. It appeared by the affidavit of the defendant, that <em>Manor </em>was absent from the state, and was expected to return soon ; and that <em>Cunningham </em>was not a creditor of <em>Halstead.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-11\"><em>Boyd, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhRL\">moved to set aside the proceedings in this cause. He said, that as the <em>relator, </em>Cunningham, was a co-surety with the defendant, no suit could be maintained by him,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> not even if he were a creditor. But the plaintiff is not a creditor. He merely swears that he is a creditor of <em>Halstead </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>of which firm he was a partner. If <em>Duncan </em>has interfered with any property belonging to Cunningham, he is liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>in a different action. The co-obligor cannot maintain an . - . . . , , . \u25a0, , action against his co-surety unless he has paia the money, and then only for a contribution. This is a vexatious suit. The bond is for fifteen thousand dollars, and tjie defendant has been held to bail to that amount.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-8\">Woods, contra.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-13\"><em> </em>Laws of N.
