The order recited that it was made on the complaint of the <em>poor-masters </em>of \u00a3fle town of Mamakating ; that the justices, \u201c after examining , . , \u201e \u201e , \u2019 , , \u201c the said Sarah, as well under oath as otherwise, could not \u201c discover that she had any legal settlement or place of resiu dence in any part of the world whatever ; that if suffered \u201c t0 remain she was likely to become chargeable to the town; tt and that the place she last came from was the town of . , , r \u201c Shawangunk.\u201d hromthis order the overseers of bhawanSunh appealed to the general sessions of the peace, by-whom it was confirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AB7\"><em>Fisk </em>ill behalf of the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD9\">now moved to quash the order. <em>\u00cd. </em>Because it was stated to have been made on the complaint of the <em>poor-masters </em>of the town of Mamakating, when no officers of that name are known in law, or authorised to make complaint. 2. Because it requires the overseers of the town of Shawangunk, to receive the pauper &amp;c. without <em>adjudging </em>that she was legally settled in that town.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acs\">1. He contended, that the justices were not authorised to remove any person unless upon complaint of the <em>overseers of the </em>poor, or from their own knowledge or belief, that sudi a person is likely to become chargeable ; and the grounds, or reason for such removal ought to appear in the order. The compa nt is a substantial part of the order, and it ought to be made by the persons designated by lav/for that pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>pose. Here it was done, on the complaint of poor-masters, and unless the court will intend that they are the <em>overseers of the poor, </em>this exception must be fatal. Laws of N. Y. Vol. 1, p. 530. \u00a7 7. <em>Rex. </em>v. <em>Hareby. </em>3 <em>Burn's Justice </em>566. 2 <em>Bott. </em>636. 2 Andrews, 361. \u201c The removal is bad if 44 it do not set forth any complaint made ; for the complaint 41 is the foundation of the justices\u2019 jurisdiction.\u201d In 2 <em>Salk. </em>482. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>inhabitants of Weston Rivers &amp;c. </em>it is said, 44 that a complaint from one not concerned, is nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-5\">2. The order merely <em>recites, </em>that the pauper had no place of legal settlement; and that she camelast from the town of <em>Shawangunk ; </em>but there is no express adj udication of the facts. The authorities on this point shew that there must be an adjudication, for want of which the courts-have uniformly quashed the order of removal. 1 <em>Burrows Set. Cases, </em>39, 76, 584. 2. <em>Bott's Poor </em>Laws, 643. <em>Bury </em>v. <em>Arundel, </em>645. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>647. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Weswood. Ufculm </em>v.

The justices are. to make one according to the nature of the case. The present is well enough, and the first exception is of no force, as the act allows the justices to remove, on any information, or on their own knewledge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-7\">As to the second exception, it may be said, that the order of removal may be made on two grounds, either on an adjudication of a <em>legal settlement </em>of the pauper, or as a <em>vagrant. </em>This order expressly declares, that the justices do not know where <em>Sarah Hide </em>had her legal settlement, hut directs her to be sent back to Shawangv.nk, <em>from whence she last came, </em>which are the words of the act. There is, therefore, a substantial and sufficient adjudication of the facts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-8\"><em>Fisk </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHs\">Whether it be an order of removal, or a <em>vagrant warrant,yet it </em>should contain an express adjudication. It must either adjudge the place ofthe pauper\u2019s legal settlement to be at S, or that she is likely to become chargeable, and that she last came from such a town. The making of the order or warrant, is a <em>judicial </em>act, and the adjudication should be set forth. It is the duty of the justices to h. nr, examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>mid <em>adjudge. </em>The law will not allow them to remove upon light or trivial cases ; their order should be clear, precise, and definite. The adjudication is the substance and basis of the order. It cannot be presumed, but must be distinctly This is not a mere travelling order or warrant, as it is called, for it directs the overseers of S, to receive and provide for the pauper ; such an order is directed to the constable of the next town, and so from him to the next. In either case, however, an adjudication is necessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ak6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AmA\">The justices may act on information obtained from any source, or on their own suspicion. The order of the two justices states, that they do not discover that the <em>pauper </em>had any legal settlement in this state ; and it expressly finds that <em>she came from Shatvangunk. </em>This is a sufficient adjudication of the fact, to authorise them to send her back \u2022to that town.</p>\n<p id=\"AUr\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
