Nevertheless, the said defendant, his affirmation; promise and assumpsit aforesaid, not re-* garding, &amp;c. hath not performed, &amp;c. and the plaintiff <em>avers </em>that the defendant, at the time, &amp;c. <em>Well </em>knew, that the obligor, &amp;c. was unable to pay \u00e1hd satisfy, &amp;c. The <em>second count </em>was for money had and received by the defendant to the' use of the plaintiff. To this declaration there was a <em>demurrer and joinder.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-7\">Emott, in support of the demurrer; contended that the counts in the declaration could not be joined. The first count was on. the <em>deceit\u25a0 </em>in the sale, for there was no <em>assumpsit </em>laid. Being therefore in <em>tortj </em>it required a plea of <em>not </em>gt\u00edilty, while the second count required a plea of <em>non-assumpsit. </em>Here he was stopped by the court, who desired to hear the other side.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-8\"><em>Gold, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq_\">\u2022 This mode of declaring is certainly anomalous ; but it has been allowed. .The count is on an <em>implied \u201cwarranty </em>in the sale, not on the deceit. An affirmation or representation, amounts to an implied warranty in law, for which <em>assumpsit </em>has of late years been allowed to be a <em>proper </em>mode of declaring; if so, the money count may be joined; and the general plea of non-assumpsit is sufficient.

You. cannot recover on a <em>parol </em>affirmation made at the time, on the ground of warranty.

It states further, that \u25a0 there was a written assignment which contains no warranty. The plaintiff therefore, could maintain an action only for the <em>deceit. </em>The first count requires a plea of <em>not </em>guilty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>and the <em>second, non-assumpsit. </em>Two causes of action, as <em>tort </em>and <em>assumpsit, </em>which require different pleas, cannot be joined. The demurrer is well taken, and the defendant is entitled to judgment; but the plaintiff has leave to amend his declaration on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">judgment for defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-5\"> <em>Ante, p. </em>414. <em>Mumford and others </em>v. <em>McPherson and others.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
