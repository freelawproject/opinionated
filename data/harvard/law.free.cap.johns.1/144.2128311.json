Error was brought on that judgment into this court, and the judgment was reversed and a restitution of the money, paid by the defendants below,was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-13\">On the judgment of reversal in this court, a <em>capias ad. satisfaciendum </em>was issued- against <em>Brewerton, </em>on which he was taken and remained in prison, until he was discharged by the act for giving relief in cases of insolvency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-14\">A new action was afterwards, <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>commenced in the same court of common pleas by <em>Brewerton, </em>against the same defendants, qn the same contract, and for the same cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>which the first action was brought and judgment obtained. In the second action, a verdict was found for the plaintiff for thirty-two dollars and six cents damages, on which a judgment was entered up for eighty-eight dollars and forty-five cents, damages and costs, which judgment remains unsatisfied..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-9\">Russell, in behalf of the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUAJ\">now moved to have the eighty dollars paid by them on the first judgment below, set off and deducted from the amount of the second judgment in the court of Common Pleas, and that the plaintiff there should not be allowed to receive more than the balance of eight dollars and forty-five cents, or, in other words, that the <em>judgment of reversal and restitution </em>in this court, should be set off against the judgment in the court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-10\">Shepard, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQz\">objected, that these were judgments in different courts,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and read an affidavit stating that the contract on which the first judgment was obtained in the court below, had been previously assigned by <em>W. </em>Brewer<em>ton </em>to <em>Cornelius V. </em>Brewerton, for a full and valuable consideration, and that the former had no interest whatever in the judgment. He observed, also, that the attorney' had a <em>lien </em>on the judgment for his costs, which could not be included in the set off. <em>Cole v.

Costs in one court have been allowed to be set off against costs in another court.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The parties are before this court, which has control of its suitors, and may see that justice is done between them. If no authority could be adduced exactly in point, still this court has an equitable power to extend the doctrine of set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>off. This case differs from that of <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>and the court ought not to protect the attorney as to his costs.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\"> It is supposed before his discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-15\"> <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Oldfield.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AFs\"> <em>2Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>29 <em>Hall v.

For this court to order <em>Brewerton </em>to deduct-eighty dollars from his last judgment below, and take out execution for eight dollars and forty-five cents only, would be, at least, an inconvenient interference with that judgment. Such an order could be enforced only by attachment.
