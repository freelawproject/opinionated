It was attempted, on the part of the plaintiff, to show that the discharge was void, on account of fraud. The fact alleged in proof of the fraud, was the stating, in their account to the judge, that the plaintiff was their <em>debtor, </em>when, in truth, he was a considerable <em>creditor </em>of the defendants. The proceedings took place, before the last revision of the laws, and the fact now alleged as a fraud, does not appear to be included among those which are declared to be fraudulent by the former act,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> so as to render the discharge void.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A-D\">A discharge tmder the <em>insol</em>\u00bfhr\u00e1vefastcT1 the facts set forth and cannot be avoided, except for the particular causes, or frauds specified in the statute-.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-9\"><em>D.

The maxim in this case is, <em>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. </em>It is true, that in the revised laws,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> a clause has been inserted which meets the present case; but this shows the opinion of the framers of this law, that the for-. ... , V1 ., mer act did not embrace a case like the present..</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\"> Greenleaf's edition of the Laws of N.

The fact now alleged is not one of those mentioned. The plaintiff should have contested this question before the judge, before the discharge was granted : he is nqw too late in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>objection, and is precluded by his own default, from con-<em>r </em>L v \u00cd . <em>A </em>testing the validity of the discharge on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"AxA0\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
