The greater part of the cargo was sold at <em>Santa Cruz ; </em>but not being <em>able to sell the </em>residue, the vessel proceeded <em>to St. Thomas, </em>where the remainder of the outward cargo was sold, and after taking in a homeward cargo, she set sail for <em>N\u00e9w-York. </em>The , , . . , , . . , vessel having encountered very heavy gales of wind, was so shattered as to be obliged to put into <em>Norfolk </em>to refit; and the present action was brought to recover the amount of repairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-25\">The plaintiff offered parol evidence to prove, that according to the understanding of merchants, and persons engaged in the <em>West-India </em>trade, the words in the policy, ft to <em>Barbadoes </em>and a market,\u201d gave a liberty <em>to </em>go from island to island, in the <em>West-Indies, </em>and- to sell a part <em>at </em>each, until the whole was disposed of. The counsel for the defendants objected to this evidence ; but the judge, considering the-word \u201c market,\u201d as one of doubtful signification, admitted the proof. Several merchants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>underwriters testified, that these words had been used in policies for many years, and that they always understood, and believed, and that it was generally so received among the merchants trading to the West-Indies, that they gave the liberty of going to all or any of the ports in the West-Indies, and to touch and trade, until a market was found for all the cargo. Some of the witnesses, however, thought the liberty extended no farther, than to one port beyond that named in the policy, or at least, that after having sold a part of the cargo at one island, the insured could not proceed to another, and be protected by the policy. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">A motion was now made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial. 1. Because, the <em>parol </em>evidence of the meaning of words in the policy, was not admissible. 2. If it was admissible, it was insufficient.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-8\"><em>D.

It was decided in 1794, that the words used in the policy, allowed the insured to go from port to port, until he found a market for his whole cargo ; but I do not recollect the name of the case at present.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-10\">Ilarison, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxG\">I do not recollect the case alluded to ; but I shall contend that <em>ex vi </em>termini, these words give the liberty to go to all or any of the ports in the West-Indies, until the whole cargo is sold. I should suppose, however, that it was peculiar to policies on voyages to the West-Indies, in reference to this particular course of trade.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-11\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A5mM\">By the words in the policy, <em>to Barbadocs and a </em>market, a vessel may <em>bona Jide </em>go from island to island, until her whole cargo is disposed of; but we do not mean to say, that the same construction is to be given to a policy, in any other trade than that to the <em>West-Indies, </em>Our opinion is, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment-</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
