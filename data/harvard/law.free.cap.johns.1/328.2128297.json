The notice given to the demand-ant\u2019s attorney, was merely that they had retained an attorney ; still they were bound to appear on the <em>quarto die </em>post, in <em>February </em>term. The object of the writ of <em>Grand, Cape, </em>is to give the tenant an opportunity of offering some legal excuse for not appearing. These <em>legal </em>excuses, are fixed and specific; they are enumerated in <em>Booth,\u00a7 </em>suchas want of summons, imprisonment, inundation, tempest, &amp;c. Common excuses are not sufficient. In this case, no legal excuse whatever is shewn. It is merely a neglect which would not avail in a common suit; and in this action the tenants are entitled to no particular favour.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-5\"><em>Colden </em>then offered pleas of <em>non summons.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>P.
