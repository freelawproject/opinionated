The rule should be for a return to the first <em>mandamus, </em>as in other cases, where a writ is not returned, a rule is obtained, requiring the person to whom it was directed, to return it in a certain time, or that an'-attachment issue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aj_\"><em>Emott </em>and <em>Ilarison </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqCn\">The alternative <em>mandamus </em>is like a rule to shew cause, and as copies have been duly served on all the parties, -and no cause shewn,-it is regular <em>to </em>issue a peremptory writ. A <em>mandamus </em>is not like ordinary process, nor governed by the same rules. It is a high prerogative writ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A-V\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AlR\">It is not requisite that we should go through \u25a0 the process and delay of rules and attachments, in order to compel a return to the first <em>mandamus. </em>The <em>alternative </em>in it, was intended for the benefit and.convenience of defendants. As the first writ has been regularly served, we may, at. our discretion, order a peremptory <em>mandamus; </em>but as the defendants may not have had a sufficient time to meet together and make their return, we are disposed to allow them a further day for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\">The counsel, thereupon, agreed on the 15th day of <em>April; </em>and the court ..ordered, that if the return was not made on that day, the <em>relator </em>might sue out a peremptory <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
