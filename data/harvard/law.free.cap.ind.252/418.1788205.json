On March 7, 1968, the trial court granted appellant\u2019s petition for permission to file a belated motion for a new trial. The belated motion for a new trial was then filed and claimed that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>did not have a fair trial for the following reasons: that he was forced into a trial without any opportunity to confer with his court-appointed counsel and without any time to secure witnesses in his defense. There are also other allegations with reference to the claim that the evidence was insufficient for a conviction, to which we need not give any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">At the hearing on the belated motion for a new trial the evidence was uncontradicted that the appellant was under a charge of assault and battery and carrying a deadly weapon and also under the present charge of arson. After his counsel was appointed by the court the appellant testified that the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cQ. Alright and then what happened ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cA. Well, he [the trial attorney] said I\u2019ll talk to you later. I\u2019ll come over and talk to you about it and I waited until October 19 and he never did come back, so the day of the trial he came back in the cell block back there. (Parenthesis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s the lock up here in the court room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">\u201cA. Yes, and he said are you ready to go to trial and I said \u2018On the assault and battery and drawing a deadly weapon, I am, because I had my witnesses, Bill Mooris and Burger Johnson.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">\u201cQ. Now, you stated you were ready for trial on the appeal cases from Municipal Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">\u201cQ. Assault and battery and concealing a weapon ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">\u201cA. Yes, because I asked him . . . told him to get a continuance on the arson until I can get my witnesses to establish where I was at that night and he said, \u2018Well, let me talk to Bill Synder,\u2019 who Bill Synder is I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">\u201cQ. The prosecuting attorney, is that who he is referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-15\">\u201cA. Well, I assumed that\u2019s who it might be, anyway he came back and said \u2018alright, we\u2019ll take care of half of it\u2019 and he brought me out of the courtroom told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>me . . . pointed to me to take a seat and him and the prosecutor got up and walked up in front of the Judge and they talked, what they talked about I didn\u2019t know and he come back and sit down and then summoned Laura Miles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201cQ. Do what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cA. They summoned Laura Miles to the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cQ. To the stand where you are sitting now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cQ. Alright, then what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">\u201cA. And started showing her some pictures and then I knew I was on trial for arson,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">\u201cQ. Then what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t know what to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">\u201cQ. What did you say to Laswell at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-13\">\u201cA. He wouldn\u2019t talk to me, I tried to whisper to him but he didn\u2019t turn around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">\u201cQ. So they tried you on the arson case while you at the present time thought that you were being tried for the appeal cases from Municipal Court, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-15\">\u201cA. I was supposed to be tried for the appeal cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-16\">\u201cQ. Did you have witnesses that you wanted to bring in as opinion to establish and incorporate your evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-17\">\u201cA. Yes, I did and I...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-18\">\u201cQ. How many?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-19\">\u201cA. About 8 or 9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-20\">\u201cQ. Did you give Mr. Laswell a list of those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-21\">\u201cA. Just before we came in the courtroom he asked me who they were and I told him that\u2019s when I told him that I wanted a continuance to get them and that\u2019s when he said you had one witness here and I said I want the rest of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-22\">\u201cQ. Did you confer with Mr. Laswell in the Marion County Jail while you were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-23\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u201cQ. How long were you over there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cQ. Six months, he didn\u2019t come to see you or talk about this arson case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u201cQ. Were you able to advise him to the facts related to this charge in order that he could properly present it to the court to establish your innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not until the day that I came over, the 19th, I wasn\u2019t able to and ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\u201cQ. Tell me...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">\u201cA. I asked ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">\u201cQ. Were you ever in law school ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">\u201cQ. You know anything about preparing your own case and defense in a matter of this type ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-15\">\u201cA. No, sir, I had a friend who was in the jail that knew a little law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-16\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You\u2019ve never had any law have you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-17\">\u201cA. No, I asked him to help me file a Writ of Alibi because I didn\u2019t have enough money. I had 50 some dollars in the bank and it wasn\u2019t enough to get a lawyer to do it and this inmate filed me a writ and he said he filed a writ of alibi and filed it in Criminal Court Two, sent it over at two o\u2019clock and it was sent back Friday denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-18\">\u201cQ. Were you advised of your rights to hear the case heard by jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-19\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-20\">\u201cQ. Was there a waiver, do you remember signing a waiver, a piece of paper waiving your right to trial by jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-21\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-22\">\u201cQ. Do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-23\">\u201cA. No, I never have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201cQ. Now, in yonr belated motion for new trial I understand that you alleged that the witnesses who testified against you that resulted in your conviction for six months in the Municipal Court were the same witnesses in this arson, is that correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cQ. And they have some hostility and hard feeling against you is that right? Prior to the time this happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s the status of those two cases now that you appealed from the Municipal Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">\"A. Well, assault and battery, Laura Miles put against me she said it happened at the first week and she waits till three or four weeks later to put a charge against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">\u201cQ. Is Laura Miles this same prosecuting witness that testified against you in the arson case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">\u201cQ. Did she alleged that the arson happened after the assault and battery case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-14\">\u201cQ. Would you say that this girl was bias and prejudice and under proper cross examination these facts would have been brought out to ... in order that the court might have known the interest of the witness in the outcome of that particular ligitation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, Under proper investigation I think they both would be tried for perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-16\">\u201cQ. You feel there should have been more investigation as to your defence in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-18\">\u201cQ. Did you know this Laura Miles prior to this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-19\">\u201cA. I\u2019ve known her since 1956 personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-20\">\u201cQ. Had she been a girl friend of yours at one time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-21\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u201cQ.' Just close friends is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cA. I went to school with her boys and then broke her son into the roofing business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201cQ. Now, you also led in this motion for a new trial, when all these things did happen you couldn\u2019t have form a specific intent to commit the offence because you were intoxicated at the time and some place else is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201cA. I was asleep at the Mahogany Bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\u201cQ. Was this brought out in the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I brought it out but it was stricken from the record because of my not having an attorney to file a motion for an alibi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">\u201cQ. So under the law in order to properly present it you would have had to have filed for you and in your behalf a notice of alibi on file?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">\u201cQ. Is that the reason you were unable to show you were elsewhere and in the condition that you stated at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">\u201cQ. Is this your first degree ... or first conviction on an arson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-16\">\u201cQ. Never been convicted of this before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-17\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-18\">\u201cQ. Do you think this matter should be re-heard and a new trial granted in the matters committed through a court or jury and an opportunity for you to summons your witnesses and subpoena them rather to have them here to establish your defence also you would like the opportunity to file your motion of alibi by proving you were some place else other than the place that they alleged that you were in the affidavit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-19\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-20\">\u201cQ. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-21\">\u201cA. -Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201cQ. And you feel that also because of the duties of a public defender in this court that you weren\u2019t given full time to present your case and to have all the facts brought forth in your defence, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cQ. You\u2019re not alleging in any way that Mr. Laswell was incompetent or what have you but you know that if he knew the circumstances and facts in this case you would have been able to establish your innocence, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201cQ. You may cross-examine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">MR. CONNER: No questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">MR. MANN: Nothing further, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">THE COURT: Step down, Mr. Wright, show the evidence heard and the matter taken under advisement. I\u2019ll rule on it promptly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACn\">There was no evidence offered by the state to contradict this testimony. The state did not see fit to call the court-appointed counsel of the defendant to in any fashion contradict the facts the defendant related. It appears therefore from the uncontradicted evidence in the record that the appellant was forced into a trial as a surprise, without warning and without an opportunity to consult his attorney, and his attorney failed to procure witnesses for his defense. It is quite evident from this uncontradicted evidence that regardless of the guilt or innocence of the appellant, he did not receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AKdb\">It is to be regretted that the state did not see fit to call counsel appointed to represent the defendant to rebut the charges of incompetency and neglect in the representation of the appellant. The attorney involved here should have had the opportunity to refute the charges. We have held in this state that an attorney may intervene in an action in which he is charged with personal misconduct to protect his reputation and any reflection upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>his integrity. <em>Dodd v. Reese </em>(1939), 216 Ind. 449, 24 N. E. 2d 995.</p>\n<p id=\"AT8\">We have said previously that we need not, in a case like this, draw an exact line between competency and incompetency of counsel in order to grant the defendant a fair trial. A defendant is entitled to more than a perfunctory representation. <em>Wilson v. State </em>(1943), 222 Ind. 63, 51 N. E. 2d 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In <em>Shack v. State </em>(1967), 249 Ind. 67, 231 N. E. 2d 36, 43, this Court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201cIn many cases it would be impossible for this Court to fix guidelines as to the requisite number of hours that an attorney should spend in preparation of the defense of a case. This Court has written on the subject of adequate preparation and adequate time for preparation, but we must conclude that each case stands on its own facts. However, see <em>Bradley v. State </em>(1949), 227 Ind. 131, 84 N. E. 2d 580, 582. <em>Lloyd v. State </em>(1960), 241 Ind. 192, 170 N. E. 2d 904. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">It is evident to us from the uncontradicted facts in this case that the appellant did not receive a fair trial because of failure of counsel to properly represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s belated motion for a new trial, and the court is directed to grant the belated motion for a new trial and grant the appellant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">DeBruler, C. J., and Hunter, Jackson and Givan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">NOTE.\u2014Reported in 249 N. E. 2d 33.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
