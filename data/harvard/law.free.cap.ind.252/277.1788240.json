Misconduct of the Jury, in this: Certain extraneous matters and improper evidence were received; interjected into; and considered by the Jury during the course of its deliberations to the prejudice of the Defendant, Richard Arthur Krivanek, all as is made clear by affidavits attached hereto and made a part hereof, and of which Juror misconduct this Defendant, as well as both of his counsel, were completely unaware until after the rendition of the verdict in this cause. Specifically, said prejudicial misconduct of the Jury consisted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">a) The following statement repeatedly made by Juror, Paul Auman, to Juror, Jane Zimmer, as well as to certain of his other fellow-Jurors, during the course of their deliberations, to-wit: \u2018Would you want a guy like that out in a year and a half? Why, he\u2019s been in jail six months now and they\u2019ll subtract that from the two years he would get. He could get out in a year and a half.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">b) This remark \u2014 repeatedly made by Juror, Fred Bock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to Juror, Jane Zimmer, and other of his fellow-Jurors, during the course of their deliberations, to-wit: \u2018Would you want a guy like that out in a year and a half? Why, he\u2019s been in jail six months now and they\u2019ll subtract that from the two years he would get. He could get out in a year and a half.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">c) The argument \u2014 repeatedly resorted to by Juror, Frank Soos, in his efforts to sway Juror, Jane Zimmer, as well as certain of his other fellow-jurors, to-wit: \u2018Would you want a guy like that out in a year and half? Why he\u2019s been in jail six months now and they\u2019ll subtract that from the two years he would get. He could get out in a year and a half.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">A Juror is \u2014 under his oath \u2014 duty bound to predicate his verdict solely upon the law and the evidence in the case \u2014 and upon absolutely nothing else. When he bases his verdict upon something besides the law and the evidence or persuades his fellow-jurors to do so, he flagrantly violates his solemn oath as a Juror and is guilty, indeed, of misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">d) The remark by the foreman of the Jury, Robert Towner, to Juror, Jane Zimmer and other of his fellow-jurors, during the course of their deliberations, to-wit: \u2018Listen, we\u2019re too intelligent to go in there as a hung jury.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">e) The promise made by the foreman of the Jury, Robert Towner, to Juror Jane Zimmer and other of his fellow-jurors, during the course of their deliberations, to reveal to them certain vital information concerning the family of the Accused, when he assured them: \u2018As soon as we come to a verdict, I\u2019ll tell you something else about that family (or sister).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">f) The extraneous, extremely prejudicial and highly improper information \u2014 information totally inadmissible in evidence \u2014 which the foreman of the Jury, Robert Towner, revealed to Juror Jane Zimmer and other of his fellow-jurors, during the course of their deliberations, to-wit: \u2018His sister was involved in a shooting several years ago and someone was shot (or killed).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">The aforementioned remarks made by the foreman of the Jury, Robert Towner, interjected into the Jury\u2019s deliberations certain extraneous and highly prejudicial matters which were clearly not admissible in evidence. His knowledge of this information and its subsequent revelation by him, to his fellow-jurors, unequivocally and unquestionably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>precluded him from serving as an impartial juror in said cause and \u2014 beyond all doubt \u2014 deprived the Defendant, Richard Arthur Krivanek, of his constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury comprised of twelve qualified jurors \u2014 a right guaranteed him by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as well as by Article I, Section 13 of the Constitution of the State of Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">g) The remark made by Juror, Mary Lou Spear, to Juror, Jane Zimmer and other of her fellow-jurors before the Jury returned its verdict in open Court, to-wit: \u2018You just watch him, he\u2019ll show his temper when he hears the verdict.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">These instances of juror misconduct were highly prejudicial to the Defendant, Richard Arthur Krivanek, and effectively deprived him of his constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury comprised of twelve qualified jurors\u2014 a right guaranteed him by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as well as by Article I, Section 13 of the Constitution of the State of Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">In compliance with the new rule which became effective on March 1, 1967, said Defendant, Richard Arthur Krivanek, has hereto, attached and made a part hereof, his Memorandum In Support of His Motion For a New Trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">WHEREFORE, the Defendant, Richard Arthur Krivanek, prays the Court to set aside the verdict and judgment thereon and grant a new trial of this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">/s/ Theodore E. Prekowitz /s/ SamMirkin Attorneys for Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">(T. 92-95)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">With the motion appellant also filed on March 21, 1967, an affidavit by juror Jane Zimmer, omitting formal parts, reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">(AFFIDAVIT OF JANE ZIMMER)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-13\">\u2018JANE ZIMMER, being first duly sworn upon her oath, deposes and says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-14\">That she was a Juror in the case entitled: State of Indiana v.

Why, he\u2019s been in jail six months now and they\u2019ll subtract that from two years he would get. He could get out in a year and a half.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">Affiant further states that \u2014 while she and her fellowjurorswere engaged in their deliberations and, at a point at which said affiant was the sole hold-out, said affiant informed her fellow-jurors as follows, \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is a hung jury.\u2019 At this point the foreman of said jury, Robert Towner, told the affiant: \u2018Listen, we\u2019re too intelligent to go in there as a Hung Jury.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">Affiant further states that, while she and her fellow-jurors were engaged in their deliberations and while said affiant was the sole hold-out, the foreman of said jury, Robert Towner, said to her: \u2018As soon as we come to a verdict, I\u2019ll tell you something else about that family or (sister).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">Affiant further states that she, subsequently agreed to the verdict and, thereupon, the foreman of said jury, Robert Towner, said to this affiant, as well as to the other jurors in the immediate vicinity, \u2018His sister was involved in a shooting several years ago and someone was shot or (killed).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">Affiant further states that \u2014 after she and her fellow-jurors had arrived at a verdict, but before the same was returned in open Court, one of her fellow-jurors, namely: Mary Lou Spear, said to this affiant: \u2018You just watch him, he\u2019ll show his temper when he hears the verdict.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">Further affiant saith not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">Dated at South Bend, Indiana, this 15th day of March, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">/s/ JANE ZIMMER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Subscribed and sworn to before me, a Notary Public in and for said County and State, this 15th day of March, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">/s/ THEODORE E.

Affiant further states that the extraneous and inherently prejudicial matter to which the foreman of the Jury, Robert Towner, referred and which he interjected into the deliberations of the Jury in the aforementioned case, concerns the shooting and killing of a member of a teenage gang which included three sisters of the Defendant and which slaying occurred on July 21, 1948, and is best described by the newspaper report of the same which appeared on the front page of the South Bend Tribune in its afternoon edition of Thursday, July 22, 1948, and is, herewith, from microfilm reproduced and attached hereto and made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">3.

That said newspaper story carried a picture of the aforementioned four teenagers \u2014 which picture does not clearly reproduce in the reproduction of the story \u2014 and that two of the aforementioned four teenagers, namely: Edith (Krivanek) Coleman and David Sigrist were witnesses in the Defendant\u2019s aforementioned trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">4.

The Court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on May 11,1967.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoJ\">Grounds 2 and 3 of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial are not before the court in this appeal for two reasons. First, appellant makes no attempt to illustrate how the evidence was insufficient or in what manner the jury\u2019s verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence. Appellant neglected to set out in the brief any of the evidence adduced at the trial. Second, appellant did not argue either ground 2 or 3. It is a long standing rule that, on appeal, it is incumbent upon the appellant to affirmatively show harmful error by both argument and citation of authorities, and f ailure to do so results in waiver of the alleged errors; <em>Wright v. State </em>(1958), 237 Ind. 593, 147 N. E. 2d 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">It is apparent appellant on appeal is relying on ground No. 4 of his motion for new trial, and the affidavits, including his own, attached thereto. We have, in view of the seriousness of the charge of which appellant was convicted, the fact that he received a life sentence and the reliance appellant places on said ground, set out in toto his motion for new trial and the memorandum in support thereof as well as the exhibits attached thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The crux of appellant\u2019s argument is that the interjection of extraneous and improper evidence by jury foreman Towner during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations was highly prejudicial to appellant, and should have resulted in the sustaining of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AMr\">With this we cannot agree. The revelation as to the alleged jury misconduct is the product of an affidavit by \u00e1 juror in which the juror attempts to impeach the verdict that she reached. However, it is well settled law that affidavits by jurors may not be received for the purpose of impeaching their verdict. <em>Widup v. State </em>(1967), 250 Ind. 1, 230 N. E. 2d 767; <em>Groover v. State </em>(1959), 239 Ind. 271, 156 N. E. 2d 307; <em>White v. State </em>(1955), 234 Ind. 193, 125 N. E. 2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"AXyP\">Even without the long established rule that a juror\u2019s affidavit will not be received to impeach his verdict, the affidavit in question is not sufficient to establish the jury misconduct and resulting prejudice of which the appellant complains. In order for the extraneous evidence interjected by juror Towner to have prejudiced the jury, it must appear that the evidence was interjected into the deliberations prior to the time the entire jury reached a verdict. It is obvious that if the information was divulged after the jury had reached its verdict, and not while the jury was deliberating, it could not have effected the verdict since the jury would not have known of the information prior to arriving at its verdict. From juror Zimmer\u2019s affidavit it is clear that she was the last juror to arrive at the verdict. It is also apparent from juror Zimmer\u2019s affidavit that the questionable information was not divulged until after she arrived at her verdict. Therefore, since she reached a verdict before hearing the information, the information could not have had any influence on the verdict she reached. Neither could the information have influenced the other jurors since it is clear that they, too, had arrived at their verdict prior to hearing the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Appellant cites <em>Hutchins v. State </em>(1894), 140 Ind. 78, 39 N. E. 243, for the proposition that the affidavit of a juror may be considered by the court in determining whether the accused was given a fair trial. However, the conduct complained of in <em>Hutchins </em>was that the jury foreman prevented free and open discussion by the jury of the merits of the case. Here there was no such stifling of debate, but, based on the affidavit, a vigorous exchange of opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Finally, appellant fails to show how juror Towner\u2019s information colored the verdict that he reached. The event of which juror Towner had knowledge did not involve appellant, but appellant\u2019s sister, and occurred approximately twenty years prior to trial. As was mentioned above, the affidavit clearly establishes that none of the other jurors knew of the information prior to reaching their verdicts, and thus it could not have influenced their verdicts. Further, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that juror Towner\u2019s knowledge in any way affected his verdict. On the contrary, there is juror Towner\u2019s statement during voir dire that he would attempt to be a fair and impartial juror in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Thus, we cannot say that appellant has presented us with such a case of jury misconduct as to deprive him of a fair and impartial trial by his peers. As was stated above, the law is clear and well established that a juror\u2019s affidavit cannot be used to impeach the jury\u2019s verdict, and appellant has failed to persuade us that the rule should not be applied to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We postponed discussion of ground 1 of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial until we had considered all of the allegations of ground 4 of such motion. Our reason for doing so was to eliminate the possibility that some one of the grounds set out at ground 4 would lend support to ground 1. Having thoroughly considered the motion for new trial we now find that ground 1 thereof presents no question on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>DeBruler, C.
