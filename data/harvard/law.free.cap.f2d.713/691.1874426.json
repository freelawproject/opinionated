On March 31, 1981, the EEOC issued a Notice of Right to Sue, sent by certified mail to Eldridge Law. This piece of certified mail was picked up at the post office on April 14, 1981 by Mr. Law\u2019s son, Chester, a seventeen year old high school student, at the request of his mother, Mr. Law\u2019s wife. Chester Law took the letter home and placed it on the kitchen table. Eldridge Law received the notice \u201cone or two days later.\u201d Law commenced suit on July 14, 1981, ninety-one days after the notice was signed for by his son. On defendant\u2019s motion, the district court entered summary judgment for the defendant based on the failure to comply with the ninety day deadline imposed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">On appeal Eldridge Law urges adoption of an actual receipt rule contending that his complaint is timely since he did not receive the notice until \u201cone or two days\u201d after it was picked up at the post office. In <em>Lewis v. Conners Steel Co., </em>673 F.2d 1240 (11th Cir.1982), we confronted the issue of the notice being sent to a possibly outdated address, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-16\">We need not embrace the doctrine of constructive receipt, nor close our eyes to the liberal construction the act is entitled to in order to fashion a fair and reasonable rule for the circumstances of this case. There is no reason why a plaintiff should enjoy a manipulable open-ended time extension which would render the statutory limitation meaningless. Plaintiff should be required to assume some minimum responsibility himself for an orderly and expeditious resolution of his dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 1242. In <em>Bell v. Eagle Motor Lines, </em>693 F.2d 1086 (11th Cir.1982), we were presented with a situation where the notice of right to sue letter was signed for by Bell\u2019s wife on December 18, 1979, but Bell claimed he was out of town and first learned of the letter on December 26,1979. \u201cApproaching the issue on a case by ease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>basis as we did in <em>Lewis,\u201d </em>we found that \u201cthe receipt of the EEOC notice by Bell\u2019s wife at his residence triggered the running of the 90 day period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">This case is not significantly distinguishable from <em>Bell. </em>Eldridge Law was living at home at the time of the receipt of the letter, which was picked up by his seventeen year old son and placed on the kitchen table. To allow additional time based on a claim that the letter was not actually received by Eldridge Law until \u201cone or two days later,\u201d would be to foster a \u201cmanipulable open-ended time extension which would render the statutory limitation meaningless.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>673 F.2d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We therefore agree with the district court that Law\u2019s Title VII claim is foreclosed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f) and the entry of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
