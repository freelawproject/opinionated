The appellant maintains that the state law exemptions protected by \u00a7 522(f) are limited to the equity owned by the debtor in the property. Additionally, the company suggests that the Georgia legislature intended to \u201copt out\u201d of the avoidance provisions contained in \u00a7 522(f). The district court carefully considered these same contentions and concluded that they were without merit. Agreeing with the district court, we adopt the pertinent part of that opinion, 27 B.R. 592 at 594, as our own and attach it hereto as an appendix. We add only that the appellant\u2019s arguments, which primarily question the soundness of the policy embodied in \u00a7 522(f), are more appropriately directed to the legislative branch rather than to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-19\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-20\">IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA ATLANTA DIVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-21\">IN RE: JOSEPH THOMAS MADDOX and MARY NELL MADDOX,</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-22\">Debtors :</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-23\">SOUTHERN DISCOUNT COMPANY, :</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-24\">Defendant-Appellant :</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-25\">: CIVIL NO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-26\">VERSUS : C-82-1535-A</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-27\">JOSEPH THOMAS MADDOX and :</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-28\">MARY NELL MADDOX,</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-29\">Plaintiffs-Appellees :</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-30\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"pA-p_\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-31\">\n<em>The Avoidance of Lien on Household Goods</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-32\">The appellant claims a security interest in certain of the appellees\u2019 household goods and furnishings which is greater than the equity value of these items. The appellant appeals from the bankruptcy judge\u2019s finding that appellees may avoid this interest under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"AyN\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-4\">(f) Notwithstanding any waiver of exemptions, the debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such a lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section, if such lien is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAFD\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-5\">(2) a non possessory, non purchase-money security interest in any\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-6\">(A) household furnishings, household goods, wearing apparel, [or] appliances, ... that are held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMX\">The apparent intent of this provision is to allow debtors to avoid security interests in some of the items which are described in subsection (b). This subsection, in part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-7\">... an individual debtor may exempt from property of the estate ...\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-8\">(1) property that is specified under subsection (d) of this section, unless the State law that is applicable to the debtor [on the date of the filing of the petition] specifically does not so authorize.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">Georgia chose to \u201copt out\u201d of the exemptions provided in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d) by providing that an individual debtor whose domicile is in Georgia \u201cis not authorized to apply or utilize and is hereby prohibited from applying or utilizing the provisions of 11 U.S.C. Section 522(d)....\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51-1601 (Harrison Supp.1981). The Georgia statutory scheme did not, however, deprive Georgia debtors of all exemptions which would have been allowed under subsection (d). Georgia law provides an alternative to subsection (d) which tracks that subsection, but changes certain provisions and lowers the dollar amount of some exemptions. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51-1301.1 (Harrison Supp.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">The Georgia exemptions provided as an alternative to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d) are available to an individual debtor seeking to avoid security interests through subsections (f) and (b). Subsection (b), which determines which items may be freed of security interests under subsection (f), also provides that \u201can individual debtor may exempt from property of the estate ... any property that is exempt under ... State or local law that is applicable on the date of filing of the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">One of the Georgia exemptions provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-13\">... [A]ny debtor who is a natural person may exempt ... for purposes of bankruptcy, the following property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAfeQ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMG_\">(4) The debtor\u2019s interest, not to exceed $200 in value in any particular item, in household furnishings, household goods, wearing apparel, [or] appliances ... that are held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor. The exemption of debtor\u2019s interest in the items contained in this subsection shall not exceed $3,500 in total value; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1175-15\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51-1301.1(a)(4) (Harrison Supp.1981). Except for the $3,500 limitation, which is not present in federal law, subsection (4) is identical to the corresponding federal provision at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(3), including the use of the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-16\">The appellant argues that the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest\u201d in Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51\u2014 1301.1(a)(4) includes only the debtor\u2019s equity in the property listed. The appellant argues that appellants have no \u201cinterest\u201d in the property because the amount of appel-lee\u2019s lien exceeds the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-17\">If the court were to adopt the interpretation urged by the appellant, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) would be a meaningless provision. The Georgia provision upon which the appellee bases his argument is identical in relevant part to the corresponding federal provision in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(3). If the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest\u201d in 11 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u00a7 522(d)(1) means only the debtor\u2019s equity, then a debtor could, under the federal scheme, avoid liens on property to the extent the property was free of liens. The result would be equally absurd if the court were to hold that a lien might be avoided unless the lien were greater than the value of the property. In that case the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest\u201d would mean the \u201cdebt- or\u2019s equity\u201d if the debtor had no equity but would mean the \u201cdebtors legal interest\u201d if the debtor had an equity interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">Congress evidenced its intent to make subdivision (d)(3) serve as the basis of the lien avoidance provision of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) by making the two provisions applicable to identical property interests of debtors. The appellee [sic] cannot reasonably argue that, by adopting the language of subdivision (d)(3) in Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51-1301.1(a)(4), the Georgia legislature evidenced its intent to \u201copt out\u201d of the lien avoidance provisions of subsection (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">The legislative history of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f), provides ample support for the bankruptcy judge\u2019s interpretation of that section.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-7\">[T]he bill gives the debtor certain rights not available under current law with respect to exempt property. The debtor may void any judicial lien on exempt property, and any nonpurchase money security interest in certain exempt property such as household goods. The first right allows the debtor to undo the actions of creditors that bring legal action against the debtor shortly before bankruptcy. Bankruptcy exists to provide relief for an overburdened debtor. If a creditor beats the debtor into court, the debtor is nevertheless entitled to his exemptions. The second right will be of more significance for the average consumer debtor. Frequently, creditors lending money to a consumer debtor take a security interest in all of the debtor\u2019s belongings, and obtain a waiver by the debtor of his exemptions. In most of these cases, the debtor is unaware of the consequences of the forms he signs. The creditor\u2019s experience provides him with a substantial advantage. If the debtor encounters financial difficulty, creditors often use threats of repossession of all of the debtor\u2019s household goods as a means of obtaining payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-9\">In fact, were the creditor to carry through on his threat and foreclose on the property, he would receive little, for household goods have little resale value. They are far more valuable to the creditor in the debtor\u2019s hands, for they provide a credible basis for the threat, because the replacement costs of the goods are generally high. Thus, creditors rarely repossess, and debtors, ignorant of the creditors\u2019 true intentions, are coerced into payments they simply cannot afford to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-10\">The exemption provision allows the debt- or, after bankruptcy has been filed, and creditor collection techniques have been stayed, to undo the consequences of a contract of adhesion, signed in ignorance, by permitting the invalidation of nonpur-chase money security interests in household goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95 Cong. 1st Sess. 127 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 5787, 6087-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-12\">The appellant argues that the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest\u201d as it appears in Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51 \u2014 1301.1(a)(4) must be interpreted to mean only the debtor\u2019s equity because it has such a meaning in other subsections of Section 51-1301.1, citing <em>In re Curry, </em>18 B.R. 358, 360 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ga.1982) and <em>In re Adams, </em>13 B.R. 281 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Ga.1981). <em>In re Curry </em>does not, however, hold that the term \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest\u201d means the \u201cdebtor\u2019s equity.\u201d The bankruptcy judge in that case ruled that a lien on the debtor\u2019s pickup truck could not be avoided because the truck was not a \u201ctool of the trade\u201d within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f). The bankruptcy judge did not address the meaning of the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The <em>Adams </em>case discusses the meaning of the term \u201cinterest\u201d in the context of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1), not in the context of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522. In fact, the <em>Adams </em>case shows that the term \u201cinterest,\u201d as used in the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 <em>et seq., </em>includes a variety of interests. (\u201cHere, both Bank and Trustee have respective intangible \u2018interests\u2019.\u201d 13 B.R. at 282.) 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) specifically refers to \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d This court must reject the appellant\u2019s narrow interpretation of the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s interest.\u201d The word \u201cinterest\u201d is a broad term encompassing many rights of a party, tangible, intangible, legal and equitable, and the court will not redefine the term to reach the result sought by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">The appellant also argues that this court should find in its favor on the basis of the reasoning in <em>Matter of McManus, </em>681 F.2d 353 (5th Cir.1982). In that case a Fifth Circuit panel held that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f) would not permit a Louisiana debt- or to avoid a chattel mortgage on household goods and furnishings because Louisiana \u201copted out\u201d of the exemption for such goods and furnishings subject to chattel mortgages. <em>Id. </em>at 357. <em>Matter of McMa-nus </em>is inapposite because Louisiana, unlike Georgia, enacted a specific provision to avoid the effects of subsection 522(f) <em>in addition to </em>\u201copting out\u201d of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-5\">Notwithstanding the provisions of R.S. 13:3881(2) and (4) to the contrary, a person who has granted a chattel mortgage on his property described in R.S. 13:3881(2) or (4) <em>may not thereafter claim an exemption </em>from the seizure of such mortgaged property for the enforcement of that mortgage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">LSA-R.S. 13:3885 (emphasis added). Even if the Georgia legislature had enacted such a provision this court might have chosen not to follow the <em>McManus </em>case. Judge Dyer, an Eleventh Circuit Judge sitting on the <em>McManus </em>panel by designation, dissented from the majority opinion. This court finds persuasive Judge Dyer\u2019s argument that the federal statute does not permit a state to \u201copt out\u201d of the lien avoidance provisions of \u00a7 522(f). \u201cAnd under the supremacy clause, United States Constitution, art. VI, cl. 2, any conflict between the state lien conservation provision and the federal lien avoidance provision must be constitutionally resolved in favor of federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">Accordingly, the order of the bankruptcy court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED this 16th day of February, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">/s/William C.
