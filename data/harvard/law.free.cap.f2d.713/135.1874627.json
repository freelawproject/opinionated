She bases her claim upon her analysis of Louisiana codal articles in the light of civilian methodology, contending that under the proper interpretation of Louisiana\u2019s civil-law-based Civil Code articles 2315 and 1934(3), this type of damages has always been recoverable. She contends that a recent 1982 amendment of article 2315 recognizing the right of spouses to sue for such type of non-pecuniary losses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was interpretative or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>remedial in effect, merely removing a bar that had been judicially created to this type of damages, which were always legislatively allowable under the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Despite the plaintiff\u2019s imaginative and persuasive contentions, we \u2014 Erie-bound to follow Louisiana jurisprudential interpretations as they are, not as academic scholars say they should have been \u2014 affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Despite the plaintiff\u2019s argument that civilian methodology commands a different result, a consistent and long-established line of Louisiana jurisprudence has refused, sometimes reluctantly but in deference to early high-court precedent, to recognize a cause of action for mental damage to persons other than the tort victim in nonfatal personal injury cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to the 1982 Louisiana amendment, Louisiana judicial interpretations have, consistently with this doctrine, denied a spouse\u2019s claim for loss of consortium resulting from non-fatal accidents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the absence of controlling Louisiana law to the contrary, we are Erie-bound to follow the consistently stated Louisiana jurisprudential rule insofar as it is applicable to her claim of injury resulting from the pre-1982-accident to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Nor are we persuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the 1982 amendment to article 2315 should be given retrospective effect as merely interpretative or curative, rather than as creating a new cause of action. This amendment (enacted subsequent to the collision but prior to the date on which the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action would have prescribed had it been viable), if applied retroactively, would permit the plaintiff to assert her cause of action for non-pecuniary damages. However, absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary (concededly not here present), Louisiana courts have granted only prospective application to legislative enactments that create a new cause of action or affect substantive rights. La.Civ.Code art. 8;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Rodriguez v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>410 So.2d 325, 328 (La.App. 4th Cir.1982); <em>Manuel v. Carolina Casualty Insurance Company, </em>136 So.2d 275, 279 (La.App. 3rd Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">As previously explained, no cause of action existed for loss of consortium in nonfatal injury cases prior to the effective date of the 1982 amendment. As reiterated by a Louisiana appellate court in <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>(citing many Louisiana decisions and, relying particularly upon <em>Manuel, supra, </em>which had rejected an argument, similar to the one made here, that an earlier amendment to Article 2315 was interpretive or remedial in nature rather than substantive),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">[t]his amendment creates a new cause of action, therefore, where none existed before. It is, accordingly, substantive and cannot be applied retroactively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7P\"><em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>410 So.2d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s suit inasmuch as no cause of action for loss of consortium existed under Louisiana law at the time of her husband\u2019s injury, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>because the 1982 amendment to article 2315, affecting substantive rights, may not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-13\">.
