The district court dismissed the complaint because of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust administrative remedies, 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 224.1(c)(5)(ii)(A) (1974), and because the delivery policy in question was constitutional. On appeal, plaintiffs concede the exhaustion issue, but assert that the district court erred in dismissing their suit without considering their claim under 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3661. Because of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust administrative remedies and the inapplicability of this statute to the instant case, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">Under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3661, before the Postal Service may implement any \u201cchange in the nature of postal services which will generally affect service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis,\u201d it must request the Postal Area Rate Commission to render an advisory opinion on the change, which may issue only after an opportunity for a public hearing. This Court analyzed the scope of section 3661 in <em>Buchanan v. United States Postal Service, </em>508 F.2d 259 (5th Cir. 1975), and held that three factors must coexist before this statute applies: (1) there must be a change in terms of a meaningful impact on services; (2) there must be an alteration in postal services; and (3) the change must affect service \u201con a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis.\u201d For at least one obvious reason, the requirements set forth in <em>Buchanan </em>are not met in this case. Nothing whatsoever in the complaint indicates that the change complained of affects service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis. Even reading plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in the broadest light as a class action encompassing all residents of townhomes and/or single family dwellings in Harris County, Texas, does not bring it within the requirement of a nationwide change.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Because the prerequisites to invoking the safeguards of section 3661 have not been satisfied, plaintiffs are not entitled to a public hearing under this statute. The order of the district court dismissing their complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"AeQ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
