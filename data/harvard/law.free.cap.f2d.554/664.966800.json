The district court has retained jurisdiction of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">However, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and we must dismiss. The district court's order of October 8,1975, remanding this case to the Board is not dispositive of this litigation, and is not a final order as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Nor may the district court\u2019s order be considered an interlocutory decision under either paragraphs (a) or (b) in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292. The order does not grant, continue, modify, refuse, or dissolve an injunction, and the district court has not certified the order to us as involving a controlling question of law about which there is difference of opinion. See <em>Pauls v. Secretary of Air Force, </em>1 Cir. 1972, 457 F.2d 294, 297-298.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
