Y., et al., </em>5th Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1440-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1440-12\">Plaintiff, Albert H. Carter, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983 action against defendant Telectron, Inc. Carter\u2019s complaint alleged that Telectron, Inc. unlawfully deprived him of his property when it succeeded in getting the court to set aside a final judgment of default rendered against it and in Carter\u2019s favor in the District Court of the 80th Judicial District of Harris County, Texas. The operative sentence of the court\u2019s order provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-13\">Therefore, since plaintiff\u2019s cause against the defendants is still pending in the District Court for the 80th Judicial District of Harris County, Texas, and since plaintiff has failed to allege either a cause of action against the defendants or demonstrate any loss he has suffered as the result of the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct, the Court finds that this case should be and the same is hereby DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIQN\">Carter does not seek a reversal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint but requests only that the instant case be remanded with instructions to indicate that the order is without prejudice. In the past, this court has granted similar requests. <em>E. g., Transit Casualty Co. v. Security Trust Co., </em>396 F.2d 803, <em>petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc denied, </em>399 F.2d 665 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1024, 89 S.Ct. 635, 21 L.Ed.2d 568 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-15\">The final sentence of Federal Rule Civil Procedure 41(b), which applies to involuntary dismissals of federal complaints, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-16\">Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1440-17\">Unlike the result in some situations, a failure to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, or 1985 \u201chas the effect of depriving federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction under [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3)].\u201d <em>Campbell v. Gadsden County District School Board, </em>534 F.2d 650, 653 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1976). As we noted in <em>Mann v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Co., </em>488 F.2d 75, 76 (5th Cir. 1973), \u201c[a] dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not a dismissal on the merits that makes the action <em>res judicata. . </em>Indeed the lack of jurisdiction renders the court powerless to make a decision on the merits. [Citation omitted.]\u201d Accordingly, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, <em>see Weissinger v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 795 (5th Cir. 1976), dismissal of a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983 complaint for failure to state a cause of action constitutes a dismissal \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d under the final sentence of rule 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-18\">The case is remanded to the district court with instructions to modify its order to show that it is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-19\">REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
