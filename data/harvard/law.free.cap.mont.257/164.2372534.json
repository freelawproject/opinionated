Phillips presiding. Appellants Charles and Eva Schaubel (the Schaubels) appeal from a directed verdict and denial of their motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">The Schaubels raise only the issue of whether the District Court erred in applying \u00a7 85-7-2212, MCA, in granting its directed verdict. However, because the Schaubels failed to specify as error and address an independent ground on which the District Court granted the directed verdict, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">The Schaubels sued Enoch and Olivia Iversen (the Iversens) on the theory that they were negligent regarding the overflow of a drainage ditch that runs approximately twenty-five to fifty feet from the Schaubels\u2019 residence and on the theory that they were operating a nuisance. According to the pre-trial order, whether the Iversens were negligent, and whether their negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of the Schaubels\u2019 damage was to be determined at trial. Also to be determined as an issue of law was whether \u00a7 85-7-2212(2), MCA, barred the Schaubels\u2019 claim. That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-15\">85-7-2212. Irrigation ditches - nonliabilities. An irrigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>district or private person or entity owning or operating irrigation ditches is not liable for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">(2) personal injury or property damage occurring on another\u2019s land and caused by water seepage that existed or began before the injured person first arrived on or obtained an interest in the land or before the damaged property was first placed on the land, if the seepage does not carry toxic chemicals onto the land;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">At the close of the Schaubels\u2019 case-in-chief the Iversens moved for a directed verdict. After lengthy discussion in chambers, the District Court granted this motion based on two reasons. The first reason was the defense provided by \u00a7 85-7-2212(2), MCA. The second reason was the Schaubels\u2019 failure to establish a duty or breach of any duty by the Iversens or to show that the Iversens\u2019 irrigation practices were different than would have been practiced by a reasonable person. The second reason amounts to failure to establish a prima facie case of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Schaubels raised only the application of \u00a7 85-2-2212(2), MCA, in their motion for a new trial, which the court denied after briefing and oral argument. They raised only that issue on appeal also. However, as the Iversens correctly point out in their brief to this Court, that was not the only basis on which the District Court granted their motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The issue of whether the District Court erred in determining that the Schaubels had failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence is not properly before this Court, as Rule 4(c), M.R.App.R, requires that the notice of appeal \u201cdesignate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from.\u201d <em>State v. Delap </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 346, 351, 772 P.2d 1268, 1271. Furthermore, because the Schaubels did not raise the issue or argue it in their brief, the issue is deemed waived and we need not address it. <em>Teesdale v. Anschutz Drilling Co. </em>(1960), 138 Mont. 427, 431, 357 P.2d 4, 7; <em>Hagerty v. Hall </em>(1959), 135 Mont. 276, 283, 340 P.2d 147,151; See also <em>Nutter v. Permian Corp. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 72, 727 P.2d 1338 (order denying sanctions would not be reversed where appellant filed no brief or transcript with this Court). \u201cThis Court will not endeavor to review a matter when appellant has directed no argument toward it.\u201d <em>Sands v. Nestegard </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 421, 428, 646 P.2d 1189, 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The Schaubels argue in their reply brief that the District Court did not specifically determine that they had failed to establish a prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>facie case; rather, the court\u2019s second enumerated reason also referred to \u00a7 85-7-2212, MCA, and not to another issue. The District Court specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">The other [reason for granting the motion for directed verdict] is I fail to find any evidence of any standard to establish the duty or any evidence of a breach of that duty to show that the irrigation practices were improper. There has been no evidence presented that the irrigation as practiced by the Iversens was not as would have [been] done by a reasonable person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Contrary to the Schaubels\u2019 argument, this statement is not unclear or ambivalent. It speaks directly to their failure to establish a prima facie case of negligence. There is no doubt that the court was speaking to this issue when its statement is viewed in light of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">1. The Schaubels sued on the theory of negligent irrigation practices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">2. The Iversens\u2019 answer denied negligence and affirmatively pled lack of proximate cause and contributory negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">3. The Iversens raised the issue of proximate cause in their motion for summary judgment and the Schaubels responded to that issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">4. The Iversens raised the issues of proximate cause and comparative negligence in their trial brief and the Schaubels squarely addressed negligence in their trial brief;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">5. The pretrial order specifically raised the issue of negligence as a matter to be decided at trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">6. The Iversens stated that their motion for a directed verdict was based on the arguments set forth in their trial brief and motion for summary judgment and specifically cited the Schaubels\u2019failure to establish proximate cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The record shows that negligence and whether the Schaubels could establish the elements were overriding issues in this case. Furthermore, a small sample of the arguments found in the transcript of the hearing on the motion for a directed verdict reveals that the argument focused mainly on the negligence issue and that the Schaubels\u2019 counsel clearly addressed that issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">MR. JOHNSON: [Schaubels\u2019 counsel] ... we have certainly established control on the part of the plaintiffs \u2014 excuse me, the defendants, and we\u2019ve certainly established causation. As a matter of fact, we\u2019ve established something a good deal more than negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>MR. KELLER: [Iversens\u2019 counsel]... There has been no proximate cause established between the 38.5-acre drainage and the building up of the silt as a proximate cause, a \u201cbut for\u201d example, in the ditch that backed up the water .... What there has been is testimony, uncontroverted, that the Bureau of Reclamation or the Board of Control has the duty of maintaining that drainage ditch.... There\u2019s been no evidence presented that there was any foreseeable consequence as a result of any actions. So I think that the proximate cause link is necessary for a finding of negligence. It is totally absent and something that warrants a granting of the motion for directed verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">THE COURT: ... I have absolutely no evidence that any of the practices of Iversens are negligent in their farming operation. I have no evidence that they used too much water. I have no evidence that the silt is not other than normal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t have any evidence that they have violated any standard of proper farming in terms of their operation in the irrigation that they\u2019ve done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">MR. JOHNSON: ... Now, surely it\u2019s for the jury to determine whether or not a failure to alleviate that problem with knowledge of it is negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We need not belabor the point any longer. The Schaubels\u2019 failure to allege error in this independent, sufficient, clearly articulated ground for granting the Iversens\u2019 motion for a directed verdict constitutes a waiver of that claim. As this is an independent ground on which the directed verdict can stand, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of the directed verdict and denial of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A1K\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER, McDONOUGH and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
