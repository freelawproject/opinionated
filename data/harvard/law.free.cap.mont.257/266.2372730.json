Loos against Jim Waldo, f7d/b/a Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar, and the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, Department of Labor and Industry (UEF). On appeal is a judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, finding that Gary Loos was an employee of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar and granting death benefits to Jan Loos.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The issues for our review are:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">1. Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in determining that Gary Loos was an employee of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar, rather than its proprietor.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">2. Whether the Workers\u2019Compensation Court erredin denying Jan Loos\u2019 costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">On September 28,1988, an armed robber shot and killed Gary Loos while Loos was working at Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar in Acton, Montana. His death left Jan Loos a widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Two weeks earlier, on September 14th, Waldo and Loos entered an oral lease agreement whereby Loos would purchase the liquor license and inventory of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar. They also agreed that Loos would lease the realty and the bar\u2019s equipment. Along with the inventory, Waldo gave Loos 790 dollars cash to cover payouts from the poker machines and generally run the bar. Loos had not paid for the inventory or made a lease payment before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Initially, Loos planned to get an advance from his trust fund to pay for the bar. When his plan fell through, he and Waldo agreed that he would pay Waldo for the inventory and liquor license out of the bar\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Waldo testified that he agreed to sell the liquor license to Loos for one dollar. Apparently, they planned to put the license in escrow and if Loos defaulted on the bar lease, the license and the bar would revert back to Waldo. The testimony indicates that the parties intended to draft a written lease agreement and formally transfer the liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>license in the near future. Yet when Loos died, the license was still in Waldo\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Before September 14th, Loos was a frequent patron of the bar, but did not work there. On that date, Loos and Waldo\u2019s wife took inventory of the bar\u2019s saleable items. Thereafter Loos operated the bar. He hired and paid employees, kept the books, paid the bills, contrived promotions, extended credit, received a share of the poker machine profits, and kept the profits of the bar. Because the business was changing hands, meter readings were taken on the electric meter, propane tank, poker machines and keno machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Loos\u2019name was added to the checking account. Waldo relinquished control over the bar keys and check book to Loos. Waldo\u2019s name remained on the account, but Loos wrote all the checks between September 14th and the date of his death. During that time, the creditors sent the bills to Loos rather than Waldo.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">After September 14th, Loos represented to friends and business associates that he had leased the bar from Waldo. He told the Coca-Cola distributor that he had leased the bar and would assume responsibility for all future bills. He borrowed shot glasses from another bar for his grand opening. He told the vending machine repair person that he had leased the bar and would be in charge of vending machine matters. In addition, Jan Loos told a bank officer that she and her husband were leasing the bar from Waldo.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On the other hand, Waldo told a State Compensation Insurance Fund field investigator that Loos had attempted to buy the bar, but had been unsuccessful so Loos was managing the bar instead. The field investigator had preconceived that Loos was an employee before the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Law enforcement officers examined the scene after Loos\u2019 death and found 1,255 dollars cash remaining in the bar. Waldo testified that he kept the money to pay Loos\u2019 bills and that he gave the remaining money to Jan Loos.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The bar closed following Loos\u2019 death. A few days later, Waldo resumed operating the bar and paid Loos\u2019 business creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">A claims examiner from the compliance bureau of UEF investigated to determine whether Waldo owed any fines or penalties for not having worker\u2019s compensation insurance on Loos. She concluded that Waldo did not owe anything because there was no evidence that Loos was an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">After Loos\u2019 death, Jan Loos submitted a claim for workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. In November 1988, the UEF denied her benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>on the grounds that her husband was not an employee at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Jan Loos then requested administrative review of the UEF\u2019s decision. After a contested hearing, a hearing examiner from the Department of Labor and Industry denied Jan Loos\u2019 claim, holding that Loos was not an employee at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On October 9,1990, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court reversed and dismissed the hearing examiner\u2019s order. The court stated that the Department did not have jurisdiction over the issue. Jan Loos\u2019 attorneys then filed a request for mediation. After a mediation conference, the workers\u2019 compensation mediator filed a recommendation and report stating that Loos was not an employee at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Jan Loos then filed a petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. The court held that upon his death Loos was an employee of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar, thus Jan Loos was entitled to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits. The court also held that Jan Loos was not entitled to attorney fees because the insurer did not act unreasonably in denying coverage. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in determining that Loos was an employee of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar, rather than its proprietor?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">This issue presents questions of both law and fact. Where the parties challenge both factual determinations and legal conclusions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, two different standards of review apply. <em>Doig v. Graveley </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 59, 61, 809 P.2d 12, 13. We defer to the fact finder where substantial credible evidence exists to support the court\u2019s factual determinations. However, where we face an issue that raises only a question of law, we are free to determine whether the court was correct in its conclusions. <em>Doig, </em>809 P.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Waldo and UEF contend that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred by exclusively using the statutory independent contractor test in determining that Loos was an employee rather than a proprietor. This issue presents solely an issue of law, so we draw our own conclusions as to whether the court was correct. See <em>Doig, </em>809 P.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act generally does not cover a person who is a sole proprietor or a working partner. Section 39-71-401(2)(d), (3)(a), MCA. There is no statutory definition of sole proprietor.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>In determining that Loos was an employee, the court used the independent contractor test by analogy, because there is no test to determine whether a person is a sole proprietor. Cf. \u00a7 39-71-120(1), MCA, (elements necessary for independent contractor status); <em>Sharp v. Hoerner Waldorf Corp. </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 419, 424, 584 P.2d 1298, 1301-02, (four factors used to determine freedom from an employer\u2019s control).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The court did not balance the freedom from control factors, rather it strictly adhered to the statute and case law delineating the independent contractor test. Under the statute, a person who performs services for remuneration is an employee, unless that person meets the elements of an independent contractor. See \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA. The case law holds that a finding of independent contractor status requires a convincing accumulation of the freedom from control factors and the statutory elements. See, e.g., <em>Sharp, </em>584 P.2d at 1302. In contrast, employee status \u201ccan if necessary often be solidly proved on the strength of one of the four [freedom from control factors].\u201d See, e.g., <em>Sharp, </em>584 P.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The court concluded that it was bound by the constraints of the independent contractor test. We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err by exclusively using the independent contractor test in determining that Loos was an employee rather than a sole proprietor.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In ruling on a related issue, the court found that Waldo did not sell the bar to Loos and did not intend to sell it. Waldo and UEF contend that the court\u2019s finding was erroneous. Because the issue presents a question of fact, we will uphold the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision if substantial credible evidence supports it. <em>SeeDoig, </em>809 P.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Waldo originally thought that Loos would purchase the inventory items on a cash basis. They did not enter into any written agreements. Waldo testified that because Loos could not acquire the necessary cash, they agreed Loos would make payments on the inventory along with lease payments on the building and equipment. They did not set a price, however, and Loos did not pay for the inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Waldo owned the liquor license which permitted the sale of alcohol on the premises of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar. He neither applied with the Department of Revenue to transfer the license, nor assigned the license to Loos. Further, Loos did not apply for temporary authority to sell liquor pending final approval of a transfer of the license. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u00a7 16-4-404(6), MCA; 42.12.208, ARM. Thus Waldo retained any authority the bar had to sell alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We note that it is a felony to sell alcoholic beverages without a liquor license. Section 16-6-302, MCA. Loos could not have run the bar without selling alcoholic beverages and he did not have a license to do so. Therefore, if Loos owned the bar he could not have run it without committing a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Waldo gave Loos 790 dollars cash as part of the inventory. After the robbery, 1255 dollars remained in the bar. Although Waldo testified that it belonged to Loos, he kept most of the money for bar operations rather than giving it to Loos\u2019 widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Finally, the bar\u2019s checking account continued after the bar\u2019s alleged sale and Waldo remained an owner of the account. Following Loos\u2019 death, Waldo resumed operating the bar and paid Loos\u2019 business bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">We hold that there is substantial credible evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s determination that Waldo did not sell the business to Loos.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Moving to another closely related issue, UEF and Waldo contend that Waldo\u2019s ownership of the bar\u2019s liquor license did not constitute a right to control Loos under the independent contractor test. They argue that the control factor is not a mere right to control, but the right to control the details of the person\u2019s work. See <em>Sharp, </em>584 P.2d at 1301. They urge us to apply the reasoning of a case wherein we said statutes \u201cmust not be distorted to allow persons who are truly independent in their operation to be held employees merely for tax purposes and resulting benefits derived from an employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>St. Regis Paper Co. v. U.C.C. of Mont. etal. </em>(1971), 157 Mont. 548, 552, 487 P.2d 524, 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The issue of whether Waldo\u2019s ownership of the liquor license gave him control over Loos\u2019 work presents a question of fact. Consequently, we will defer to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court if substantial credible evidence supports its determination. <em>Doig, </em>809 P.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">The law governing whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor is well settled. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Code defines independent contractor as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">(1) An \u201cindependent contractor\u201d is one who renders service in the course of an occupation and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(a) has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of the services, both under his contract and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">(b) is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(2) An individual performing services for remuneration is considered to be an employee under this chapter unless the requirements of subsection (1) are met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Section 39-71-120, MCA. We have held that this statute creates a two-part test, both parts of which must be met to classify a person as an independent contractor. First, the person must be free from the employer\u2019s control. Second, the person must have an independently established occupation. <em>Sharp, </em>584 P.2d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We use four-factors to determine whether a person is free from an employer\u2019s control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">(1) Direct evidence of right or exercise of control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">(2) Method of payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">(3) Furnishing of equipment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">(4) Right to fire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-12\"><em>Sharp, </em>584 P.2d at 1301-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">The last three factors tend to indicate that Loos was not Waldo\u2019s employee. First, Loos was not to receive any type of payment directly from Waldo. Rather, Loos\u2019 remuneration would have come from the profits on inventory sales after his payments to Waldo. Second, Waldo was not furnishing the equipment for free. Rather, Loos agreed to purchase the inventory and lease equipment from him. Finally, Waldo testified that he could not fire Loos.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">However, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that the right to control factor was dispositive. In ruling on the right to control, the court stated: \u201cAlthough Loos fully operated the bar and made representations regarding his \u2018lease,\u2019 Mr. Waldo retained his right of control through his ownership of the liquor license and his status as a signatory on the bar\u2019s checking account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Waldo and Loos agreed that Loos would purchase the inventory, but would merely lease equipment and the premises. The court reasoned that a liquor license can be transferred only on the sale of a business, not on a lease. See \u00a7 16-4-404(6), MCA. The court determined that because no sale occurred and no sale was intended, the parties could not have transferred the liquor license even if Loos had not died.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>We note that a liquor license is personal to the licensee. Section 16-4-404(3), MCA. Before a transfer of a liquor license is effective, the parties must file an application with the Department of Revenue. Section 16-4-404(6), MCA. Waldo and Loos did not file an application. Therefore, the purported sale of the liquor license to Loos was not effective and the liquor license remained in Waldo\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">It is a felony to sell alcoholic beverages without a license. Section 16-6-302, MCA. As a result, the bar could not legally sell alcoholic beverages unless Waldo remained in control of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court reasoned that because Waldo owned the liquor license, he had the right to mandate that Loos comply with the State liquor laws. The court further reasoned that Waldo had the right to retake possession of the bar if Loos did not comply. The court concluded that Waldo retained some right to control Loos\u2019 operation of the bar through the liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In addition, the court reasoned that Waldo had some right to control because he could withdraw funds from the account, as his name was still on the account. After Loos died, Waldo resumed operation of the bar and paid Loos\u2019 business debts. The court concluded that although Waldo did not have access to the bar\u2019s checkbook, he \u201cin effect had access to the purse strings of the bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Although nearly all of the evidence showed that Loos operated the bar, the court held that Loos was not an independent contractor because Waldo retained some right to control the business through the liquor license and the checking account. We hold that there is substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s determination that Waldo had the right to control Loos\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In conclusion, the court reasoned that Loos must have been an employee because he was not an independent contractor. We note that the dealings between Waldo and Loos were hardly clear-cut business transactions. Consequently, this Court will not attempt to classify them. We merely hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s determination that Loos was an employee of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in denying Jan Loos\u2019 costs and attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">A workers\u2019 compensation claimant is entitled to reasonable costs and attorney fees if the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>mines that the insurer acted unreasonably in denying liability. Section 39-71-611(l)(c), MCA. The standard of review on the issue is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court abused its discretion. <em>Baeta v. Don Tripp Trucking </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 487, 489-90, 839 P.2d 566, 568-69, 49 St.Rep. 824, 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In this case, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not determine that UEF acted unreasonably. In fact, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Court held that Loos was operating the bar in all areas except the right to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">There is no evidence of unreasonable conduct by the insurer. Workers\u2019 compensation covers employees, but does not automatically cover sole proprietors, working partners, or independent contractors. See \u00a7 39-71-401(2)(d), MCA. A workers\u2019 compensation mediator and a hearing examiner separately determined that Loos was not Waldo\u2019s employee. In addition, the UEF\u2019s claims examiner concluded that Waldo did not owe a penalty for noncompliance with workers\u2019 compensation laws, because she could not find any evidence that Loos was an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Because it is not clear that Loos was an employee of Waldo\u2019s Acton Bar at the time of his death, the UEF did not act unreasonably in denying liability. Therefore, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jan Loos\u2019 request for costs and attorney fees. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT and HARRISON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b299-8\">JUSTICE WEBER</author>\n<p id=\"AvE\">dissents as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The majority affirmed the determination by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that Loos was an employee rather than a sole proprietor. The majority affirmed the usage of the independent contractor test in reaching that conclusion. I disagree with the usage of the independent contractor test in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The majority further concluded there was substantial credible evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court in its determination that Waldo did not sell the bar to Loos and did not intend to sell it. The record does not support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Waldo retained his right of control by ownership of the liquor license and his status as a signor on the bar checking account. Applying the control factor from <em>Sharp v. Hoerner Waldorf Corp. </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 419, 584 P.2d 1298, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that Loos was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>employee because this was direct evidence of the exercise of control by Waldo. The key part of the statute relied upon by the court is the following paragraph of \u00a7 16-4-406, MCA (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">(6) Upon a bona fide sale of the business operated under any license, the license may be transferred to a qualified purchaser. No transfer of any license ... shall be effective unless and until approved by the department, and any ... proposed transferee who operates ... under any supposedly transferred license prior to the approval of such transfer by the department,... shall be considered as operating without a license and the license affected may be revoked...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that there was no sale of the business under the statute, and the absence of a license transfer provided Waldo with the right of control. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">Loos was allegedly leasing the bar from defendant Waldo. However, according to the statute above, it is only upon a <em>sale </em>of the business that a liquor license can be transferred. Therefore, since there was no sale and since none was intended, no transfer of the license could have taken place, even if Loos had not died. This retention of the liquor license provided defendant Waldo the right to control the operation of the bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">I disagree with the conclusion that no sale occurred and that none was intended. The record does not contain evidence to support that conclusion. Following are portions of significant transcript testimony by Waldo, the previous owner and seller of the bar, which establishes that a sale was intended and in fact was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">Q Did you operate this bar \u2014 Previously you testified that you had owned it since \u201884.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">Q Did you operate the bar from that time until September of \u201888?

Two questions are raised by that conclusion. The first is whether the facts demonstrate the absence of a sale. The second is whether the failure to comply with the statute is sufficient to invalidate the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-21\">With regard to the first point, it is clear that the uncontradicted facts rebut the holding that there was no sale and none was intended. I would reverse the factual determination of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that there was no sale and none was intended. I would rely upon the holding of <em>State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund v. Lee Rost Logging </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 97, 827 P.2d 85, and hold that the finding was <em>not </em>supported by substantial evidence and was, therefore, clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-22\">The next question relates to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 16-4-404(6), MCA (1987), when it concluded there was a right of control under that statute which met factor one of the <em>Sharp </em>test for an employee rather than an independent contractor. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>section does not require such an interpretation. The section establishes that until a transfer of license has been approved by the department, such a transfer is ineffective for licensing purposes and a proceeding may be brought to revoke or suspend the license. I find nothing in the statute which allowed the court to conclude that the statute itself gave Waldo a right to control Loos. The Court apparently concluded that because the license had not yet been transferred, that necessarily gave Waldo the right to control Loos. The statute does not warrant such a conclusion by its wording. In addition, the facts as above set forth clearly indicate that Waldo did not intend to retain such a right of control and, in fact, did not exercise any such right of control. I conclude that the failure to complete the statutory procedure for license transfer did not give any measure of control to Waldo. I therefore conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and the majority incorrectly applied factor one of the <em>Sharp </em>test in concluding that Waldo retained control over Loos.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">I again emphasize that in reaching this conclusion, the majority failed to rely upon the record but relied only upon the statute itself. Applying the four factors of the <em>Sharp </em>test, we must conclude as follows: (1) the record demonstrates no evidence of retention of a right of control by Waldo, (2) the method of payment did not demonstrate an employee relationship \u2014 in fact the record is totally absent of any proof to demonstrate that Waldo was to pay anything to Loos which could be classed as compensation, (3) no furnishing of equipment was present which would demonstrate an employee relationship, and (4) there was no right to fire on the part of Waldo. Because the record, without contradiction, establishes that the four factors stated in <em>Sharp </em>have not been proven, there is no basis to conclude there was an employee relationship rather than an independent contractor relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The Fund was correct when it contended that Loos was a sole proprietor and exempt from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act under the facts of this case. The Act specifically does not apply to the employment of sole proprietors. Section 39-71-401, MCA (1987), in pertinent part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">(2) Unless the employer elects coverage under this chapter and an insurer allows such an election, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not apply to any of the following employments:...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">(d) employment of sole proprietors or working members of a partnership, except as provided in subsection 3;...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>(3)(a) A sole proprietor ... who holds himself out or considers himself an independent contractor ... must elect to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of compensation plan No. 1, 2 or 3 ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Because the factual record demonstrates that Loos was not intended to be an employee and that the test demonstrating an employee relationship under <em>Sharp </em>had not been met, the issue remaining is whether or not Loos was a sole proprietor. The record demonstrates without contradiction that he was such a sole proprietor. Under the foregoing statute, a sole proprietor may be covered by the Act if he elects to be bound personally. Such election was not made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">I conclude the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erroneously found there had been no sale of the business. I further conclude that even where the independent contractor test is applied, under the uncontradicted facts of this case, there was no control present. Last, I conclude that Loos was a sole proprietor and not an independent contractor and was not covered by workers\u2019 compensation. I would hold, therefore, that Loos, in fact, was a sole proprietor and that in the absence of any election under the statute, he could not be classed as covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">I would reverse the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-7\">JUSTICE GRAY concurs in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
