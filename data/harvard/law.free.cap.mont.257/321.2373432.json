We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Todd pleaded guilty of the offense of issuing bad checks (common scheme), a felony, as defined in \u00a7 45-6-316, MCA. Following entry of the plea, Todd was sentenced to a term of ten years in the Montana State Prison, the sentence to run consecutively to a sentence imposed in the Fourth Judicial District Court and concurrently with a sentence imposed by the Eleventh Judicial District Court. Payment of restitution was imposed as a condition of Todd\u2019s parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Todd filed a Motion for Correction of Sentence, challenging the restitution provision contained in his sentence; he alleged that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to impose restitution other than as a condition of a deferred or suspended sentence. The court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The issue before us is whether the District Court erred in ordering restitution as a condition of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Subsections (a) through (g) of \u00a7 46-18-201(1), MCA, set forth the sentencing options available to a district court when a person has been found guilty of an offense upon a verdict or plea. The options range from deferred imposition of sentence, with or without restrictions or conditions such as restitution, through commitment to a correctional institution as provided by law, to a combination of the authorized options. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In addition, \u00a7 46-18-202, MCA, authorizes the district court to impose \u201crestrictions or conditions on the sentence provided for in 46-18-201 which it considers necessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of society.\u201d Subsections (a) through (d) of \u00a7 46-18-202(1), MCA, list specifically authorized conditions, while subsection (e) enables a court to impose \u201cany other limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Here, the District Court first sentenced Todd to ten years\u2019 imprisonment in the Montana State Prison, the maximum prison sentence available under \u00a7 45-6-316, MCA, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(1)(e), MCA. The court then ordered restitution as a condition of Todd\u2019s parole, in the \u00e9vent he was paroled in advance of serving the entirety of his prison sentence. While the court did not so state, it is clear that the restitution was ordered pursuant to the court\u2019s authority, under \u00a7 \u00a146-18-202(1)(e), MCA, to impose any limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation. The restitution was not imposed pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">We previously have upheld a district court\u2019s authority to impose restitution as a condition of parole under \u00a7 46-18-202, MCA, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>almost identical facts. <em>State v. Klippenstein </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 42, 778 P.2d 892. We were careful to point out in <em>Klippenstein </em>that the condition of restitution would never apply if the defendant served his full term of imprisonment; in other words, the total sentence imposed could never exceed the statutory maximum for the offense. <em>Klippenstein, </em>239 Mont. 42, 778 P.2d at 894. <em>Klippenstein </em>is directly on point and mandates the same result in the case presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Todd argues that our decision in <em>State v. Mazurkiewicz </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 172, 799 P.2d 1066, controls. He asserts that, pursuant to <em>Mazurkiewicz, </em>restitution can be ordered only as part of a deferred or suspended sentence under \u00a7 46-18-201(1)(a) or (b), MCA. He over-reads our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In <em>Mazurkiewicz, </em>the district court sentenced the defendant to the Montana State Prison for the maximum statutory term and ordered the payment of restitution upon his release. 799 P.2d at 1068-70. The ordered restitution was part of the defendant\u2019s actual sentence, not a condition of parole. We concluded on those facts that while Montana law permits restitution as a condition of a deferred, suspended or partially suspended sentence, nothing in the statutes allows restitution requirements to be imposed in the absence of those sentences. <em>Mazurkiewicz, </em>799 P.2d at 1070. Our concern in <em>Mazurkiewicz </em>was that the totality of the defendant\u2019s sentence exceeded that authorized by law. No statute authorized the \u201cstacking\u201d of restitution onto the maximum statutory term of imprisonment. In other words, restitution was not statutorily available as an independent and cumulative sentencing option.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Here, as in <em>Klippenstein, </em>the ordered restitution is conditional; it becomes operative only in the event the defendant secures early release from prison via parole. Thus, it cannot result in a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum. In the event of parole, similar to a deferred or suspended sentence situation, the State maintains considerable authority over the offender for general rehabilitative and protective purposes, and the restrictions or conditions authorized by \u00a7 46-18-202, MCA, lawfully can be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We hold that the District Court did not err in imposing restitution as a condition of Todd\u2019s parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-9\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, HARRISON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
