We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The essential issue on appeal is whether all elements necessary to establish a prescriptive easement across Appellants\u2019 (Rappolds) property were proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">This action concerns Durocher\u2019s right to access his property through Rappolds\u2019 property. Previously, Durocher\u2019s property was acquired by one, R.N. Lear, in 1940 and 1941, from the original homesteaders. The east half of the property was patented in 1923. The west half of the property was patented in 1935. The property was accessed from the Swift Dam road, traveling across tracts owned by Art Lindseth, Fay Lear, and John Rappold. R.N. Lear never lived on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">In 1965, Mahlon (Jack) Lear and Deloris Lear acquired the property from R.N. Lear and used the property primarily for livestock grazing. Jack Lear also crossed the property of Art Lindseth, Fay Lear (Jack Lear\u2019s brother) and John Rappold.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">In 1969, Jack and Deloris Lear obtained an affidavit from their neighbors relative to borrowing money from the Federal Land Bank, which was recorded in 1978. The affidavit was signed by John Rappold (appellants\u2019 father), A. D. Lindseth and Fay Lear and read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">FAY F. LEAR, A. D. LINDSETH and JOHN RAPPOLD, being first duly sworn, upon their oaths depose and say that they own real estate in the vicinity of land owned by MAHLON JOHN LEAR, said land being located in Sections 3,4,5 and 9 of Township 27 North, Range 9 West, Teton County, Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">That affiants have personal knowledge of the fact that the said MAHLON JOHN LEAR and his predecessors in title and business visitors and guests of same have regularly, openly, and continuously used a trail from the Swift Dam road to gain access to this land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and that said access road has been used without objection, contest or obstruction by anyone for a period of over fifteen years from this date; that the said access road runs southeasterly through Sections 24, 25, 26, 34 and 35 of Township 28 North, Range 9 West in Pondera County, and through Section 3, Township 27 North, Range 9 West in Teton County, entering land owned by MAHLON JOHN LEAR on the east side of the NW1/2SW1/2 of Section 3, Township 27 North, Range 9 West....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">In 1979, Jack and Deloris Lear sold the property to Glen and Lola Thoreson, who used the same access trail that R.N. Lear and Jack Lear had used to reach the property. The Thoresons grazed cattle on the land until 1982, when they leased the land to Jerry Lear, Fay Lear\u2019s son, to graze Jerrys livestock. The property was leased by Jerry until April of 1988, when the Thoresons sold the property to Durocher.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Rappolds\u2019 father and grandfather bought the property crossed by the contested trail in two purchases. First, John and Karl (appellants\u2019 father and grandfather) purchased the Lenor place in 1938. They subsequently purchased the \u201cGordon place\u201d in 1949. The Rappolds acquired their property through various deeds in 1980 from their father, John Rappold.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The Rappolds filed this action on November 28,1988 to quiet title to the traversed land against any interest of Durocher. Additional facts will be provided as necessary in the body of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u201cOur standard of review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is clear.\u201d Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\"><em>Keebler v. Harding </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 518, 522, 807 P.2d 1354,1357. In interpreting this rule, we have adopted the following three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APY\">First, the Court will review the record to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. Second, if the findings are supported by substantial evidence we will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of evidence. Third, if substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence has not been misapprehended the Court may still find that \u201c[A] finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the court with the definite and firm conviction .that a mistake has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">To establish an easement by prescription, the party claiming an easement \u201cmust show open, notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted use of the easement claimed for the full statutory period. The statutory period is five years <em>.\u2019\u2019Keebler, </em>807 P.2d at 1356. (Citation omitted.) See also; <em>Downing v. Grover </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 172, 175, 772 P.2d 850, 852.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cOpen and notorious\u201d is defined as \u201ca distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to the rights of the owner and must be brought to the attention of the owner.\u201d \u201cContinuous\u201d means \u201cit is necessary to have use made often enough to constitute notice of the claim to the potential servient owner.\u201d \u201cUninterrupted\u201d means \u201cuse not interrupted by the act of the owner of the land or by voluntary abandonment by the party claiming the right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"><em>Downing, </em>772 P.2d at 852 (citations omitted). \u201cAn Exclusive use means that the claimants\u2019 right to use the right of way is independent of a like right of way in another.\u201d <em>Cope v. Cope </em>(1971), 158 Mont. 388, 392, 493 P.2d 336, 339. Finally, \u201c[t]o be adverse, the use of the alleged easement must be exercised under a claim of right and not as a mere privilege or license revocable at the pleasure of the owner of the land; such claim must be known to, and acquiesced in by, the owner of the land.\u201d <em>Keebler, </em>807 P.2d at 1356-1357. (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Given the elements of an easement by prescription and the definition of such elements, the trial court concluded that Durocher had established an easement to his property through the Rappolds\u2019 property. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The Thoresons owned Durocher\u2019s property for approximately ten years, from 1979 to 1988, when they sold the property to Durocher. The Thoresons used their property in various ways during different seasons. They grazed livestock on it, they would go to the property to repair fences and they moved a trailer to the property for overnight stays. They consistently used the trail through Rappolds\u2019 to get to their property. They used the disputed trail to access their property for snowmobiling, hunting, Christmas tree gathering, picnics and general enj oyment of the property. They continued to use the property after they leased it to Jerry Lear to graze his cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Mr. Thoreson testified that the Rappolds knew they travelled the disputed trail because he had met both Karl and John at different times on the trail. The Rappolds never prevented him from using the trail. Thoreson claimed he had a right to access his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The 1969 affidavit signed by Fay Lear, Art Lindseth and John Rappold provides evidence that Jack Lear\u2019s use of the trail was also open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted and exclusive. The affidavit states that <em>\u201cMAHLON JOHN LEAR and his predecessors </em>in title and business visitors and guests of same have regularly, openly, and continuously used a trail from the Swift Dam road to gain access to this land, and that said access road has been used without objection, contest or obstruction by anyone for a period of over fifteen years from this date ....\u201d (Emphasis added.) The affidavit is dated October 18,1969. The affidavit reflects this use occurred over <em>at least </em>a fifteen year period prior to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The trial court concluded that the language of the affidavit was not consistent with permissive use and that the \u201caffidavit... appears to confirm the existence of a prescriptive easement.\u201d All elements of prescription have been shown through the testimony of the Thoresons and the 1969 affidavit. The element of adversity is the element of contention here. However,\"... adverse use is established by presumption if all other elements of the claim are demonstrated.\u201d <em>Parker v. Elder </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 75, 78, 758 P.2d 292, 294 (citation omitted). When the other elements have been established, the burden falls upon the other party to show that the use was permissive. <em>Garrett v. Jackson </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 505, 508, 600 P.2d 1177, 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In our present case, the use has been shown to be open, notorious, exclusive, continuous and uninterrupted at least through the ownership of Jack Lear and Glen Thoreson, Durocher\u2019s predecessors in interest. This establishes the presumption of adversity that the Rappolds must overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We conclude that the Rappolds have not met their burden of demonstrating that Durocher and his predecessors\u2019 use was permissive. Although Karl Rappold testified that he had given Glen Thoreson and his son, Gary permission to cross his property, Glen and Gary Thoreson testified that they never sought permission, nor were they given permission, to use the trail. The trial court concluded that he found \u201cthe testimony of Glen Thoreson, a disinterested third party, more credible than that of plaintiffs and members of their family. Glen Thoreson never asked for or received permission from plaintiffs to use the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The Rappolds provided nothing more than their own statements to show that the use of the road was permissive. We observe that \u201c[d]ue regard is given the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of witnesses ... and resolve conflicts or inconsistencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>in testimony.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Barnum </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 137, 143-144, 684 P.2d 1106, 1110. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The element of adversity also is present in Glen Thoreson\u2019s testimony that he did not understand that there were any limitations on using the road at any time during the year nor any limitations for any use he wanted to make of the road. Also, he testified that when he sold the property to Durocher he told Durocher that he had a right to use the trail based upon the \u201cwritten easement\u201d (1969 affidavit). Thoreson believed he had a legal right to go to his property based on the affidavit and the word of the real estate man who worked with Jack Lear when Jack sold the property to Glen Thoreson. Finally, Glen Thoreson testified that he did not feel that he had to ask for permission to access his property. The trial court concluded that \u201cGlen Thoreson was told when he purchased the property from Lear that there was an easement that went with it. The 1969 affidavit was the basis for this representation. This information was passed along to Defendant Durocher.\u201d Thoreson exercised his use of the trail as an adverse claim of right, not as a license revocable at the Rappolds\u2019 pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment that Durocher has a prescriptive easement through Rappolds\u2019 property is supported by substantial credible evidence, that the trial court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence, and that the court was not clearly erroneous.
