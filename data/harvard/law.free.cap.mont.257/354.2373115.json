The court ordered Wellcome and the insurer for his client to pay the sanctions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>sanctions, either as ordered or as compromised, ultimately were paid by Page Wellcome and Aetna Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Wellcome submitted a claim for the amount of the sanction to The Home Insurance Company (Home) under his professional liability policy. Home denied the claim on the basis of a provision excluding payment for \u201cfines or statutory penalties whether imposed by law or otherwise ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Wellcome filed a diversity action in the United States District Court asserting a breach of the insurance contract and seeking a declaration of the parties\u2019 rights thereunder. Home pleaded as affirmative defenses both the \u201cfines or statutory penalties\u201d exclusion and an exclusion for \u201cdeliberately wrongful acts or omissions committed by the Insured.\u201d The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Wellcome sought summary judgment on the grounds that: (1) the term \u201cfine\u201d in the policy was ambiguous and, therefore, should be construed against Home; and (2) coverage should be required under the \u201creasonable expectations\u201d doctrine. The U.S. District Court granted summary judgment to Home on the basis of the \u201cfines\u201d exclusion, concluding that the term was not ambiguous. On that basis, the court determined that the reasonable expectations principle did not apply. The court did not rely on the \u201cwrongful acts\u201d exclusion, 758 F.Supp. 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Wellcome appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Stating that no clear controlling precedent in Montana judicial decisions existed on questions determinative of the case, the Ninth Circuit certified questions to this Court. We accepted jurisdiction of the certified questions by order dated August 25, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The following two questions are certified from the Ninth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">(1) Was there ambiguity in the contract language that should be construed against Home to require it to provide coverage for the sanctions imposed against Wellcome?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">(2) Does the doctrine of reasonable expectations require Home to provide coverage for the sanctions imposed against Wellcome?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akb\">The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law in Montana. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Waller </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 328, 331, 828 P.2d 1384,1386. Well-established principles guide our interpretation. The language of the policy governs if it is clear and explicit. <em>Waller, </em>828 P.2d at 1386. Ambiguities are construed against the insurer. <em>Bauer Ranch v. Mountain W. Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 153, 156, 695 P.2d 1307, 1309. Furthermore, exclusions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>coverage will be narrowly and strictly construed because they are contrary to the fundamental protective purpose of an insurance policy. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Oakland </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 352, 356, 825 P.2d 554, 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">With these principles of insurance policy interpretation in mind, we turn to the policy at issue and the question of whether the \u201cfines or statutory penalties\u201d language is ambiguous, thereby requiring Home to provide coverage for the sanctions imposed against Wellcome. In so doing, we note that Home\u2019s alternative basis for excluding coverage, the \u201cdeliberately wrongful acts\u201d exclusion, is not before us and, therefore, is not addressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Pursuant to the claims made policy between Wellcome and Home, Home generally undertook to pay on Wellcome\u2019s behalf all sums in excess of the deductible amount which Wellcome became \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages ....\u201d The specific provision under which the U.S. District Court granted summary judgment to Home defines damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">Damages, whenever used in this policy, means a monetary judgment or settlement and does not include fines or statutory penalties whether imposed by law or otherwise, nor the return of or restitution of legal fees, costs and expenses arising therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApI\">The court agreed with Wellcome that the monetary sanction was not imposed pursuant to statutory authority, and focused on the term \u201cfine.\u201d It determined that the term was not reasonably subject to differing interpretations, \u201c[r]ather, the term, whether used in a formal context or in ordinary parlance, means the payment of money imposed upon a person for misconduct.\u201d Because the Montana trial court imposed a payment of money on Wellcome for misconduct, the court concluded that the imposed sanctions were excepted from coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, and before this Court, Wellcome argues that sanctions are sanctions and are not fines, penalties or any other type of punishment. He asserts that the term \u201cfines\u201d is used in Montana statutes only in the context of criminal matters and, therefore, that a Montana attorney reasonably could understand the exclusion for \u201cfines\u201d in his professional liability policy to exclude only criminal fines. Home contends that the policy clearly informed Wellcome that coverage was not available if a court ordered him to pay money as a result of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">We conclude that the term \u201cfines,\u201d as used in the policy before us, is not ambiguous and excludes coverage for the sanctions imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>by the state trial court. We note first that the \u201cstatutory penalty\u201d language does not apply here; it was not the basis for the trial court\u2019s imposition of sanctions. However, that language would include penalties of all kinds imposed under authority of statute or rule, including a criminal fine, an \u201cexcess costs\u201d penalty pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, a statutory contempt, or a sanction imposed under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Here, the trial court imposed the sanctions for Wellcome\u2019s violation of certain of its orders during trial, pursuant to its inherent authority. The sanctions were a penalty or punishment for Wellcome\u2019s misconduct, notwithstanding the fact that they did not come within any specific statutory authority so as to constitute a <em>statutory </em>penalty under the policy. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. Rev.) defines a fine as a penalty; it defines the verb \u201cfine\u201d as \u201cto impose a pecuniary punishment ....\u201d In our view, this is the commonly understood and clear meaning of the word \u201cfine.\u201d Wellcome\u2019s attempt to restrict the term to the criminal context is hypertechnical; it would produce an absurd result in that sanctions imposed pursuant to statute or rule would be excluded from coverage, while sanctions imposed pursuant to a court\u2019s inherent authority to do so would be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We turn next to the \u201creasonable expectations\u201d doctrine, first recognized by this Court in <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 173, 656 P.2d 820. In that case, we held that a policy exclusion was invalid due to its failure to \u201chonor the reasonable expectations\u201d of the purchaser of the policy. <em>Royle, </em>656 P.2d at 824. We quoted Keeton, Insurance Rights at Variance with Policy Provisions, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 961, 967 (1970), for the proposition that the objectively reasonable expectations of the purchaser would be honored notwithstanding the fact that a \u201cpainstaking study\u201d of the policy would have negated the expectations. <em>Royle, </em>656 P.2d at 824. The reasonable expectations doctrine is in accord with our strong public policy that insurance is intended to serve a fundamental protective purpose; to this extent the doctrine goes hand in hand with our rule of strictly construing policy exclusions. See <em>Oakland, </em>825 P.2d at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We next considered, and declined to apply, the reasonable expectations doctrine in <em>Passage v. Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 60, 727 P.2d 1298. In <em>Passage, </em>plaintiffs contended that the arbitration clause in their client agreement form, printed in the same typeface as the other agreement provisions, was unenforceable as outside their reasonable expectations. Stating that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the arbitration clause was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>within the parties\u2019 expectations, we affirmed the enforceability of the clause. <em>Passage, </em>727 P.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We most recently addressed the reasonable expectations of an insured in <em>State Farm v. Estate of Braun </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 125, 793 P.2d 253. There, the underinsured policy at issue specifically provided that coverage extended to Canada. Canadian law severely restricted damages in wrongful death tort actions. We determined that, given the policy\u2019s specific extension of coverage for accidents occurring in Canada, a reasonable average insured would not be aware that, in relation to Montana law, Canadian law severely restricted damages. <em>Braun, </em>793 P.2d at 256. We noted that accepting the insurer\u2019s position would produce the result that State Farm sold, and collected premiums for, coverage in Canada that was worthless to the insured. <em>Braun, </em>793 P.2d at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Nothing in our cases supports the applicability of the reasonable expectations doctrine in this case. In neither <em>Royle </em>nor <em>Braun </em>did we apply the doctrine to require coverage where clear policy language excluded the coverage. We decline to do so here. Expectations which are contrary to a clear exclusion from coverage are not \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d as we used that term in <em>Royle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We have concluded herein that the definition of damages in Wellcome\u2019s policy with Home which excludes \u201cfines\u201d clearly and unambiguously excluded coverage under the facts of this case. To require Home to provide coverage where the policy manifests a clear intent to do otherwise would violate our most basic contract law and rules of interpretation. See, e.g., \u00a7 28-3-401, MCA, and <em>Waller, </em>828 P.2d at 1386. We conclude, therefore, that the doctrine of reasonable expectations does not require Home to provide coverage for the sanctions imposed against Wellcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Based on the above discussion and conclusions, we answer the certified questions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u201cFirst, was there ambiguity in the contract language that should be construed against Home to require it to provide coverage for the sanctions imposed against Wellcome?\u201d No.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u201cSecond, does the doctrine of reasonable expectations require Home to provide coverage for the sanctions imposed against Wellcome?\u201d No.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-10\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, HARRISON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
