Despite the INS\u2019s additional arguments, we adhere to our panel decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-23\">We need not repeat the facts of this case, but pause only to summarize. Under the immigration laws, Juan Jaime Medina, born of an American father, was himself an American citizen provided that he complied with a two year residency requirement. In 1985, an Immigration Judge (IJ) held in an adjudicatory proceeding that Medina had met the statutory requirement, although the IJ applied, the incorrect standard. The INS, sharing this error, conceded Medina\u2019s citizenship and waived appeal. Two year's later, the INS initiated new proceedings against Medina, claiming that he was deportable under \u00a7 241(a)(1) of the. Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-24\">Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon order of the Attorney General, be deported who \u2014 (1) at the time of entry was within one or more of the classes of aliens excludable by the law existing at the time of such entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-25\">In our panel opinion we held that the subsequent proceeding was precluded by res judi-cata.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-26\">Few legal doctrines are more intrinsic or necessary in our system than res judicata. That doctrine, which provides that a valid and final judgment precludes a second suit between the same parties on the same claim or any part thereof, ensures that litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tion will come to an end. Were we to accept the INS\u2019s arguments, we would carve out a large exception to this venerable doctrine, one that would allow the agency to eschew direct appeals \u2014 either inadvertently, through error, or consciously as a strategic decision\u2014 then, years later, collaterally attack decisions of immigration judges. The INS presents no persuasive argument or authority to convince us to take such a drastic step.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In its rehearing petition, the INS argues that application of administrative res judicata or collateral estoppel is subject to the direction of Congress, citing <em>University of Tennessee v. </em>Elliott,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association v. </em>Solimino.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But these cases dealt with state administrative findings under Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In each case, the Supreme Court held that unre-viewed adverse findings by a state administrative judge did not preclude the plaintiff from filing a claim in federal court. The Court also held that \u201cwhen the interpretation of a statute is at hand.... the question is not whether administrative estoppel is wise but whether it is intended by the legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We do not quarrel with the correctness of these opinions; they are simply inapplicable to the instant case. In making its argument, the INS overlooks an important distinction between the state administrative proceedings required under Title VII and the ADEA on the one hand and the review of a determination of citizenship on the other. In Title VII and ADEA claims, the plaintiff is required to exhaust those state remedies before bringing a claim in federal court. In other words, the plaintiff <em>brings suit </em>in federal court. Obviously, under such a system, the determination in the state administrative proceeding cannot bind the federal court or there could never be a federal cause of action. The exhaustion of state remedies requirement has several purposes, but elimination of the claim is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">In contrast, when determining citizenship neither the petitioner nor the INS brings a new suit in federal court; rather, under the INA, they <em>seek review </em>of an IJ\u2019s decision. Accordingly, the proper procedure to <em>review </em>an IJ\u2019s holding is an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA); the decision of the BIA is appealed directly to the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By enacting \u00a7 106(a)(5),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cCongress carved out one class of eases ... where de novo <em>review </em>in district court claims of nationality <em>would be available: </em>cases in which the person subject to deportation claims to be a United States citizen.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under that section, the Court of Appeals may transfer the claim for a de novo review by the district court if there is a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">The INS now urges that Medina is entitled to that determination in district court. We note in passing that the language of the provision is phrased to protect the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>seeking recognition of his or her citizenship, not the INS. Section 106(a)(5) was prompted by Supreme Court cases recognizing \u201cthat the Constitution requires that there be some provision for de novo judicial determination of claims to American citizenship in deportation proceedings.... \u2018To deport one who ... claims to be a citizen, obviously deprives him of liberty ... [and] may result also in loss of both property and life; or of all that makes life worth living.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the transfer to the district court is not automatic, but occurs only after determinations by the Court of Appeals. Thus, at most, the INS could have attempted to obtain from us a transfer to the district court for a de novo review of Medina\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">At the heart of this case, however, is the INS\u2019s failure to grasp or refusal to accept that the agency must seek such a determination on direct appeal or suffer res judicata preclusion. These review proceedings do not exist separately as do the federal claims under Title VII or the ADEA. Here, when the INS failed to take advantage of the appeals process, res judicata mandated that the agency be precluded from successive attempts to relitigate the question of Medina\u2019s citizenship. Certainly, the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that claims to American citizenship in deportation proceedings implicate liberty and property rights supports our conclusion, reiterated today, that a final, uncontested grant of citizenship cannot be revisited at the INS\u2019s pleasure.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. 478 U.S. 788, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 92 L.Ed.2d 635 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\">. <em>Astoria, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2169.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\">. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 106(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (exclusive procedure for judicial review of orders of deportation and exclusion governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2341 et seq., which vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(5).
