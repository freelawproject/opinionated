Prior to the collegial conference, the panel members read the briefs and a bench memorandum prepared by staff counsel in each of the cases to be decided at conference. Each panel member personally reviews the records of one-third of the day\u2019s eases and takes the lead in the discussion of those cases following a presentation by staff counsel. Prior to the conference a draft of the proposed per cu-riam opinion is reviewed and revised, as needed, by the judge responsible for the record analysis. The panel thoroughly discusses the appellate issues and resolves same, making such changes as may be appropriate in the proposed opinion. With the aid of modern technology, all revisions are promptly completed and the opinions are approved, signed, and filed with the clerk of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Our Conference Calendar practice is now in its second year of operation. We plan sessions on alternate months and anticipate average dockets of 120 cases per session. Every active judge on our court has served on at least one Conferene\u00e9 Calendar panel and most have served on two or more. We are unanimous in our conclusion that cases decided on the Conference Calendar receive a fully adequate allocation of quality judicial time and attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\"><em>Graves </em>\u2014 No. <em>93-1292</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Danny R. Graves appeals the dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) of his section 1983 civil rights claim. We modify and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Graves, proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>filed suit against Judge Jack Hampton, John Vance, the District Attorney for Dallas County, and Harris M. Samuel, a private citizen, alleging false imprisonment as a result of his prosecution and conviction for forgery. Finding all defendants immune from suit the district court invoked section 1915(d) and dismissed the complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">Dismissal of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) is appropriate if the district court is \u201csatisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.\u201d An action is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s section 1915(d) dismissal utilizing the abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">A claim is based upon an indisputably meritless legal theory if the defendants are immune from suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Graves advances three such claims. Judicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from damage claims arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The claims against Judge Hampton are based upon his actions during Graves\u2019 criminal trial \u2014 actions well within the ambit of the judge\u2019s absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>A criminal prosecutor also enjoys absolute immunity from section 1983 damage claims for presenting the state\u2019s case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This immunity applies to the prosecutor\u2019s actions in initiating prosecution and in carrying the case through the judicial process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Graves\u2019 claims against Vance are based on Vance\u2019s prosecution of Graves for forgery, actions obviously within the scope of the prosecutorial immunity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"> Finally, the district court dismissed Graves\u2019 claims against Samuel because Graves did not allege any facts which would make Samuel a state actor. Graves alleges only that Samuel made a false statement against him. A witness is entitled to absolute immunity from section 1983 damage claims, even if it is alleged that the witness committed perjury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Because all three defendants are immune from suit, dismissal under section 1915(d) was proper; Graves\u2019 claims against these defendants have no arguable basis in law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Graves, insists, however, that the court erred in not allowing him to amend his complaint to cure any defects.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In <em>Denton, </em>the Court noted that among the pertinent factors in determining whether a district court has abused its discretion in dismissing a complaint under section 1915(d), is the inquiry whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f it appears that frivolous factual allegations could be remedied through more specific pleading, a court of appeals reviewing a section 1915(d) disposition should consider whether the District Court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint with prejudice or without leave to amend.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">The judgment dismissing Graves\u2019 complaint contains no language advising whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice. Although the general rule is that a dismissal is with prejudice unless otherwise specified,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the application of that general rubric to section 1915(d) dismissals is by no means certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">In <em>Denton, </em>the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-18\">Because a \u00a7 1915(d) dismissal is not a dismissal on the merits, but rather an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, the dismissal does not prejudice the filing of a paid complaint making the same allegations. It could, however, have a <em>res judicata </em>effect on frivolousness determinations for future <em>in forma pauperis </em>petitions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>This suggests that section 1915(d) dismissals generally are to be without prejudice. Thus, when a section 1915(d) dismissal is silent, we will presume that the dismissal is without prejudice. This does not mean, however, that a section 1915(d) dismissal should never be with prejudice.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Should the court determine to dismiss with prejudice, appropriate reasons must be assigned. For example, if it is clear from the face of the complaint that the claims asserted are subject to an obvious meritorious defense, such as a peremptory time bar, dismissal with prejudice would be appropriate, for no amendment or subsequently paid filing could overcome the fatal defect.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Dismissal with prejudice also would be appropriate if the plaintiff has been given an opportunity to expound on the factual allegations by way of a <em>Watson </em>questionnaire <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or orally via a <em>Spears </em>hearing,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but does not assert any facts which would support an arguable claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Finally, claims which otherwise clearly have <em>no </em>arguable basis in law,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> thereby negating a rectification by amendment, usually should be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Graves\u2019 claims were dismissed without prejudice. Because his claims clearly lack an arguable basis in law, the trial court\u2019s dismissal should have been with prejudice. As so modified, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"A-o\"><em>Edmonds </em>\u2014 No. <em>92-9114</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUM\">Ronald Harlan Edmonds invokes 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and complains that his eighth amendment rights were violated by incompetent medical personnel in the federal prison.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is firmly established that negligent or mistaken medical treatment or judgment does not implicate the eighth amendment and does not provide the basis for a civil rights action.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is irrefutable that Edmond\u2019s claim has no arguable basis in law and it is therefore subject to dismissal with prejudice. The trial court\u2019s judgment is accordingly modified to so provide and, as modified, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"AKC\"><em>Lopez </em>\u2014 No. <em>98-1432</em></p>\n<p id=\"An_\">Chris Lopez also complains of inadequate medical treatment. To state a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 a prisoner must allege and be able to prove that the defendants exhibited \u201cdeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Lopez complains only of negligence and malpractice. His claims manifestly have no arguable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>basis in law and must be dismissed. They should be dismissed with prejudice and, modified to reflect such, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">.
