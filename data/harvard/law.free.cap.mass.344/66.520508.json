The plaintiff in the first count (hereinafter called the plaintiff) is Patricia Rossi, a minor, who seeks by her next friend to recover for injuries inflicted upon her by two dogs owned by the defendant, Ernest V. DelDuca. In the seventh count John Rossi, Patricia\u2019s father, seeks to recover for medical expenses incurred by bim on behalf of his daughter. Both counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>were submitted to the jury who returned verdicts for the plaintiffs. The case comes here on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">There was evidence of the following: The plaintiff lived with her parents on Oak Street, Methuen. Oak Street runs north and south. In order to reach the Rossi house coming from the south it is necessary to pass Cambridge Street which joins Oak Street from the east. On the east side of Oak Street starting at the junction of Cambridge and Oak streets and proceeding northward there are three houses occupied by the defendant and members of his family. The first house (No. 105) is owned and occupied by Arthur DelDuca, a brother of the defendant. To the north of, and next to, Arthur\u2019s house is a house (No. 119) owned and occupied by Samuel DelDuca, also a brother of the defendant. Next to and north of Samuel\u2019s house is the defendant\u2019s house (No. 121). At 70 Cambridge Street (on the north side of the street) is a garage owned by the defendant\u2019s wife, which the defendant uses in his contracting business. There is a small shed near the back of the garage, slightly to the west, which is also used in the business. Cambridge Street is a dead-end street to the east of the garage, and there are no streets running off Oak Street north of Cambridge Street. In connection with his business, the defendant owned and maintained bulldozers, graders, and equipment which he kept outdoors on a field owned by his father, Vincenzo, located east of 105, 119, and 121 Oak Street, and north of the garage at 70 Cambridge Street. \u201cGoing north on the east side of Oak Street starting at Cambridge Street there were no fences between the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">The field on the east side of Oak Street was to the north of 70 Cambridge Street and east of . . . [the defendant\u2019s] land at 121 Oak Street. The land was all open in there.\u201d On this field, the defendant, with the permission of his father, had erected a pen to house two great Dane dogs which he owned. The defendant\u2019s brother Arthur was the owner of a purplish-gray German Weimaraner dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In September, 1955, Ida Celia and the plaintiff, both aged eight, were students in the third grade of the Ashford school. In the afternoon of September 26, school having closed, they started walking up Oak Street toward their homes. As they reached the corner of Cambridge Street, they saw the German Weimaraner ahead of them on Oak Street. The dog started to come toward them, and, as the plaintiff testified, \u201cWe got frightened so we . . . ran down Cambridge Street . . . [and the dog was] [fallowing us.\u201d Realizing that Cambridge Street was a dead-end street, the girls left Cambridge Street on the north side, passing around the garage at 70 Cambridge Street and the shed. The dog continued to follow them. After they passed the shed, they ran along a path in the field belonging to the defendant\u2019s father. The plaintiff then saw, for the first time, a black great Dane. \u201c [T]he dog was on its hind legs and it was going to jump on her. It did jump on her. She doesn\u2019t remember after that, and then she remembers two black dogs on her. She didn\u2019t feel anything but they were biting her neck. She shouted for help.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s father observed the defendant\u2019s great Dane dogs in the field. They \u201cwere worrying some object\u201d which he learned was his daughter Patricia who was \u201ccrouched down on her knees . . . with her hands on her face.\u201d He picked her up and took her to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendant testified that on September 26, 1955, he owned two \u201cblack Dane dogs.\u201d The dogs were \u201ctrained to stay in the field to the rear of this defendant\u2019s home where his equipment was kept. . . . He had a lot of equipment and was concerned about it.\u201d The defendant\u2019s arrangement with his father regarding this land was that the \u201cdefendant could use all of that property for parking his equipment and doing anything he wanted with it in connection with his business. ... He had full control of the field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">1. It is clear both from the pleadings and the evidence that the plaintiff seeks to recover under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 155, which, as amended by St. 1934, c. 320, \u00a7 18 reads: \u201cIf any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>dog shall do any damage to either the body or property of any person, the owner or keeper, or if the owner or keeper be a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor, shall be liable for such damage, unless such damage shall have been occasioned to the body or property of a person who, at the time such damage was sustained, was committing a trespass or other tort, or was teasing, tormenting or abusing such dog.\u201d Under this statute, unlike the comm mi law, \u201cthe owner or keeper of a dog is liable . . . for injury resulting from an act of the dog without proof . . . that its owner or keeper was negligent or otherwise at fault, or knew, or had reason to know, that the dog had any extraordinary, dangerous propensity, and even without proof that the dog in fact had any such propensity.\u201d <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Falco, </em>292 Mass. 299, 300. It is to be noted that the strict liability imposed by the statute is of no avail to a plaintiff if at the time of his injury he 1 \u2018was committing a trespass or other tort, or was teasing, tormenting or abusing the dog.\u201d And it is incumbent upon a plaintiff to plead and prove that he has done none of these things. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>304 Mass. 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The defendant contends that the plaintiff is barred from recovery because on her own testimony \u2014 and there is no evidence more favorable to her \u2014 she was committing a trespass at the time the defendant\u2019s dogs attacked her. We assume that, although the field where the plaintiff was attacked was owned by the defendant\u2019s father, the defendant had possessive rights in the property sufficient to render the principle enunciated in <em>Sarna </em>v. <em>American Bosch Magneto Corp. </em>290 Mass. 340, inapplicable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Worcester Insulation Co. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 44. We are of opinion, nevertheless, that the jury could have found that the plaintiff was not a trespasser, as that word is used in the statute. A finding was warranted that the plaintiff, an eight year old girl, was frightened by the German Weimar-aner dog which was between her and the only means of access to her house; that she turned and ran down a side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>street; and that because this was a dead-end street she went north across the field in the rear of the defendant\u2019s house in order to get home, the Weimaraner following her all the while. This evidence brings the case, we think, within the principle that one is privileged to enter land in the possession of another.if it is, or reasonably appears to be, necessary to prevent serious harm to the actor or his property. Restatement 2d: Torts, Tent, draft no. 2,1958, \u00a7 197. This privilege not only relieves the intruder from liability for technical trespass <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>58 N. H. 104; <em>Ploof </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>81 Vt. 471; <em>Boutwell </em>v. <em>Champlain Realty Co. </em>89 Vt. 80. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Race, </em>7 Cush. 408. Cf. <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Lake Erie Transp. Co. </em>109 Minn. 456, a case where actual harm resulted from the invasion) but it also destroys the possessor\u2019s immunity from liability in resisting the intrusion. <em>Ploof </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>81 Vt. 471. See Bohlen, Incomplete Privilege to Inflict Intentional Invasions of Interests of Property <em>&amp; </em>Personality, 39 Harv. L. Rev. 307. \u201cThe important difference between the status of one who is a trespasser on land and one who is on the land pursuant to an incomplete privilege is that the latter is entitled to be on the land and therefore the possessor of the land is under a duty to permit him to come and remain there and hence is not privileged to resist.\u201d Restatement 2d: Torts, Tent, draft no. 2, 1958, \u00a7 197, comment k. We assume that the statute evidences a legislative recognition of the right of a possessor of land to keep a dog for protection against trespassers. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the Legislature intended to bar recovery in a case like the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">2. In support of his motion for a directed verdict on count seven, the defendant contends that it is not possible to recover consequential damages under Gr. L. c. 140, \u00a7 155. He argues that the phrase \u201cdamage to either the body or property of any person\u201d must be interpreted to mean damage which is the direct result of an injury, and cannot include consequential damage which was sustained by the plaintiff John Rossi. A full answer to this contention is found in <em>M\u2019Carthy </em>v. <em>Guild, </em>12 Met. 291 (construing a pred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ecessor of the present statute, which, while different in some particulars, is essentially similar on the point in issue). There, in permitting recovery for consequential damage by the parent of a child bitten by a dog, it was said: \u201cThe object of the statute is to protect from injury by dogs. . . . But it is quite apparent that a remedy, confined to the case of an injury to the person, and to be enforced only by an action in the name of such person, would fall short of giving complete redress for injuries by dogs. . . . [The statute] provides an adequate remedy for the entire damages that may result from any such injuries]. The parent . . . will recover his appropriate damages, and the minor . . . will, in his own name, recover for the personal suffering.\u201d PP. 292-293. Compare <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>273 Mass. 146, 154-155; <em>Zarba </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>322 Mass. 132, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> The <em>Sarna </em>case held that where A was injured by the negligence of B on land of O, B, having no property in the land, could not defend on the ground that A was a licensee of O.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
