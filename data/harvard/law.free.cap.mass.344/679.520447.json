The declaration is in three counts. Count 1 is for causing an assault by imprisoning and restraining her against her will in Bournewood. Count 2 is for causing her to be imprisoned and restrained of her liberty in Bournewood for a long period of time against her will. Count 3 is for negligent diagnosis and treatment by a physician. The answer contains a general denial; allegations of contributory negligence and wrongful conduct on the part of the plaintiff; and allegations that because the plaintiff was mentally ill and in immediate need of medical treatment the defendant duly arranged for such treatment at Bournewood in accordance with G. L. c. 123. The judge found for the plaintiff on count 1, and for the defendant on counts 2 and 3. The defendant\u2019s exceptions relate to the denial of his requests for rulings numbered 5, 6, and 16. These rulings present the only issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">1. The sixteenth request was: \u2018 \u2018 The evidence warrants a finding for the defendant under Count 1 of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.\u201d The judge made only a general finding. Hence, if there was evidence which would permit a finding for the defendant, the refusal of the request was error. <em>Bresnick </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>292 Mass. 293, 298-299. <em>Quality Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>337 Mass. 150, 152. The plaintiff\u2019s brief does not mention this request, but is largely concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>arguing that the evidence warranted a finding in her favor. This, as we have indicated many times, does not meet the point. <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>314 Mass. 504, 517-518. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>315 Mass. 54, 56. <em>Brodeur </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>315 Mass. 527, 529-530. <em>Liberatore </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>315 Mass. 538, 541-542. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>317 Mass. 393, 395. <em>Rock-Ola Mfg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Music &amp; Television Corp. </em>339 Mass. 416, 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A preliminary analysis of count 1 is needed in the light of the judge\u2019s findings. The finding for the defendant on count 2 means that there was no false imprisonment. Count 1 charges an assault by false imprisonment, so the judge must have found that there was only an assault. The reference to false imprisonment in count 1 may be treated as surplusage, where the remaining allegations state a cause of action. <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>338 Mass. 603, 604. The immediate question now becomes whether there was evidence which would warrant a finding that no assault was committed. By \u201cassault\u201d the declaration is to be understood as comprehending an allegation that there was a \u201cbattery.\u201d The parties seem to have so treated it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruggles, </em>6 Allen, 588, 590-591; Restatement : Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The defendant contends that there was evidence supporting such a finding on three grounds: (1) authority conferred under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 79; (2) the written authorization of the plaintiff\u2019s husband for the administration of electric shock therapy; and (3) the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary application for care and treatment under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">We state certain pertinent testimony, beginning with that of the defendant. The plaintiff was referred to him by Dr. Frederick W. O\u2019Brien, who was treating her for cancer, and who gave him information on the plaintiff\u2019s marital difficulties and background. He first saw the husband in order to obtain some history of the plaintiff and to appraise the husband as a person. He then saw the plaintiff on October 30,1956, at Bournewood. He spent between thirty and sixty minutes with her in order to evaluate her marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>problems and to seek solutions. She told him, \u201cGod directs me in many things.\u201d \u201cI met with God on that Greyhound bus.\u201d She asked God, \u201cWhere have I failed?\u201d and the answer on the bus was, \u201cTell Bill to look within himself.\u201d The bus incident occurred ten years previously, but she stated in the present tense that God directs her in many things. On October 30, the defendant made a diagnosis of \u201cInvolutional psychotic reaction, paranoid type,\u201d and a final note that he would prefer her to have electric shock treatments, but not that day. She was then as much in need of temporary care as on November 3, but he would not sign the \u201ctemporary care\u201d paper with no member of the family present. On November 3 the plaintiff and her husband came to him at the hospital. At that time he felt that she was sick and recommended that she stay in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\u2018 \u2018 She refused, and the ten day paper was then signed. Doctors and nurses were called and they took her to a ward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In the \u201ctemporary care\u201d paper he wrote, \u201cThis patient has been manic in her activity and also paranoid. She feels that her actions are directed by God. She is in need of immediate hospitalization.\u201d \u201cIn his opinion, if at the time of the admission to the hospital, the plaintiff was not treated there would have been a possibility that she might hurt herself or someone else. That is a real risk in an involutional psychosis illness.\u201d On November 3 the husband signed a permit, authorizing him and the hospital to administer electric shock treatments. He did not believe that the plaintiff ever specifically gave such permission, but he assumed that the husband, despite marital difficulties, was authorized. The electric shock treatments were administered by the defendant on November 6, 7, 8,10,13,15, 17, and 20. A treatment causes a temporary loss of memory for the period immediately preceding, and consecutive treatments produce a greater temporary loss of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">If memory is affected, judgment is affected. The treatments had no other physical effects on the plaintiff. He was not present when the plaintiff signed the \u201cvoluntary paper.\u201d After treatments were started she showed good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>improvement. After the eighth treatment she was discharged with the definite understanding that she would return. Bight treatments were not enough, and it was a mistake in judgment to let her go. She went home, and never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">A written statement of the husband, admitted in evidence by agreement, was to the effect that on November 3, when the plaintiff refused to remain, the defendant used a telephone; that a nurse and doctor appeared, \u201ctook her by the arms and walked her out of the office\u201d; that she protested, but did not scream; and that she was not dragged, drugged, nor given a needle.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s own testimony in some respects was different. She drove her husband to Bournewood and met the defendant in an office. In a visit, which lasted one-half hour, in the presence of her husband the defendant and she discussed life, philosophy, what she believed in, and her troubles at home. \u201cWhile [they were] discussing these matters, three men appeared from somewhere and grabbed her. She did not know who the three men were; they were attendants. She rebelled and was physically fighting. . . . The attendants took her to one of the more serious ladies wards where hospital privileges were not allowed, and there confined her to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Dr. Charles Saltzman testified that he was a physician psychiatrist and acting superintendent of Bournewood; that he saw the plaintiff daily during her stay at the hospital from November 3 to 20,1956; that it was his diagnostic impression that \u201cthe plaintiff was suffering from an involutional psychotic reaction paranoid type\u201d; and that it was his impression that she was in need of immediate care and treatment. On November 12,1956, the plaintiff signed a voluntary admission paper. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 86 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 637, \u00a7 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Dr. William M. Konikov testified that he was a resident physician psychiatrist at Bournewood; that he saw the plaintiff on November 3,1956; and that in the course of the first few days of her hospitalization he made a diagnosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that she was suffering from involutional psychosis paranoid type, and was in the need of hospitalization and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On the testimony of any one of three witnesses, namely, the plaintiff, her husband, and the defendant, a battery occurred, when the attendants took the plaintiff by the arms or \u201cgrabbed\u201d her, unless she consented or the action was privileged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, 2 </em>Met. 23, 24. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruggles, </em>6 Allen, 588, 590-591. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 13. See <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>West, </em>281 Mass. 244. In assault the burden is on the plaintiff to prove lack of consent. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>143 Mass. 577, 578. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 13, comment f. But there is nothing to indicate that on that occasion the plaintiff did consent. Consequently, unless the husband\u2019s consent is to be deemed the equivalent of hers, there was no consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">(a) The defendant relies upon privilege under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 79 (as amended through St. 1941, c. 645, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>). The first sentence of this section reads, \u201cThe superintendent or manager of any institution for the insane may, when requested by a physician . . ., receive and care for in such institution as a patient, for a period not exceeding ten days, any person deemed by such superintendent or manager to be in need of immediate care and treatment because of mental derangement other than drunkenness.\u201d The third sentence is, \u201cSuch request for admission of a patient shall be put in writing and be filed at the institution at the time of his reception, together with a statement in a form prescribed or approved by the department [of mental health], giving such information as it deems appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">This statute, which originated in St. 1911, c. 395, was before this court in 1935 in <em>Karjavainen </em>v. <em>Buswell, </em>289 Mass. 419, where it was said (page 426): \u201cBy necessary implication the superintendent and manager who receive patients for examination under the statute are protected by the statute against an action for false imprisonment. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>[A]ny statute is to be strictly construed which purports to authorize a person or an officer of government to restrain for any length of time a person in the exercise of his personal liberty. So construed, \u00a7 79 requires by necessary implication that a physician, as also every one of the persons or officers named in \u00a7 79, shall act in good faith and without negligence whenever, acting under said section, they exercise the power conferred on them by that statute. Section 79 provides with particularity how such commitment shall be made, and plainly indicates that no physician, nor any person or officer named in said statute, should arrest and send to an insane asylum for examination and care a person who is merely insane, but not needing immediate treatment, and not dangerously insane or disturbing the peace. <em>Look </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>108 Mass. 121,123.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The trial judge granted the defendant\u2019s first and second requests for rulings: \u201c1. A physician, who in the manner set forth in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 79, causes the hospitalization of another, is not liable therefor, if in so doing he acts in good faith and without negligence. 2. A physician, who in the manner set forth in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 79, causes the hospitalization of another, is not liable therefor, if the person hospitalized was actually in need of immediate care and treatment because of mental derangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">These rulings have become the law of the case, and cover all that was laid down in the <em>Karjavainen </em>case which is presently material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not discuss this aspect in detail as the testimony of the defendant and of Drs. Saltz-man and Konikov would warrant findings of good faith, lack of negligence, and the need for immediate care and treatment with a reasonable possibility of harm to others. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, it is not the fact that the only basis for considering the plaintiff to be dangerous is that ten years before she had some communication with Grod on a bus. The foregoing analysis is equally applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>to a claim of battery based on the electric shock treatments during the first ten days which reasonably could be found to be embraced within \u201ccare and treatment\u201d in \u00a7 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Accordingly, it was error to deny the defendant\u2019s request numbered 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">(b) Whether the husband\u2019s consent constituted another reason why request 16 should have been granted we need not consider. We shall refer to the effect of his consent when we take up the denial of other requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">(c) The plaintiff\u2019s signature to the voluntary admission paper was a consent to all treatment given subsequent to November 12, it not being contended that she was in no condition to sign or that she did so because of any misrepresentation. See <em>Leggate </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>111 Mass. 308, 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">2. Since there must be a new trial, we shall discuss the effect of the husband\u2019s consent. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s requests numbered 5 and 6. The fifth request was: \u201cThe consent of a husband to the care and treatment of an insane wife, is in law the consent of such wife, and a bar to an action of assault and battery by said wife against a physician, based upon said care and treatment.\u201d The sixth request was identical except that the wife was described as \u201cmentally deranged\u201d in place of \u201cinsane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The requests are not based on any statutory procedure. They purport to be abstract statements of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">We are of opinion that they could not be given in their precise form, but should be qualified by the proviso that there is danger of harm to the wife or to others. This limitation is most reasonable in view of the many procedures established in c. 123 for the commitment of persons to mental hospitals or their admission for care and treatment. See <em>Mezullo </em>v. <em>Maletz, </em>331 Mass. 233, 234. See also 1956 Senate Doe. No. 700, \u201cReport of the Special Commission on Commitment, Care and Treatment of Mental Health Hospital Patients. \u201d Such a qualification was the view of Chief Justice Shaw who, in 1845 in speaking for the court in <em>Matter of Oakes, </em>8 Law Rep. 122, said (page 124), \u201cThe right to restrain an insane person of his liberty, is found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>that great law of humanity, which makes it necessary to confine those whose going at large would be dangerous to themselves or others.\u201d This case was cited with approval<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>3 Allen, 225, 229, although in the latter case the element of danger to the patient or to others was not discussed and apparently thought not crucial where a patient \u201cis capable of exerting no intelligent will or sound discretion in his own behalf\u201d (page 227). Cf. <em>Look </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>108 Mass. 116, 120-121; <em>Look </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>108 Mass. 121, 122-123. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that the husband could not consent in the absence of an emergency does not give weight to the existence of evidence warranting a finding that the plaintiff might cause harm to herself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">While much often turns upon local statutes, we believe that the majority of the cases elsewhere recognize the requirement that there be danger to the patient or others before summary restraint outside any statutory procedure is justified. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>321 Ill. 305, 316-318. <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>189 Iowa, 7, 12-14. <em>Boesch </em>v. <em>Kick, </em>97 N.
