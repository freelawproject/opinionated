In each case count 1 is for personal injuries, and count 2 is for consequential damages. Demurrers to the declarations as a whole were sustained, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We summarize the declaration in the first case. Count 1 alleges that \u201cthe plaintiff\u201d is the father of Jean, a minor; that the defendants are the parents of David Zaher, a minor; that David had a tendency and propensity toward assaulting, accosting, tormenting, and molesting young children; that the defendants were warned and knew, or should have known, that on previous occasions David did assault, accost, torment, and molest other children; that the defendants did nothing to restrain his dangerous propensities ; that on or about June 7, 1961, in Chelmsford David did assault, accost, torment, and molest Jean; that the defendants were negligent in allowing this to take place in that they had taken no steps to restrain his propensities; and that Jean was injured, \u201call to <em>his </em>[the plaintiff\u2019s] great damage\u201d (emphasis supplied). The second count repeats these allegations, and further alleges that as a result the plaintiff was put to expense for medical care and lost his daughter\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The grounds of demurrer are (1) the declaration does not set forth a cause of action; (2) there is no cause of action against parents for the torts of minor children in the circumstances alleged; and (3) the defendants have violated no duty toward the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The first count is defective. The action for personal injuries should be brought in the name of the minor by her next friend. See <em>Guild </em>v. <em>Cranston, </em>8 Cush. 506, 507-509; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Butler </em>v. <em>Winchester Home for Aged Women, </em>216 Mass. 567, 568-569; <em>Dellamano </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>308 Mass. 502, 503; <em>Myrick </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>334 Mass. 42, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A demurrer to a declaration as a whole must be overruled if either count is good. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>319 Mass. 372, 373. In count 2 for consequential damages the father is the proper party plaintiff. We are of opinion that the substantive cause of action in count 2 is good. Count 1, from which it is repeated, will also state a good cause of action after the allowance of a proper amendment substituting the name of the minor as party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We are of opinion that in circumstances like the present a parent is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent his minor child from inflicting injury, intentionally or negligently, on others. This duty of parental discipline arises when the parent knows or should know of the child\u2019s propensity for the type of harmful conduct complained of, and has an opportunity to take reasonable corrective measures. We have applied this rule in cases where the parent was alleged to have been negligent with respect to his child\u2019s possession or use of a gun or air rifle. See <em>Sousa </em>v. <em>Irome, </em>219 Mass. 273, 276; <em>Gudziewski </em>v. <em>Stemplesky, </em>263 Mass. 103, 105-106; <em>Sojka </em>v. <em>Dlugosz, </em>293 Mass. 419, 423; <em>Norlin </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>336 Mass. 553, 554. We believe that the principle is equally applicable where the parents \u2019 negligence is, as here, based on allegations that they knew of their child\u2019s propensity toward assaulting other children and \u201cdid <em>nothing\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) to halt it. <em>Bieker </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>234 Ark. 97. <em>Gissen </em>v. <em>Goodwill, </em>80 So. 2d 701, 703-705 (Fla.). <em>Steinberg </em>v. <em>Cauchois, </em>249 App. Div.
