On August 29,1960, a single member of the Industrial Accident Board entered a decision that the employee was partially disabled and ordered the payment of compensation. Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, as amended. On November 9,1960, the reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member, and awarded costs of review, including a counsel fee, against the self insurer. On December 28, 1960, the employee filed in the Superior Court a certified copy of the proceedings before the Industrial Accident Board. On February 27, 1961, a decree was entered in the Superior Court substantially in accordance with the decision of the reviewing board and also ordered the payment of an additional fee to the employee\u2019s counsel \u201cfor his appearance before the Superior Court.\u201d On March 14, 1961, the self insurer appealed from this decree and filed a motion that the Superior Court \u201creport to the Supreme Judicial Court for determination the questions of law raised by the decree of the Superior Court, as provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1949, c. 61.\u201d This motion was allowed on March 22,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The portion of \u00a7 11 (as now amended through St. 1957, c. 693, \u00a7 2) upon which the self insurer relies was added by St. 1949, c. 61, and reads, \u201cIn the event of a decree of the superior court . . . the court may, on motion of either party, by a brief statement of facts agreeable to the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>report questions of law raised by the decree to the supreme judicial court for determination. \u2019 \u2019 Compare <em>Pierce\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 649, 651-653. This must be read in connection with a previous part of \u00a7 11 which reads: \u201cAny party in interest may present certified copies of an order or decision of the reviewing board ... to the superior court . . .. The court shall thereupon render a decree in accordance therewith and notify the parties. . . . [T]here shall be no appeal from a decree based upon an order or decision of the reviewing board which has not been presented to the court within ten days after the notice of the filing thereof by said board.\u201d This provision first appeared (and in substantially the same form) in St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The record does not disclose when the self insurer received notice from the reviewing board of the decision of November 9, 1960. As there is no contrary contention, we must accept the fact that the self insurer did receive such a notice in due course. It follows that the self insurer never complied with the ten-day provision for presenting copies to the Superior Court, and under the language of \u00a7 11 cannot appeal to this court from so much of the decree of the Superior Court as related to the decision of the reviewing board. <em>Sciola\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 407, 411-412. <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412, 417-418. <em>Virta\u2019s Case, </em>287 Mass. 602, 606. See <em>Batchon\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 605, 606. This is not a petition for leave <em>to </em>appeal late. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 28 (as amended through St. 1960, c. 207, \u00a7 2). See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., petitioner, </em>298 Mass. 75. The provision for report by the Superior Court of questions of law based upon a brief statement of facts created an alternative simplified procedure on an abbreviated record. Compare Buie 4 of the Buies for the Begulation of Practice before the Full Court (1952). 328 Mass. 695. The provision does not create a new power in the Superior Court at any indefinite future time to make such a report in a case where there was no presentation to it of certified copies of the decision of the reviewing board within ten days of notice of the filing. Absent compliance with the ten day provision, no such report may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The self insurer is not foreclosed from an appeal from the order of the Superior Court for an additional counsel fee. See <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 63, 64-67. The merits of this question are not now argued, and the question is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The decree of the Superior Court as to an additional counsel fee is affirmed. The appeal from that decree is otherwise dismissed. The report is not properly before this court and is dismissed. Costs and reasonable expenses under Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
