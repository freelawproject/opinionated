Since the pleadings in the cases are substantially the same, they have been consolidated for purposes of appeal and are presented to this court on the record in the case against Louis Lesser, \u201cthe decision on appeal [to] he applicable to each case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">The declaration alleged \u201cthat the defendant by fraudulently representing to the plaintiff that he was not indebted to any other credit union, bank, of loan agency, either as maker, co-maker, or endorser, induced the plaintiff to lend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>him the sum of Nine Hundred ($900) Dollars, whereas the defendant was then indebted to other credit unions, banks, or loan agencies, either as maker, co-maker, or endorser, as the defendant then knew, and the defendant has since been adjudicated a bankrupt, as a result thereof the plaintiff has been damaged to the extent of the balance due on its loan.\u201d . The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was as follows: \u201cNow comes the defendant in the above entitled cause and appearing specially for the purpose of filing this motion moves that the action be dismissed and alleges as reason therefor that it appears from the pleadings in the case that the indebtedness alleged in the declaration accrued before the filing of the defendant\u2019s petition in bankruptcy . . that the plaintiff had notice of. the defendant\u2019s bankruptcy, and that the claim of the plaintiff was one provable in bankruptcy, that the plaintiff was scheduled in the schedules attached to and made part of the defendant\u2019s petition as a creditor in the amount of the indebtedness alleged in the declaration, and the plaintiff received notice thereof, and that said indebtedness was a claim dischargeable under Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, as most recently amended, and was and is discharged. Wherefore the defendant prays this Honorable Court that this action be dismissed, and for his costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We place no reliance on the defendant\u2019s characterization of the matter appearing in the record as a \u201cMotion to Dismiss.\u201d <em>E. S. Parks Shellac Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>265 Mass. 108, 110. The motion should be treated as a demurrer, since it raises a question of pleading rather than of process. See <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Boot &amp; Shoe Wkrs. Union, </em>285 Mass. 54, 55. It is not an answer in avoidance; it purports merely to set forth the consequences which follow from the allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe defendant has since been adjudicated a bankrupt.\u201d The defendant contends that the plaintiff cannot maintain its alleged cause of action because of the admission in its declaration of the defendant\u2019s adjudication in bankruptcy and its failure to allege facts which would, avoid the effect of a discharge under \u00a7 17a of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the Bankruptcy Act (11 U. S. C. [1958] \u00a7 35 [a]). The fallacy of the defendant\u2019s position is that an adjudication of his bankruptcy in itself is not sufficient to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The defendant\u2019s debt is not extinguished. His bankruptcy may affect the remedy of the plaintiff but to avail himself of it as a defence it must be pleaded in avoidance by the defendant. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 28. <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Buckingham, </em>165 Mass. 76, 78-79. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>182 Mass. 360, 362. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Abbot, </em>206 Mass. 270, 274. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>232 Mass. 188,190-191 (affd. sub nom. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>260 U. S. 592). <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Warwick Stores, Inc. </em>329 Mass. 406, 408. The legal effect of anticipating such a defence by a plaintiff in his declaration is similar to the effect of a declaration which shows on its face that the statute of limitations has run. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Warwick Stores, Inc., supra. </em>A demurrer does not lie.. See <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>299 Mass. 1, 3, and cases <em>cited; Stetson </em>v. <em>French, </em>321 Mass. 195,198. Consequently, we need not decide whether the plaintiff has alleged facts which avoid a discharge within \u00a7 17a of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Each case should stand for hearing on the merits. The orders of the Superior Court dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s actions on the pleadings are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
