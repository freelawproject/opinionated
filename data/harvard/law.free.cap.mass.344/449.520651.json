L. c. 117, \u00a7 24A, inserted by St. 1959, c. 584: \u201cIf hospital care is furnished to a person in need of public assistance by any person not liable by law for his support, the town wherein he resides at the time his hospitalization begins . . . shall be liable for the expense of such care necessarily incurred under this chapter after notice and request . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The report shows that the plaintiff furnished hospitalization to Christina Doucette of Chelsea from July 29, 1960, to August 13, 1960, the date of her death, at the rate of $30.79 a day; that at the time of her admission Christina \u201cwas in the need of immediate hospitalization\u201d; that the hospital on her admission made inquiry and \u201cwas advised that . . . [she] had no property of any nature\u201d; and that on July 26 Christina withdrew from a savings account $1,662.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The judge in the Municipal Court ruled that Christina \u201cwas not a needy person within the meaning of the act,\u201d and found that she \u201cwithdrew $1,600 from the County Savings Bank two days before she entered the hospital.\u201d The inference is warranted that the ruling is predicated on the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The judge gave other rulings which recognized the principle that a person having assets may nevertheless be in distress and in need of immediate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">The Appellate Division dismissed the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">The applicable construction of c. 117, \u00a7 24A, is set out in <em>Symmes Arlington Hosp. Inc. </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>292 Mass. 162, 164-165. The hospital is entitled to act on appearances. \u201cThe law does not contemplate that a person seriously injured or desperately ill, shall wait . . . until his wealth shall be appraised .... The town ... is made immediately liable.\u201d But that case also holds that it may not be ruled as a matter of law that \u201cthe expense for relief for the whole period of care and treatment was \u2018necessarily incurred\u2019 (G. L. c. 117, \u00a7 24), or, in other words, that the . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>[patients] during the whole period were \u2018in distress and standing in need of immediate relief.\u2019 G. L. c. 117, \u00a7 14. The burden was on the plaintiff to prove the need.\u201d The patients, injured boys, remained in the hospital for two months or more. It did not appear that the parents had been asked to pay. The court said: \u201cHowever improbable it might appear to be . . ., for all that appears the parents stood ready on request to provide for all expenses, so that continued relief at the expense of the plaintiff was not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In the case at bar the plaintiff did not sustain the burden of proof for the fifteen days of hospitalization. The evidence warranted recovery for the duration of that emergency which was recognized by the plaintiff on the admission of Christina. Conceivably this continued for the duration of Christina\u2019s stay. On the evidence, however, the judge was not required to conclude that that was so. There was nothing to show the nature of the illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The decisive ruling erroneously determined that, because of the withdrawal of funds prior to the hospital admission, there could be no recovery for any relief given by the plaintiff based on the appearance of immediate need. The evidence warranted a finding for the plaintiff for at least one day and for such further reasonable time as the judge should conclude was encompassed within the emergency on which the plaintiff acted when it admitted Christina.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\n<em>Decision of Appellate Division dismissing report reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\n<em>Decision is to enter vacating the finding for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
