The judge found for the plaintiff in the amount of $13,402.66. The defendant excepted to the finding, two rulings on evidence, and the denial of several requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">We summarize the evidence as follows: On August 3, 1953, Coveluzzi, a member of the contributory retirement system, responded with his company to a fire alarm in Eevere under a \u201cmutual aid plan.\u201d At the fire Coveluzzi was observed to be in an \u201cexhausted condition\u201d and later \u201cappeared to be in pain.\u201d On August 5, he failed to report for duty and \u201cwas reported sick\u201d; he never returned to duty after that date. The medical panel\u2019s report showed that Coveluzzi was suffering from heart trouble. On June 30, 1954, Coveluzzi filed an application for accidental disability retirement with the Everett retirement board, and the board voted to grant him a pension as of July 31, 1954. There was no evidence of any notice given to the defendant of the retirement hearing. It was agreed by counsel that proper notices were sent to the defendant\u2019s treasurer with reference to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for reimbursement under the provisions of C. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (4) (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Some time between 1922 and 1925 the chiefs of the fire departments of Everett, Chelsea, and Eevere met for the purpose of establishing a mutual aid plan. Under the plan \u201cthe fire alarm systems of each municipality were connected with each other so that an alarm which was sounded in Eevere would also be recorded in [the alarm system of] Chelsea and . . . Everett.\u201d Assignment cards were drawn up which provided that \u201cwhen an alarm was rung in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>one of the cities under the mutual aid plan each respective city would perform the assignment designated by said cards.\u201d Coveluzzi came to the fire in Severe on August 3, 1953, in accordance with the prearranged assignment prescribed in these cards. A city not a party to the mutual aid system would have to call upon another city for aid and the furnishing of such aid by the city called upon would rest in the discretion of its fire chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The judge found that Coveluzzi, since deceased, \u201cwas a member of the contributory retirement system at the time of his injuries as covered by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (4) (a) and (b),\u201d and that with respect to his \u201celigibility to receive the accrued benefits all matters have been complied with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s case is grounded on G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (4) (a) and (b) (as appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 l),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which imposes a mandatory requirement on a governmental unit receiving assistance to reimburse the assisting governmental unit for any pensions paid on account of injuries to its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The defendant requested rulings that \u201c3. This cause is covered by the provisions of G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 59A.\u201d and <em>\u201c4. </em>The law of c. 32, \u00a7 7 (4) (a) and (b), is not applicable in this action.\u201d These requests were denied. It is the defendant\u2019s contention that G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 59A (as amended through St. 1960, c. 14),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> controls, in which event reimbursement by the city of Revere would not be mandatory, for \u00a7 59A provides that \u201c [a]ny city . . . aided under and in accordance with this section . . . <em>may </em>reimburse . . . [any city rendering aid under this section] in whole or in part for any payments lawfully made to any member of its fire department ... on account of injuries or death suffered by him in the course of rendering aid as aforesaid or of death resulting from such injuries\u201d [emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We are of opinion that G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 59A, governs rather than G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (4). The former deals specifically and in detail with the subject of mutual aid between fire departments ; the latter is a general provision dealing with any aid rendered by one governmental unit to another. The statutes to some extent overlap, for the aid mentioned in \u00a7 7 (4) could include fire protection; but it could include many other kinds of assistance. The schemes under each, however, are quite different. As the defendant argues, the \u201cwhole purpose ... of the mutual aid plan [established under \u00a7 59A] is to create an enduring obligation with the respective benefits and burdens clearly established and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>agreed upon between the . . . [municipalities].\u201d Under \u00a7 7 (4) the aid that one unit would be called upon to give to another would be discretionary and not in pursuance of a prearranged plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The evidence establishes that the aid furnished by the plaintiff in the case at bar was pursuant to a mutual aid plan, and no contention is made to the contrary. If we were to construe e. 32 as covering the case at bar, then G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 59A, would, for all practical purposes, be nugatory. We do not believe the Legislature intended such a result, especially in view of the fact that \u00a7 59A was amended as recently as 1960. \u201cA statute is to be interpreted with reference to the preexisting law. ... If reasonably practicable, it is to be explained in conjunction with other statutes to the end that there may be an harmonious and consistent body of law. . . . Statutes\u2018alleged to be inconsistent with each other, in whole or in part, must be so construed as to give reasonable effect to both, unless there be some positive repugnancy between them.\u2019 <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street Railway, </em>200 Mass. 8, 17.\u201d <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>300 Mass. 244, 246. We perceive no such repugnancy here. The defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of its third and fourth requests are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">A question of evidence requires discussion, as it is likely to arise on a retrial of the case. Thomas J. McCarrick, who was the fire chief of the defendant\u2019s fire department on August 3, 1953, after describing the mutual aid plan, was asked: \u201cNow in connection with this mutual aid fire system, what are the arrangements pertaining to injury to firemen or damage to fire equipment of each city while responding under the agreement to a fire in the other city?\u201d An objection by the plaintiff was sustained. The defendant excepted and stated that the witness would testify that \u201cit was understood and agreed that each fire department would take care of their own firemen both as to injury and as to pensions and that each city would take care of the damage suffered by their equipment while at the other city fire.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Unless this evidence was excluded under the best evidence rule \u2014 and it is not apparent that it was \u2014 it should have been received, as it was offered to show the \u201cconditions and restrictions\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> agreed upon by the parties touching the subject of payment for injuries. <em>Passanessi </em>v. <em>C.

The treasurer of the first governmental unit shall annually, on or before January fifteenth, upon the certification of the board of the system from which such disbursements have been made, notify the treasurer of the second governmental unit of the amount of reimbursement due therefrom for the previous fiscal year and such latter treasurer shall forthwith take such steps as may be necessary to insure prompt payment of such amount. All such payments due under the provisions of this paragraph from the second governmental unit shall be charged to the pension fund of the system pertaining thereto, or if there is no such system then they shall be paid by such governmental unit from a special appropriation, and as received they shall be credited to or appropriated for the pension fund of the system pertaining to the first governmental unit.
