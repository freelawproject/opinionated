The defendant excepted to the refusal to direct a verdict for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On the testimony of the plaintiff and her husband the jury could have found these facts: The cat had been owned by the plaintiff or her family since May, 1957, was friendly and healthy, and had never bitten anyone. The defendant had treated it twice before. The defendant examined the cat on October 28, found it had wax in its ear, at first instructed that oil be put in the ear daily for a week, and said that thereafter he would anesthetize the cat and clean the ear, but then decided to \u201ctry to do it now.\u201d The cat was placed on the drain board of the sink in the defendant\u2019s laboratory. The defendant instructed his assistant to hold the cat\u2019s hind quarters and requested the plaintiff to hold its forelegs saying that he did not care to get scratched or clawed. The plaintiff put her hands on the upper forelegs, the defendant placed his left hand on the cat\u2019s head and \u201cfairly well covered\u201d it. As the defendant started to syringe the ear, the cat urinated on the assistant and \u201cwithin a split second the defendant\u2019s hand slipped off the cat and the cat bit the plaintiff,\u201d while the plaintiff\u2019s hands remained on the forelegs.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The defendant, in the course of a very different account of the occurrence, testified as follows: the assistant \u201cwas very capable of holding any animal that came into the office\u201d; \u201cI can hold onto the cat\u2019s ear and syringe the ear so no damage is going to come to her or anybody else\u201d; while he and his assistant were at work on the cat, the plaintiff, who had come into the room, seeing the cat \u201ca little unruly,\u201d intervened and was bitten; it \u201cis one of the rules, not to let the cats or animals run all over the place\u201d; after the accident he and his assistant syringed out the ear alone; he could have told the plaintiff \u201cto get out, but he had to be diplomatic about those things, and he did not [do so].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">This evidence shows no negligence of the defendant. There is no basis for concluding that it was not good prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tice to have the owner of the cat hold its front legs while the assistant held its rear quarter and the defendant its head. The defendant\u2019s preference for operating without the owner\u2019s participation, if inferable on the evidence, does not show negligence in permitting such participation. On the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony the operation proceeded in recognition of the fact that the cat might inflict injury. There is no basis for concluding that the cat\u2019s head became free because of any negligence of the defendant. He did not expressly or impliedly assure that it would not come free. His testimony of his confidence in being able to restrain a cat does not show his negligence in this instance. The plaintiff was injured by a recognized hazard of handling and inflicting pain on a cat and there is no basis for concluding that in good practice the risk should or could have been prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It is unnecessary to consider the other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
