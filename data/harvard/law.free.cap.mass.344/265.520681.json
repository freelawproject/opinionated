A verdict was returned, for the plaintiff and the case is here on the defendants\u2019 exception to the denial of their motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The defendants agreed that they were the owners of the premises in question on the date of the accident; that the plaintiff was a tenant; that the defendants were in control of the common stairways and passageways; and \u201cthat the plaintiff sent a sufficient snow and ice notice, which was received by the defendants within the time required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We state the facts most favorable to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had been a tenant of the third floor apartment of the defendants\u2019 building prior to \u00cd956 'ancT in February, I956pshe and her farnTly moved to an apartment on the first floor. There were porches at the rear of the house, one above the other, at the first, second, and third floors. There was a platform at the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s apartment. This platform was \u201c \u2018in back, coming down from the stairways\u2019 and there were four stairs going from the platform to the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">It had been snowing on March 16, 1958, but had stopped snowing at about 9 p.m. The plaintiff went on the porch at about 12:15 a;m. to take her dog out and as she put her right foot down to step on the platform \u201cit hit something and it just skidded under . . . [her].\u201d She noticed a \u201cskid mark\u201d where she had fallen and there was \u201csnow and ice and slush.\u201d Water was dripping from the porches above onto a \u201clittle mound of ice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The plaintiff did not notice the condition of the porches before moving to the first floor in February, 1956. About eight months after moving she noticed'\u201cthat the piazza was saggingWlittIS*Io^Hrftnbeamabove where the platform was\u201d and that'any time it rained \u201cyou could notice the water dripping from the piazza onto the. platform and steps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">After the accident, \u201cthere was a new beam and a new platform fixed onthe back porch\u201d and some posts supporting the porches were replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>With respect to common areas used by tenants over which the landlord retains control, the landlord owes to his tenants \u201cthe duty to use reasonable care to keep the common areas in as good a condition as that in which they were or appeared 'tolie atrthe time of the creation of the tenancy. \u2019 \u2019 Goodman v. Smith, 340 Mass. 336, 338. There was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the platform on which the plaintiff fell was part of a common rear stairway over which the defendants retained control.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the condition of the piazza which\" caused water to dripWhto the platform arose after the commencement of the tenancy. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Golburgh, </em>320 Mass. 309, 310. There was evidence from which the jury could infer that the sagging condition did not exist at the commencement of the tenancy but did exist eight months thereafterT <em>Griffin </em>v. Rudnick, 298 Mass. 82, 84-85. <em>McGeorge </em>v. <em>Grand Realty Trust, Inc. </em>316 Mass. 373, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The accident took place more than a year after the plaintiff noticed the sagging condition. The jury could have found that the defendants in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the defect \u201clong enough before the accident to have repaired or remedied it.\u201d <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>340 Mass. 336, 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">There was no error in the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
