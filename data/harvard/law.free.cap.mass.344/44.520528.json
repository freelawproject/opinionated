L. c. 278, \u00a7 33B, as amended through St. 1955, c. 352, \u00a7 1, from a conviction of murder in the second degree. The defendant, having waived a trial by jury, was tried before a judge on two indictments. In one he was charged with murder in the second degree. The other was for conspiracy with eight other codefendants to commit an assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>and battery upon a person unknown. The record does not include the indictment for conspiracy and no argument is made concerning the conviction on that indictment. The transcript of evidence includes all the evidence introduced at the trial on both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">There are eleven assignments of error. The first three are based on exceptions to the admission of testimony and the remaining eight to the denial of certain of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">There was evidence that a friend of the defendant, one Vincent Andrews, who lived in Watertown, had been beaten in a fight in Arlington on March 20, 1960. The defendant and a group of others decided to go to Arlington to \u201cbeat up \u2019 \u2019 the \u2018\u2018 fellow who beat up Andrews. \u2019 \u2019 On the following evening, the defendant and eight others drove in two cars to Bruno\u2019s Variety Store in Arlington. The defendant was wearing his work clothes, in the pocket of which was a knife that he used in the course of his employment in a produce packing company. He also had a baseball bat with him which he had taken from his cellar that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The defendant and several of his companions entered the store. He noticed two girls and a boy with a broom in his hand. The deceased, Frank Theall, came from the rear of the store and asked the boys what they wanted there. Theall told them to get out and grabbed one of the boys. The boys then \u201cpushed him [Theall] out the door.\u201d A fight began between Theall and two of the defendant\u2019s companions. One of the boys was knocked down and when he got up there was blood on his arm. All the boys started to leave. \u201cThey were heading towards the parking lot.\u201d Theall grabbed another of the boys but the boy \u201cwrenched away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Theall started coming toward the defendant. The defendant pulled the knife out of his pocket, opened it and \u2018 \u2018waved it back and forth, slashing. \u201d The defendant testified that he told Theall, \u201c \u2018Keep away from me or I\u2019ll have to use it.\u2019 Then I stopped and I just held it out, and he came at me. He lunged at me, and before I could pull it back, I felt it go into him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>On cross-examination the defendant testified that he held his arm ont with the knife in his hand, the blade pointed forward and Theall jumped chest first into the blade of his knife. After the fight while returning to Watertown in the car, the defendant said to his companions that he thought he might have stabbed Theall.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Upon completion of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination, the judge asked the defendant the following question: \u201cWhen you and Mr. Theall were out there in the street, were there any of the other boys immediately behind you?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d The judge then asked, \u201cDid you ever turn around and run any distance away from him?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cI tried to get around him to \u2014 I didn\u2019t run back but I tried to get around his left, I think it was, to get to the parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">One John Mankiewicz, a police sergeant in the town of Watertown, testified as follows: On the night of March 21, 1960, he was on duty in a police car and, as a result of a \u2018 \u2018 radio call, \u2019 \u2019 stopped a Ford automobile. There were four occupants in the car including the defendant. They were ordered out of the car, given a \u201cpat search, so called,\u201d handcuffed, and taken to the police station. At the station, in the presence of another officer, Mankiewicz made a thorough search of the defendant, and took off both his shoes. He \u201clifted up and emptied the shoes\u201d and a knife fell out onto the floor. The defendant admitted it was his knife. Mankiewicz asked him about some stains on the knife and he replied that he had scratched himself on his left hand. Mankiewicz looked at the defendant\u2019s wrist and noticed a slight scratch.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Richard H. Keefe, a lieutenant in the Watertown police department, testified that on the night of March 21, 1960, as a result of a telephone call to his home, he went to the Watertown police station. There he saw the defendant, two other boys, and several police officers. He saw a knife on the floor beside the defendant. He picked up the knife, opened the blade and \u201csaw brown stains on the blade.\u201d</p>\n<author id=\"b80-8\">Cornelius J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP0\">Crowley, detective-lieutenant, inspector, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Massachusetts State Police, testified in pertinent part as follows. On March 21, 1960, he went to the Arlington police station and there talked with the defendant. The defendant told him that a number of boys were fighting with Theall; that the defendant took out his knife and slashed it around in front of Theall; that, \u201cwhile they were fighting, they got tangled up together and he [the defendant] felt the knife go into the man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">1. The defendant, by his first assignment of error, contends that the admission of testimony of one Joseph Baxter as to his conversation with some of the codefendants was error. Baxter testified that he was in the store when the defendant and the other boys entered; that he followed Theall and the boys out of the store; that he was stopped by three of the boys at a point about thirty to thirty-five feet away from Theall; and that a conversation with the three boys ensued. He was then asked, \u201cWould you tell us what the conversation was?\u201d The defendant objected and the witness was permitted to testify, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, as follows: \u201cI said \u2018Kind of uneven, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 and then one of the boys replied back to me \u2018What about yesterday? You guys put one of our boys in the hospital with,\u2019 I believe he said, \u2018six stitches.\u2019 \u201d Then the witness was struck in the head by one of the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in the admission of this testimony. The defendant was being tried for conspiracy as well as murder in the second degree. The declarations were made at the scene of the fight while the fight was in progress and just before the witness himself was struck. They were sufficiently spontaneous to negative contrivance \u201cor possible fabrication, and tended to qualify, characterize and explain\u201d the events. <em>Correira </em>v. <em>Boston Motor Tours, Inc. </em>270 Mass. 88, 91. <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Boston-Leader, Inc. </em>340 Mass. 195,196, 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">2. The defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error have to do with the testimony of one Bradley, a police officer in the town of Arlington. The witness testified that he observed the defendant after the defendant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>interrogated at the Arlington police station; that the defendant was sitting in a chair with \u201chis head in his arms on a table\u201d; that he was crying; and that his eyes were red. This testimony may not have been particularly pertinent, but we do not believe the defendant was harmed by its admission especially since previous testimony that the defendant had been crying was admitted without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">3. The defendant contends that the judge\u2019s denial of requests for rulings numbered 7 and 8 (assignments of error 4 and 5) on the ground that they were requests for findings of fact was error. Bequests numbered 7 and 8 are as follows: \u201c7. On all the evidence, it cannot be found that the Homicide was committed in furtherance or in the prosecution of the common object and design of the alleged conspiracy. ... 8. On all the evidence, the Homicide was not the natural or necessary consequences of the alleged enterprise or conspiracy.\u201d Each request cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>7 Allen, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The defendant argues in effect that a request for a ruling \u201con all the evidence\u201d is a request for a ruling of law as to whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of guilty. The defendant cites the cases of <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Gordon &amp; Gerber, Inc. </em>298 Mass. 91, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>306 Mass. 141, which establish the rule that in cases tried in the Superior Court, without a jury, the question whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding against a party is to be raised by a request for a ruling that the evidence would not warrant such a finding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>316 Mass. 563, 564; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slome, </em>321 Mass. 713, 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Assuming the requests raised the question of sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a finding of guilty, there was no error in the denial of such requests. Under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, \u201cMurder which does not appear to be in the first degree is murder in the second degree.\u201d It has been judicially defined as an \u201cunlawful killing with malice aforethought.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bedrosian, </em>247 Mass. 573, 576. \u201cMalice\u201d as it is used in this definition includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cevery . . . unlawful and unjustifiable motive\u201d and is \u201cimplied from any deliberate or cruel act against another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 304. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>333 Mass. 83, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We have examined the complete transcript and are of opinion that there was ample evidence to warrant a finding of guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>333 Mass. 640, 647-648, cert. den. sub nom. <em>Boisvert </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>352 U. S. 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">4. The judge denied certain of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings (assignments 6, 9,10, and 11) on the ground that \u201ceven if abstractly correct, they are not applicable to the facts found.\u201d The granting of other requests indicates that the judge was not misinformed as to the law. In view of our determination that the evidence warranted a finding of guilty, \u201cnone of the rulings deemed inapplicable can be said to have been required as matter of law. There was no error in the disposal of the requests.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>340 Mass. 754, 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">5. Assignments 7 and 8 have not been argued by the defendant and are deemed waived. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>327 Mass. 641, 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
