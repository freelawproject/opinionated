G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 265, \u00a7 15A. This crime was a felony. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 274, \u00a7 1. The case was made subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. The defendant appealed, and filed an assignment of errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">1. Assignments 3,4, and 5 are based upon the admission in evidence of the knife which, it is asserted, was obtained as the result of an illegal search and seizure by two police officers of the city of Lynn which was made at the defendant\u2019s house on October 15, 1961. The defendant relies upon <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, which had been decided on June 19, 1961. So, there is no question as to retroactive effect, as in <em>Dirring, petitioner, </em>decided this day, <em>ante, </em>522.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">There was, however, no error. The Commonwealth does not take the position that the officers had either a search warrant or a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. But a search warrant was not required if, as the Commonwealth contends, the knife was discovered in a reasonable search incident to a lawful arrest. <em>Agnello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>269 U. S. 20, 30. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56, 60-64. <em>Abel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 217, 235-237.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The police officers could arrest the defendant without a warrant if they reasonably believed that he had committed a felony. <em>Muniz </em>v. <em>Mehlman, </em>327 Mass. 353, 356, and cases cited. The evidence indicates (1) such reasonable belief and (2) that an arrest in fact occurred. The defendant had spent the day off and on with Carter and one Jordan, at times drinking intoxicating liquor. In the evening they were in the apartment of Jordan and Carter. The defendant made two attempts to go upstairs where a girl had a room. Jordan then ordered him to leave the house, and a brawl ensued during which Carter, who had stepped between the antagonists, received cuts on the head, hand, and chest requiring seventeen stitches. The defendant drove to his house, where later his wife admitted the two officers, who had received information as to the foregoing. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>conducted them to a bedroom where the defendant was asleep. They woke him up, asked if there had been a fight, and said that \u201chis name was mentioned,\u201d and that they would like to \u201cget it cleared up.\u201d While assisting him to dress, they had to hold him up. Upon finding a knife in his pocket as they helped him dress, they asked \u201cif this was the knife he used.\u201d He replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know; it might be.\u201d They said that they were taking him to the hospital to be identified by Carter. He went voluntarily. After questioning at the hospital he was taken to the police station for further interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">(1) The officers clearly could have reasonably believed that the defendant had committed a felony. (2) The facts fall within the rule that \u201c [t]o constitute an arrest there must be either a physical seizure of the person by the arresting officer, or a submission to his authority and control.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Boston Pub. Co. </em>285 Mass. 344, 349. See <em>French </em>v. <em>Bancroft, </em>1 Met. 502, 504; <em>Whithead </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>3 Allen, 495, 501; <em>Mowry </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>100 Mass. 79, 85; <em>Muniz </em>v. <em>Mehlman, </em>327 Mass. 353, 354-356; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 112, 128; Voorhees, Law of Arrest (2d ed.) 59-76. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merrick, </em>255 Mass. 510, 512-513. The defendant does not contend that he did not know that he was arrested. He could not rightly do so. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Boston Pub. Co., supra, </em>349-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Although the word \u201carrest\u201d was not used either at this time or later in the officers\u2019 testimony, that was not necessary. <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>State, </em>64 Texas Crim. App. 114,117. Restatement : Torts, \u00a7 128, comment a.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">2. The first assignment of error hardly merits discussion. It is to a question asked Jordan on direct examination when called as a witness for the prosecution: \u201cWas there a reason why you asked him [the defendant] to leave?\u201d The answer was, \u201cAt that moment, I just didn\u2019t like his attitude, that\u2019s all.\u201d The question was proper. It elicited nothing harmful to the defendant, who even now argues only on the ground of relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
