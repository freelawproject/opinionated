I do not find he was a needy person within the meaning of the act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>This, read with other rulings given, we construe to be, in effect, a ruling that the hospital could not recover for the expenses of furnishing emergency relief to an apparent pauper on September 4 and for the duration of the emergency recognized in the acceptance of Joseph as a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">This was error for the reasons stated in the preceding case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>Decision of Appellate Division dismissing report reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Decision is to enter vacating the finding for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
