See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 248, \u00a7 1. In 1958 he was convicted in the Superior Court of felonies described in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 266, \u00a7 49 (possession of burglarious implements), and in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, as amended through St. 1957, c. 688, \u00a7 23 (unlawfully carrying firearms). Also in 1958 he was committed to the custody of the respondent to serve, and is now serving, two concurrent sentences. At the hearing upon this petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed on July 11, 1961, he sought release in reliance upon <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643 (decided on June 19, 1961), contending that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>there had been \u201cviolation of his Constitutional right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. \u2019 \u2019 The Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss. From a denial of the petition, the petitioner appealed, purportedly under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The judge found that the petitioner testified as to the search of his automobile by police officers on September 6, 1958, and the finding of \u201can assortment of tools and a loaded pistol\u201d in the trunk \u201csubstantially conformably to the allegations of the petition.\u201d He also found: \u201cHe did not know whether objection to the admissibility of the evidence of the search and seizure was made at the trial of the indictments. He was there represented by competent counsel. The petitioner did not satisfy me that he seasonably safeguarded his Constitutional rights against the alleged unlawful search and seizure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Attorney General argues that the findings of the judge are not before us on appeal under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. He cites <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>312 Mass. 442; <em>Matter of Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 191, 193-194; and <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>316 Mass. 187,191-192. We do not consider this or any other procedural question, because we rest our judgment upon a ground which goes to the heart of the petitioner\u2019s case and is decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Retrospective effect of the <em>Mapp </em>rule is enshrouded in doubt. We do not puzzle as to something which must be, for us, inscrutable. Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Muller, </em>11 N. Y. 2d 154. At the moment there is no occasion to do so, because in the present ease no issue as to illegally seized evidence was brought here by an appropriate appellate procedure (see <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>337 Mass. 264, 266-270) following the trial of the indictments. Indeed, it does not appear that any motion to suppress or objection was made either before (see <em>Segurola </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U. S. 106, 111-112) or at that trial. Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Friola, </em>11 N. Y. 2d 157. There is no issue as to jurisdiction, and the question of law is raised for the first time in this petition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skalberg, </em>333 Mass. 255, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The petitioner derives no aid from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>Spofford, </em>343 Mass. 703, where in the Superior Court the admissibility of illegally seized evidence was properly challenged in what might be described as optimistic anticipation of the <em>Mapp </em>decision. After the <em>Mapp </em>decision, we heard the <em>Spofford </em>appeal, which came before us, as we said at page 707, \u201cin regular course for decision on the law as it presently stands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
