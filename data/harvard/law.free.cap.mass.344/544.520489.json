The judge made a report of the material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">The pertinent findings of the judge are herewith summarized. The petitioner, John P. Duclos, is the father of three minor children: Jacqueline P., born on September 29, 1947; Diane M., born on August 6, 1948; and Mary Ann, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>born on March 13,1951. The mother of these children died on April 9,1956. The parents had domestic difficulties and separated early in 1951. Soon after the parents separated and five weeks after Mary Ann was born, she was placed by the Worcester Children\u2019s Friend Society in the home of the respondent. On May 3,1952, the petitioner placed his other two children in the same home and also \u201cat that time he went to live in this home with his children. \u2019 \u2019 The petitioner was a discouraged and disturbed man. The respondent \u201chad come to love these children and gave them as good care as she gave her own two children. \u2019 \u2019 In 1957, with the consent of the petitioner, the respondent was appointed guardian of the children. Early in 1961 the petitioner went to Brattleboro, Vermont, and obtained employment with the same company he had worked for in Massachusetts. He took a training course with \u201csome assurance that within six months he would be a district manager. \u2019 \u2019 While in Vermont \u201che met a woman he had courted years before he had married. \u2019 \u2019 She, too, had married but her husband had died \u201cs\u00e9ven years ago.\u201d She had five children and \u201cbeing an energetic and intelligent . . . person -. . . kept her family together.\u201d She is a \u201cwoman of marked intelligence and excellent reputation . . . who loves children.\u201d They decided to marry.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On March 17, 1961, the petitioner filed a petition in the Probate Court for the removal of the respondent as guardian of the children. \u201cAs the summer school vacation approached,\u201d the probate judge \u201csuggested that the children spend part of this period with the . . . [petitioner] in his new home in Vermont.\u201d Two of the children were there for a time and the older two \u201cdecided they wished to live with\u201d the petitioner. The respondent \u201cagreed . . . [to] abide by the wishes of the children and thus was reconciled to their desire\u201d to live with their father \u201cbut she did not agree that the youngest child,\u201d Mary Ann, should go to live with the petitioner. Mary Ann, <em>\u20181 </em>after spending some days with her sisters and father in the Vermont home announced, but not too strenuously, that she did not wish to live in the Vermont home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The judge also found that the petitioner is not an unfit person; that \u201che is now in a position to better his condition and that he is able to properly care for his three children and that the welfare of the children warrants . . . removing . . . [the] guardian [respondent] so as to enable the father [petitioner] to have his entire family with him in his new home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The only issue before us is whether the judge was justified in removing the respondent as guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">General Laws c. 201, \u00a7 33, as amended by St. 1956, c. 314, \u00a7 12, provides, \u201cIf a guardian . . . becomes mentally ill or otherwise incapable of performing his trust or is unsuitable therefor, the probate court, after notice to him and to all other persons interested, may remove him. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The respondent contends that the judge was in error in ordering her removal as guardian because she could not be found \u201cunsuitable\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Unsuitability, as that term is used in the statute, is not to be adjudged solely by an examination of the character, capacity, and conduct of the guardian, as the respondent seems to assert. All factors should be considered and \u201cadjudged with reference primarily to the welfare of the child. \u2019 \u2019 See <em>Cassen </em>v. <em>Cassen, </em>315 Mass. 35, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">This is the paramount consideration. <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>227 Mass. 77, 87. <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>271 Mass. 545, 555. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 553. <em>Aufiero </em>v. <em>Aufiero, </em>332 Mass. 149, 153. See <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>343 Mass. 292, 294 \u2014 295, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Admittedly, the order of the judge is a distressing one for the respondent and perhaps even for the child. Yet it is \u201cimportant in the long view that the child should be reared with her own next of kin and in companionship with her own\u201d sisters. <em>Stinson </em>v. <em>Meegan, </em>318 Mass. 459, 465. This helps to create a normal family relationship which may well prove to be of inestimable future benefit to all of the children. We believe the judge was right in concluding that the youngest child should not be separated from her father and sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
