The offense is complete under the statute, even though the female may have been at the time of the offense the wife of another.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-5\">Id.\u2014Instructions\u2014Presumption of Truthfulness\u2014Rebuttal by Bias and Prejudice.\u2014A charge by the court that \u201cthe presumption that a witness speaks the truth may be repelled by his interest in the case, if any, or his bias or prejudice, if any,\u201d though it goes beyond section 1847 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is not, therefore, error; and it amounts only to telling the jury that interest and bias may be considered in weighing the testimony.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-6\">Id.\u2014Belief of Prosecutrix\u2014Reasonable Doubt.\u2014The court properly instructed the jury: \u201cIf you believe the prosecutrix, and are satisfied from all the evidence in the case, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt, then you should so find.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-7\">Id.\u2014Instruction as to \u201cPenetration\u201d\u2014Omission of \u201cSexual\u201d not Prejudicial.\u2014An instruction that \u201cproof of any penetration, however slight, is sufficient in a ease of rape,\u201d is not rendered prejudicial by the omission of the word \u201csexual\u201d preceding the word \u201cpenetration,\u201d where, in view of the other instructions defining the offense, and which must be read in connection therewith, it was clearly disclosed to the jury that \u201csexual penetration\u201d was referred to in such instruction.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-8\">Id.\u2014Construction of Penal Code\u2014\u201cSexual Penetration\u201d\u2014Provision Inclusive of Offense Charged.\u2014The provision in section 263 of the Penal Code that \u201cany sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime,\u201d refers to every definition of \u201crape\u201d contained in section 261 of that code, including the offense here charged, of \u201crape\u201d by \u201csexual intercourse with a female under the age of sixteen years.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-9\">Id.\u2014Constitutionality of Offense\u2014Knowledge\u2014Motive\u2014Criminal Intent.\u2014Section 261 of the Penal Code, defining the offense charged, is not unconstitutional in making the act of sexual intercourse with a female under the age of sixteen years a felony, independent of whether or not the accused intended any crime, or had any notice or knowledge of any fact or facts which would constitute his acts a crime. In such ease, the illegal motive is present, and becomes a criminal intent, when the facts, at whose peril he acts, are shown to exist.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-10\">Id.\u2014Protection of Society and Family\u2014Estoppel of Offender.\u2014 The protection of society, of the family, and of the infant, demands that one who has carnal intercourse with an infant shall do so in peril of the fact, and he will not be heard against the evidence to urge his belief that the victim of his outrage had passed the period which would make his act a crime.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, and from an order denying a new trial.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYB\">Defendant was convicted of rape committed upon a female child under the age of sixteen years. He appeals from the judgment and order denying a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The information filed, and upon which defendant was tried, charged that the offense was committed \u201con or about the 12th day of October, 1907.\u201d It is insisted that the information is defective because the precise time was not stated. This is not necessary under section 955 of the Penal Code, except where the time is a material ingredient in the offense. That it is not such an ingredient, where rape by means of force is charged, is determined in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>102 Cal. 382, [36 Pac. 661]. No convincing reason is suggested why a different rule should apply where the female is by statute rendered incapable of consent. The information charges that at the time of the commission of the act the female was under the age of consent, and it clearly appears that the offense was committed within the three years immediately preceding the filing of the information. This is sufficient. It is unnecessary to allege that the female had never been married to anyone before the commission of the act. It is sufficient to aver and prove that she was under the age of consent and not at the time the wife of the one having sexual intercourse with her. The offense is complete under the statute, even though the female may have been at the time the wife of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The charge of the court, \u201cthat the presumption that a witness speaks the truth may be repelled by his interest in the case, if any, or his bias or prejudice, if any,\u201d while it goes beyond section 1847, Code of Civil Procedure, is not therefore error. \u201cIt amounts only to telling them (the jury) that interest and bias may be considered by them in weighing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>testimony, as undoubtedly may be done.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Amaya, </em>134 Cal. 540, [66 Pac. 794].)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We see no error in the charge which instructed, \u201cif you believe the prosecutrix, and are satisfied from all of the evidence in the case, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt, then you should so find\u201d; nor in that other charge, \u201cthat proof of any penetration, however slight, is sufficient in a case of rape.\u201d With reference to the latter charge, it may be said the crime of rape is defined by section 261 of the Penal Code, and that part of section 263 embodied in the charge last referred to is applicable alike when the crime is committed under any of the circumstances set forth in section 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The omission of the word \u201csexual\u201d as preceding the word \u201cpenetration\u201d could not have been prejudicial. As said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rongod, 112 </em>Cal. 673, [44 Pac. 1071]: \u201cWe do not regard the omission as material, in view of the other instructions defining the offense, and which, read in connection with the one under consideration, very clearly disclosed to the jury that it was sexual penetration which was referred to in the latter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The proposition advanced, that section 261 of the Penal Code is unconstitutional, in that it makes the act a felony independent of whether or not the accused intended any crime, or had any notice or knowledge of any fact or facts which would constitute his acts a crime, is met and determined adversely to appellant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ratz, </em>115 Cal. 132, [46 Pac. 915], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>117 Cal. 586, [59 Am. St. Rep. 216, 49 Pac. 712], wherein it is held that in cases like this and of kindred character, \u201cthe illegal motive is present, and that illegal motive becomes a criminal intent when the facts, at whose peril he acts, are shown to exist.\u201d \u201cThe protection of society, of the family, and of the infant, demand that one-who has carnal intercourse under such circumstances shall do so in peril of the fact, and he will not be heard against the evidence to urge his belief that the victim of his outrage had passed the period which would make his act a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">An examination of the record discloses no prejudicial error \u2022therein, and the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Shaw, J., and Taggart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
