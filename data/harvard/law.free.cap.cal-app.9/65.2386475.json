In the former case, communication of acceptance is ordinarily not required, but compliance with the condition of the offer by doing the act in the way prescribed is ordinarily sufficient evidence of the acceptor\u2019s assent, and it is not necessary to show that he notified the offerer that he accepted it and would perform the condition.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b100-6\">Id.\u2014Agreed Terms of Commission\u2014Letters\u2014Acceptance by Owner.

Please come to Fresno Monday, the 25th instant, and arrange details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201cJ. R BAIRD,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">\u201cAgent, 1823 Tulare street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The same day, June 21st, defendant by letter refused to sell the land, saying that he had changed his mind, and that the property was off the market. The uneontradicted testimony of the proposed buyer, one Droge, is that he was ready, able and willing to pay the defendant the stipulated price for the property on any terms of payment which he, defendant, would insist upon; that he so informed defendant, who, making no objection to the offer, refused to consider the proposition, and rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">Appellant\u2019s (defendant\u2019s) first proposition is that the contract sued upon is insufficient under the statute of frauds, because of the blank spaces therein with reference to the terms and amounts of payments. If this were an action between the owner and the buyer to compel a conveyance, it might be contended successfully that the blank spaces not being filled in, it did not as a memorandum contain all the terms of the contract, and hence was void under the statute of frauds. But in this ease, it being an action by the broker against the owner, and the statute of frauds requiring only that the authorization to sell shall be in writing <em>(Toomey </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>86 Cal. 642, [25 Pac. 130]; Civ. Code, see. 1624, subd. 6), and as the proposed buyer was able and willing to pay the agreed price, and offered to do so on any terms the owner might dictate\u2014under these circumstances it seems plain to us that the contention of appellant is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>If we understand him correctly, appellant next asserts that the letter of appellant of May 19th, stating that respondent might sell the property to anyone except to an Armenian, introduced a new term into the negotiations, which amounted to a rejection of respondent\u2019s offer, and a counter-proposition which required acceptance by the respondent in order to result in a binding contract between the parties. He further asserts that there was no acceptance of the counter-offer, and that therefore no contract resulted. In this he is wrong. There was not, it is true, an acceptance in writing, nor was it necessary that there should have been. It might have been indicated by acts, as indeed it was in this case, for the respondent not only showed his assent to the new term by conduct, but actually complied with it by producing a purchaser not an Armenian. The rule controlling here is thus laid down in 9 Cyc. 270: \u201cThere is a radical distinction in regard to communication between offers which ask that the offeree shall do something, and offers which ask that the offeree shall promise something. In offers of the former kind communication of acceptance is ordinarily not required . . . where the offer is to do something if the offeree will not merely promise to do but do something, compliance with the condition of the offer by defendant by doing the act in the way prescribed is ordinarily sufficient evidence of the acceptor\u2019s assent, and it is not necessary to show that he notified the offerer that he accepted the offer and would perform the conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In <em>Veale </em>v. <em>Green, </em>105 Mo. App. 182, [79 S. W. 731], it is said: \u201cEvidence that P. continued from time to time to make efforts to sell defendant\u2019s land after defendant offered him a commission for making the sale was sufficient to sustain a finding that he accepted the offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">There remains one other point to be considered. Appellant concedes that the letters constitute a sufficient statement of the facts of employment to satisfy the statute of frauds; and he also concedes that if this were an action on an implied contract respondent would have been entitled to recover the reasonable value of his services <em>(Toomey </em>v. <em>Dunphy, supra), </em>but he insists that the letters relied upon do not state the compensation to be paid the broker, and that therefore this action, being on express contract, no recovery can be had. Appellant had read and knew the terms of the proposed contract and the contents of the letter with which the contract was inclosed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In reply, referring to them, and having, of course, their contents in mind, he in effect said: \u201cProceed, but don\u2019t sell to an Armenian.\u201d With the exception just noted (not to sell to an Armenian) the reply of the defendant was, we think, tantamount to an express acceptance of each of the terms of the contract, including the rate of commission. \u201cA contract is to be construed as a whole (and) terms which can be inferred from a consideration of the entire instrument are as much a part of the contract as if expressly set forth there.\u201d (2 Page on Contracts, sec. 1118, p. 1740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Hall, J., and Cooper, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on November 19, 1908.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
