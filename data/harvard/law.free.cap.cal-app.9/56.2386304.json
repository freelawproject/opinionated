It does not appear that the trial court has refused to settle any bill, but, on the contrary, has refused to settle the particular bill presented by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">This court has no jurisdiction or authority, under this statement of facts, to interfere with the settlement and allowance of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">The writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
