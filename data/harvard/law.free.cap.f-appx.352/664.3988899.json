Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-27\">In September 2008, Arango, an inmate incarcerated at SCI-Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, filed a pro se civil rights action against the prison superintendent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Rhonda Winstead, alleging that her due process rights were violated in connection with a disciplinary proceeding. Arango claimed that prison officials wrongly accused her of sexual harassment and failed to follow proper procedures in investigating the incident, resulting in a finding of misconduct. As punishment, Arango was subject to a thirty-day cell restriction and she was removed from participating in a Sex Offender Program for six months. Winstead moved to dismiss Arango\u2019s complaint, and in July 2009, the District Court granted the motion, dismissing the case. The court concluded that Arango\u2019s due process claim was not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as it was precluded by the \u201cfavorable termination rule\u201d announced in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Arango now appeals from order of the District Court dismissing her complaint under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary view over the District Court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Santiago v. GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc., </em>417 F.3d 384, 386 (3d Cir.2005). Summary action is warranted when no substantial question is presented on appeal. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The assumption of truth does not apply, however, to legal conclusions couched as factual allegations or to \u201c[tjhreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere eonclusory statements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">The District Court ruled that Arango\u2019s due process claim was not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because of the \u201cfavorable termination rule\u201d announced in <em>Heck </em>and extended to prison disciplinary sanctions that alter the duration of the prisoner\u2019s incarceration in <em>Edwards. </em>Under that rule, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff cannot seek damages for harm caused by actions that implicate the validity of the fact or length of her confinement, unless she can prove that the sanction has been reversed, invalidated, or called into question by a grant of federal habeas corpus relief. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 646-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584. This bar applies not only to requests for money damages, but also to requests for equitable and declaratory relief. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). However, claims that relate only to the conditions, and not the fact or duration, of incarceration are not subject to the favorable termination rule. <em>See Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242; <em>Torres v. Fauver, </em>292 F.3d 141, 145, 150 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Arango challenges the prison officials\u2019 actions that resulted in her placement in 1\u2019estricted housing for thirty days and removal from a prison program. Because these sanctions did not alter the length of her incarceration, the success of her claim would not \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity\u201d of the fact or duration of her confinement. <em>Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 646, 117 S.Ct. 1584; <em>Torres, </em>292 F.3d at 150. Thus, Ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ango\u2019s claim is not subject to <em>the </em>favorable termination rule and is cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Although Arango\u2019s due process claim is cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, to survive a Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, her complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter\u201d to state a plausible claim of a deprivation of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[a]s long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise violative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not in itself subject an inmate\u2019s treatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight.\u201d <em>Asquithv. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>186 F.3d 407, 410 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 468, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)). Due process applies only where the conditions of confinement impose \u201catypical and significant hardship[s] on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Placement in administrative segregation for days or months at a time or transfers to more restrictive custody do not implicate a pro tected liberty interest. <em>See Torres, </em>292 F.3d at 150; <em>Fraise v. Terhune, </em>283 F.3d 506, 522-23 (3d Cir.2002). Nor does removal from a prison program, as restriction from participation in prison programs is among the conditions of confinement that an inmate may reasonably anticipate during her incarceration. <em>See James v. Quinlan, </em>866 F.2d 627, 629 (3d Cir.1989). Therefore, Arango\u2019s complaint, alleging that she was removed from a program and placed in thirty days restrictive housing, did not state a plausible violation of a protected liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">We have held that when a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, a plaintiff should be granted the opportunity to amend her complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 106 (3d Cir.2002). Given that, as discussed above, there are no facts to infer that Arango was deprived of a protected liberty interest, we conclude that it would have been futile for the District Court to provide Arango with leave to amend her complaint before granting the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Because Arango\u2019s due process claim implicated only the conditions, and not the fact or duration, of her confinement, the District Court erred in ruling that the claim was not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. However, a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal was appropriate because Arango\u2019s complaint did not state a deprivation of a protected liberty interest, and we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for that reason. Appellant\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-5\">. Furthermore, Arango was provided with both notice and an opportunity to respond to this very issue, as defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss argued that Arango's complaint failed to allege a protected liberty interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
