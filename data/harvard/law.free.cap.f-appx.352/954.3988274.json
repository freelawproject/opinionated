Hampton appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of t\u00fane to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Hampton argues that the district court erred in concluding that it did not have the discretion to grant him a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). Hampton\u2019s Guideline range was derived not from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status. PSR \u00b6 25. Accordingly, he was not sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and that section does not apply. Hampton\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
