We will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 (2008); 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Liggon-Redding submitted a motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>together with a one-page complaint alleging that appellee Roslyn Souser, a physician, \u201cmutilated\u201d her then answered her with a racial slur when she complained. By order entered July 9, 2009, the District Court simultaneously granted Liggon-Redding\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissed her complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Liggon-Redding then timely filed a motion for reconsideration, which we construe as a motion under Rule 59(e), arguing, among other things, that her complaint satisfies the requirements of Rule 8(a). The District Court denied that motion by order entered July 27, 2009, and Liggon-Redding appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">Liggon-Redding has appealed the denial of her Rule 59(e) motion, which brings up for review the District Court\u2019s earlier order dismissing her complaint as well. <em>See CTC Imports and Exports v. Nigerian Petroleum Corp., </em>951 F.2d 573, 577 (3d Cir.1991). Because the District Court\u2019s underlying order merely dismissed the complaint without prejudice, it ordinarily would not constitute a final order. <em>See Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951 (3d Cir.1976). Liggon-Redding\u2019s insistence that her complaint complies with Rule 8(a), however, indicates her intent to stand on it. Thus, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See id. </em>at 951-52. We review for abuse of discretion the District Court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 8(a), <em>see In re Westinghouse Secs. Litig., </em>90 F.3d 696, 702 (3d Cir.1996), and its refusal to reconsider that ruling, <em>see Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999). We perceive no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">The District Court did not specify why Liggon-Redding\u2019s complaint fails to comply with Rule 8(a), but it clearly fails to comply with all three sub-parts of that rule: it fails to plead the grounds for the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, it fails to state a claim showing that Liggon-Redding is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>entitled to relief, and it fails to request any particular relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1)-(3). Thus, the District Court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice was entirely appropriate. The District Court did not specifically state that Liggon-Redding had leave to file an amended complaint, but we have no concerns in that regard. Liggon-Redding gave no indication in her Rule 59(e) motion that she could or would amend her complaint to assert an actionable claim in compliance with Rule 8(a). To the contrary, her motion indicates that she already has litigated her dispute with Dr. Souser in state court and that she views her federal action as an \u201cappeal\u201d of the state court\u2019s ruling. Under the circumstances, the District Court acted well within its discretion in dismissing the complaint without prejudice, and we will summarily affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
