Krause, Texas prisoner # 1459103, filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that various local officials had violated his constitutional rights during his stay in the Galveston County Jail. In particular, Krause complains that Sheriff Gean Leonard allowed other prisoners regularly to beat Krause and that Nurse Cheryl Moffett failed adequately to treat his various maladies. The district court granted summary judgment in full to all defendants \u2014 including Sheriff Leonard and Nurse Moffett \u2014 and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">Krause, convicted of various sex crimes, currently sits in a Texas prison. His complaint, though, arises out of the nearly two years he spent awaiting trial in the Galveston County Jail. The story begins in the summer of 2003, when Krause befriended a teenage boy. Krause began homeschooling the boy and even invited the boy to live in Krause\u2019s trailer home. In December, Krause traveled with the boy to Wisconsin. While the two vacationed in Wisconsin, the boy\u2019s mother learned that Wisconsin authorities previously had investigated Krause for child pornography and child abuse. The boy\u2019s mother immediately arranged for the boy to fly home to Texas. Once the boy returned, he and his mother broke into Krause\u2019s trailer to retrieve the boy\u2019s possessions. The pair, however, also found in Krause\u2019s trailer various media containing images of child pornography. The boy and his mother took these images and turned them over to Texas police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-19\">Krause, too, soon made his way back to Texas. But, on December 9, 2003, the state of Wisconsin issued a Violation Warrant stating that Krause had \u201cabsconded from probation.\u201d The next day, Texas authorities in Galveston arrested Krause as a fugitive from justice and held him without bond as they sorted out the Wisconsin charge. On January 6, 2004, though, the state of Texas issued its own warrant for Krause\u2019s arrest for possession of child pornography. Consequently, Galveston Country Jail continued to hold Krause, now on a $50,000 bond. In November of 2005, a Texas jury convicted Krause of possession of child pornography, and the court of appeals later affirmed his nine-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-20\">This narrative, though, all serves as backdrop to Krause\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim in federal court, in which he alleges a litany of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>abuses that occurred during his confinement in Galveston County Jail. We, like the district court did, liberally construe Krause\u2019s pro se complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 in which Krause seeks both compensatory and equitable relief. First, he challenges the validity of the Wisconsin warrant and his confinement preceding the January 6 issuance of the Texas warrant. Second, Krause contends that Texas authorities violated his right to a speedy trial by keeping him locked-up for two years before his conviction. Third, Krause states that while he waited in jail unknown perpetrators stole valuable possessions from his trailer because Texas authorities failed properly to secure his belongings. Fourth, he accuses his jailors \u2014 and Sheriff Leonard in particular \u2014 of failing to protect him from attack by other prisoners. And fifth, Krause asserts that the jail\u2019s medical staff \u2014 and Nurse Moffett in particular \u2014 disregarded his serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Even though we review Krause\u2019s complaint de novo and in a light most favorable to him,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we find no merit in any of his accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">A. Unlawful Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"AGt\">Krause claims that the Texas authorities had no right to arrest him in the first instance. \u201cGovernment officials performing discretionary functions are entitled to qualified immunity from civil liability to the extent that their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Texas officials arrested Krause as a fugitive from justice on December 10, 2003. Krause, though, claims that he never fled in the first place, because he had received a travel pass in Wisconsin before traveling back to Texas in December of 2003. Wisconsin, though, issued a warrant for his arrest on December 9, 2003. Krause presents no evidence to show that the Texas authorities had reason to doubt the validity of the Wisconsin warrant. Consequently, Krause cannot show that the Texas police acted unreasonably in violation of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">B. Speedy Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">Krause urges that \u2014 by keeping him in jail for almost two years awaiting trial on the Texas child pornography charges \u2014 the Texas authorities violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Subject to certain exceptions, <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>directs lower federal courts to dismiss any \u00a7 1983 action that \u2014 if successful \u2014 would necessarily imply the invalidity of the claimant\u2019s criminal conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After waiting in jail, Krause stood trial for possessing child pornography. A jury convicted him, and Krause is now serving the resultant nine-year prison sentence. A determination here in Krause\u2019s favor would necessarily implicate the invalidity of his otherwise unchallenged conviction, so <em>Heck </em>bars his speedy-trial claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>C. Loss of Property</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Krause blames the police both for losing valuable possessions from his impounded automobile and for allowing thieves to steal from his trailers during his time in jail. As the district court artfully explained, Krause\u2019s claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. As long as the state provides for a meaningful post-deprivation remedy, then no constitutional violation occurs when a state employee negligently or intentionally deprives a prisoner of property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cIn Texas, as in many other states, the tort of conversion fulfills this requirement.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">D. Failure to Protect</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Krause alleges that his jailors deliberately failed to protect him both from attacks by other inmates\u2014including a group called the Gang Gladiators<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014and from spiders that perpetually hounded him. He emphasizes on appeal that the jail\u2019s overcrowding\u2014which regularly forced three men into a two-person cell\u2014 exacerbated his plight.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">As noted by the district court, a pretrial detainee can only succeed on a damages claim under \u00a7 1983 for failure to protect by demonstrating that prison officials have shown \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the harm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has explained precisely what \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d means: \u201c[A] prison official may be held liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of confinement only if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">Krause presents nothing on appeal to show that the jail officials disregarded a serious risk to his safety. To the contrary\u2014and as described by the district court\u2014the record uniformly reflects that the jail officials responded to Krause\u2019s requests for cell transfer based on perceived threats to his well being. Krause, therefore, has failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact in order to overcome summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">E.Failure to Treat</p>\n<p id=\"b962-17\">Finally, Krause alleges that the medical staff at Galveston County Jail did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>not adequately treat his medical needs \u2014 in part by refusing to refer him to proper specialists. The Eighth Amendment forbids prison officials from displaying deliberate indifference toward prisoners\u2019 medical needs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mere negligence, though, is not enough.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, \u201cthe legal conclusion of deliberate indifference ... must rest on facts clearly evincing wanton actions on the part of the defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Krause makes no such showing. In fact, as described thoroughly by the district court, the record shows that the jail\u2019s medical staff responded diligently to Krause\u2019s myriad medical requests.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Krause received a \u201cgreat deal of care and attention\u201d and \u2014 consequently\u2014cannot show that the medical staff caused \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A2t\">Krause\u2019s damages claims have no basis in either law or fact. Additionally \u2014 because Texas authorities transferred Krause out of Galveston County Jail after his conviction \u2014 the district court properly dismissed as moot his claims for equitable relief relating to his confinement in Galveston.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We thus AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to all defendants on all claims. Krause\u2019s Motion for Appointment of Counsel<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and his Request for Stay \u2014 as well as any other outstanding motions \u2014 are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b960-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
