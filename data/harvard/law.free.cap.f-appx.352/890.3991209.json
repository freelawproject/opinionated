Esquivel contends that the district court erred in refusing to award him the additional level decrease for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) Esquivel asserts that his case should be remanded for resentencing because the government declined to file a motion for an additional level decrease under \u00a7 3El.l(b), which he contends amounts to an \u201cincorrect application of the Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-23\">We review the government\u2019s refusal to move for the additional level decrease to determine whether that refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to a legitimate end. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 378-79 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2522, 171 L.Ed.2d 802 (2008). Esquivel does not contend that the government\u2019s refusal to file the motion was based on an unconstitutional motive, and a defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal is a basis rationally related to the purposes of \u00a7 3El.l(b). <em>See id. </em>Esquiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>el\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>Newson. See id. </em>at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The government has filed a motion for summary affirmance. In light of the foregoing, the government\u2019s motion is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
