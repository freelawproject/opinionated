Initially, Champion did not appeal his criminal judgment, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals later granted him authorization to proceed with an out-of-time appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">The instant appeal arises from the district court\u2019s denial of Champion\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition as untimely. This denial was grounded in the district court\u2019s determination that Champion\u2019s out-of-time direct appeal did not toll the period for filing his \u00a7 2254 petition or otherwise affect the limitations period found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Champion argues that this decision was incorrect and that the time for filing his \u00a7 2254 petition began to run after the conclusion of proceedings related to his out-of-time direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-22\">This court conducts a de novo review of the district court\u2019s determination that Champion\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely. <em>See Emerson v. Johnson, </em>243 F.3d 931, 932 (5th Cir.2001). <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009), which was decided after the district court denied Champion\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, is dispositive. <em>Jimenez </em>instructs that, in eases such as this, the one-year limitations period in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) begins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>to run when the out-of-time appeal becomes final. 129 S.Ct. at 686-87. As a result, the district court\u2019s contrary determination was erroneous. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with <em>Jimenez. </em>We express no opinion on the ultimate disposition of Champion\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
