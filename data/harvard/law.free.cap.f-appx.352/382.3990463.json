On appeal, Hudgins argues that our decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008), was incorrect because we held that statutory m\u00ednimums change guideline sentence ranges. According to Hudgins, statutory m\u00ednimums do not impact guideline ranges. Hudgins also argues that, because he provided substantial assistance, his sentence should be reduced for public policy reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Hudgins\u2019s guideline range was life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), pursuant to \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The district court properly denied Hudgins\u2019s motion for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his guideline range, which was based on the statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment, was not affected by Amendment 706. Hudgins correctly concedes that our holding in <em>Williams </em>controls the outcome of the case. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (holding that a</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201can amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commen-' tary elaborates that a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Section 5G1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, \u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because he \u201cwas subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
