First, Giraldo argues the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial. Specifically, Giraldo contends that he has satisfied the five elements necessary for a defendant to receive a new trial. Second, Giraldo argues he was denied due process because the government obtained his conviction using testimony it knew or should have known was false. Lastly, Giraldo argues that the district court abused its discretion when it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing on his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">I. New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">We \u201creview a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1151 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(en </em>banc). Motions for new trials based on newly discovered evidence are \u201chighly disfavored\u201d and \u201cshould be granted only with great caution. Indeed, the defendant bears the burden of justifying a new trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">A new trial based on newly discovered evidence is warranted only if: \u201c(1) the evidence was in fact discovered after trial; (2) the defendant exercised due care to discover the evidence; (3) the evidence was not merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence was material; and (5) the evidence was of such a nature that a new trial would probably produce a different result.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1294 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe failure to satisfy any one of these elements is fatal to a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">Giraldo has not established that his co-defendant\u2019s post-trial statement was newly discovered evidence, was not merely impeaching, was material, or was likely to produce a different outcome at trial. First, Palacios-Beltran\u2019s statement does not qualify as newly discovered evidence. As the district court noted in its denial, Giraldo was always aware of the extent of his relationship with Palacios-Beltran and Lim\u00f3n. In fact, Giraldo leveraged his defense on the theory that he was not Lim\u00f3n. Palacios-Beltran\u2019s statement does not provide any previously unknown information about Giraldo\u2019s role in the money laundering operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">Second, Palacios-Beltran\u2019s information would at most constitute impeachment testimony. On cross-examination, Marill opined that Lim\u00f3n was a code word used among the co-defendants. Palacios-Beltraris statement could potentially impeach Marill\u2019s opinion about the import of the word Lim\u00f3n, and perhaps cast some additional doubt on Manso\u2019s identification of Giraldo. However, mere impeachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>testimony is not sufficient to warrant a new trial. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 687-88 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Third, Palacios-Beltran\u2019s statement did not provide material evidence. Palaeios-Beltran twice instructed Marill to meet with a money courier. On both occasions, Giraldo met with Marill, and accepted cash payments as arranged with Palacios-Beltran. These facts supported Giraldo\u2019s conviction, and Palacios-Beltran\u2019s statement does not disturb them. Although Palacios-Beltran\u2019s statement may have somewhat supported Giraldo\u2019s claim that he was uninvolved with the $600,000 Memorial Day transaction, it does not directly impeach Manso\u2019s testimony that Giraldo was involved in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Fourth, a new trial would likely have the same result. Limon\u2019s identity was not the foundation of Giraldo\u2019s conviction. Rather, Giraldo was convicted because of the transactions he conducted with Marill. Because Palacios-Beltran\u2019s statement does not undermine the facts of those transactions, a new trial is not likely to result in Giraldo\u2019s acquittal. Likewise, Palacios-Beltran\u2019s statement is not likely to produce a different result at a new sentencing hearing. Although the statement tends to bolster somewhat Giraldo\u2019s claim that he was uninvolved with the $600,000 Memorial Day transfer, the effect is not enough to overcome Manso\u2019s testimony that Giraldo was involved in the transaction. Because failure to satisfy one of the elements is fatal to a motion for a new trial, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Giraldo\u2019s motion. <em>See Thompson, </em>422 F.3d at 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">II. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Due process is denied and a new trial required when the government obtains a conviction using material evidence that it \u201cknew, or should have known,\u201d was false. <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The district court did not err when it determined government witness Eddy Marill\u2019s testimony was not perjured. Giraldo has not shown how his co-defendant\u2019s statement proves that Marill perjured himself at trial. Moreover, Giraldo has made no substantial showing that the government knew or should have known that Marill was testifying falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">III. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">We review a district court\u2019s decision concerning whether to hold an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>89 F.3d 1433, 1443 (11th Cir.1996). When the resolution of a motion for new trial is clear, the district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1289 (11th Cir.2003). Moreover, the district court\u2019s familiarity with a case can allow the court to rule on a motion for a new trial based on new evidence without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>See United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 994 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Giraldo\u2019s motion for a new trial. Giraldo failed to demonstrate a need for the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his motion. The record shows that Giraldo engaged in conduct sufficient to convict him on money laundering charges. The fundamental facts supporting these convictions remained essentially undisturbed by his co-defendant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\">.
