On appeal, Brumfield argues that the district court erred by denying her motion to suppress a credit card seized following a warrantless search of her person, and that an \u201calleged confession\u201d she made shortly thereafter should have been excluded as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-22\">A ruling on a motion to suppress presents \u201ca mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 966 (11th Cir.2008). We accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, construing all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Id. </em>A factual finding is clearly erroneous if, after reviewing all of the evidence, we are \u201cleft with a definite and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). The district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts is reviewed <em>de novo. Steed, </em>548 F.3d at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. \u201c[A] basic principle of Fourth Amendment law [is] that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. McGough, </em>412 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Nevertheless, law enforcement officers may search an individual\u2019s property without a warrant, as long as the individual voluntarily consents to the search. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219-22, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). \u201cWhether consent is voluntary is a fact question determined according to the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Johnston v. Tampa Sports Authority, </em>530 F.3d 1320, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1013, 173 L.Ed.2d 295 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Relevant factors include \u201cwhether the person is in custody, the existence of coercion, the person\u2019s awareness of [her] right to refuse consent, the person\u2019s education and intelligence, and whether the person believes incriminating evidence will be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The former Fifth Circuit has held that \u201c[t]he mere fact that [the] appellant could see no benefit to [herself] in resisting does not make the act involuntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>647 F.2d 588, 591 (5th Cir. Unit B June 1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even so, the government bears the burden of proving an exception to the warrant requirement, <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>290 F.3d 1331, 1337 (11th Cir.2002), and must show that the consent was not \u201ca mere submission to a claim of lawful authority.\u201d <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Generally, any evidence obtained by unconstitutional searches and seizures is inadmissible in court and must be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d for the purpose of deterring police misconduct. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); <em>United States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1112 (11th Cir.1990). An exception to this exclusionary rule is for evidence obtained \u201cby means sufficiently distinguishable [from the illegal conduct] to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. 407 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Here, a totality of the circumstances supports the district court\u2019s finding that Brumfield voluntarily consented to the search and subsequent seizure of an incriminating credit card from her pants pocket. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, Brumfield (1) possessed at least a high school education, (2) was aware of her <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights and her right to refuse consent to a search, (3) had access to her cell phone and could have called someone for legal advice, (4) handed the card to an inspector who either asked or demanded to see it, but who never made a show of force to get her to comply, and (5) yielded the card despite its incriminating nature because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>she knew the inspector saw it sticking out of her back pocket. <em>See Steed, </em>548 F.3d at 966. The mere fact that Brumfield knew that the credit card was incriminating does not make it \u201cinconceivable\u201d that she voluntarily produced it, especially in light of the inspector\u2019s testimony that he saw the CitiBank logo on the card and that Brumfield handed it over without protest with a \u201cdeflated\u201d look because she knew she had been caught. <em>See Johnston, </em>530 F.3d at 1326-30; <em>Williams, </em>647 F.2d at 591. Moreover, Brumfield does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the inspector made no show of force in an effort to obtain her compliance. Thus, even interpreting the inspector\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d as an \u201corder,\u201d any such coercion arguably was minimal under the totality of the circumstances. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err by refusing to suppress the credit card and by finding that it was unnecessary to address whether her subsequent inculpatory statements were \u201cfruits of the poisonous tree.\u201d We affirm Brumfield\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\">.
