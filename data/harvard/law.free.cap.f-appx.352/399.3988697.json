Manning contends the district court clearly erred by applying the mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), instead of giving him the benefit of the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>2Dl.l(b)(ll). The district court denied safety-valve relief based on its finding that Manning was not completely truthful and forthcoming in providing information about the offense, a conclusion that was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a) enables sentencing without regard to the statutory minimum for certain offenses if five requirements are met. <em>See United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1344 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The burden is on the defendant to show he has met all the criteria. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). If he satisfies this burden, the defendant receives a two-level reduction in offense level. <em>Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d at 1344; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll). The fifth requirement, and the only one at issue here, is that the defendant \u201chas truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). A district court cannot apply the safety valve if it determines the defendant \u201cwithheld or misrepresented information.\u201d <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>199 F.3d 1281, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations and subsequent denial of safety-valve relief only for clear error. <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302. \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we \u201caccept the evidence unless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We must affirm \u201c[i]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We find ample support in the record for the district court\u2019s determination that Manning was not completely forthcoming. A reasonable factfinder could determine that Manning refused to admit supplying the crack cocaine for the drug deal because he is protecting his source. Franklin Mack, a co-defendant, stated that Manning supplied the drugs and arrived at their rendezvous point in a black SUV along with Mack\u2019s brother, Demetrius. Manning flatly denied that account, but Mack was more credible because he would not benefit from lying about these particular facts, which implicate his brother in the drug deal. Anthony Simmons, another co-defendant, corroborated Mack\u2019s story about the SUV and Demetrius, and added details about the existence of a bowl in which Manning transported the drugs. In this \u201che said, they said\u201d scenario, we cannot conclude it was clear error to credit the testimony of two witnesses over the self-interested testimony of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Manning argues that the district court had a clearly erroneous recollection of the record because it said the following: \u201c[I]t has been my experience that people that say \u2018to be honest with you\u2019 are not. And Mr. Manning often said \u2018to be honest with you\u2019 during his testimony.\u201d Manning said \u201cto be honest with you\u201d only once in his testimony, not \u201coften.\u201d But one misstatement does not render the district court\u2019s account implausible \u201cin light of the record <em>viewed in its entirety.\u201d Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504 (emphasis added). As discussed above, there were many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>reasons to find that Manning withheld or misrepresented information.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We are not persuaded, as Manning argues, that either <em>United States v. Alvarado-Rivera, </em>386 F.3d 861 (8th Cir.2004), or <em>United States v. Miranda-Santiago, </em>96 F.3d 517 (1st Cir.1996), compel a different result. Those cases are not binding in this circuit or on point. Both involved a denial of safety-valve relief based solely on the district court\u2019s intuition that the defendant had lied, unlike this case where Manning\u2019s testimony was contradicted by other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Because we find Manning ineligible for the safety valve, we need not address his argument that he was entitled to a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Manning was sentenced to the statutory minimum of 120-months imprisonment. Thus, even if he established eligibility under \u00a7 3E1.1, such eligibility could not affect his sentence. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1555 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
