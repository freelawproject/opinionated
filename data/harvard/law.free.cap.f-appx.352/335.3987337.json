On appeal, Likollari argues that: (1) the BIA erred in finding that his motion to reopen was time-barred because newly discovered evidence established changed country conditions in Albania; and (2) the newly discovered evidence established his prima <em>facie </em>eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to review claims not raised before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA\u2019s exercise of discretion was arbitrary or capricious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Generally, an alien who is subject to a final order of removal must file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the date when the removal order became final. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). An exception to the 90-day time limit is when an alien presents material evidence of changed country conditions that could not have been discovered or presented at the previous asylum hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii); <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). When an alien does not establish an exception to the 90-day time period, the BIA does not abuse its discretion in denying the untimely motion to reopen. <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150. Additionally, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen even if the alien establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case for relief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Likollari\u2019s motion to reopen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the record shows, the majority of the evidence presented could have been presented during his asylum proceedings, and the remainder of the evidence failed to establish changed country conditions. First, the affidavit of Likollari\u2019s attorney, Marina Meyerovich, could not be considered evidence of changed circumstances because an attorney\u2019s arguments are not evidence. <em>Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (holding that an attorney\u2019s arguments are not evidence). Similarly, Likollari\u2019s sister\u2019s and parents\u2019 affidavits both simply described events that occurred <em>prior to </em>Likollari\u2019s asylum proceedings, and thus, the evidence could have been discovered and presented before the IJ during Likollari\u2019s asylum proceedings. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Additionally, with the exception of one paragraph, Likollari\u2019s affidavit merely describes his situation in Albania <em>prior to </em>leaving the country. In the one paragraph about conditions in Albania since he left, Likollari says that there continue to be reports of threats to political activists and increasingly dangerous country conditions, and he heard that his uncle was murdered by Socialists in 2007. This paragraph, however, fails to establish changed country conditions because: (1) a continuation of threats means that the threats were occurring before he left; and (2) the documentary evidence Likollari submitted in support of his asylum application provided that political violence was occurring prior to Likollari\u2019s asylum hearing, indicating that his uncle\u2019s political murder was not a change in country conditions. <em>Likollari v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>178 Fed.Appx. 904, 907 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">As with Likollari\u2019s affidavit, the majority of the events and conditions discussed in the affidavit of Prenk Camaj \u2014 an alleged expert in the country conditions of Albania and other Balkan countries \u2014 could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>have been discovered and presented during Likollari\u2019s asylum proceedings. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319. With regard to the events that occurred after Likollari\u2019s asylum proceedings became final in 2005, the evidence is either not material or fails to demonstrate a change in country conditions. Specifically, Camaj\u2019s discussion of blood feuds is not material because Likollari claims he will be harmed due to his participation with the Democratic Party, not because of a blood feud. Additionally, while Camaj describes the country conditions in Albania since 2005 as chaotic and discusses several incidences of politically motivated disappearances and violence, Camaj\u2019s own affidavit confirms that prior to 2005 the country conditions were chaotic and that politically motivated disappearances and violence were just as prevalent. Further, in addition to Camaj\u2019s own statements demonstrating that conditions have not changed since Likollari\u2019s asylum proceeding, as noted above, the documentary evidence that Likollari submitted during his original asylum proceedings demonstrates that an unstable political climate, political violence, and excessive force by police officers is not a new development in Albania. <em>See Likollari, </em>178 Fed.Appx. at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Moreover, Camaj\u2019s affidavit was in direct conflict with the 2007 Country Report\u2019s assessment that there were no political prisoners or politically motivated disappearances. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the BIA to find Camaj\u2019s statements about the current country conditions unpersuasive to the extent that the statements conflicted with the Country Reports because this Court has held that the BIA may \u201crely heavily\u201d on Country Reports. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that the BIA is \u201centitled to rely heavily\u201d on State Department reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The BIA, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying Likollari\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because Likollari filed the motion more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s September 2005 order and Likollari failed to satisfy \u00a7 1003.2(c) (3) (ii)\u2019 s exception due to the fact that the evidence was immaterial, was previously available, or failed to establish changed country conditions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (3)(ii); <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319. Because Likollari\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the motion without considering whether Likollari was <em>prima facie </em>eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. <em>See Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">. We disagree, however, with the government\u2019s claim that Likollari failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not raising his \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3) argument before the BIA, as Likollari argued in his motion to reopen that his removal proceedings should be reopened under \u00a7 1003.2(c) because he had new evidence that established deteriorating country conditions in Albania. Further, Likollari did not abandon his changed country conditions argument on appeal; he expressly argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion because he presented new evidence establishing changed country conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
