The federal district court held that LeBlanc\u2019s petition was untimely but granted a Certificate of Appealability on whether the statute of limitations should be tolled for Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. For the reasons below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-24\">In its Order Clarifying Prior Order Granting Certificate of Appealability, the federal district court held that \u201cPetitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d The district court also held that despite his petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>being untimely, LeBlane has provided new evidence that may toll the deadline for federal habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">LeBlane points to only one piece of evidence which \u201ccould not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence\u201d and thus potentially toll the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). This is a motion in an unrelated proceeding where LeBlanc\u2019s former attorney-acting as his own counsel-requests the state of Louisiana to determine his own sanity. This self-interested and semi-farcical \u201cApplication for Appointment of a Sanity Commission\u201d is in response to an indictment against LeBlanc\u2019s attorney for extortion. The attorney states two grounds in his Application for questioning his sanity: (1) people he knows allegedly stated that he was mentally ill, and (2) \u201che would have to be insane to single out\u201d the alleged victim when there were more vulnerable targets. There is no evidence that this Application was ever granted by the court in those proceedings, nor does LeBlane point to evidence substantiating the claims in the Application itself. Consequently, we do not find this Application to be evidence of the attorney\u2019s mental instability. Even if the Application were taken as evidence of this attorney\u2019s mental instability at the time of its filing, it is not probative of the attorney\u2019s mental state at the time of LeBlanc\u2019s representation two years prior to the Application. Accordingly, the filing does not provide evidence of a factual predicate which can toll the statute of limitations pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">LeBlanc\u2019s remaining evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel consists of his testimony at the state court evidentiary hearing. This testimony recounts his attorney\u2019s behavior to which LeBlane was a witness during his trial. Assuming this evidence demonstrates ineffective assistance of counsel, LeBlane presents no reason why he could not have reasonably presented this evidence through the exercise of due diligence within the one-year period of limitation. Accordingly, this evidence, too, does not provide evidence of a factual predicate which can toll the statute of limitations pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">LeBlanc\u2019s conviction became final on November 25, 2002, and his application for post-conviction relief came more than one year later. The decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court cannot be considered a new charge that began a new finality date. And LeBlanc\u2019s ineffective counsel contention is directed at counsel\u2019s conduct before the trial court. Accordingly, LeBlanc\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is time-barred. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1) (providing one-year period of limitation to all federal habeas claims of final state judgments). Without a reason to toll the federal statute of limitations, we cannot look to the merits of LeBlanc\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) \u2014 (D) (providing exclusive list of statutory grounds for tolling one-year period). Furthermore, LeBlanc\u2019s claims of actual innocence do not present \u201crare and extraordinary circumstances\u201d for which we may consider an equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. <em>See Felder v. Johnson, </em>204 F.3d 168, 171 (5th Cir.2000). Finally, because LeBlanc\u2019s claims are barred by the federal statute of limitations, he has failed to show that the Louisiana State Supreme Court\u2019s decision reinstating his conviction is \u201ccontrary to ... clearly established Federal law.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
