Ford appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">Ford\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) applies in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings is unavailing in light of <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238-39 (5th Cir.2009). Also, Ford\u2019s sentence was based upon the career offender guideline. Because Ford\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, Ford was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was lowered by the Sentencing Commission through Amendment 706. The district court therefore did not err in denying Ford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
