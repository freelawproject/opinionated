On appeal, Canword generally argues that he is entitled <em>to </em>317 days of prior custody credit on his aggregated sentence, and without the 317 days of credit, his concurrent federal sentences became, in effect, consecutive. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">We review the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Regarding the BOP\u2019s decisions concerning the award of credit for time served, \u201cthe judiciary retains the final authority on matters of constitutionality and statutory construction.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Lamer, </em>60 F.3d 745, 747 (11th Cir.1995). In interpreting the BOP\u2019s construction of a statute, we use the deferential two-step process of review established in <em>Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Id. </em>If the statute is clear, we must follow Congress\u2019 unambiguous intent. <em>Id. </em>Where the statute is silent or ambiguous as to the issue in question, however, we must employ the <em>Chevron </em>\u201crule of deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). That rule provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\">[a] court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation by an administrating agency. Agency interpretation is reasonable and controlling unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Thus, [this Court] defer[s] to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-16\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">Section 3585(b) of Title 18 of the United States Code reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-18\">A defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">(2) as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the sentence was imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">that <em>has not been credited against another sentence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (emphasis added). District courts are not authorized to compute a presentence detention credit at sentencing. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 334, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Here, the district court did not err when it denied Canword\u2019s petition because he was not entitled to additional credit for time served on his first federal sentence between the date he was indicted in the second federal case and the date the second federal sentence was imposed. Pursuant to the clear terms of \u00a7 3585(b), a defendant can receive credit for time served only if the specified time period has not been credited against another sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). Canword already received credit towards his first sentence for the time he served between April 12, 1999, and March 3, 2000. Can-word had been credited with that time when the BOP aggregated the remainder of his first sentence with the concurrent portion of his second sentence, and the district court correctly found that counting it twice would have amounted to double crediting. <em>See Wilson, </em>503 U.S. at 337, 112 S.Ct. 1351 (indicating that Congress made clear in \u00a7 3585 that a defendant could not receive a double credit for his detention time). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
