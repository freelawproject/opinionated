No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">The Smiths\u2019 appellate challenges involve the admission of (1) post-arrest phone conversations between Brad and his sister, Adrian Adams, about Brad\u2019s desire to prevent a key government witness from testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>fying, and (2) Adams\u2019s testimony about what these conversations meant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government introduced this evidence to show Brad\u2019s consciousness of guilt. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 946 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Brad argues that the government gave inadequate pretrial notice of its intent to use the conversations and testimony in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); and this lack of notice prejudiced his ability to present a defense. Under Rule 404(b), evidence of unchai'ged \u201ccrimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d may be admissible for certain limited purposes \u201cprovided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Here, that (1) the conversations at issue did not occur* until the weekend before trial, (2) the government confirmed the threatening nature of the conversations only after the first day of trial had concluded, and (3) the government could not have obtained this evidence earlier through the exercise of due diligence, is undisputed. Brad also was able to review the tapes before Adams\u2019s testimony. We conclude that these conditions \u2014 coupled with the government\u2019s prompt notice upon learning about the threatening nature of the evidence \u2014 constitute good cause excusing the government\u2019s lack of pretrial notice; and the district court abused no discretion in admitting the evidence despite the lack of pretrial notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Brad also contends that the recorded conversations were subject to exclusion because of their low probative value: they were ambiguous, did not support an inference of consciousness of guilt, and were cumulative of Adams\u2019s testimony. Brad also argues that the probative value of Adams\u2019s testimony was outweighed by its prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">We have concluded that \u201c[cjourts may consider evidence of threats to witnesses as relevant in showing consciousness of guilt under Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Prior bad act evidence, such as witness threats, must meet these three requirements to be admissible: (1) \u201cthe evidence must be relevant to an issue other than defendant\u2019s character;\u201d (2) \u201cthe government must offer sufficient proof so that the jury could find that defendant committed the act;\u201d and (3) the risk of undue prejudice must not outweigh substantially the probative value. <em>United States v. Ellisor, 522 </em>F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. We have noted that the admissibility of witness threats is \u201ca close call\u201d because the potential prejudice \u201cmay be great.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1220-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Despite the potential prejudicial value of this evidence, we conclude that the district court abused no discretion in admitting it. The government offered the evidence only for the limited purpose of showing Brad\u2019s consciousness of guilt, and not to prove his bad character. While Brad argues that the conversations inherently were ambiguous and that Adams\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>corroborating testimony about their meaning could not be tested in a meaningful way, we \u201cdefer to the district court\u2019s determination that the [recordings and corroborating] testimony [were] credible enough to allow a jury to find that the [threat] occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1154 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">And many factors in Brad\u2019s case minimized the risk of undue prejudice. The court gave a limiting instruction to the jury that it could consider the evidence only on whether it indicated consciousness of guilt and admonished the jury that it was their responsibility to decide \u201cwhether to believe [the] testimony and what weight, if any, to give it.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1354 (11th Cir.2005) (considering whether the court gave an appropriate limiting instruction in balancing the degree of prejudice against probative value). In addition, Brad created doubt about \u201cwhether a threat was actually made\u201d by eliciting Adams\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that the conversations did not contain explicit threats of harm to anyone. <em>See Brazel, </em>102 F.3d at 1154. Given these things and that the balancing test of Rule 403 favors admissibility, <em>see United States v. Dodds, </em>347 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir.2003), we conclude that no undue prejudice resulted from the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Christopher argues that the district court\u2019s admission of the evidence against Brad violated Christopher\u2019s right to a fair trial because its admission created \u201cspillover prejudice\u201d against him, which the court\u2019s limiting instructions could not cure. Where, as here, evidence of an attempt to threaten or harm a witness is admissible under Rule 404(b) against the defendant who made the threat, the district court still must balance its probative value against the risk of undue prejudice to uninvolved codefendants. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1220-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Here, the district court \u2014 on three separate occasions \u2014 explicitly instructed the jury that it was to consider the evidence only about Brad\u2019s consciousness of guilt and that it was not to consider the disputed evidence \u201cin any regard as to\u201d Christopher. And the court received the jury\u2019s affirmative response when it asked whether each member could \u201cseparate out this evidence\u201d on each defendant. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>703 F.2d 1222, 1224 (11th Cir.1983) (the law assumes that jurors follow their instructions, and \u201cthe decision as to whether the jury can sort out the evidence relevant to each defendant is firmly committed to the discretion of the trial court\u201d). We reject Christopher\u2019s argument that this limiting instruction did not adequately cure any prejudice. <em>See id. </em>(concluding that the district court abused no discretion by admitting one defendant\u2019s threat against a witness under Rule 404(b), where it instructed the jury that it could only consider the evidence against the defendant who made the threat).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\">. In the conversations, Brad refers to \"cooking a steak.\u201d In her testimony, Adams stales that Brad wanted her to talk to their brother, Marlow, \"about cooking a steak\u201d and that she understood t\u00edrese words to mean to harm or kill a certain government witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-12\">. Brad did not object to this evidence on pretrial notice grounds in the district court. But the court's decision to excuse the government\u2019s lack of pretrial notice is supported under either a plain error or abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
