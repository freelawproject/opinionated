No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">On appeal, Franklin argues that the district court erred in concluding that Amendment 706 did not apply to him. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our prior precedent and acknowledges that he raises it only to preserve it for later review. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Here, the district court committed no error in denying Franklin\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion. Because Franklin was sentenced based on the career-offender offense level instead of the offense level determined by drug quantity, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>United States v.
