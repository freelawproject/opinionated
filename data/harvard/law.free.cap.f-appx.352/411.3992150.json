She contends that her sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and failed to articulate sufficient findings to support her sentence. Alter careful review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Garc\u00eda de Funcia pled guilty to being an accessory after the fact, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, and was sentenced in June 2007 to five years of probation. As part of her probation conditions, she was prohibited from using controlled substances. The conditions also required periodic drug testing, ninety days of house arrest, and participation in a substance abuse treatment program. In January 2009, Garcia de Funcia admitted violating her probation after she tested positively for cocaine and failed to undergo drug testing on three occasions. The court did not revoke her probation but ordered her to enter a ninety-day in-patient drug treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">A second revocation hearing occurred in May 2009. Garcia de Funcia admitted violating her probation based on another positive cocaine test. The government recommended a sentence within the applicable guideline range of three to nine months of imprisonment. Garcia de Funcia acknowledged that she had a drug problem due to depression over her husband\u2019s death, her father\u2019s cancer, and being a single mother. However, she argued that house arrest would be more beneficial than jail. She also suggested that medication might help her drug problem and requested an examination by a psychologist or a psychiatrist. The court responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">Counsel, this is kind of a unique situation, as you said. And the real uniqueness of this is the fact that your client has had the same probation officer, which rarely happens, from detention all the way through every violation, all the way through her supervised release. A probation officer who I know is accessible, caring[,] and not once, and Ms. Bofan is here to say[,] I need in-patient treatment but there isn\u2019t the program or I think I need some additional mental health counseling. All of that is there. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>What happens consistently, because as you said this isn\u2019t your client\u2019s first time at the rodeo. She waits until it is this crisis point and then she starts telling us all what the issue is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">Do I empathize with the fact she has had a death and issues, definitely. But the criminal justice part of this remains. Like I said, this case is unique because rarely do I have a chance to talk to the \u2014 rarely is the supervising officer the same officer who had the person since they first came into the system. So that\u2019s what I have here. I have somebody who has been able to follow her through all the permutations and the manipulations. I don\u2019t know if your client explained to you or described to you her last court appearance where she pretty much dared me to jail her and secondly pretty much said she was going to be back. So since she has fulfilled all of those needs I think it is time for me to fulfill mine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">R2 at 7-8. Garcia de Funcia rebutted that she was not a danger to society and had not committed new offenses. The court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">But she is. Eventually that is going to happen and we both know that. And you know that from your practice of this kind of consistent drug use. She has kids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">... She is going to end up when you don\u2019t follow one rule you end up not following others. And she is going to be in that situation where the next time she\u2019s going to violate a more serious statute and it\u2019s going to be like jail for real.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Following additional arguments by both parties and a sidebar discussion with the probation officer, the court concluded that \u201cI cannot allow the consistent violations of the supervised release, and I told you exactly what was going to happen if you returned and hopefully I\u2019m always a person of my word.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. The court then stated that it had considered the statements of all the parties and the violation report. Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the court sentenced Garcia de Funcia to nine months of imprisonment to be followed by one year of supervised release. The court then asked Garcia de Funcia if she objected to the court\u2019s findings of fact or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced. Garcia de Funcia responded perfunctorily, \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">On appeal, Garcia de Funcia argues that her sentence was unreasonable because the court never stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, including the nature of the violations. She also contends that nine months of imprisonment was disproportionate to her original sentence of probation with house arrest. Garcia de Funcia concludes that the court\u2019s statements were inadequate in a <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>environment to justify her sentence at the high end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">As an initial matter, we agree with the government that we may review Garcia de Funcia\u2019s sentence only for plain error. A defendant must <em>\u201cdearly </em>articulate a specific objection during sentencing\u201d in order to preserve an objection for appeal. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1088 (11th Cir.2003). Because Garcia de Funcia failed to state the grounds for her objection to the court\u2019s sentence, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 1087-88. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Under this standard, we cannot reverse unless there is (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1087. Even if all three requirements are met, we must still find that \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Before revoking a defendant\u2019s probation and resentencing her, a court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1300-01 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed ... treatment ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">(5) any pertinent policy statement ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-15\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). So long as the record demonstrates that the sentencing court considered these factors, the court is not required to state explicitly that it has done so. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe now ... squarely hold that nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-18\">Although the district court here did not expressly state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court\u2019s statements make clear that these factors influenced the sentence. The court sympathized with Garcia de Funcia\u2019s personal hardships but observed her reluctance to seek timely help, her defiant behavior at her previous revocation hearing, her consistent drug use, and the fact that she has children. These facts implicate Garcia de Funcia\u2019s history and characteristics as well as the nature and circumstances of her offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Additionally, the court mentioned the importance of criminal justice, Garcia de Funcia\u2019s repeated violations of supervised release despite court warnings, and the need to prevent more serious violations of the law. Such considerations promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter future criminal behavior, and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), (C). Finally, the court considered the advisory guideline range and the sentencing alternatives proposed by the defendant. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(3), (4). In light of these statements, we And no error, much less plain error, in the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">We also And no error in the district court\u2019s statement of reasons for imposing a sentence at the high end of the guidelines range. The Supreme Court does not require a detailed explanation for sentences that fall within the guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>(2007). Rather, a sentencing judge must \u201cset forth enough\u201d to show that the judge \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Rita, </em>the judge\u2019s brief statement of reasons was sufficient because the judge listened to the parties\u2019 arguments, considered the evidence presented, and was cognizant of the defendant\u2019s medical condition and personal history. <em>Id. </em>at 358, 127 S.Ct. at 2469. The same holds true in this case. The court heard from both sides and evaluated all the evidence in light of Garcia de Funcia\u2019s particular circumstances. The court\u2019s statements were more than adequate to show that it had a reasoned basis for sentencing Garcia de Funcia to nine months of imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468; <em>see also United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (concluding that the district court\u2019s explanation of a defendant\u2019s sentence within the guidelines range was sufficient where the court considered, but did not explicitly reference, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). No error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Because the record demonstrates that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and had a reasoned basis for the sentence, we find no error, plain or otherwise, in the court\u2019s sentencing decision. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Garcia de Funcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-11\">. <em>United. States v.
