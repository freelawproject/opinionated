He now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">First, Hernandez argues that the district court should not have enhanced his offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) for use of \u201csophisticated means.\u201d Specifically, he claims that his actions were not complicated at all, but rather simple, thereby making application of the two-level enhancement inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We review a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant utilized sophisticated means for clear error. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2007) (applying a sophisticated-means enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) (1998)). A finding is clearly erroneous \u201cwhen although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The Sentencing Guidelines provides for an enhancement of two levels if the offense in question \u201cinvolved sophisticated means.\u201d \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). Application note 8(B) to that Guideline states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">... \u201csophisticated means\u201d means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts also ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)). In interpreting a prior version of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) in <em>Robertson, </em>we upheld a sophisticated means enhancement for a defendant who utilized fictitious names and addresses to insulate himself from detection. 493 F.3d at 1332. In addition, the defendant created fictitious entities that were switched every 30 days to take advantage of the victim company\u2019s policies. Consequently, relying on these facts and a prior, but nearly identical version of \u00a7 2B1.1 application note 8(B), we explicitly rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his scheme was \u201csimple.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Here, the district court did not commit clear error in applying the two-level sophisticated means enhancement to Hernandez\u2019s Guidelines calculation. The court correctly noted that Hernandez\u2019s conduct fell squarely within the plain language of \u00a7 2B1.1 application note 8(B). Moreover, the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C) is in accord with our holding in <em>Robertson. </em>Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level sophisticated means enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">Second, Hernandez argues that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. In sum, he claims that the district court improperly relied on one of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the protection of the public, and consequently failed to consider other \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we established a two-part process for district courts to use in calculating sentences. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2007). First, the district court must consult and correctly calculate the sentence range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. Second, the district court must fashion a reasonable sentence by considering the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 45-47, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Overall, the analysis is a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we examine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. Second, after it has been determined that a sentence is procedurally sound, we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">When reviewing for procedural unreasonableness, we should ensure that the district court: (1) properly calculated the Guidelines sentence range; (2) treated the Guidelines as advisory; (3) considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (4) did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; and (5) adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. When the district court considers the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court need not discuss each factor. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. All that is required is that the court acknowledge that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation omitted). The analysis includes \u201cexamining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) that the court must consider are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANE\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The weight the district court accords to \u201cany given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court....\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). In terms of the sentence range, we have held that \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Also, where the sentence imposed is only a fraction of the statutory maximum, this supports a finding of reasonableness. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>F.3d at 1324 (noting the importance of the defendant\u2019s 50-month sentence being \u201cwell below the maximum ten-year sentence available....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing concurrent prison sentences of 60 months each. Procedurally, the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the parties\u2019 arguments, and the record. Furthermore, the sentence imposed was within the Guidelines sentence range and well below the statutory maximum, creating strong support for a finding of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
