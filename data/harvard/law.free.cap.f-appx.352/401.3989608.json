Faruk argues, for the first time on appeal, there is a variance between his indictment and the factual basis for his guilty pleas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-21\">Faruk\u2019s knowing, voluntary, and unconditional plea of guilt \u201cwaive[d] all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2003). Faruk may obtain relief from his pleas of guilt only if he identifies a defect that affected the power of the district court to enter its judgment. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). A jurisdictional error must be apparent on the \u201c \u2018face of the indictment or the record at the time of the plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Tomeny, </em>144 F.3d 749, 751 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Caperell, </em>938 F.2d 975, 977-78 (9th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">Faruk\u2019s argument does not cast doubt on the jurisdiction of the district court. Faruk argues that he was charged with and pleaded guilty to violating section 1344(2), but that his conduct instead violated section 1344(1). The record reveals no jurisdictional defect. Faruk was indicted for and admitted violating section 1344, and the factual basis stated to support Faruk\u2019s guilty plea, that he kited checks at seven financial institutions, constitutes a violation of section 1344. <em>See United States v. Goldsmith, </em>109 F.3d 714, 716 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>(11th Cir.1997) (\u201cWhere the indictment ... charge[s] both clauses of [section 1344], as was done in this case, the defendant\u2019s conviction may be sustained under either clause.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Sirang, </em>70 F.3d 588, 595-96 (11th Cir.1995) (check-kiting encompassed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344). Faruk waived any nonjurisdietional error by unconditionally pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Faruk\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
