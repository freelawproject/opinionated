On appeal, Jack raises only one issue: whether a prior conviction for violating La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 14:94 was a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of Section 2K2.1(a)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">The Presentence Report (PSR) assigned an offense level of 24 to Jack\u2019s current conviction, reasoning that he committed the \u201cinstant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2008). After making other calculations not in dispute here, the PSR arrived at a total offense level of 30. With a criminal history score of IV, Jack\u2019s guidelines range was 135-168. However, because the statutory maximum for this offense was lower than the range \u2014 120 months- \u2014 the statutory maximum became the guidelines sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a); <em>United States v. Allison, </em>63 F.3d 350, 354 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">Jack does not dispute that he has one conviction for a controlled substance offense; he disputes only the nature of the \u00a7 14:94 offense. He argues that if that conviction had not been counted as a crime of violence, he would have had a guidelines range of 100-125 months (capped at the 120-month statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">Jack concedes that he failed to raise this issue before the district court such that the plain error standard applies. We pretermit the question of whether his \u00a7 14:94 conviction is a crime of violence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because we conclude that, if the district court erred, it is (1) harmless error and (2) not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">If the Government can show that the district court would have pronounced the same sentence regardless of any error in calculating the guidelines range, then the resulting error is harmless. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009). We note that the sentence imposed was within the guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>range which Jack contends is the correct one. Further, the district court clearly stated that it would have preferred to assess a higher sentence but was constrained by the statutory maximum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to this assertion in the Government\u2019s brief, Jack did not file a reply pointing to any contrary indication by the district court, and we have found none. Thus, we conclude that the error, if any, is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Even if we were to conclude that the district court\u2019s intent was unclear, we would still affirm. Unlike the statutes in the cases that Jack relies upon, the \u201cleast culpable\u201d conduct required to violate \u00a7 14:94 still requires that it be \u201cforeseeable that it may result in death or great bodily harm to a human being.\u201d Thus, in a \u201ctypical ease\u201d such a crime \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009) (construing \u201cviolent felony\u201d and holding that it is not necessary that \u201cevery conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury\u201d if the \u201ctypical case\u201d violation would do so) (internal citation and quota tion marks omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. Sept. 8, 2009) (No. 09-6395). Where, as here, a strong argument can be made that Jack was convicted of a crime of violence, any error in so holding is not \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 371, 175 L.Ed.2d 124 (2009).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-10\">. We note the likelihood that it is a crime of violence. Section 14:94(A) defines the illegal use of a weapon as the \u201cintentional or criminally negligent discharging of any firearm ... where it is foreseeable that it may result in death or great bodily harm to a human being.\u201d The PSR asserts that Jack was convicted of \"illegal discharge of a weapon\u201d and sentenced to six years of hard labor. It appears that Jack could have only received \u201csix years of hard labor\u201d for violating subsection E of \u00a7 14:94, because the PSR reveals no prior convictions under this statute within the preceding five years and does not indicate that he was sentenced under the habitual offender provision for this offense. Subsection E states: \u201cWhoever commits the crime of illegal use of weapons ... by discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle ..., where the intent is to injure, harm, or frighten another human being, shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than five nor more than ten years.... \u201d Read together, subsections A and E constitute a crime that \"presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2); <em>see also Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1584-88, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (stating the residual clause references conduct that is \"purposeful, violent and aggressive\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-11\">. \"I can't go any higher than [the statutory maximum] by law. There are some instances that I'm looking at in your background that would indicate a higher sentence is appropriate, but not when Congress has passed a law that says 120 months, maximum.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
