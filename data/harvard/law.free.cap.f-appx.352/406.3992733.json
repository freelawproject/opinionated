Carman also argues that the ALJ failed to give \u201cexplicit and adequate reasons\u201d for discrediting his subjective complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may not decide facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cReview of the Secretary\u2019s application of legal principles is plenary.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1558 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). Under the first step, the claimant has the burden to show that he is not currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(b). Next, he must show that he has a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c). He then must attempt to show that the impairment meets or equals the criteria contained in one of the Listings of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(d). If the claimant cannot meet or equal the criteria, he must show that he has an impairment which prevents him from performing his past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(e) and (f). Once a claimant establishes that he cannot perform his past relevant work due to some severe impairment, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that significant numbers of jobs exist in the national economy which the claimant can perform. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(g); <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">A. The ALJ\u2019s consideration of the medical evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">The opinions of examining or treating physicians generally are given more weight than non-examining or non-treating physicians unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d); <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). Good cause exists to discredit a physician\u2019s testimony when a physician\u2019s opinion is conclusory, inconsistent with his own medical records, or contrary to the evidence contained in the record. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Carman has shown no error in the ALJ\u2019s treatment of the medical evidence, as he did not show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ALJ overlooked or improperly discounted any of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">B. The ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Carman\u2019s subjective complaints of pain</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">When a claimant attempts to establish disability through his own testimony concerning pain or other subjective symptoms, we apply a three-part \u201cpain standard,\u201d which requires (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (A) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain stemming from that condition, or (B) that the objectively determined medical condition is so severe that it can reasonably be expected to cause the alleged pain. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe claimant\u2019s subjective testimony supported by medical evidence that satisfies the standard is itself sufficient to support a finding of disability.\u201d <em>Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201cAfter considering a claimant\u2019s complaints of pain, the ALJ may reject them as not creditable, and that determination will be reviewed for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.1992). The ALJ must explicitly and adequately articulate his reasons if he discredits a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony. <em>Id. \u201cA </em>clearly articulated credibility finding with substantial supporting evidence in the record will not be disturbed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1562; <em>see also Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe recognize that credibility determinations are the province of the ALJ.\u201d). \u201cThe credibility determination does not need to cite particular phrases or formulations but it cannot merely be a broad rejection which is not enough to enable ... this Court to conclude that the ALJ considered [the] medical condition as a whole.\u201d <em>Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1210 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). When evaluating a claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms, the ALJ must consider such things as: (1) the claimant\u2019s daily activities; (2) the nature and intensity of pain and other symptoms; (3) precipitating and aggravating factors; (4) effects of medications; and (5) treatment or measures taken by the claimant for relief of symptoms. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The ALJ articulated various inconsistencies in Carman\u2019s evidence that a reasonable person could conclude supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that Carman\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were not entirely credible. Thus, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">C. The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the vocational expert</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">When a claimant cannot perform a full range of work at a given level of exertion or has non-exertional impairments that significantly limit basic work skills, the ALJ can determine whether a claimant can perform other jobs through the testimony of a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240. \u201cIn order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ is not required to include findings in the hypothetical that he properly finds are unsupported. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">Because the ALJ proposed a hypothetical to the VE that included all of Carman\u2019s credible limitations, we conclude that the VE\u2019s testimony, that there was a significant number of jobs in the national economy that a person with Carman\u2019s impairments could perform, constituted substantial evidence that he was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Accordingly, based on our review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability benefits and supplemental security income.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
