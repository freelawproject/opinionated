Dewitt argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, because Amendment 706 reduced his applicable guideline range, his criminal history was not extensive, the original sentencing court miscalculated the drug quantity for which he was responsible, and his post-sentencing conduct justified a reduction. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Dewitt was indicted in Case No. 98-6097 for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and in Case No. 99-6018, for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). These cases were consolidated for purposes of pleading and sentencing, and Dewitt pled guilty to both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Dewitt was accountable for 119.4 grams of crack cocaine in relation to Case No. 98-6097 and 141.3 grams of cocaine and 4.4 grams of crack cocaine in relation to Case No. 99-6018. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d), Dewitt\u2019s offenses were grouped and the drug quantities for these offenses were added together and converted into the marijuana equivalent. Because Dewitt\u2019s offenses involved the equivalent of 2,504 kilograms of marijuana, the PSI set Dewitt\u2019s base offense level at 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1. After applying enhancements pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (firearm possession), 2J1.7 (offense committed while released on bond), and 3Bl.l(c) (role enhancement), the PSI set Dewitt\u2019s total offense level at 39. Dewitt had no criminal history points, which placed him in criminal history category I. Dewitt\u2019s total offense level of 39 combined with criminal history category I to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 262 to 327 months. Although Dewitt had no criminal history points, the PSI indicated that he had pled nolo contendere to (1) resisting arrest without violence, loitering, and prowling in October 1995; (2) driving with a suspended license in July 1996 (a second count of operating an unsafe vehicle was dismissed); (3) driving with a suspended license in May 1997; and (4) reckless driving, in August 1997. Dewitt paid a fine as punishment for the first three offenses, and was sentenced to 6 months\u2019 probation for the 1997 reckless driving offense. Dewitt\u2019s probation was revoked in December 1998, because he failed to report, pay fines, attend and complete D.U.I. school, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>complete his community service requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">At sentencing, the district court applied a two-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), because Dewitt possessed a weapon during the commission of the offense; a two-level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility; and a three-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2J1.7, because Dewitt committed the present offenses while released on bond. Based on these calculations, Dewitt\u2019s total offense level was 35 and his guideline imprisonment range was 168 to 210 months. The court sentenced Dewitt to 180 months on each count, to run concurrently, plus one additional month, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147, to run consecutively, for a total of 181 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In March 2008, Dewitt filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendments 706 and 715<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reduced his base offense level by two levels and reduced his guideline imprisonment range to 135 to 168 months. The district court denied Dewitt\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, explaining that, because Dewitt was sentenced to two concurrent 180-month sentences, reducing the sentence for his crack cocaine offense would not reduce his total term of imprisonment, because he would still be required to serve the 180-month sentence for the powder cocaine offense. Dewitt appealed, and we reversed the district court\u2019s denial of relief. We held that Amendments 706 and 715 had effectively reduced Dewitt\u2019s applicable guideline imprisonment range and the district court had abused its discretion by \u201coverlooking] that the sentences were reached using a combined offense level that took into account the amounts of cocaine and crack cocaine involved.\u201d We held that the district court also erred in failing to \u201capply the requisite two-step analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On remand, the district court acknowledged that Amendment 706 had reduced Dewitt\u2019s applicable guideline imprisonment range to 135 to 168 months; however, after \u201cconsidering all statutory factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and in particular the Defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history,\u201d the court refused to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Dewitt filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the district court wrongly determined that he had an \u201cextensive criminal history,\u201d because the PSI placed him in criminal history category I. Dewitt also argued that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on <em>Kimbrough</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and his post-sentencing rehabilitation efforts. The district court denied Dewitt\u2019s motion for reconsideration, stating that it had carefully reviewed Dewitt\u2019s criminal history prior to issuing its previous order. The court noted that, although Dewitt had no criminal history points, he had been involved in four instances of criminal conduct over a period of two years. It pointed out that Dewitt\u2019s August 6, 1997 reckless driving conviction was the first offense for which Dewitt had received punishment greater than a nominal fine, and it noted that Dewitt violated the terms of his probation in July 1998. Dewitt now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). In considering a defendant\u2019s motion to reduce sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court must engage in a two-part analysis: first, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines; second, the court must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and decide whether, in its discretion, it will choose to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In the instant case, the district court complied with the required two-step analysis outlined in <em>Bravo </em>by recalculating the applicable guideline range under the amended guidelines and stating that it had considered the \u00a7 3535(a) factors, particularly, Dewitt\u2019s history and characteristics. <em>See id. </em>Although Dewitt\u2019s criminal history consisted of only four misdemeanors, the district court correctly noted that these prior offenses were committed during a two-year period and that Dewitt had violated his probation. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant a reduction under \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that we will reverse a procedurally proper sentence only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case\u201d); <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that \u201cthe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Dewitt also argues that the court should have reduced his sentence in light of his post-sentencing conduct; however, the court was not required to consider this factor in determining whether to grant a reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment, n. 1(B) (noting that courts <em>\u201cmay </em>consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant\u201d in deciding whether to grant a sentence reduction) (emphasis added). Finally, Dewitt\u2019s drug quantity argument lacks merit, because a \u00a7 3582 proceeding does not authorize a court to reconsider original sentencing determinations. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, with the exception of the amended guideline range, \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Dewitt\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence and his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">.
