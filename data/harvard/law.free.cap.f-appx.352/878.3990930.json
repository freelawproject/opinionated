He argues that the district court procedurally erred by failing to explain adequately the non-Guidelines sentence. He argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the sentence was imposed arbitrarily, without reference to the insufficiency of the Guidelines range, and because the district court failed to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>factual findings to support its reliance on any of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). This court first determines whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as failing to explain adequately its decision to deviate from the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If there is no significant procedural error, this court reviews the sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Although Gonzalez-Laguna preserved his objection to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, he failed to object in the district court to the district coui't\u2019s explanation of the sentence. Plain error review thex-efore governs this issue. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The sentencing court must state \u201cthe reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). \u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the pax'ties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">The district coux-t\u2019s explanation reflects that the court expx-essly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district coux't\u2019s statements that Gonzalez-Laguna is \u201cdangerous coming back to the [United] States\u201d and that \u201cyou and I know that once you sexwe this time, you ax\u2019e going to try to find a way to come back,\u201d reflect that the district court considex'ed Gonzalez-Laguna\u2019s history of violent criminal behavior and repeated illegal l\u2019eentry into the United States, as noted by the Government at sentencing and in the PSR, as well as the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(2)(C). The distilct court also explicitly stated that the sentence was calculated to deter Gonzalez-Laguna from future cx\u00faminal activity and to ensure that Gonzalez-Laguna understood the seriousness of his offense. Gonzalez-Laguna has not shown that the distx'ict coux't committed clear or obvious ex-ror in its explanation of the non-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Gonzalez-Laguna\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. In light of GonzalezALaguna\u2019s long histoi\u2019y of violent crimes and his continued flouting of the law by returning to the United States despite px\u00f1or removals, he has not shown that the district court abused its discx'etion iix sentencing him to 72 months in px-ison. Further, this coxxx't has upheld variances considex'ably greater than the incx*ease in Gonzalez-Laguna\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming a vaxiaixce from the Guidelines maximum of 51 months to a sentence of 180 months); <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 312-13 (5th Cir.2005) (upholding the imposition of consecutive sentences that effectually quadx'upled the maximum Guidelines sentence); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (5th Cir.2005) (affirming an increase from the Guidelines maximum of 41 months to a sentence of 120 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">Gonzalez-Laguna has not shown that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
