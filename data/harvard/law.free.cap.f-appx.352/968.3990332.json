The district court sentenced Longoria to 120 months in prison. Longoria appeals his conviction, arguing that (1) the evidence that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce was insufficient to support his conviction, (2) the district court erred when it failed to suppress the search of Longoria\u2019s residence and the evidence seized therefrom, (3) the district court erred when it failed to suppress Longoria\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statements, and (4) the district court erred when it enhanced Longoria\u2019s offense level on the basis of relevant conduct not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by Longoria. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">In his first assignment of error, Longoria asserts that the evidence that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce was insufficient to support his conviction. The trial testimony established that the firearm was manufactured in Ohio and shipped to Texas, the state in which Longoria resides. The trial testimony further established that Longoria purchased the firearm in Texas. Thus, the Government produced sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm possessed by Longoria affected interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 317-18 (5th Cir.2005); \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">Longoria also mounts an as-applied constitutional challenge to his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1), arguing that the Government had to prove that his possession of a firearm had a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). Longoria\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-16\">In his second assignment of error, Longoria contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the warrant authorizing the search of his house and the evidence seized therefrom, asserting alternative arguments. Longoria first argues that the detectives violated local law when they seized his garbage without a warrant. Accordingly, Longoria argues that because the primary basis for the warrant\u2014the garbage\u2014was illegally seized, the search warrant was invalid and violative of the Fourth Amendment. Longoria\u2019s argument is without merit. Because Longoria had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the garbage he deposited on the curb for collection, the Fourth Amendment is not implicated. <em>See California v. Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 37, 39-42, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988); <em>see also United States v. Vahalik, </em>606 F.2d 99, 100-01 (5th Cir.1979). Notwithstanding the privacy issue, Longoria\u2019s argument remains meritless. This court has long held that evidence obtained in violation of state law, but not federal law, may be used in a federal prosecution. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>960 F.2d 409, 415 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Longoria alternatively argues that the affidavit offered in support of the warrant application failed to provide the issuing judge with enough information to determine the existence of probable cause. Longoria further argues that because the affidavit was lacking in information, the issuing judge\u2019s actions were \u201ca mere ratification of the conclusion of others.\u201d Aside from these conclusory statements, Longoria offers no record support and no argument in support of his assertions. Accordingly, Longoria has abandoned this claim. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In his third assignment of error, Longoria contends that the district court should have suppressed the <em>post-Miranda </em>statements he made to police while they were searching his house as well as the statements he made following his arrest. Longoria asserts that his waiver of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) was involuntary as a result of police coercion, i.e., that the police told him honesty was the best policy. Longoria\u2019s arguments are unavailing under this court\u2019s holdings in <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>586 F.2d 1060, 1063 (5th Cir.1978), and <em>United States v. Paden, </em>908 F.2d 1229, 1235 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">In his last assignment of error, Longoria argues that the district court erred when it enhanced his offense level on the basis of relevant conduct not proven to a jury or admitted by him. Longoria\u2019s argument is foreclosed, as he concedes. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
