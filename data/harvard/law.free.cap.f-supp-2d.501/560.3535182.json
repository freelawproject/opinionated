These actions are brought on behalf of the successors of two bankrupt Parmalat subsidiaries against a number of banks and accounting firms principally for helping conceal Parmalat\u2019s true financial condition, thus causing the subsidiaries to incur debt in reliance on misrepresentations of Parmalat\u2019s financial health. Before the Court are defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the second amended complaints in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">The complaints in these two actions are substantially the same. The only relevant differences are that the complaint in <em>Smith v. Bank of America</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>names Banca Intesa as a defendant and asserts a cause of action against certain other defendants for aiding and abetting a fraudulent conveyance, while the complaint in <em>Pappas v. Bank of America</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>does not. Accordingly, the following allegations are drawn from both complaints unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">\n<em>I. The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-19\">\n<em>A. Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-20\">Parmalat USA Corp. (\u201cParmalat USA\u201d) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Parma-lat. It had no operations or employees of its own, but was the sole owner of Farmland Dairies LLC (\u201cFarmland\u201d), which was in the business of processing, selling, and distributing dairy products in the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the complaints, both Parmalat USA and Farmland (the \u201cCompanies\u201d) were insolvent and completely financially dependent on Parmalat.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">The Companies filed for bankruptcy in this district on February 24, 2004, following Parmalat\u2019s collapse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 10, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed a liquidation plan for Parmalat USA and a modified reorganization plan for Farmland. Plaintiff G. Peter Pappas was appointed the administrator of Parmalat USA\u2019s Plan of Liquidation. Plaintiff Gerald K. Smith was appointed the litigation trustee of Farmland Dairies LLC Litigation Trust.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>\n<em>B.

Together they constitute the United States member firm of the Deloitte organization.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Deloitte USA audited Parmalat USA\u2019s financial statements from 1999 to 2002.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Deloitte &amp; Touche, S.p.A. (\u201cDeloitte Italy\u201d) is an Italian limited liability entity and the Italian member firm of DTT.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It audited Parmalat\u2019s consolidated financial statements from 1999 to 2002.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\n<em>2. The Grant Thornton Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Grant Thornton International (\u201cGTI\u201d) is an Illinois corporation headquartered in London and the umbrella organization for Grant Thornton entities throughout the world. Grant Thornton LLP (\u201cGT USA\u201d) is an Illinois limited liability partnership and the United States member firm of GTI. Grant Thornton S.p.A. (\u201cGT Italy\u201d) is an Italian limited liability entity and the Italian member firm of GTI.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> GT Italy audited the financial statements of Parma-lat\u2019s off-shore subsidiary, Bonlat Financing Ltd. (\u201cBonlat\u201d) from 1999 to 2002.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">\n<em>8. The Bank of America Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">Bank of America Corp. (\u201cBA Corp.\u201d) is a Delaware corporation and the parent of Bank of America, N.A. (\u201cBA\u00d1A\u201d), a national banking association based in North Carolina and successor of Bank of America National Trust <em>&amp; </em>Savings Association (\u201cBANTSA\u201d). Banc of America Securities Ltd. (\u201cBAS Ltd.\u201d) is a United Kingdom limited liability investment bank and BANA\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary. Its predecessor was Bank of America International Ltd. (BAI). Banc of America Securities LLC (\u201cBAS LLC\u201d), also a subsidiary of BA Corp., is a Delaware limited liability investment bank and brokerage firm based in North Carolina.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">A <em>The Credit Suisse Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-19\">While the complaints are not entirely clear, it appears that there are three Credit Suisse defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">Credit Suisse Group (\u201cCSG\u201d) is a Swiss global financial services company with a branch office in New York City. According to the complaints, an entity called Credit Suisse First Boston (\u201cCSFB\u201d) was its wholly owned subsidiary and investment banking and asset management arm until 2005 when it merged with Credit Suisse (\u201cCS\u201d), which the complaints describe as CSG\u2019s private banking division. The complaints appear to name CS as a defendant. If, in fact, that was the intention and if, as plaintiffs suggest, CS is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>unincorporated division of CSG, CSG would be a defendant. The Court notes, however, that CSG\u2019s Report on Form 6-K for August 2007 describes CS as a wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, counsel for the Credit Suisse defendants have appeared on behalf of CS rather than CSG. In 'consequence, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs sued CS, not CSG. In view of the outcome of these motions, however, any uncertainty ultimately is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The other two Credit Suisse defendants are Credit Suisse First Boston International (\u201cCSFBI\u201d), a London-based bank, and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited (\u201cCSSEL\u201d), a London-based broker-dealer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\n<em>5. Banca Nazionale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro S.p.A. (\u201cBNL\u201d) is an Italian banking conglomerate. It has branches in the United States, including New York and Chicago, and describes itself as one of the world\u2019s 100 largest banks. BNL\u2019s subsidiary, Ifitalia S.p.A. (\u201cIfitalia\u201d), is an Italian bank and factoring company.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">\n<em>6. Banca Intesa</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">Smith\u2019s complaint names also Banca Intesa (\u201cIntesa\u201d), one of Italy\u2019s largest banking companies, which provides a variety of commercial banking services.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Its subsidiary, Nextra Investment Management SGT (\u201cNextra\u201d), serves as Intesa\u2019s asset management and investment banking arm.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">\n<em>II. The Alleged Wrongdoing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">The complaints are long, rambling, repetitious, and disorganized.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Their gist, however, can be summed up as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">Plaintiffs allege that the Companies were insolvent and completely financially dependent on Parmalat at all relevant times.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For example, the notes to Parma-lat USA\u2019s consolidated financial statements for 2002 stated that the company\u2019s ability to maintain its then-current debt arrangement, obtain additional financing from third-party lenders, and continue as a going concern was dependent on Parmalat\u2019s ability to guarantee Parmalat USA\u2019s debt to third parties and Parmalat\u2019s forbearance from calling debts owed to it by Parmalat USA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Because of this dependence on Parma-lat, plaintiffs claim, certain \u201cinnocent decision makers\u201d at the Companies relied on representations that Parmalat was financially healthy in (1) causing Parmalat USA to incur more than $20 million in debt guaranteed by Parmalat,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and (2) causing Farmland to take out a loan in the form of a sale-leaseback transaction, whereby it transferred its dairy processing plants and equipment to a third party and leased them back under leases guaranteed by Parmalat.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Plaintiffs allege, however, that Parmalat in fact was in financial ruin when the Companies entered into these transactions. Certain of Parmalat\u2019s officers, directors, and other employees allegedly had looted the company for years and fraudulently concealed the company\u2019s true financial condition in its financial statements.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that the Companies therefore incurred debt that they were unable to repay once Parmalat collapsed in 2003, thus deepening their insolvency. In addition, the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction allegedly were looted by Par-malat insiders.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">According to plaintiffs, the innocent decision makers would have prevented the Companies from incurring these liabilities in the first instance, reported the fraudulent acts being committed by Parmalat\u2019s insiders, and filed for bankruptcy at an earlier date if they had known the truth about Parmalat\u2019s financial condition.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Defendants are charged principally with assisting the Parmalat fraud or otherwise with being complicit in a scheme to hide Parmalat\u2019s financial condition. The allegations of defendants\u2019 wrongdoing may be divided into three categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">\n<em>A. Misleading Parmalat Financial Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">The first includes claims that Deloitte Italy and GT Italy helped Parmalat insiders misrepresent Parmalat\u2019s financial condition in financial statements. They allegedly did so by (1) failing to reveal in their audit reports that Bonlat was booking fictitious sales to boost Parmalat\u2019s reported revenues, and that Bonlat\u2019s sole purported asset, a $4.9 billion bank account, did not exist,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (2) participating in a scheme with Parmalat\u2019s insiders to reclassify improperly \u201cParmalat\u2019s growing debts to third parties as obligations owed by one Parmalat entity to another,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and (3) deliberately preventing DTT\u2019s Maltese member firm (\u201cDeloitte Malta\u201d), which audited Bonlat\u2019s parent, Parmalat Capital Finance (\u201cPCF\u201d), from receiving Bonlat\u2019s audited financial statements for the years 2001 and 2002, thus preventing Deloitte Malta from completing its audit work on PCF\u2019s 2002 financial statements and blowing the whistle on the Bonlat fraud.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">The complaints allege that Deloitte Italy further assisted the fraud by (4) certifying Parmalat\u2019s 2002 financial statements without having received certification of PCF\u2019s financial statements for that year,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (5) failing to reveal in its audit reports that reimbursement credits issued by Parmalat to its subsidiaries, which the subsidiaries booked as reductions in costs and expenses, were uncollectible,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and (6) failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>to ensure that a $26.5 million write-down of Parmalat USA\u2019s goodwill in 2002 \u201cflowed through\u201d to Parmalat\u2019s financial statements.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>B. Fraudulent Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The second category of allegations includes claims that certain defendants engaged in transactions that permitted Parmalat insiders to misrepresent the company\u2019s financial health.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Plaintiffs allege that the Bank of America and Credit Suisse Defendants structured or otherwise participated in fraudulent transactions designed to conceal Parmalat\u2019s debt,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and that BNL and Ifitalia repeatedly paid Parmalat cash in exchange for assignment of receivables that both parties knew were bad, thus permitting Parmalat to record as assets what essentially were loans from BNL.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> These allegations are substantially similar to those described in the Court\u2019s earlier opinions in related matters,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> familiarity with which is assumed, and need not be recounted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In addition, Smith alleges that Intesa assisted Parmalat\u2019s insiders in fraudulently securing financing through the use of a company called Wishaw Trading S.p.A. (\u201cWishaw\u201d).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Although Smith does not so allege, he implies that Parmalat or its employees somehow controlled Wishaw.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> According to Smith, Parmalat insiders \u201cused\u201d Wishaw to manufacture fictitious promissory notes, purportedly representing trade debt owed to Intesa, which Inte-sa then endorsed and sold to third parties, thus acting as a \u201cbroker/banker of fraudulently obtained loans.\u201d The purpose of the transaction, Smith claims, was to raise money to \u201cprop up Parmalat\u2019s ailing Brazilian operations and to improperly funnel money to\u201d Parmalat\u2019s corrupt insiders.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">Smith alleges also that in June 2003, Nextra purchased an entire 300 million bond issue of Parmalat Finance Corporation B.V., which it resold within a few months for a substantial profit, despite knowing of Parmalat\u2019s \u201cdisastrous financial condition.\u201d According to Smith, this transaction \u201cartificially propped up Parma-lat and concealed Parmalat\u2019s true financial condition.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">\n<em>C. Deloitte USA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">The third category of allegations involves claims arising from the conduct of Deloitte USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">\n<em>1. Auditing Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-18\">Plaintiffs claim that Deloitte USA misled innocent insiders at the Companies by issuing unqualified audit opinions of Parma-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>lat USA\u2019s financial statements for the years 1999 to 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\">\n<em>a. Reimbursement Credits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">They allege that Parmalat USA had booked millions of dollars worth of \u201creimbursement credits\u201d issued by Parmalat between 1999 and 2002.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The credits had been booked as reductions in costs and expenses and therefore increased Parma-lat USA\u2019s reported net income and assets.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim, however, that the credits in fact were \u201cuncollectible.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> They allege that Deloitte USA violated generally accepted auditing standards (\u201cGAAS\u201d) by failing to obtain sufficient audit evidence that the credits were genuine despite \u201cred flags\u201d that should have cued it into the fact that they were phony.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In particular, plaintiffs claim that when Deloitte USA conducted a \u201csuccessor audit\u201d of Parmalat USA in 1999, it discovered that the company had not collected on similar reimbursement credits issued from 1995 to 1998.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> They allege also that when Deloitte USA \u201csought confirmation from [Parmalat and Deloitte Italy] of the calculations and nature of the reimbursement credits\u201d and \u201cquestioned why the reimbursement credits were accounted for as reimbursement of expenses as opposed to a capital contribution from [Parmalat],\u201d it \u201cdid not receive the confirmations and information it requested\u201d because Parmalat and Deloitte Italy \u201crepeatedly refused to provide such audit evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege further that Carlo Zucchinali of De-loitte Italy sent a January 18, 2000 email to James Pickette, Deloitte USA\u2019s audit manager, describing the reimbursement credits as \u201closs absorptions,\u201d or \u201ccontributions \u2014 income for the receiving company\u2014 from other Parmalat companies to cover losses.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">According to plaintiffs, Deloitte USA knew or should have known that the reimbursement credits were uncollectible and that Parmalat USA\u2019s financial condition was overstated in its financial statements. It therefore acted improperly in failing to qualify its audit opinions.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">\n<em>b. Going Concern Qualifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">Plaintiffs claim that Deloitte USA failed to issue going concern qualifications in its audit opinions. Because Parmalat USA was financially dependent on Parmalat, they allege, Deloitte USA was required by GAAS either to obtain evidence that Par-malat in fact intended to give, and was capable of giving, continued financial support to Parmalat USA, or to reveal in its audit opinions that there was substantial doubt about the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that Deloitte USA failed to do either.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">In connection with its audits of Parmalat USA for the years 1999 to 2001, Deloitte USA allegedly sought only representations from Parmalat\u2019s managers that Parmalat would continue to support Parmalat USA. Plaintiffs claim that this was insufficient under GAAS.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">On May 8, 2003, in connection with Par-malat USA\u2019s 2002 audit, Astrid Potts of Deloitte USA allegedly \u201csought from [De-loitte Italy] and ParmalaNSpA details of the <em>actual audit evidence </em>\u2014 not just the representation from Parmalat-SpA\u2019s man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>agement that had become the norm \u2014 that [Deloitte Italy] was relying upon to confirm Parmalab-SpA would not call loans to ParmalaNUSA due during 2003 and that Parmalat-SpA had the ability to continue to provide financial support to Parmalat-USA.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, \u201cLelio Bigogno of [Deloitte Italy] responded that same day to Potts, refusing to provide the requested audit evidence: T do not believe that out consideration on the capability of Finanziaria <em>to support or on whatsoever information about our </em>audit procedures should be shared with you <em>[sic </em>].\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Plaintiffs claim that Bigogno\u2019s response to Potts should have signaled to Deloitte USA that there was serious doubt about Parmalat\u2019s ability and intention to continue supporting the Companies. Nevertheless, plaintiffs allege, Deloitte USA improperly issued an unqualified audit opinion of Par-malat USA\u2019s 2002 financial statements.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">c. <em>Overstatement of Goodunll</em></p>\n<p id=\"AY-\">The complaints allege also that Deloitte USA failed to reveal that Parmalat USA\u2019s goodwill was overstated in financial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">According to plaintiffs, \u201c[f]or the years 2000 and 2001, the goodwill reported on the balance sheet of ParmalaNUSA constituted approximately half or more of Par-malat-USA\u2019s total reported assets\u201d and that \u201c[r]eported goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $202 million at the end of fiscal year 2000 and $198 million at the end of fiscal year 2001.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that \u201cthe results of the underlying operations of Parmalat-USA and its subsidiaries did not justify\u201d the reported values.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">When it became clear that the company\u2019s goodwill was overstated, Deloitte USA and Parmalat USA reduced reported goodwill by $26.5 million. Plaintiffs contend that \u201ceven this write-down was not sufficient.\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> They allege that Deloitte USA knew or should have known that Parmalat USA\u2019s goodwill was misstated, and that had it conducted its audits in accordance with GAAS, it would have revealed this in its audit opinions.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">\n<em>2. The Sale-Leaseback Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">The remaining allegations against De-loitte USA arise from a 2003 transaction between Farmland and General Electric Capital Corporation (\u201cGECC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">\n<em>a. The Proposed Deal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AkD\">The complaints allege that, in late 2002, Parmalat\u2019s corrupt insiders \u201cdesperately needed increasing amounts of cash in order to fund their fraudulent scheme.\u201d Parmalat hired Citigroup Global Markets (\u201cCGM\u201d) to locate an investor to provide financing using Farmland\u2019s assets as security.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> GCM found GECC.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">GECC and Parmalat initially contemplated that GECC would lend $200 million to Farmland in the form of a sale-leaseback transaction \u2014 Farmland would transfer its dairy processing plants and equipment to GECC in exchange for $200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>million in cash and then lease the assets back. It allegedly \u201cwas understood that the financing would be upstreamed to Parmalat-SpA and that Parmalat-SpA was the ultimate creditor.\u201d Parmalat therefore would guarantee the leases.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The transaction later was restructured and divided into two tranches, the first of which was $100 million and the second $94 million.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">GECC required that it be provided with Parmalat USA\u2019s audited financial statements for the years 2000 and 2001. During the winter of 2002 and the spring of 2003, Deloitte USA provided GECC with the requested documents. Plaintiffs allege that \u201cGECC also received Parmalat-USA\u2019s unaudited financial statements for 2002.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">GECC required also that Farmland\u2019s dairy processing equipment be appraised. This was in part because GECC required \u201cthe outstanding loan amount to be over-collateralized at all times by at least 30% (i.e., 1.3 times).\u201d GECC therefore required Farmland\u2019s assets to be worth at least $252.2 million, or 130 percent of $194 million.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\n<em>b. The Deloitte USA-Deloitte Italy Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Plaintiffs allege that, in September 2002, CGM \u201crequested\u201d that GECC use Deloitte USA as the appraiser of Farmland\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> When Adolfo Mamoli of Deloitte Italy found out about this, he objected vigorously, claiming that the appraisal assignment necessarily would compromise Deloitte USA\u2019s independence with respect to its audits of Parmalat USA. That is, Mamoli complained that if Deloitte USA served both as an appraiser of Farmland\u2019s assets and as auditor of Parmalat USA, it ultimately would have to audit a transaction, the value of which would have been based upon its own appraisal. Plaintiffs allege that Mamoli voiced his objection repeatedly between September 5, 2002 and January 16, 2003.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">Charles Horstmann, DTT\u2019s global director of ethics and independence, \u201cwas responsible for mediating disputes between [Deloitte] member firms, including those arising out of the Parmalat account.\u201d Horstmann, \u201con behalf of DTT and at the request of [Deloitte USA],\u201d allegedly intervened in the dispute between Deloitte USA and Deloitte Italy.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that Horstmann was able to \u201cpersuade Mamoli to withdraw his objection\u201d \u201c[a]fter a long series of e-mails, telephone conversations, and at least one face-to-face meeting.\u201d Mamoli allegedly withdrew his objection \u201ceven though the substance of that objection was not resolved.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">c. <em>The Appraisal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-17\">Sometime in March 2003, \u201cGECC executed a letter agreement with [Deloitte USA] dated February 21, 2003, whereby [Deloitte USA] agreed to appraise\u201d the property that would be subject to the sale-leaseback transaction.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-18\">On April 30, 2003, Deloitte USA issued an appraisal report. According to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tiffs, the report inflated the appraisal value of Farmland\u2019s assets. It allegedly reported an appraisal value of $252.5 million\u2014 more than enough to meet GECC\u2019s collat-eralization requirements for a $194 million transaction \u2014 even though an appraisal performed in 1999 by Daley-Hodkin Appraisal Corporation (\u201cDHAC\u201d) valued Farmland\u2019s assets at about $35 million. Plaintiffs contend that Deloitte USA\u2019s appraisal report \u201cprovided no explanation or justification for an over seven-fold increase in the value of Farmland\u2019s assets in four years, despite Farmland having reported substantial operating losses over the same period.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Plaintiffs allege that the overvaluation stemmed from the fact that Deloitte USA \u201cignored two of the three basic approaches to valuation[, t]he Cost Approach and the Market Comparable Approach,\u201d and instead applied only the \u201cDiscounted Cash Flow Approach.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Moreover, plaintiffs allege, in applying the discounted cash flow approach, Deloitte USA relied on \u201ccalculated\u201d instead of actual values for Farmland\u2019s 2001 and 2002 earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d). Deloitte USA allegedly stated in its appraisal report that Farmland\u2019s EBITDA for 2002 was unavailable, and therefore projected the company\u2019s 2003 EBITDA value and then \u201ccalculated\u201d EBITDA values for previous years \u201cby reducing the 2003 projections by 2.5% per year.\u201d Plaintiffs claim that Deloitte USA did this despite knowing Farmland\u2019s actual EBITDA values for 2002. According to plaintiffs, Deloitte USA\u2019s \u201ccalculated\u201d EBITDA values \u201cfar exceeded\u201d the actual values.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">\n<em>d. The Aftermath</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">On the same day that Deloitte USA issued its appraisal report, Farmland transferred its dairy processing plants and equipment to GECC for $100 million. It agreed to make periodic lease payments totaling $50 million plus interest and costs and a residual payment of $50 million at the end of the lease term.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Although plaintiffs do not so allege, the complaints imply that this $100 million transaction represented only the first tranche of sale-leaseback transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">In February 2004, Farmland was unable to make its lease payments. Moreover, as Parmalat already had been declared insolvent in Italy, Parmalat \u201cfailed to honor its obligations under its guarantee given to GECC.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Plaintiffs claim that the sale-leaseback transaction would not have gone forward if Farmland\u2019s assets had been valued properly. They claim that a proper appraisal would have revealed not only that the transaction was not sufficiently collateral-ized to meet GECC\u2019s requirements, but also that there were substantial doubts about the Companies\u2019 abilities to continue as going concerns.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Hence, plaintiffs contend that Farmland would not have incurred a liability on which it ultimately defaulted when Parmalat collapsed if De-loitte USA had acted properly.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">The complaints allege also that, after Farmland entered into the sale-leaseback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>transaction and received the $100 million from GECC, Parmalat\u2019s insiders \u201clooted the cash by causing Farmland to ultimately divert $20 million to Parmalat\u2019s Canadian operations and $80 million to Parmalat\u201d itself.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\n<em>III. Causes of Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Plaintiffs assert causes of action against all defendants for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and fraud<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> by the Parmalat insiders, as well as for participating in a civil conspiracy to conceal Par-malat\u2019s financial condition.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> They allege also violations by the Bank of America and Deloitte Defendants of the federal and New Jersey Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Acts (\u201cRICO\u201d)<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> based on alleged predicate acts of mail and wire fraud.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> In connection with the auditing services Deloitte USA provided to the Companies, plaintiffs sue the Deloitte Defendants for fraud,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> negligent misrepresentation,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> and professional malpractice.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Finally, Smith asserts a claim against the Bank of America, Deloitte, and Grant Thornton Defendants for aiding and abetting a fraudulent transfer of Farmland\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-22\">The Deloitte, Bank of America, and Credit Suisse Defendants, as well GTI, GT USA, and BNL move to dismiss the claims against them in both complaints. In addition, Intesa moves to dismiss the claims against it in Smith\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-23\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-24\">\n<em>I. Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-25\">In deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court ordinarily accepts as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Until recently, it frequently was said that dismissal is inappropriate \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> This standard, however, has been supplanted. Now, in order \u201c[t]o survive dismissal, the plaintiff must provide the grounds upon which his claim rests through factual allegations sufficient \u2018to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>In addition, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires allegations of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty consisting of fraud by a fiduciary to be stated with particularity.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> While the rule allows general aver-ments of intent, knowledge, and other mental conditions, it nevertheless requires a plaintiff to allege facts that give rise to a \u201cstrong inference\u201d of the defendant\u2019s culpable state of mind.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> This may be done by alleging facts that the defendant had both motive and opportunity to commit or assist fraud, or facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s conscious misbehavior or recklessness.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\n<em>II. Choice of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Plaintiffs argue that New Jersey law applies to all of their claims. Some defendants resist this; others do not. However, the parties point to no conflict between the law of the forum and that of any other state with respect to the issues necessary to dispose of these motions. Accordingly, the Court applies New York law.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>III. Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The complaints allege two kinds of injury to the Companies. First, plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 improper actions misled innocent decision makers at the Companies about Parmalat\u2019s financial health. Believing, incorrectly, that Parma-lat could provide the Companies with continuing financial support and guarantee its loans, the innocent decision makers caused the already-insolvent Companies to incur debt they were unable to pay, thus deepening their insolvency. Second, plaintiffs claim that the $100 million GECC paid to Farmland as part of the sale-leaseback transaction was looted by Parmalat\u2019s corrupt insiders.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">\n<em>A. Deepened Insolvency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">The parties devote a great deal of space to arguing whether courts recognize \u201cdeepened insolvency\u201d damages or \u201cdeepening insolvency\u201d causes of action. But this ultimately is beside the point, as plaintiffs have failed adequately to allege that the Companies were injured when they allegedly were induced to incur debt, whatever the claimed injury should be labeled.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">\n<em>1. Debt and Insolvency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">Plaintiffs assume that the mere act of incurring debt when a company already is insolvent \u2014 that is, when its liabilities are greater than the value of its assets<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>when it is unable to repay its existing debt<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> \u2014 necessarily deepens the company\u2019s insolvency. This is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">When, for example, a company borrows cash and receives the full amount of the loan, it receives an asset that directly offsets the newly incurred liability on its balance sheet. In other words, the company \u201cexpand\u00eds] debt in <em>precise </em>proportion \u2014 dollar-for-dollar proportion \u2014 to the expansion of assets in the form of new cash.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The difference between the company\u2019s assets and liabilities therefore remains the same. Its ability to pay its debts as they become due is no worse; indeed, it may be better. The company\u2019s insolvency is no greater than before.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Ninth Circuit recognized this in <em>Rochelle v. Marine Midland Grace Trust Co. of New York.</em><footnotemark><em>95</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Rochelle, the trustee of a bankrupt company, Sunset, sued directors, officers, and auditors for mismanaging, looting, and otherwise breaching duties owed to the company. He asserted claims under the federal securities laws, arguing that Sunset was injured when the defendants misrepresented the company\u2019s financial health in order to secure loans that the company actually was unable to pay, thus deepening Sunset\u2019s insolvency. The court noted, however, that because Sunset received the full amount of the loans, it suffered no loss on the loan transactions in question. The court thus observed that Rochelle\u2019s theory was that Sunset\u2019s injury was caused not by the incurrence of debt, but rather by management\u2019s subsequent squandering of the loan proceeds. This, the court concluded, amounted to a claim of corporate mismanagement, and was not actionable under the securities laws.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">The point is that a company\u2019s insolvency is not deepened simply by the incurrence of new debt where the company suffers no loss on the loan transaction.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>vency is deepened when, for example, the proceeds of the loan are squandered\u2019 or assets otherwise are looted.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> It is at that point that the gap between liabilities and assets widens and the ability to service outstanding debt is impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The Companies are not alleged to have suffered any loss on the loan transactions in question. Accordingly, it would be misleading to refer to any injury the Companies may have suffered by incurring debt as \u201cdeepened insolvency.\u201d This is not to say, however, that the Companies necessarily suffered no injury at all.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\n<em>2. Debt and Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In <em>Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors v. R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co., Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>100</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the successors of two bankrupt corporations alleged that the corporations had been induced fraudulently to incur debt that they were unable to pay, thereby forcing them into bankruptcy. Although the Third Circuit framed the issue as whether Pennsylvania recognizes a cause of action for \u201cdeepening insolvency,\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> it addressed the underlying question\u2014 whether the corporations could have suffered any injury as a result of the alleged fraud. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">\u201cEven when a corporation is insolvent, its corporate property may have value. The fraudulent and concealed incurrence of debt can damage that value in several ways. For example, to the extent that bankruptcy is not already a certainty, the incurrence of debt can force an insolvent corporation into bankruptcy, thus inflicting legal and administrative costs on the corporation. When brought on by unwieldy debt, bankruptcy also creates operational limitations which hurt a corporation\u2019s ability to run its business in a profitable manner. Aside from causing actual bankruptcy, deepening insolvency can undermine a corporation\u2019s relationships with its customers, suppliers, and employees. The very threat of bankruptcy, brought about through fraudulent debt, can shake the confidence of parties dealing with the corporation, calling into question its ability to perform, thereby damaging the corporation\u2019s assets, the value of which often depends on the performance of other parties. In addition, prolonging an insolvent corporation\u2019s life through bad debt may simply cause the dissipation of corporate assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">\u201cThese harms can be averted, and the value within an insolvent corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>salvaged, if the corporation is dissolved in a timely manner, rather than kept afloat with spurious debt.\u201d <footnotemark>102</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaF\">Plaintiffs do not claim that defendants\u2019 actions ultimately drove the Companies into bankruptcy. Indeed, they allege that the Companies already were insolvent by 1999 and would have filed for bankruptcy even sooner than they did had Parmalat\u2019s true financial condition been revealed. Nor do plaintiffs allege that the Companies\u2019 incurrence of new debt harmed their business relationships, reputations, or otherwise hindered their operations. The complaints instead appear to draw on <em>Laf-ferty\u2019s </em>final theory of damages \u2014 that \u201cprolonging [the Companies\u2019] life through bad debt ... cause[d] the dissipation of corporate assets.\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Plaintiffs allege that innocent decision makers at the Companies would have sought \u201can orderly reorganization or liquidation of [the Companies] at a much earlier date, thus preserving assets,\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> had Parmalat\u2019s insolvency been revealed. In other words, plaintiffs claim that the Companies were injured in that they were induced to delay filing for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"A1fE\">\n<em>a. Delayed Liquidation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMf\">Although plaintiffs assume that delayed liquidation and delayed reorganization would have injured the Companies equally, there is a critical difference. If the Companies were insolvent by 1999 and liquidation was inevitable, then they had nothing to lose simply by continuing to operate, even if that would have meant the continued depletion of their assets. As one commentator writes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201cIn a liquidation, assets will be sold and the proceeds distributed to creditors. [In cases where] liquidation is inevitable ... [the harm caused by delayed bankruptcy filing is a] harm to the beneficiaries of that liquidation \u2014 the creditors. The corporation is no more one of them than the deceased is a beneficiary at the reading of his own will. If asset liquidation is the inevitable best case, the corporation is defunct. Delay does not hinder its ability to purchase raw material, operate its factories, sell widgets, collect receivables, make payroll, or sponsor the Mite A hockey team. All of those attributes of corporate life are gone, and once again we are adding insult only to death.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Accordingly, insofar as plaintiffs claim that the Companies were induced to delay in liquidating, they have failed to allege harm to the Companies themselves. And they of course lack standing to recoup damages suffered by others, such as the Companies\u2019 creditors.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">\n<em>b. Delayed Reorganization</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">However, insofar as plaintiffs claim that the Companies were injured because they were induced to delay filing for reorganization, the conclusion may be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\n<em>(1) Parmalat USA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Parmalat USA currently is in liquidation. If, however, Parmalat USA, at some point prior to February 2004, might have filed for reorganization and continued operating under bankruptcy protection instead of simply liquidating, it arguably missed the opportunity to fight for survival under bankruptcy protection. Its successor in interest then might have a case if he could establish that defendants\u2019 actions caused the company to miss that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The complaints allege few facts concerning Parmalat USA\u2019s financial condition pri- or to February 2004. They allege that Parmalat USA\u2019s financial statements for the years 2000 to 2002 reported that the company\u2019s insolvency \u2014 the amount by which liabilities exceeded assets \u2014 increased from about $40 million to about $47.5 million.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> This hardly establishes, however, that reorganization and continued operation would have been a viable option had the company filed for bankruptcy sooner than it did. The allegations, if proven, would leave a fact finder to speculate not only as to whether Parmalat USA would have filed for bankruptcy sooner,<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> but also as to whether the trustees would have sought reorganization as opposed to liquidation, and whether a plan for reorganization would have been approved. This is too much. Plaintiffs have not supplied factual allegations sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">\n<em>(2) Farmland</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Farmland is in a slightly different boat, as it filed for reorganization, and a plan was approved. It therefore was not deprived of the opportunity to fight for survival under bankruptcy protection. Nevertheless, it perhaps could be argued that Farmland was injured because it emerged from bankruptcy with a lower enterprise value than it otherwise would have as result of being induced to delay reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">The viability of this theory is not free from doubt.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Regardless, plaintiffs do not allege that Farmland operated at a loss or that its assets diminished in value simply as a result of the company\u2019s continued operations.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> The allegations therefore do not support the conclusion that earlier rather than later bankruptcy would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>have stemmed any additional losses or left the company with more assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Even if plaintiffs had alleged that Farmland\u2019s assets were depleted merely by continued operations, the allegations still would fail. It is too speculative to conclude that an earlier reorganization would have left Farmland, as opposed to some other interested party, better off. Bankruptcy reorganization is an inherently flexible process, as a bankruptcy court has broad equitable powers to craft a reorganization plan. In exercising those powers, a court must consider the interests of a number of relevant parties, including not only the debtor, but also its creditors.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Given this flexibility \u2014 and the paucity of allegations concerning Farmland\u2019s financial condition before February 2004 \u2014 it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to say what a hypothetical reorganization plan might have looked like had Farmland filed for bankruptcy protection at some unspecified earlier date. Even assuming that Farmland\u2019s estate would have been more valuable if bankruptcy protection had been sought earlier, it is far from clear that any of this additional value necessarily or probably would have been left to Farmland, as opposed to distributed to its creditors or other interested parties. Hence, too much speculation is required to conclude that Farmland itself would have benefitted from earlier bankruptcy protection. Accordingly, even if the complaints contained allegations supporting .this theory of injury, they would not raise plaintiffs\u2019 right to relief beyond the speculative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In sum, while the incurrence of debt by itself cannot deepen a company\u2019s insolvency, the Court is not prepared to conclude that it never can cause injury to an insolvent company. But plaintiffs nevertheless have failed to allege that it caused injury to the Companies in this case.. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be dismissed insofar as they seek damages for the Companies\u2019 wrongful incurrence of debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\n<em>B. Looting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">This does not dispose of all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, however. The complaints allege that Farmland acquired $100 million as part of the sale-leaseback transaction, and that this money subsequently was looted when Parmalat insiders diverted the funds to other Parmalat entities. As the foregoing analysis indicates, the looting of the proceeds of a loan can constitute an injury to a company.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Even assuming the truth of plaintiffs\u2019, allegations, however, the question whether the complaints adequately allege that defendants\u2019 actions caused the Companies\u2019 injuries would remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">\n<em>IV. Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Plaintiffs cannot succeed on any of their claims unless they establish that defendants\u2019 conduct caused the Companies\u2019 losses. It is not sufficient that they show \u201cbut for\u201d' causation. They must prove also that defendants\u2019 actions were the proximate cause of the Companies\u2019 losses.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\n<em>A. Defendants Other Than Deloitte USA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In <em>Bloor v. Carro, Spanbock, Londin, Rodman &amp; Fass,</em><footnotemark><em>114</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the trustee of a bankrupt company alleged a massive scheme in which the company\u2019s officers and controlling stockholders mismanaged the firm and looted corporate funds. The trustee sued, among others, a law firm in connection with its preparation of the company\u2019s SEC filings and other documents, which allegedly misrepresented the company\u2019s financial condition. The trustee claimed that these misrepresentations allowed the company to raise large amounts of capital, which ultimately was looted as part of the ongoing fraud at the company. The Second Circuit held, however, that this was insufficient to plead loss causation under the securities laws, as it amounted merely to a claim of \u201cbut for\u201d causation. The company\u2019s alleged losses, the court held, were caused by theft or mismanagement of corporate funds, not the raising of the funds that occurred with the defendant\u2019s help.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Plaintiffs allege that Parmalat\u2019s true financial condition would have been revealed had defendants acted properly and that either the innocent decision makers at the Companies or GECC would not have allowed the sale-leaseback transaction to go forward. They do not allege, however, that any of the defendants, with the exception of Deloitte USA, had any connection to the Companies or even knew about, assisted, or otherwise participated in the sale-leaseback transaction, let alone the looting of the proceeds. Absent such allegations, the Court fails to see how the Companies\u2019 losses were a foreseeable result of these defendants\u2019 alleged schemes to hide Parmalat\u2019s financial condition. As in <em>Bloor, </em>plaintiffs perhaps allege that \u201cbut for\u201d defendants\u2019 actions, the Companies would not have acquired the money that ultimately was looted. But they fail to allege that these defendants could have foreseen not only that the sale-leaseback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>transaction would have taken place, but also that the proceeds would have been squandered.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Plaintiffs cite the Court\u2019s decision in a related case brought by Dr. Enrico Bon-di, the Italian representative of Parma-lat\u2019s bankrupt estate.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Dr. Bondi, like plaintiffs here, sued the Bank of America Defendants and others for structuring fraudulent transactions that concealed Parmalat\u2019s mounting losses. The Court held that Dr. Bondi adequately pleaded proximate cause where he alleged that the defendants\u2019 \u201cmaterial omissions lulled Parmalat\u2019s innocent insiders into a false sense of security in the health of the Company\u201d and that \u201cthe innocent insiders relied on the mirage\u201d in failing to investigate further and thus failing to discover and halt the fraud.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Dr. Bondi\u2019s case, however, involved a substantially shorter chain of causation than plaintiffs allege here. It is reasonably foreseeable that misrepresenting a company\u2019s financial condition, and thus hiding from its innocent managers that the company is being driven into the ground, will cause the company harm. But it is significantly less foreseeable that doing so will cause a subsidiary with which the defendant has no contact to enter into a transaction of which the defendant has no knowledge and that the subsidiary subsequently will be injured when the proceeds are upstreamed to the parent and looted by its corrupt insiders. In other words, even assuming plaintiffs adequately have alleged that defendants helped perpetuate the Parmalat fraud, they have not alleged that it was foreseeable that the assets of one of Parmalat\u2019s subsidiaries would get swept into that scheme and looted and that the Companies thus would be injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Accordingly, plaintiffs have failed to plead proximate cause as to defendants other than Deloitte USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">\n<em>B. Deloitte USA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Deloitte USA is in a unique position because it audited the Companies and appraised Farmland\u2019s assets for purposes of the sale-leaseback transaction. The question, however, is whether these connections made it reasonably foreseeable to Deloitte USA that causing Farmland to enter into the sale-leaseback transaction would result in the looting of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The district court in the <em>Bloor </em>case held that neither auditors who overstated the victim company\u2019s financial condition in audit reports nor appraisers who overvalued its assets were liable when the money raised as a result of these misrepresentations eventually was looted by the company\u2019s management. \u201cWhile it was arguably foreseeable that, as a result of [the defendants\u2019 actions], securities issued and sold by [the company] would command a higher price than their true value, thus injuring purchasers and providing excessive funds to the corporation, it was not reasonably foreseeable that inside management of [the company] would embezzle the funds so received for their personal use.\u201d<footnotemark>118</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">Plaintiffs argue that this case is different because Deloitte USA knew that the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction would be upstreamed to Parmalat and that Parmalat was being looted by corrupt insiders. It therefore could have foreseen that if Farmland entered into the sale-leaseback transaction, the proceeds would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>be swept up into the Parmalat fraud. The question thus becomes whether plaintiffs adequately have alleged Deloitte USA\u2019s knowledge of the Parmalat fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\n<em>1. Direct Knowledge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhA\">To the extent that plaintiffs rely on allegations that Deloitte USA in fact knew that the proceeds would move upstream to Parmalat and that the corrupt insiders were looting that entity, Rule 9(b) applies, as they allege in substance Deloitte USA\u2019s culpable participation in the insiders\u2019 fraud.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">As noted, Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to allege facts raising a strong inference of the defendant\u2019s knowledge. The inference may arise where the complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendant (1) benefitted in a concrete and personal way from the purported fraud, (2) engaged in deliberately illegal behavior, (3) knew facts or had access to information suggesting that fraud was being committed, or (4) failed to check information it had a duty to monitor.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The complaints contain no allegations that Deloitte USA stood to receive any benefit from the Parmalat fraud. Rather, they allege that Deloitte USA engaged in deliberately fraudulent behavior by overstating Farmland\u2019s assets in its appraisal report, and that it improperly failed to investigate numerous \u201cred flags\u201d indicating that something was amiss at Parmalat. In other words, plaintiffs do not claim that Deloitte USA had motive and opportunity to perpetuate the Parmalat fraud, but that it consciously or recklessly misbehaved.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao4i\">\n<em>a. Fraudulent Appraisal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjV\">Plaintiffs argue that Deloitte USA\u2019s fraudulent intent can be inferred from the fact that it ignored certain valuation methods and relied on projected instead of actual earnings to arrive at an appraisal value of Farmland\u2019s assets that inexplicably was seven times greater than the value reported by DHAC four years earlier. They contend also that the inference is strengthened by the fact that Deloitte USA improperly served as both Parmalat USA\u2019s auditor and the appraiser for the sale-leaseback transaction. The argument has superficial appeal. But greater scrutiny reveals that it is not as strong as it appears at first blush.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">\n<em>(1) DHAC\u2019s 1999 Appraisal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGu\">First, it simply is not the case that Deloitte USA failed to explain why it reported a higher value than DHAC. Unlike DHAC\u2019s appraisal, which considered only Farmland\u2019s property in Wallington, New Jersey,<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> Deloitte USA\u2019s appraisal considered this property as well as property in Atlanta, Brooklyn, Grand Rapids, and Decatur, Alabama.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> In addition, Deloitte USA\u2019s appraisal report explained that there had been a \u201cmajor investment\u201d in the Wallington facility in \u201cthe past few years\u201d and that other equipment had been installed there \u201crecently.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>This of course does not establish, nor may the Court conclude on a motion to dismiss, that Deloitte USA provided accurate appraisal values in its report. But it substantially undercuts any inference of Deloitte USA\u2019s fraudulent intent based on the fact that its appraisal values were higher than DHAC\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">\n<em>(2) Valuation Approaches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Second, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, Deloitte USA\u2019s appraisal report did not \u201cignore\u201d the cost and market comparable approaches to valuation.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Rather, it considered these approaches, but concluded that the discounted cash flow approach was the most appropriate for valuing Farmland\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> It stated in the report that the cost approach was not viable because there was a dearth of information \u201cregarding the composition of the components\u201d of Farmland\u2019s property.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> Moreover, it stated that the market comparable approach was disadvantageous because comparisons to similar properties \u2014 the backbone of that approach \u2014 necessarily are imperfect. Deloitte USA nevertheless provided a valuation based on the market comparable approach and indicated that it \u201cconsidered the indication of value from this approach in assessing the reasonableness of the indication of value from [its] primary approach, the discounted cash flow approach.\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Plaintiffs do not explain why this was improper. Indeed, DHAC\u2019s appraisal report \u2014 which plaintiffs assume was accurate \u2014 also considered various approaches before concluding that one approach was appropriate for valuing certain properties while other approaches were more useful for valuing other properties.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> Plaintiffs fail also to explain how or why using other valuation methods besides the discounted cash flow approach would have produced better or more accurate appraisal values. Accordingly, allegations that Deloitte USA ignored certain valuation methods do not raise a strong inference of fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\"><em>(S) </em>\u201cCalculated\u201d <em>EBITDA Values</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5fl\">Third, the allegations that Deloitte USA improperly used \u201ccalculated\u201d EBITDA values for the years 2001 and 2002 in employing the discounted cash flow approach are belied by Deloitte USA\u2019s appraisal report.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">According to the report, Deloitte USA projected 2003 EBITDA values and then reduced them by 2.5 percent per year to arrive at 2001 and 2002 values in employing the market comparable approach, not the discounted cash flow approach. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>report states that this was done in order to make Farmland\u2019s EBITDA values consistent with those of \u201cguideline companies\u201d to which Farmland was compared for purposes of the market comparable approach, and for which actual 2002 EBITDA values were unavailable.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> But as noted, Deloitte USA stated in the appraisal report that the market comparable approach was not as appropriate for valuing Farmland\u2019s assets as the discounted cash flow approach. In employing the discounted cash flow approach, the report stated, Deloitte USA used historical revenue and other information for 2001 and 2002. It did not \u201ccalculate\u201d EBITDA values the way it did for purposes of the market comparable approach. In fact, the report does not state that Deloitte USA considered EBITDA values, \u201ccalculated\u201d or otherwise, in applying the discounted cash flow approach.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In light of this, the complaints must be interpreted as alleging that Deloitte USA\u2019s statements about the data it used for purposes of employing the discounted cash flow approach were false. But the complaints allege no facts raising an inference, let alone a strong inference, that this was the case. A bald allegation that Deloitte USA said one thing and did another is too conclusory to satisfy Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">\n<em>(k) Failure to Maintain Independence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">Finally, an auditor\u2019s violation of an ethical duty of independence by itself does not give rise to a strong inference of fraud. It may bolster other facts that tend to demonstrate fraud.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Generally, however, an auditor\u2019s decision to take on non-audit work that threatens to compromise its duty of independence gives rise to a strong inference of culpable intent only when it is shown that the auditor had a \u201cdirect stake\u201d in the alleged fraud.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">Plaintiffs do not allege that Deloitte USA stood to benefit from aiding the Par-malat fraud or that it had anything to gain from appraising Farmland\u2019s assets other than ordinary appraisal fees. The mere expectation of ordinary fees is not a sufficient motive to raise a strong inference of culpable intent.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Moreover, it is of more than passing interest that it was CGM \u2014 an entity that is not alleged to have had anything to do with the Parmalat fraud \u2014 that \u201crequested\u201d that Deloitte USA conduct the appraisal for GECC. Had Parmalat or some other allegedly culpable entity done so, this per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>haps would have taken plaintiffs closer to raising the inference that Deloitte USA\u2019s supposed violation of its duty of independence was motivated by fraudulent intent. But that is not what the complaints allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Accordingly, none of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of improper appraisal methods raises a strong inference of Deloitte USA\u2019s knowledge of the Parmalat fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\n<em>b. Improper Auditing Practices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Plaintiffs next contend that culpable knowledge can be inferred from Deloitte USA\u2019s allegedly improper audits of Parma-lat USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Allegations that an auditor failed to follow GAAS or other auditing procedures do not alone support a claim of fraud.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> \u201cOnly where such allegations are coupled with evidence of \u2018corresponding fraudulent intent,\u2019 might they be sufficient.\u201d <footnotemark>135</footnotemark> Accordingly, the issue is not whether plaintiffs have alleged GAAS violations, but whether they have alleged facts indicating that those violations were motivated by or indicative or products of fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The complaints allege that Deloitte USA encountered obvious signs that something was amiss at Parmalat, but failed to investigate and blow the whistle. Plaintiffs therefore rely on a theory of recklessness to show fraudulent intent.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> The Second Circuit defines reckless conduct as conduct that is \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d and represents \u201can extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care ... to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> \u201c[A]n egregious, refusal to see the obvious, or to investigate the doubtful, may in some cases give rise to an inference of ... recklessness.\u201d <footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">\n<em>(1) Reimbursement Credits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Avz\">Plaintiffs argue that it should have been obvious to Deloitte USA that something improper was going on at Parmalat because it knew that Parmalat\u2019s reimbursement credits were bogus. They contend that Deloitte USA knew this because it conducted a successor audit of Parmalat USA in 1999 and discovered that Parmalat USA had not collected on any of the credits it had received from 1995 to 1998. This is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The complaints do not allege why Par-malat\u2019s failure to pay past credits within a few years necessarily or probably should have indicated that it never would pay them. They do not allege, for example, that Parmalat had promised to the pay reimbursement credits within a certain time frame or that its consistent practice prior to 1995 had been to pay reimbursement credits more quickly. Accordingly, it cannot be said that Parmalat\u2019s failure to pay past reimbursement credits within a four-year span should have signaled to De-loitte USA that its credits were a sham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>altogether, let alone that Parmalat\u2019s insiders were engaged in a fraudulent scheme to loot the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Plaintiffs contend also that Deloitte USA should have known something was amiss at Parmalat when Deloitte Italy and Par-malat refused to provide it with \u201cconfirmation ... of the calculations and nature ... [and] accounting treatment\u201d of the reimbursement credits.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> If Parmalat and De-loitte Italy were evasive in providing information material to Parmalat USA\u2019s audit and Deloitte USA failed to follow up, this perhaps would go some way towards raising an inference of recklessness.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> But plaintiffs\u2019 allegations nevertheless are insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The complaints do not explain what it means to receive \u201cconfirmation\u201d of the \u201ccalculations and nature\u201d of reimbursement credits, or what a response to a request for such \u201cconfirmation\u201d would look like. The most reasonable interpretation the Court can supply, bearing in mind that it must construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, is that Deloitte USA sought confirmation that Parmalat USA had booked the proper amount of credits and that it had accounted for them properly by booking them as reimbursement of expenses as opposed to a capital contribution from Parmalat. Plaintiffs do not explain, however, how Deloitte Italy\u2019s or Parmalat\u2019s failure to answer these questions would have indicated to Deloitte USA that Parmalat never would pay the reimbursement credits or that Parmalat\u2019s insiders were committing fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Plaintiffs do not allege that Parmalat or Deloitte Italy failed to confirm that Par-malat would pay the credits or that it had the financial means to do so. Had Parma-lat or Deloitte Italy been evasive in answering <em>these </em>questions, perhaps this would have made the fact that Parmalat was concealing financial difficulties sufficiently obvious to Deloitte USA to support an inference of conscious recklessness. But that is not what plaintiffs allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">The allegations imply that Deloitte USA acted improperly in failing to ask these questions. This, however, amounts at best to a claim that Deloitte USA violated auditing standards or that it was negligent, perhaps even grossly so. But it does not raise the inference that Deloitte USA recklessly disregarded a substantial possibility that Parmalat was being looted.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\n<em>(2) Going Concern Qualifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ave\">The allegations regarding going concern qualifications fail to raise an inference of culpable knowledge as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Plaintiffs allege that, in connection with Parmalat USA\u2019s audit for the years 1999 to 2001, Deloitte USA improperly relied on management representations instead of \u201cactual audit evidence\u201d that Parmalat intended to provide continuing financial support to the Companies. But GAAS, AU Section 333.02, provides that \u201crepresentations from management are part of the evidential matter the independent auditor\u201d must obtain.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> Moreover, AU Section 333.11 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cif the independent auditor performs an audit of the financial statements of a subsidiary but does not audit those of the parent company, he or she may want to obtain representations from management of the parent company concerning matters that may affect the subsidiary, such as related-party transactions <em>or the parent company\u2019s intention to provide continuing financial support to the subsidiary.\u201d </em><footnotemark>143</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Plaintiffs claim that this does not get Deloitte USA off the hook because AU Section 333.02 permits an auditor to use management representations as a supplement to other audit evidence, not as \u201ca substitute for the application of those auditing procedures necessary to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit.\u201d<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> Plaintiffs fail to allege, however, what else beside management representations would qualify as \u201cactual audit evidence\u201d of Par-malat\u2019s future intent to continue supporting the Companies and therefore why management representations alone were insufficient. In any event, even if there were some other audit evidence that De-loitte USA failed to obtain, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations would amount only to a claim that Deloitte USA violated GAAS, which is not enough to raise an inference of culpable knowledge.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">The only allegations that bring plaintiffs close to raising a sufficient inference of recklessness are the claims that Bigogno of Deloitte Italy refused to honor Potts\u2019 request for audit evidence in connection with Parmalat USA\u2019s 2002 audit. As noted, allegations that Deloitte Italy or Par-malat refused to provide necessary audit information to Deloitte USA may be sufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b). The Court need not decide the issue, however. Even assuming that the Bigogno-Potts exchange is sufficient to raise a strong inference of Deloitte USA\u2019s culpable knowledge, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>would not help plaintiffs on the proximate cause issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The Bigogno-Potts exchange allegedly occurred on May 8, 2003. This, however, was after Deloitte USA\u2019s audits of Parma-lat USA for the years 1999 to 2001 and its April 30, 2003 appraisal of Farmland\u2019s assets. The only alleged conduct of Deloitte USA that occurred after May 8, 2003, was its 2002 audit of Parmalat USA. But plaintiffs do not allege that GECC or any other party relied on audited financial statements for 2002 in deciding whether the sale-leaseback transaction should go forward. They allege only that GECC required Parmalat USA\u2019s audited financial statements for the years 2000 and 2001, and that it received <em>unaudited </em>financial statements for 2002. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Bigogno-Potts exchange made it reasonably foreseeable that Deloitte USA\u2019s actions, at the time they were taken, would lead to the looting of the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>(3) Overstatement of Goodwill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Finally, allegations that Deloitte USA failed to reveal that Parmalat USA\u2019s goodwill was overstated in financial statements fail to raise a strong inference of fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">According to plaintiffs, Parmalat USA reported that its goodwill was approximately $202 million at the end of fiscal year 2000 and $198 million at the end of fiscal year 2001. This constituted approximately half of Parmalat USA\u2019s total reported assets in those years. Plaintiffs do not explain, however, what is improper or misleading about these values. They simply claim that \u201cthe results of the underlying operations of Parmalat-USA and its subsidiaries did not justify\u201d the reported values. In addition, they allege that even though Parmalat USA reduced the company\u2019s reported goodwill by $26.5 million in 2002, \u201cthis write-down was not sufficient.\u201d <footnotemark>146</footnotemark> Allegations that reported goodwill values were \u201cunjustified\u201d or that a reduction in values was \u201cinsufficient\u201d are conclusions. They are not facts constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Plaintiffs contend also that \u201cDeloitte recklessly did not require that [the 2002 write-down of goodwill] flow through to the consolidated financial statements of Parmalat-SpA.\u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> The vague reference to \u201cDeloitte\u201d fails to indicate that Deloitte USA, which audited only Parmalat USA and apparently had no direct connection to Parmalat, was responsible for ensuring that information \u201cflow through\u201d to Parma-lat\u2019s financial statements. Indeed, plaintiffs state elsewhere in the pleadings that this was the responsibility of Deloitte Italy.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> The allegation therefore fails to raise a strong inference of Deloitte USA\u2019s fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">\n<em>2. Imputed Knowledge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUal\">The fact that plaintiffs have failed to allege conduct by Deloitte USA itself that would give rise to an inference of culpable knowledge is not the end of the story. The complaints allege that Deloitte Italy was involved intimately in the Parmalat fraud and that its knowledge of wrongdoing, if any, should be imputed to Deloitte USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">\n<em>a. Agency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first theory is that Deloitte Italy was DTT\u2019s agent, and that DTT in turn was Deloitte USA\u2019s agent.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> As will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>become clear, however, even assuming plaintiffs adequately have alleged Deloitte Italy\u2019s knowledge of the Parmalat fraud and its agency relationship with DTT, they have not alleged adequately that DTT was Deloitte USA\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">As the Court previously has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cAn agency relationship exists under New York law when there is agreement between the principal and the agent that the agent will act for the principal and the principal retains a degree of control over the agent. The element of control often is deemed the essential characteristic of the principal-agent relationship. To bind a principal, an agent must have authority, whether apparent, actual or implied. Actual authority arises from a principal\u2019s direct manifestations to the agent. It may be express or implied, but in either case it exists only where the agent may reasonably infer from the words or conduct of the principal that the principal has consented to the agent\u2019s performance of a particular act.\u201d<footnotemark>150</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">\n<em>(1) Common Officers and Directors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AD8N\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allege first that eleven of twenty-six members of DTT\u2019s board of directors were partners of Deloitte USA, and that DTT and Deloitte USA shared a chief executive officer and a chief financial officer.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> But the fact that two corporations share officers and directors does not establish by itself that one corporation is the agent of the other. It is a \u201cwell established principle [of corporate law] that directors and officers holding positions with a parent and its subsidiary can and do \u2018change hats\u2019 to represent the two corporations separately, despite their common ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> \u201c[C]ourts generally presume \u2018that the directors are wearing their \u2018subsidiary hats\u2019 and not their \u2018parent hats\u2019 when acting for the subsidiary.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>153</footnotemark> Plaintiffs offer no allegations to overcome this presumption.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Moreover, the overlap of DTT\u2019s management with that of Deloitte USA is equally consistent with the inference that DTT controlled Deloitte USA as it is with the inference that Deloitte USA controlled DTT. Indeed, plaintiffs allege that \u201cDTT exercised authority and control over the various Deloitte member firms engaged in Parmalat audits.\u201d<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> Deloitte USA cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>be said to have controlled DTT if, as is alleged, DTT was in control of Deloitte USA.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>(2) Deloitte USA\u2019s Financial Support of other Deloitte Entities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Plaintiffs next allege that Deloitte USA paid the salaries and benefits of ten to forty percent of DTT\u2019s employees, \u201cfinancially subsidized Deloitte\u2019s global integration process for the less profitable member firms such as [Deloitte Italy],\u201d and provided funding to pay for claims brought against Deloitte member firms when their liability insurance did not provide complete coverage.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The fact that one corporation finances some of the operations of another does not necessarily establish an agency relationship. The provision of financing does not in every circumstance establish the ability to control the way the beneficiary corporation performs its work. And where it does \u2014 perhaps because the financing corporation can threaten to cut off future support \u2014 it does not necessarily entail the beneficiary\u2019s power to act on the financing corporation\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> The allegations regarding Deloitte USA\u2019s role in the Deloitte organization suggest at most that Deloitte USA was a particularly profitable Deloitte member firm and that DTT \u2014 the umbrella entity allegedly capable of controlling the Deloitte member firms \u2014 therefore used the proceeds from Deloitte USA\u2019s operations to fund the operations of itself and certain other member firms. The allegations by themselves do not support the inference that Deloitte USA controlled the manner of DTT\u2019s performance, or that DTT acted on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">\n<em>(3) Dispute Between Deloitte USA and Deloitte Italy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Finally, plaintiffs allege that when Ma-moli of Deloitte Italy objected to the idea of Deloitte USA appraising Farmland\u2019s assets while simultaneously serving as Parmalat USA\u2019s auditor, Deloitte USA \u201csecure[d] the intervention of\u2019 DTT\u2019s Horstmann to \u201cpersuade\u201d Mamoli to withdraw his objection.<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, this demonstrates that Deloitte USA controlled DTT.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">This is unavailing. Alleging that a company requested a representative of its parent organization to resolve its business dispute with a sister company is far from alleging that it controlled the parent organization. Plaintiffs do not allege, for example, that anyone at Deloitte USA ordered \u2014 or had the authority to order\u2014 Horstmann to intervene, let alone to resolve the dispute the way he did. Rather, they allege that it was Horstmann\u2019s job to resolve disputes between Deloitte member firms and that even though it was Deloitte USA that requested his help, Horstmann was acting on behalf of DTT when he intervened. Accordingly, apart from the conclusory and therefore insufficient allegation that Deloitte USA was \u201cdominant over DTT,\u201d and \u201cimpose[d] its will\u201d on Deloitte Italy,<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> plaintiffs do not allege anything about DTT\u2019s involvement in the dispute that would support the conclusion that Deloitte USA controlled DTT.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\n<em>b. Joint Venture</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second theory of imputed knowledge is that all of the Deloitte entities were engaged in a joint venture. Knowledge of a joint adventurer is imputed to its co-adventurers.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXaG\">\u201cA joint venture is a special combination of two or more persons where in some specific venture a profit is jointly sought. The indicia of the existence of a joint venture are: (i) acts manifesting the intent of the parties to be associated as joint venturers; (ii) mutual contribution to the joint undertaking through a combination of property, financial resources, effort, skill or knowledge; (iii) a measure of joint proprietorship and control over the enterprise; and (iv) a provision for the sharing of profits and losses. The ultimate inquiry is whether the parties have so joined their property, interests, skills and risks that for the purpose of the particular adventure their respective contributions have become as one and the commingled property and interests of the parties have thereby been made subject to each of the associates on the trust and inducement that each would act for their joint benefit.\u201d <footnotemark>163</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory essentially is that the Deloitte member firms were joint adventurers in auditing Parmalat\u2019s financial statements, as each provided auditing services under the Deloitte aegis to different Parmalat entities according to the same auditing standards and shared in the profits and fees generated by the Parmalat account.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> The Court previously rejected just such a theory, holding that \u201callegations that several firms worked on specific Parmalat-related assets together and that they all followed the same auditing standards\u201d did not give rise to an inference that the firms had mutual control over each other and the purported enterprise.<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> In other words, it failed to indicate that each firm\u2019s individual work on a particular Parmalat project had \u201cbecome as one\u201d with the work of its sister firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish this case by arguing that the alleged joint venture here was not the <em>auditing </em>of Parma-lat, but the <em>certification </em>of its financial statements.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> They claim that each member firm had the ability to withhold certification of a Parmalat subsidiary\u2019s financial statements, and therefore the <em>de facto </em>power to ensure that Parmalat\u2019s consolidated financial statements did not receive certification or an unqualified opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">This is unavailing. One of the essential features of a joint venture is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>agreement among the parties to share profits and losses from the undertaking. The Deloitte firms, however, presumably did not earn profits or suffer losses in connection with their certification of Par-malat\u2019s financial statements, but in connection with their provision of auditing services to various Parmalat entities. That is, they presumably received payment regardless of whether they issued certifications or qualified their audit reports. Plaintiffs allege no facts to rebut this presumption.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> Hence, it cannot be said that the Deloitte entities engaged in a joint venture, the sole object of which was to ensure that Parma-lat\u2019s consolidated financial statements were certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Plaintiffs claim also that there was joint control in this case because each member firm \u201chad the power to, and did, control the nature, amount, and flow of information to other Deloitte member firms regarding the Parmalat entity, subsidiary, or affiliate under audit.\u201d <footnotemark>168</footnotemark> But this cuts the other way. It suggests that the firms did <em>not </em>have control over one another\u2019s work, but instead acted as individual entities working on discrete projects. If there were a free flow of information and each firm had unfettered access to information concerning a sister firm\u2019s project, then perhaps one could infer that the work of all the De-loitte firms had \u201cbecome as one.\u201d The complaints, however, allege the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In the last analysis, the Court is not persuaded that plaintiffs have alleged that DTT was Deloitte USA\u2019s agent, or that the Deloitte member firms were engaged in a joint venture. Any knowledge Deloitte Italy and DTT might have had of the Par-malat fraud therefore cannot be imputed to Deloitte USA.<footnotemark>169</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">As plaintiffs have failed adequately to allege Deloitte USA\u2019s knowledge that Par-malat\u2019s insiders were committing fraud, they have failed to allege that it was reasonably foreseeable to Deloitte USA that its conduct eventually would result in the looting of Farmland\u2019s assets. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, this case is indistinguishable from <em>Bloor. </em>Plaintiffs allege at most that Deloitte USA caused the sale-leaseback transaction to occur. But they do not allege adequately that Deloitte USA proximately caused the proceeds of that transaction to be looted. Accordingly, plaintiffs have failed to plead proximate cause for purposes of their claims against Deloitte USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">The motions of Deloitte USA, DTT, De-loitte Italy, GTI, GT USA, the Bank of America Defendants, the Credit Suisse Defendants, and BNL to dismiss the second amended complaints of Smith<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> and Pappas<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> are granted in their entirety. The motion of Banca Intesa to dismiss Smith\u2019s second amended complaint<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>granted in its entirety as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">MEMORANDUM AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Plaintiffs Smith and Pappas move for reconsideration of the Court\u2019s decision granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss their Second Amended Complaints (\u201cSAC\u201ds)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or, alternatively, for leave to amend. The motion is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>The Motion for Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Plaintiffs first argue that the Court \u201cincorrectly stated the standards for pleading.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court cannot, however, discern from their memorandum why they believe this is so. The relevant portion of the document begins by noting that the SACs were prepared before <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. </em>Twombly<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and its progeny,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which the Court relied upon, had been decided, but then fails to argue that the Court misapprehended the standard that now governs. Plaintiffs have failed to show that the Court overlooked any material matters or controlling decisions. Nothing further need be said on this point save that the Court would have dismissed the SACs for substantially the same reasons even before <em>Twombly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Plaintiffs next argue that they sufficiently pleaded loss causation under <em>Bloor v. Carro, Spanbock, Londin, Rodman &amp; Fass</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The significance and import of <em>Bloor, </em>however, were briefed extensively on the motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs have said nothing that persuades me that I misapprehended it or otherwise erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">\n<em>Leave to Amend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-17\">These cases were filed long after the initial U.S. complaints relating to the collapse of Parmalat. Plaintiffs here therefore had the benefit of many prior pleadings by other plaintiffs and, indeed, of several rulings on motions to dismiss in other cases before they filed their original complaints. Moreover, shortly after filing their original complaints, both filed amended complaints. That in No. 06 Civ. 0383 was 342 pages long, that in No. 06 Civ. 3109 a mere 340 pages in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-18\">In August 2006, the Court granted a motion by defendants in No. 06 Civ. 0383 to dismiss the amended complaint in that case, principally on the ground that it did not comply with the short and plain statement requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). In so doing, it noted that it was \u201creadily apparent that [the pleading] was cut and pasted from other pleadings in other Par-malat cases without necessary regard to what is relevant to this case, the consistency of the other pleadings, and any consideration for anyone who has to read it.\u201d Order, Aug. 16, 2006, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-19\">Plaintiffs then filed SACs in both of these cases. They pared the complaints down to the 140-160 page range. But they did little to cure the other problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">It of course is a commonplace that leave to amend should be freely granted, but that principle has its limits. Bad faith, undue delay, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice and other factors may warrant denial of leave.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And this is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>a case in which further leave to amend would be a step too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">To begin with, plaintiffs have had more than sufficient opportunity to file sufficient complaints. The SACs of course are their third attempts to plead their claims. Moreover, as noted, these three attempts have had the benefit of extensive pleadings by other parties as well as rulings by the Court on other motions in other cases. I see no excuse for allowing the plaintiffs more than the three strikes they already have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Second, the problems that resulted in the dismissal of the SACs should have been apparent to the plaintiffs even before they filed their original complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Third, plaintiffs have tendered no proposed third amended complaints and have not even begun to suggest how they think they might cure the deficiencies in the SACs.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Finally, this is a large and exceptionally complex multidistrict proceeding. These plaintiffs, with their unjustifiably verbose pleadings, have contributed more than their share to its extraordinary cost and burden. I see no sufficient reason for these belatedly filed and dubious cases to continue to complicate this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration or, alternatively, leave to amend is denied in all respects. The Clerk shall enter final judgment dismissing these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-13\">. 06 Civ. 0383.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-14\">. 06 Civ. 3109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-15\">. <em>Pappas v.

While this is a substantial improvement over the first amended complaint, which was 342 pages long and contained 1309 numbered paragraphs, it still is unnecessarily long. In addition, where allegations concerning a particular topic could have been placed in a single section, plaintiffs instead have spread them among numerous, disparate sections, leaving it to the Court to consolidate relevant allegations to get a coherent picture of the alleged wrongdoing and the relationships among the parties. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-56, 266-315 (describing Deloitte Defendants and their relationships to one another); <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 215-223, 322-343 (alleging wrongdoing related to Bonlat).

Plaintiffs do allege that Farmland's assets were depleted when they were up-streamed to Parmalat and subsequently looted. Allegations that the Companies were injured by corporate looting are dealt with more fully below. The present question, however, is not whether earlier bankruptcy would have prevented intervening factors, such as the Par-malat fraud, from affecting Farmland. Rather, it is whether the mere continuation of Farmland's operations outside of bankruptcy left the company worse off \u2014 that is, whether \u25a0the mere incurrence of debt, separate and apart from what happened to the loan proceeds, caused injury to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">As noted, plaintiffs allege that the consolidated financial statements of \"Parmalat USA and its subsidiaries'' revealed that Par-malat USA\u2019s insolvency increased by about $7.5 million between 2000 and 2002, <em>Pap-pas </em>SAC \u00b6 103, during which period Parma-lat USA incurred more debt, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 151.
