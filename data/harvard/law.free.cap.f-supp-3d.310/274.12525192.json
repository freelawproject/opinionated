D. 269, \u00b6 1; D. 271 at 2; D. 273 at 2; D. 275 at 2; D. 277 at 2. Mastic, formerly known as Alcoa Home Exteriors, Inc., and owned by Ply Gem Industries, Inc. (\"Ply Gem\"), marketed and distributed Oasis. D. 269, \u00b6 2. Mastic sold Oasis to wholesalers and distributors, who would in turn resell Oasis to other distributors, contractors and retailers, who in turn would sell Oasis to end-users or consumers. D. 271 at 2; D. 273 at 2; D. 275 at 2; D. 277 at 2. Mastic offered an express warranty that Oasis \"would be free from defects in material and worksmanship for twenty-five years\" (the \"Limited Warranty\"). D. 269, \u00b6 4. The Limited Warranty included a disclaimer that limited the remedies for a warranty claim to replacement of defective Oasis decking or refund of the value of the defective product. D. 269, \u00b6 5. The Limited Warranty also provided that Mastic was not responsible for consequential, special or incidental damages arising out of the purchase of Oasis and that it was the exclusive warranty for Oasis.

Pagliaroni built his Oasis deck in the summer of 2006. D. 269, \u00b6 11. D. 271 at 3. Pagliaroni noticed cracks in his Oasis deck for the first time in August 2007, approximately one year after it had been constructed and installed. D. 269, \u00b6 16; D. 271 at 3. In addition to cracking, Pagliaroni also saw mold growth and swelling and warping of the Oasis deck boards, which concerned him. D. 269, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; D. 271 at 3-4. As the cracking continued to worsen, Pagliaroni's contractor inspected the deck in 2007 and concluded that the problems related to the product rather than the installation. D. 269, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; D. 271 at 4. Pagliaroni then attempted to contact Mastic about the issues with his Oasis deck later in 2007, but did not speak to anyone. D. 269, \u00b6 21; D. 271 at 4. In early 2010, Pagliaroni or his wife contacted Mastic again, and in April 2010, Mastic sent Pagliaroni a letter informing him of the warranty process and enclosing a warranty claim form. D. 269, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; D. 271 at 4. Pagliaroni submitted a warranty claim in April 2011. D. 269, \u00b6 24; D. 271 at 4.

Costello knew of the Limited Warranty \"that had conditions regarding coverage.\" D. 269, \u00b6 52. Costello noticed problems with his Oasis deck for the first time between Spring 2009 and 2010, when he saw delamination and warping of the deck boards. D. 269, \u00b6 54; D. 273 at 3. Costello contacted Mastic, which approved his warranty claim and offered reimbursement of the purchase price of his Oasis deck, but Costello rejected the offer.

D. 269, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. O'Brien reviewed two Oasis brochures before she purchased Oasis decking. D. 269, \u00b6 66. When making this decision, O'Brien paid particular attention to the Limited Warranty, which was described and referred to in the brochures. D. 269, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. O'Brien was aware \"that there might be exclusions from coverage under the warranty because it was a limited warranty.\" D. 269, \u00b6 69. O'Brien noticed problems for the first time between late 2010 and spring 2011, when she noticed mold on her Oasis deck. D. 269, \u00b6 70; D. 277 at 3. O'Brien submitted a warranty claim to Mastic on or about June 12, 2012. D. 269, \u00b6 73; D. 277 at 3. Mastic inspected O'Brien's Oasis deck on August 28, 2012. D. 269, \u00b6 74; D. 277 at 3. On September 4, 2012, Mastic denied O'Brien's warranty claim because the cracking in her Oasis deck was caused by the manner in which the deck was screwed down during installation rather than a defect covered by the Limited Warranty.

D. 53 \u00b6\u00b6 137-218. On September 22, 2015, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, D. 231, so only the individually named plaintiffs remain.

DNA makes\n   the same argument for Pagliaroni's breach of implied warranty claim against it. Plaintiffs counter that Pagliaroni's claims are not time-barred because the limitations period was tolled by Mastic and DNA's fraudulent concealment of its knowledge relating to Oasis's susceptibility to premature cracking, pointing to Mastic testing in December 2006 which revealed \"catastrophic failures\" in Oasis. D. 291 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Claims for breach of warranty under Massachusetts law are subject to a four-year statute of limitations under contract-based theories, or three years for tort-based theories.

Here, the Court applies a contract-based theory because the claims allegedly arise from an alleged breach of a warranty agreement. The original complaint in this case, including Pagliaroni's claim, was not filed until January 27, 2012. D. 1. Defendants argue that the statute of limitations on Pagliaroni's claims began to run in summer 2006 when his deck was installed.

Therefore, Pagliaroni's breach of implied warranty claims accrued from the date of delivery in 2006 and expired prior to the filing of the complaint in 2012.

Plaintiffs point to Mastic and DNA's Sales and Distribution Agreement and the deposition testimony of Scott Ricke, DNA's Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) designee, D. 289-16, as evidence of a direct relationship that establishes privity because ABC Suppliers was a \"valid\" distributor for Mastic, thereby establishing a link. D. 289-16 at 10; D. 290 at 11-14. However, ABC Suppliers' role as a sub-distributor for Mastic makes it an intermediate seller, for whom DNA did not honor the express warranty, D. 289-16 at 7-8, and privity with the manufacturer is obviated. Accordingly, the Court ALLOWS DNA's motion as to Costello's claims for breach of implied warranty (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The question as to Mastic turns on any agency relationship between Mastic and ABC Suppliers.

After Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was denied, the case and the evidence submitted by the Parties no longer related to Mastic or DNA's entire inventory of sold or manufactured Oasis decking. Rather, the case turned on the evidence relating to each of Plaintiffs' individual Oasis decks, and whether the damage they claimed those decks suffered due to manufacturing defect entitled them to compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Count XIII fares no better when parts (d) and (e) are evaluated as a claim for injunctive relief. A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must show \"(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.

Plaintiffs have not made any of the requisite showings to support maintaining Count XIII. The injuries Plaintiffs allege, to the extent they survive Defendants' motion on other grounds, are not irreparable and have adequate remedies at law through monetary damages. Furthermore, as explained above, the equities and public interest would both be disserved in maintaining a\n   claim for injunctive relief affecting Defendants' entire business practices when Plaintiffs represent only their individual interests, rather than a certified class. Accordingly, the Court allows Mastic and DNA's motions as to Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief (Count XIII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court ALLOWS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Mastic's motion for summary judgment, D. 266, and ALLOWS DNA's motions for summary judgment, D. 270, 272, 274, 276. Accordingly, the only counts that remain are Count I (breach of express warranty claims against Mastic) as to O'Brien, Costello and Lynch, and Count II (breach of implied warranty claim against Mastic) as to Costello.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In addition to the four named Plaintiffs, plaintiff Melisa Burnett was also listed as a putative class representative in the SAC.

To extent that portions of Count I and II survive, the Court concludes that the sanctions motion, filed in conjunction with Defendants' motions for summary judgment and more than three years after Defendants' counsel provided notice of the purported deficiency, D. 265-22, is untimely,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Long v.

Furthermore, even if the motion was timely, and the withheld computation of damages was improper, considering that it may be fairly inferred by the delayed filing of this motion that the computation evidence was not necessary for Defendants to defeat class certification or raise colorable arguments with respect to all outstanding claims on summary judgment, the drastic sanction of exclusion would not be warranted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Esposito v.

As a related matter, the Court ALLOWS Plaintiffs' motion to supplement its disclosure regarding the computations of damages, D. 280, but only as to the portions of Counts I and II that survived the motions for summary judgment and such supplementation must be done by March 1, 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
