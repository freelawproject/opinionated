BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By letter dated November 22, 2016, plaintiff sent a request to HUD for \"all\n   document(s) related to Derek N. Jarvis, and Shirley J. Pittman, and record(s) related to Jarvis and Pittman,\" including phone records, emails, and letters. Compl., Ex. 1 (exhibit numbers designated by the court). Roughly three months later, plaintiff sent a second letter to HUD which in relevant part stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 22, 2016, I submitted a letter to HUD requesting all records, documents, emails[,] phone records, logs[,] etc., pertaining to Derek Jarvis. Derek Jarvis has filed several complaints with HUD against Landlords since 2006, and the agency has failed to enforce housing violations and discrimination that he has been subjected to, engaging in fraud and possible conspiracy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   It has now been approximately, (3) months since I first requested this information ..., and I have not received any information from HUD .... HUD had engaged in fraudulent practices during the prior administration and refused to enforce housing violations and in some cases which I experienced facilitated the housing violations by landlords.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2. Plaintiff sent both requests to HUD's Secretary \"by first class postal mail to HUD's Washington[,] DC address on 451 7th Street, S.W.\" Jarvis Decl. \u00b6 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He filed this civil action on August 28, 2017, by which time HUD had not responded to either request. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A FOIA case typically and appropriately is decided on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gold Anti-Trust Action Comm., Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183023\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/762/123/#p130\">\n    762 F.Supp.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130 (D.D.C. 2011) (citations omitted). Summary judgment is granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) ;\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v. Catrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    477 U.S. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). In determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n    475 U.S. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n    89 L.Ed.2d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Under FOIA, all underlying facts and inferences are analyzed in the light most favorable to the FOIA requester; as such, only after an agency proves that it has fully discharged its FOIA obligations is summary judgment appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Aspin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7778680\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/916/32/#p35\">\n    916 F.Supp. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35 (D.D.C. 1996) (citing\n   <em>\n    Weisberg v.

Cir. 1983) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In reviewing a motion for summary judgment under FOIA, the court conducts a de novo review of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). The court may award summary judgment solely on the basis of information provided by the agency in an affidavit or declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Military Audit Project v. Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1267816,3518669\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/656/724/\">\n    656 F.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981). An agency's affidavit or declaration must be \"relatively detailed and non-conclusory.\"\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Serv., Inc. v. SEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (D.C.

In support of its motion, HUD submits the declaration of Deborah R. Snowden, Deputy Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer in the Office of the Executive Secretariat. Ms. Snowden explains HUD's procedures for processing FOIA requests as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. When a FOIA request is received by HUD, it is first entered into the FOlA Management System (\"FMS\") and assigned a FOIA control number .... Requests submitted ... through the mail are date-stamped upon receipt and immediately forwarded to appropriate staff for entry into FMS. The request is then analyzed and assigned to a [Government Information Specialist] to process. An acknowledgement letter is sent to the requester within 24 hours of receipt detailing the date the request was received, the FOIA control number assigned to the request, and an overview of HUD's FOIA processing timeline. Once a request has been assigned a FOIA control number, it can be tracked through FMS at all stages of processing, including after the request has been closed. All requests logged into FMS contain the request date, the receipt date, the requester's name and contact information, and a description of the records being sought. A request can be located using any of these identifiers, as well as the assigned control number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. All FOIA requests received by [HUD], regardless of the office to which they are addressed, are immediately routed to the FOIA Branch for intake and processing. Requests addressed to the Office of the Secretary (\"OSEC\") are treated no differently. Upon receipt of any correspondence marked as a FOIA request-or any correspondence construed as a request for agency records, even if not marked as such-OSEC will immediately deliver the request to the FOIA Branch. OSEC does not itself process or respond to FOIA requests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Decl. of Deborah R. Snowden, ECF No. 14-1 (\"Snowden Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When HUD received plaintiff's complaint, its declarant explained that staff conducted \"multiple searches ... in FMS for any requests matching the description provided by [p]laintiff.\" Snowden Decl. \u00b6 4.

The fact that plaintiff mailed his FOIA requests does not impose any obligation on HUD. \"Rather, the\n   <em>\n    receipt\n   </em>\n   of a request by the agency is the legally significant event that triggers the commencement of the FOIA request and that enables a requester, such as [p]laintiff, who is dissatisfied with the agency response to seek recourse from federal courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Freedom Watch v.

Plaintiff's burden on summary judgment is to demonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact regarding HUD's compliance with the FOIA.
