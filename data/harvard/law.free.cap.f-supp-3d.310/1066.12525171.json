(Dkt. No. 26.) On October 19, 2017, in ruling on Defendants' motion to dismiss the FAC, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion with leave to amend. (Dkt. Nos. 34, 42.)

(Dkt. No. 58-1, P's Response to Ds' SSUF, No. 1.) On December 22, 2015, the Superior Court of California issued a bench warrant for the arrest of Rory Fay (\"Fay\") for violating the terms of his probation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2.) FTF was assigned to search for Fay, who was identified as a person of interest in connection with the homicide of Bren Fisher that occurred around January 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 3, 4.) Based on database searches, FTF detectives learned that \"Mr. Fay had an active no-bail felony warrant for his arrest for possession of a controlled substance while armed, was on probation as a post release offender, had two prior felony strikes, had a psychiatric inmate history, and had a history of drug and steroid abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Using cell phone tracking technology, the FTF learned that Fay's cell phone was in the mobile home residence located at 250 La Cresta Heights Road, No. 3, El Cajon, California 92021 which is where Plaintiff Koistra lived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 6, 7.) FTF also learned that Koistra was a convicted felon with drug and theft history, was subject to arrest for violating her probation and waived her Fourth Amendment right as a condition of her probation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   From 2008 to April 2, 2016, Deputy Plutarco Vail was a canine handler with the County of San Diego Sheriff's Department (\"Sheriff's Department\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 9.) As a canine handler, Deputy Vail was regularly called upon to participate in hot calls and high risk searches for wanted and dangerous felons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the evening of January 8, 2016, Fay helped Koistra get a ride home from a nail salon with a man unknown to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13.) Fay was an acquaintance of Koistra who had met her once or twice about a year ago. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12; Dkt. No. 52-2, Ds' NOL, Ex. F, Koistra Depo. at 26:12-20; 29:4-24.) Koistra, Fay and this unknown man drove to Koistra's home and spent about one hour in her bedroom looking at decorations. (Dkt. No. 58-1, P's Response to Ds' SSUF, No. 14.) Koistra does not remember if she, Rory Fay or this unknown man used any drugs that evening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15.) The unknown man left but Fay spent the night at Koistra's residence with her permission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the morning of January 9, 2016, Deputy Vail, and his canine Hank, were called upon to assist the FTF in the search for Fay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17.) That morning, the FTF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   briefed Deputy Vail informing him that Fay was a wanted felon, a person of interest in a recent homicide, had two prior felony strikes, was considered to be armed and dangerous, and had a history of drug abuse and had a psychiatric inmate history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18.) Immediately after a briefing, Deputy Vail looked Fay up on the Sheriff Department's Jail Inmate Management System and learned that Fay was on parole, was a two-striker, and had numerous arrests for narcotics, firearm possession and acts of violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 19.) On that morning, Probation Officer Bobbitt informed Deputy Vail that the residence to be searched was the home of Koistra, who was a convicted felon with drug and theft history, was on probation, had waived her Fourth Amendment rights as a condition of that probation, and if found during the search, was subject to arrest for violating the terms of her probation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 20.) When the FTF team and Deputy Vail arrived on the scene, a perimeter had been set up around the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 21.) A helicopter from the Department's Aerial Support to Regional Enforcement Agencies (\"ASTREA\") was flying overhead to assist the FTF to monitor perimeter positions and provide aerial surveillance in the event Fay fled out of the perimeter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 22.) There were approximately five law enforcement vehicles, plus approximately ten deputies and/or police officers on scene at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Standing approximately fifteen feet from the front door, Sergeant Christopher Davis (\"Sergeant Davis\") of the FTF used a handheld Public Announcement (\"PA\") system to make the following announcements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Sheriff's department on a probation check, exit the trailer now\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"If anyone is inside, you need to exit now\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Sheriff's department we have a canine, if you do not come out you will be bit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 24.)

Hank went to the closet, stuck his head in, which was partially open, but could not enter because of the clutter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Vail went to the closet, slid the door open and Hank lunged inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There was substantial clutter and clothing that prevented him from seeing Hank's head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deputy Vail moved forward and pulled the clothing away from Hank and then saw him making contact with someone who was squatting down and hiding under a blanket in the far rear corner of the closet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That person did not make any noise but then he heard a female voice say \"ahhh.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deputy Vail removed the blanket and saw it was a female. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Koistra was attempting to\n   stand up, it forced Hank onto his hind legs. (Dkt.

A, Vail Decl. \u00b6 11.) Deputy Vail states that Hank had contact with Koistra for about 15 seconds or less. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Fay had not yet been discovered, it was important to quickly remove Hank from his contact because Fay could use this encounter to ambush the officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Koistra was handcuffed and removed from the vicinity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the incident, Deputy Vail was interviewed and he stated that Hank's bite lasted about 30 seconds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.

(Dkt. No. 58-2, Peacock Decl., Ex. D, Koistra Depo. at 69:11-13; 71:17-19.) She then went to hide in the closet of her mother's room where the TV was very loud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:16-19; 75:7-18.) She described herself as sitting down behind a chair halfway in the closet and her feet, not her legs, were hanging out behind the chair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:24-74:1; 74:17-19; Dkt. No. 52-2, Ds' NOL, Ex. F, Koistra Depo. at 76:14-18.) Her mom's closet has two sliding closet doors and one was open because it was stuck. (Dkt. No. 52-2, Ex. F, Koistra Depo. at 74:11-16.) While she was in the closet, her mother was on her bed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:23-25.) If someone is standing in the bedroom door of her mother's room, the person would not be able to see her in the closet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:19-22.) Koistra vaguely recalls that while she was in the closet, the police officers were talking to her mother before taking her outside the bedroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:1-12.) Koistra stated she did not hear any of the commands. (Dkt. No. 58-2, Peacock Decl., Ex. D, Koistra Depo. at 71:20-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Afterwards, an officer came to the bedroom door and told her to come out. (Dkt. No. 52-2, Ex. F, Koistra Depo at 77:15-16.) While in a sitting position, she responded by putting her arms up and said, \"What's going on. I'm unarmed\" and she noticed the officer had a \"SWAT gun\" in his hand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:16-23; Dkt. No. 58-2, Peacock Decl., Ex. D, Koistra Depo. at 78:18-25.) At the time, the TV was still on, and she did not see or hear a dog and did not hear whether the officer said he had a dog. (Dkt. No. 58-2, Peacock Decl., Ex. D, Koistra Depo. at 78:5-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Seconds after she put her arms up and said \"I'm unarmed\", the dog came and bit her left finger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:11-12.) Then the dog bit her left hand \"all the way through.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:15-16.) She did not hear the officer say anything to the dog and he was not doing anything. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:24-80:1; 80:2-15.) The dog also bit her on her left arm, mouth, both sides of her face, the back of her head, and broke her jaw. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:21-81:6.) The dog also began to pull her by her mouth with his teeth and dragged her out of the bedroom into the living room for a distance of about twelve feet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:20-21; 88:6-89:2.) She did not hear any commands from any of the officers while she was in the bedroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:3-6.) When she was in the living room, the officers yelled a command at the dog and he bit her again on the mouth right in the jaw with his tooth in her mouth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:7-16.) After that bite, the officer physically grabbed the dog by his head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:17-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Koistra testified she was in shock and in and out of consciousness during the encounter with Hank. (Dkt. No. 58-1, P's Response to Ds' SSUF, No. 58.) She also\n   testified that she does not remember how long her encounter with Hank lasted because she was in shock but guessed it was a matter of seconds. (Dkt. No. 52-2, Ds' NOL, Ex. F, Koistra Depo. at 81:9-18; 85:25-86:6; 111:25-112:12.) Emergency medical services were requested for Koistra about ten minutes later. (Dkt. No. 58-2, Peacock Decl., Ex. F at 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Koistra was removed from the vicinity by another deputy while Deputies Vail and Perata proceeded to the only remaining bedroom in the residence left to be cleared. (Dkt. No. 58-1, P's Response to Ds' SSUF, No. 61.) In the last bedroom, Hank found and bit Fay who was hiding under the bed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 62.) After some resistance, the deputies were able to wrestle Fay onto his stomach and get him handcuffed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 63.) Fay was arrested pursuant to the outstanding bench warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 64.) Fay was later charged, pled guilty, convicted, and sentenced to 25 years to life for first degree murder for the death of Bren Fisher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Koistra was arrested for violating Penal Code sections 1203.2(a) (violation of probation), 32 (harboring a felon) and 148 (delaying/resisting an officer). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 66.) Koistra later admitted and was convicted of violating the terms of her probation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , No. 67.) As a result of that conviction, Trina Koistra was sentenced to 270 days in jail and her probation extended another year.

Here, Fay was a wanted two-strike felon, was considered armed and dangerous with a history of drug abuse and psychiatric treatment and was a person of interest in connection with a recent homicide. Fay did not come out when the FTF officers announced themselves outside. The officers did not know if he was armed and he was hiding inside the house. Therefore, Fay posed an immediate threat to the officers' safety because he could have ambushed the officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276718\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1248/#p1256\">\n    858 F.3d at 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasonable officer could have believed that burglary was in progress, that the person could be armed and could pose an immediate threat to the officers' safety);\n   <em>\n    Bogle v.

Or. Nov. 15, 2017) (officers reasonably believed that the suspect posed a threat to them where the suspect had been in possession of a gun in the past, was an \"armed career criminal\", had a history of violent criminal activities, and because he was hiding in densely wooded terrain, he had a strategic advantage over them and could ambush them). Moreover, the officers knew that Koistra lived at the home and she was a convicted felon with a drug and theft history and was in violation of her probation. While she did not pose as great of a threat compared to Fay, her possible presence\n   complicated the search since there was a possibility of two individuals hiding in the house that could ambush them. Therefore, this factor strongly favors the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   An additional important consideration in evaluating law enforcement's interest in the use of force is \"whether officers gave a warning before employing the force.\n   <em>\n    Glenn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741494\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/864/#p871\">\n    673 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   876 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102560\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/959/#p964\">\n    340 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (officer was entitled to assume that suspect posed an immediate threat because he was hiding and the officers did not know if he was armed, and had ignored the officer's warnings). Here, the warnings regarding the use of canines were provided repeatedly for more than 15 minutes. Sergeant Davis testified that he announced over a handheld PA system that law enforcement was using a canine that would bite occupants who did not exit the trailer. The command prompted Larry Ford, Koistra's boyfriend, to exit the home. After gaining entry, the announcement was repeated by Sergeant Davis, Deputy Perata and, finally, Deputy Vail prior to releasing Hank in the bedroom where Koista was hiding. Koistra denies hearing any such warnings. However, the Court finds that Koistra lacks personal knowledge relating to the warnings.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276718\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1248/#p1256\">\n    858 F.3d at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff, who claimed she did not hear warnings, lacked personal knowledge where she had been sleeping). Koistra testified that she was prescribed and may have taken Lithium, Depakote, Xanax, and Norco within 24 hours of this incident. (Dkt. No. 58-1, P's Response to Ds' SSUF, No. 37.) She further stated that she had been awoken from her sleep by the helicopters but did not hear anyone knocking at the door of her home, opening the front door, or entering the house. Under these facts, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute that multiple warnings were given which further supports the use of the canine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, by hiding, Fay and Koistra were passively resisting arrest. Passive resistance can be considered on the third factor of the government interest analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276718\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1248/#p1256\">\n    858 F.3d at 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"passive resistance can support the use of some force.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bryan v.

Because Fay and Koistra were passively resisting by hiding, this factor slightly favors the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court also considers whether less intrusive means were available before resorting to the release of the canine. Plaintiff asserts that Deputy Vail could have waited longer before releasing the canine, could have directed commands to the closet area once he was alerted someone was in that area or could have immediately removed the canine from Koistra but instead allowed the attack to go on for about 30 seconds and encouraged the canine, or the County could have used canines who are trained to \"find and bark\", not \"find and bite.\" In assessing alternatives, \"officers 'are not required to use the least intrusive degree of force possible.' \"\n   <em>\n    Forrester v. City of San Diego\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513069\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/804/#p807\">\n    25 F.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807 (9th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As found above, repeated and sustained warnings were given and, therefore, waiting longer before releasing the canine was not an unexhausted alternative. As to the alternative of \"find and bark\", Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence regarding the effectiveness of this alternative technique. Moreover, \"find and bark\" would have required Deputy Vail to expose himself to an attack by a person of interest in a homicide investigation who was considered armed and dangerous and had ignored repeated commands to come out. These conceivable alternatives offer little\n   to counterbalance against the County's interest in the use of canine force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The remaining alternative offered is that Deputy Vail should have immediately removed the canine and should not have allowed the attack to go on for about 30 seconds. This assertion has less to do with alternatives than it does gauging \"the severity of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment rights by evaluating 'the type and amount of force inflicted.' \"\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v.

However, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Deputy Vail could have employed less intrusive means by releasing the canine's hold on Koistra once she surrendered and after he realized she was not Fay. Instead, Vail allowed the canine to continue to bite Koistra repeatedly and to drag her for about 12 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Balance Between the Gravity of the Intrusion and Need for that Intrusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, the Court balances the severity of the intrusion with the government's interest. The Ninth Circuit has observed that characterizing the quantum of force used with regard to the use of a police dog depends on the specific factual circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Lowry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276718\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1248/#p1256\">\n    858 F.3d at 1256-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This has been interpreted as requiring the Court to analyze each use of the canine, or bite, to characterize its level of force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bogle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205490870\">\n    2017 WL 5490870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6. Likewise, the Ninth Circuit has held that excessive duration of a dog bite and the encouragement of a continuation of the attack can constitute excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v. Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534854\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/1357/#p1362\">\n    27 F.3d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1362 (9th Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.

Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Koistra, the Court concludes that (1) employing the canine to apprehend Fay was reasonable but (2) there is an issue of fact whether the duration and extent of Deputy Vail's use of the canine was an unreasonable use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In this case, Koistra alleges that it was unreasonable for the County to employ canines who were trained to \"bite and hold\" persons who may be encountered where the canine cannot distinguish whether that person is a child, disabled or dangerous. However, the objective reasonableness of a seizure is determined in the light of the facts and circumstances confronting the police officers.\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p388\">\n    490 U.S. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, it was reasonable for Defendants to deploy a \"bite and hold\" canine given that police officers were confronted with a concealed subject who was a wanted felon, a person of interest in a recent homicide, considered to be armed and dangerous, and known to have psychiatric issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The remaining question is whether the continued use of the canine following Koistra's alleged surrender was reasonable. Koistra maintains it was unreasonable where she had surrendered, and Deputy Vail, realizing Koistra was not the dangerous suspect being sought, did not immediately command the canine to stop but instead let the canine bite her on the finger, arms, face, mouth, and skull for about 30 seconds and permitted the canine to drag her 12 feet by her mouth. After this occurred, Deputy Vail yelled a command to the dog and the dog bit her again in her jaw. Then Deputy Vail physically removed the canine from Koistra. Moreover, the severity of Koistra's injuries creates an issue of fact whether she suffered an unnecessary, prolonged attack by the canine. If the trier of fact accepts Koistra's account, the use of the canine following her surrender constitutes a severe intrusion on Koistra's Fourth Amendment rights which outweighs the governmental interest in the continued use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"Because [the excessive force inquiry] nearly always requires a jury to sift through factual contentions, and to draw inferences therefrom, we have held on many occasions that summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law in excessive force cases should be granted sparingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Santos v.

The officers learned that Chew had three outstanding warrants for his arrest and called for assistance, including an officer and his canine, and set up a perimeter around the scrapyard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The canine handling officer unleashed the canine two hours after Chew had fled to the yard, and the canine found Chew crouching between two metal bins.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chew claims that once he became aware of the canine's presence, he tried to surrender and yelled at the officers to call off the dog.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The canine handler was not within sight of the canine and did not immediately respond to Chew's request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The canine bit Chew several times and\n   then seized him causing severe lacerations on his left side and left forearm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The canine handler went to trial and the jury found in favor of Chew.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court granted summary judgment as to the other individual defendants based on qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal, the Ninth Circuit addressed the qualified immunity question as to the two Sergeants who trained the city's canines and the supervisor of the K-9 unit. The Ninth Circuit distinguished its case from the clearly established law in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   asserting that\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   held it is clearly established law that when a deputy allows a canine to seize a suspect who has fully surrendered and is under control, such conduct is unlawful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1448-49. In\n   <em>\n    Chew\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit determined that the issue was whether \"it was clearly established that it was unlawful to use police dogs to search for and apprehend concealed suspects by biting and seizing them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1449. Based on the longstanding official policy of the use of police canines in many police departments across the country, the Ninth Circuit held it was not clearly established and the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In this case, Defendants fail to identify the \"clearly established\" proposition of law involved in the case but, rather, summarily argue that they are unaware of any cases that would have put Deputy Vail on notice of the illegality of his actions, and in their reply, fail to address Plaintiff's argument that the law giving notice was clearly established by\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   . Meanwhile, in her response, Plaintiff characterizes the salient issues as whether it was clearly established that releasing a canine on a non-violent person and allowing the attack to continue while she was on the ground violated the Fourth Amendment. (Dkt. No. 58 at 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court has already ruled that the release of the canine was reasonable and therefore does not require qualified immunity analysis. As to the prolonged use of canine force,\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   provided notice that a canine officer cannot continue to use canine force against someone, like Koistra, who had surrendered by putting her arms up and asserted she was unarmed after she heard Deputy Vail tell her to come out. At that point, it was clearly established and a reasonable officer would have known that the continued seizure by a police canine after Koistra surrendered for an additional 30 seconds was unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Deputy Vail is not entitled to a qualified immunity defense on the continued and prolonged use of the \"bite and hold\" by the canine after Koistra surrendered, and DENIES summary judgment on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Third Cause of Action-\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The SAC alleges that it is the custom, practice and policy of the San Diego Sheriff's Department that when a canine is given the order to \"search\", the canine will bite anyone that the canine encounters irrespective of whether the person is a suspect, a victim, a child, a disabled person and whether that person poses a threat to anyone. (Dkt. No. 43, SAC \u00b6 66.) This custom, practice and policy is an alleged violation of the Fourth Amendment because it encourages, permits, and ratifies the use of serious and deadly force upon an individual without considering the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors.

As discussed above, there are material facts in dispute on whether the prolonged and extended use of a canine following Koistra's surrender was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Next, Plaintiff asserts that the County has a \"bite and hold\" policy and presented the deposition transcript of Jacob Pavlenko, the person most knowledgeable for the County of San Diego. (Dkt. No. 58-2, Peacock Decl., Ex. B, Pavlenko Depo. at 22:2-8.) Pavlenko testified that Sheriff's officers are trained on when to release a canine to\n   search for a suspect according to Section 4.4 of the policy and procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:9-18.) The canines are trained to locate human odor and bite and do not differentiate between good or bad guys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:10-23.) Deputy Vail testified that when a canine is given the search command, he is taught to bite and hold and is not trained to distinguish whether the person is a child. (Dkt. No. 58-2, Peacock Decl., Ex. A, Vail Depo. at 62:19-24.) In reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has presented no evidentiary support that the County has an official policy.

No. 58 at 24.) However, this is insufficient to show that there is \"direct causal link\" between the policy and the injuries incurred. In this case, the Court has found that initial use of the canine under the \"bite and hold\" policy was justified because the officers were attempting to apprehend a two-striker felon who was considered armed and dangerous and refused to submit to commands to submit to arrest. It was only after Deputy Vail continued to permit the canine to bite and hold Koistra after she had surrendered that canine force became unreasonable. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a County policy authorizing the continued use of the \"bite and hold\" where the suspect has surrendered. In this case, the \"moving force\" behind the constitutional deprivation was a failure to reevaluate the need for canine force once the circumstances no longer justified it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As a result, the Court finds Koistra has failed to prove that the \"bite and hold policy\" was the \"moving force\" of her injuries.

Here, because the Court granted summary judgment on all claims as it relates to Deputy Vail's initial deployment of the canine, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to the County on these same claims. However, because the Court denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the state law claims as it concerns the continued use of the canine after Koistra surrendered, the Court necessarily DENIES summary judgment on these causes of action against the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Defendants argue Plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages because there is no evidence of evil motive or intent, or reckless or callous indifference to the constitutional rights of Koistra. Plaintiff argues that the manner in which Deputy Vail used the canine was reckless and callously indifferent to her Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force when after she surrendered, he allowed the canine to continue to bite her for 30 seconds during which he allowed the canine to drag her, by her mouth, for about 12 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Punitive damages are permissible in an action under \u00a7 1983 when the defendant's conduct is \"motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

To the extent that the evidence is proper under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Court considered the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   To the extent that the evidence is not proper, the Court did not consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Based on the above, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants' motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the Court GRANTS summary judgment on the first (excessive force), fourth (violation of section 52.1 ), sixth (battery), seventh (assault), eighth (intentional infliction of emotional distress) and ninth (negligence) causes of actions as it concerns the initial deployment of the canine and DENIES summary judgment on these same causes of action concerning the continued use of the canine after Koistra had surrendered. The Court also GRANTS summary judgment on the third cause of action based on\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   and the fifth cause of action for false arrest. The hearing set for April 20, 2018 shall be\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     vacated.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    In their motion, Defendants contend that the Court dismissed with prejudice all of Ford's claims against the County and Deputy Vail. (Dkt. No. 52-1 at 16.) The Court disagrees that the Court's order on the motion to dismiss the FAC dismissed Ford's claims with prejudice. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 42.) Moreover, Ford is named as a Plaintiff in the SAC. (Dkt. No. 43.) However, it appears Ford may not have any valid claims against Defendants. The sole constitutional claim alleged by Ford is the second cause of action for an unreasonable seizure against Does 1 through 25 but Ford has not moved to amend the SAC to name these Doe defendants. Ford also alleges\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    liability against the County, violation of California Civil Code section 52.1, false arrest, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence based on the allegations related to the unreasonable seizure claim. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Plaintiff does not dispute Defendants' characterization as to the status of Ford's claims. However, neither party has moved to dismiss Ford as a Plaintiff; therefore, procedurally, his claims remain.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    <em>\n     Monell v.
