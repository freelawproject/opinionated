Pl.'s Opp'n 16-21. Mr. Moreno asserts that his wife's statement provides percipient evidence that Mr. Moreno suffered loss of ADLs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. He further argues that the certification by Dr. Dennis Hopkins, a physician who reviewed his medical records, \"speaks for itself\" that Mr. Moreno suffered more than 120 days of loss of ADLs because Dr. Hopkins attested to it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. As for his medical records, Mr. Moreno argues that they are \"unlikely to contain, on any consistent basis, entries that document lack of ability to perform ADLs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Because of this, Mr. Moreno asks the Court to infer that he was \"incapable of safely performing his activities of daily living of bathing and dressing without physical or standby assistance\" from records showing that he was nonweightbearing for a period of time and thereafter was a fall risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To be sure, the documentation in this case that directly addresses Mr. Moreno's inability to perform ADLs is scant.

As previously described, judicial review under the arbitrary or capricious test looks to whether there is \"relevant evidence [that] a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\" an agency decision.\n   <em>\n    United Steel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661622,3536286,4170991\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/319/\">\n    707 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In Mr. Moreno's case, the Appeals Board specifically noted that its review included \"the case file and all medical documentation, to include the recently submitted new and material evidence\"-namely, Mrs. Moreno's statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 2. Documentation from the Appeals Board's review shows that Mrs. Moreno's statement was taken into account but found not to substantiate Mr. Moreno's inability to perform two ADLs. A.R. 5. Specifically, one\n   review comment found that \"his wife's statement indicates she communicated with him via skype, that he had no assistance, and was required to return to work two weeks after sustaining his surgery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661622,3536286,4170991\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/319/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Another reviewer stated, \"wife's statement indicates servicemember was living in Barracks alone without aid from command and was required to return to work in 2 weeks.\" A.R. 6. These statements may reasonably be taken to mean that Mr. Moreno did not have assistance in the weeks following his injury, and that he was not unable to \"independently perform\" certain ADLs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1980A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Appeals Board was also free to consider and weigh Dr. Hopkins' assertion on Mr. Moreno's application for 120 days of bathing and dressing ADLs vis-\u00e0-vis treatment records maintained by Mr. Moreno's treating physicians and notes from his physical therapy sessions. As summarized by a regimental surgeon who reviewed Mr. Moreno's medical records during the reconsideration review, his medical records showed that \"he is ambulatory[with] crutches\" and that \"he ambulated independently....There are no OT notes addressing claim for bathe and dress ADLs [ ].\" A.R. 21-22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R. 356-60 (documenting instances where Mr. Moreno was able to ambulate independently with crutches and/or a controlled ankle movement boot). It was within the Appeal Board's purview to evaluate this underlying evidence, which was contemporaneously documented by Mr. Moreno's medical treatment team, against the statement of a non-treating physician.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weller v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205320133\">\n    2014 WL 5320133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. La. Oct. 17, 2014) (finding it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Government to conclude that other medical evidence in the record did not support,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the medical certification submitted with the service member's application for benefits). Mr. Moreno asks the Court to discount the lack of contemporaneous documentation because other evidence-that he was ordered to be nonweightbearing for some time after surgery, and was thereafter considered a fall risk-implies that he was unable to independently bathe and dress. Def.'s Opp'n 17-18. But it is not for this Court to make inferences from the record evidence (or lack thereof), or to assess the strength and veracity of competing factual assertions or medical conclusions. The Appeals Board's unanimous conclusion that the evidence did not reflect even 30 days' ADL loss is reasonably supported by the record indicating that Mr. Moreno was able to perform certain activities independently and that he did not have assistance in his daily activities in the weeks following surgery. On that basis, the Court finds that the Government's decision was not arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted.
