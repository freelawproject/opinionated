Gorton, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of the development of a cancer drug by AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"AVEO\"). The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"the SEC\") alleges that AVEO, its chief executive officer Tuan Ha-Ngoc (\"Ha-Ngoc\"), chief financial officer David Johnston (\"Johnston\" or \"defendant\") and its chief medical officer William Slichenmyer (\"Slichenmyer\") made materially misleading statements to investors about communications with the Food and Drug Administration (\"the FDA\") during their bid for approval of their flagship drug candidate, tivozanib (\"Tivo\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SEC contends that AVEO, through Johnston, concealed from investors the critical fact that the FDA recommended that AVEO conduct a second clinical trial in order to secure approval for Tivo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is Johnston's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 86). For the reasons that follow, that motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FDA Approval Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To obtain FDA approval to market and sell a drug in the United States, a pharmaceutical\n   company must demonstrate the drug's safety and efficacy through human clinical trials conducted in three phases. After the third phase of the trial, a company can seek approval from the FDA by submitting a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") which, if accepted, leads either to a substantive review or a Refusal to File (\"RTF\") letter from the FDA. If the NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA sends a letter (\"the Day 74 Letter\") which confirms certain logistics and identifies any preliminary deficiencies in the application. Upon receipt of the Day 74 Letter, an applicant has the opportunity to respond to any concerns by amending the NDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the review process for cancer therapeutics, the FDA may convene an advisory panel of outside experts called an Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (\"ODAC\"). The ODAC provides additional review of the safety and efficacy of proposed drugs by holding non-binding votes on questions posed by the FDA. Before ODAC meetings, the FDA and the pharmaceutical company release the pre-meeting summaries for those meetings. The FDA makes the final determination on the NDA as to whether to approve the drug unconditionally, approve the drug with certain conditions or deny approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Tivo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   AVEO is a publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company that develops oncology medicines, incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2012 and 2013, Johnston was the chief financial officer (\"CFO\") of AVEO and, in that capacity, he was a member of AVEO's Executive Committee, responsible for the company's strategic decisions, and its Disclosure Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On AVEO's Form 10-K for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the company reported that it was developing a cancer therapy, Tivo, which would be indicated for the treatment of renal cell cancer. AVEO had begun sponsoring a Phase 3 drug trial (\"TIVO-1\") in 2009 to measure Tivo's efficacy and safety against a control group that received sorafenib, an approved therapy for renal cell cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May, 2012, representatives from AVEO and its business partner Astellas Pharma, Inc. (\"Astellas\") met with the FDA in advance of submitting the NDA for Tivo (\"the pre-NDA meeting\"). Prior to the meeting, AVEO sent the FDA data derived from TIVO-1, AVEO's only Phase III trial. The data indicated that Tivo met its primary endpoint but that the secondary endpoint, measuring overall survival (the period of time a patient lives while taking the drug), trended in a negative direction. The minutes of the pre-NDA meeting indicate that the FDA voiced doubts about the drug's safety and efficacy because of the TIVO-1 secondary endpoint results. The minutes note that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [t]he Agency expressed concern about the adverse trend in overall survival. Further discussion of these findings will be required at the time of filing and if the application is filed they will be a review issue that could affect approvability. FDA recommended that the sponsor conduct a second adequately powered randomized trial in a population comparable to that in the US.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   One member of the FDA staff suggested that the trend in the secondary endpoint could cause the FDA to issue an RTF letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the pre-NDA meeting, Johnston attended an AVEO Executive Committee meeting and a board meeting to discuss the results of the pre-NDA meeting and budgeting for a second Phase III trial of Tivo (\"TIVO-2\"). Although AVEO sought a meeting with the FDA to discuss TIVO-2's design and timing, the company withdrew that request when the FDA expressed\n   \"significant concerns regarding the trial design described in [AVEO's] meeting package\". Rather than pursuing the second trial, AVEO decided to submit the NDA, relying on the results of TIVO-1. In August, 2012, AVEO provided a regulatory update in a public press release, stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [t]he FDA has expressed concern regarding the OS trend in the TIVO-1 trial and has said that it will review these findings at the time of the NDA filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the issuance of that press release, AVEO prepared a script for a conversation with investors and analysts in which Johnston participated. During that conversation, Dr. Slichenmyer stated that he could not speculate as to what additional action the FDA might require. AVEO filed its quarterly Form 10-Q shortly thereafter which Johnston signed. That form did not mention any recommendation of the FDA for a second randomized trial. AVEO submitted another 10-Q in November, 2012 with identical disclosure language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In November, 2012, the FDA accepted and filed the NDA which initiated the process of substantive review. The FDA sent a Day 74 letter in which it stated that the TIVO-1 results remained a \"significant safety concern\" for the agency that it intended to discuss at a May, 2013 meeting with the ODAC convened to review Tivo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In January, 2013, AVEO filed an 8-K with the SEC. That 8-K did not address the FDA's recommendation that the company undertake a second trial or mention AVEO's plans to set up TIVO-2. The next day, AVEO filed a prospectus in anticipation of offering 6,667,000 shares of common stock, priced at $7.50 per share. AVEO raised approximately $53.8 million in connection with its stock offering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In advance of the May, 2013 meeting of the ODAC, the FDA released a public briefing book concerning Tivo in which it disclosed that it had previously recommended that AVEO conduct a second trial of TIVO. After the release of the briefing book, AVEO's stock price declined by approximately 30%. On May 2, 2013, the ODAC voted 13 to 1 against approving Tivo and the following month the FDA decided not to approve the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The SEC filed the instant action in March, 2016, at which time it entered into a consent decree with AVEO. Later that year, the SEC filed its first amended complaint, alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-14 thereunder and violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"the Securities Act\"). In 2017 and early 2018, the SEC entered into settlement agreements with defendants Ha-Ngoc and Slichenmyer. In January, 2018, Johnston moved for summary judgment on all claims against him. That motion is the subject of this memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motions for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Summary judgment is appropriate if, after viewing the record in the non-moving party's favor, the Court determines that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Duty to Disclose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Johnston first contends that the information omitted by AVEO was not material because any potential disclosure about the FDA's recommendation that AVEO conduct a second trial was not obligatory. Because the FDA's recommendation was not a directive, he suggests it merely created a possibility that an adverse event affecting AVEO could occur at some later point. He submits that the FDA's recommendation was part of the regulatory back-and-forth between the agency and the company and that it contemplated a risk that was too uncertain to merit disclosure. The drug approval process is inherently risky and the FDA's statements were innately provisional. He notes that a company has no duty to disclose normal risks and ongoing discussions with the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The SEC rejoins that the recommendation was material and, in any event, the determination of materiality should be left to the jury. The SEC emphasizes an Executive Committee slide deck, reviewed by Johnston, which noted that failure to conduct a second trial would lead to a high risk of non-approval. It proffers evidence demonstrating the importance of the recommendation to investors, namely the steep reduction in stock price after the FDA disclosed its recommendation. The SEC also submits that the recommendation was important to AVEO internally, prompting the budgeting and design of TIVO-2 and internal discussions at board meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   SEC Rule 10b-5 implements the Exchange Act by making it unlawful to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made ... not misleading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p318\">\n    551 U.S. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 318,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p318\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p318\">\n    168 L.Ed.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5(b) ).

Johnston repeatedly emphasizes that the company made the results of TIVO-1 known and that those negative results could impede the approval process of Tivo. A reasonable jury could find that the disclosures made by Johnston and AVEO would mislead rather than adequately inform prospective investors because of the omission of the recommendation for a second trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Biogen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1352266\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/179/25/#p34\">\n    179 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   35 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522785\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/170/\">\n    36 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   175 ) (\"[T]he disclosure required by securities laws is measured not by literal truth, but by the ability of the material to accurately inform rather than mislead prospective buyers.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Furthermore, Johnston's emphasis on the uncertainty of the risk of non-approval is undercut by evidence proffered by the SEC of Johnston and AVEO's internal assessment of the risk. AVEO and Johnston actively pursued budgeting and designing TIVO-2, leading to the reasonable inference that there was concern about the likelihood of approval without a second clinical trial. Johnston also participated in the review of a slide deck prepared by AVEO's chief medical officer summarizing the pre-NDA meeting which highlighted the \"high risk\" of non-approval or an RTF letter if AVEO chose not to pursue a second clinical trial. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the SEC has raised a genuine issue as to the materiality of the FDA's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Johnston also moves for summary judgment on the grounds that the SEC is unable to prove that he acted with the requisite state of mind. First, Johnston asserts that any inference of scienter is undermined by the absence of evidence that there was any duty to disclose. Johnston then suggests that the uncertainty of the negative regulatory outcome precludes an inference of scienter here. He maintains that his understanding of the risk was also attenuated because he did not attend the pre-NDA meeting and his conception of the risk came instead from the advice of two regulatory experts, an attorney and a former FDA official.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The SEC rejects Johnston's version of the facts, contending that the record demonstrates a genuine dispute about whether Johnston knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Tivo faced a high-risk of non-approval without a second trial. The SEC contends that a defendant's state of mind is generally a jury question. It denies that Johnston's reliance on other regulatory experts negates a finding of scienter because AVEO has not waived the privilege with respect to its lawyers' advice. Finally, the SEC submits that Johnston's limited disclosures do not demonstrate that he acted in good faith to disclose the full measure of the FDA's concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To prevail on a Rule 10b-5 claim, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with scienter, \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud\".\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p318\">\n    551 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p318\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Ernst\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hochfelder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/\">\n    425 U.S. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) ).

That script notes that, if asked about the need for additional clinical studies, the appropriate response would be that \"[a]t this time, the Agency has not required an additional study for approval\". There is an internal note, however, that states \"IF PUSHED ... details on discussions with FDA\".

In\n   <em>\n    Kader\n   </em>\n   , however, the First Circuit noted that the communication that allegedly omitted material information in fact reiterated a previous disclosure that made clear to investors that the FDA was looking for further review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051978\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/228/#p244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court found that the subject communication did not omit new material information and stated that scienter could not be inferred from the company's decision not to \"elaborate more fully\".\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051978\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/228/#p244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the case at hand, however, there was no previous disclosure that described the pre-NDA meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While Johnston and AVEO did provide warnings about the TIVO-1 results, the SEC presents evidence that investors were not informed about the FDA's recommendation that a second clinical trial would likely be necessary.

He contends that, even if the Rule creates a separate cause of action, it merely creates liability for false statements and alleged omissions are not actionable where the defendant had no duty to disclose. The SEC maintains that defendant has such a duty and that, therefore, the relevant Commission filings contained materially misleading statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Rule 13a-14 mandates that, for each report filed under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, each principal executive and financial officer of the issuing company must sign a certification as to the accuracy of the financial statements within the report.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .13a-14 (2002).
