Defendant Drake filed a supplemental brief, (Doc. 224), to which the Government responded, (Doc. 233). Drake then filed a motion to strike the Government's Response, (Doc. 235), to which the Government responded, (Doc. 237). On April 13, 2018, a motions hearing was held at which the parties addressed the substantive issues within the supplemental briefing as well as the motion to strike. (Minute Entry 04/13/2018.) For the reasons stated herein, both of Drake's motions seeking dismissal of the indictment or suppression of her Grand Jury testimony will\n   be denied and Drake's motion for an ex parte hearing will be denied as moot. Drake's motion to strike will also be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In summary, it is not disputed that during the course of a criminal investigation by the United States beginning in 2012, GrandSouth Bank (\"the Bank\") engaged attorney Jim Medford and law firm Smith Moore Leatherwood, LLP (\"Smith Moore\") to represent the Bank in that investigation. At that time, Defendant Ronald Earnest (\"Earnest\") was President and Drake was an employee of the Bank. It is also undisputed that the Bank was subpoenaed to appear and produce records to a Grand Jury in the Middle District of North Carolina as part of that investigation. These motions by Defendant Drake are all premised upon Drake's allegation that she was represented in her individual capacity during that investigation by Smith Moore; that she was improperly induced to testify before a Grand Jury conducted in the Middle District of North Carolina; and further that she has not waived attorney-client privilege as to various documents now in the custody of the Bank. The United States is seeking production of those documents in preparation for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As will be explained in more detail below, the United States and a Grand Jury in the Middle District of North Carolina were conducting an investigation into bank fraud and tax violations originating from the prior investigation and eventual prosecution of Gregory Harrison.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Harrison\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:10CR411-1 (M.D.N.C.). The Grand Jury issued a subpoena to the Bank seeking the production of certain records relating to this earlier investigation. Defendant Drake appeared and testified on two occasions, once in 2012 and again in 2013, in response to those subpoenas. On both occasions, the United States advised Drake and her counsel, prior to the Grand Jury and during her Grand Jury testimony, that she was neither a target nor a subject of its investigation. (Government's Consolidated Resp. to Mots. Filed by Def. Shannon Drake on June 9, 2017 (\"Government's Consolidated Resp.\"), Ex. 1, Drake Sept. 25, 2012 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-1) at 3; Government's Consolidated Resp., Ex. 2, Drake May 29, 2013 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-2) at 2; Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 198.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States also specifically advised Defendant Drake that she was called as a fact witness. (Government's Consolidated Resp., Drake Sept. 25, 2012 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-1) at 3; Government's Consolidated Resp., Ex. 2, Drake May 29, 2013 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-2) at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As it turns out, Drake's status, at least in the two weeks prior to her second appearance, was something more complex. This order addresses three issues: (1) whether an attorney-client relationship existed between Drake and Smith Moore during 2012 and 2013 in the matter of the Grand Jury investigation; (2) whether the Government's advice to Drake, that she was neither a target nor a subject of the investigation, was accurate or whether it was misleading; and (3) if misleading, whether a remedy is appropriate in this case as a result of: (a) this court's supervisory powers over grand jury proceedings and/or (b) constitutional violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Drake was originally indicted on June 28, 2016. (Indictment (Doc. 1) at 1.) Subsequently, the Grand Jury returned superseding indictments, and the currently operative Superseding Indictment was returned\n   on August 29, 2017. (Superseding Indictment (Doc. 85) at 1.) Various proceedings took place and this case was ultimately assigned to this court. (Order of Recusal (Doc. 110) at 2-3.) As noted above, a number of motions were filed, and on November 9, 2017, a hearing was held during which the parties presented evidence as to whether there was an attorney-client relationship between Earnest and Smith Moore and/or Drake and Smith Moore and, if so, what documents may be privileged. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 19-20.) Present at that hearing were the parties and their counsel; Jon Berkelhammer on behalf of Smith Moore; and Dan Boyce, Mark Moore, and Andrew Mathias on behalf of the Bank. This court overruled Smith Moore's objection as to attorney-client privilege in part and permitted the testimony of current and former Smith Moore attorneys. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 46-47.) This testimony was subject to specific objections raised by counsel during the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This court did not issue a final ruling with respect to the objection as to the production of documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 224.) Both counsel for Smith Moore and the Bank were permitted to participate during the hearing for the purpose of lodging any objections to specific questions propounded by the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Earnest called as witnesses Bruce Ashley, Laura Dildine, and Stephen Petersen, all of whom were attorneys at Smith Moore during the relevant time period. The hearing was continued to February 8, 2018, at which time Defendant Earnest called as witnesses Professor Nathan Crystal and FBI Special Agent Mike Knapp. (Tr. of Feb. 8, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 212) at 65, 181.) The United States called as a witness James B. Schwiers, the current President of the Bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) A subsequent hearing was held on March 7, 2018, at which time Defendant Earnest called as witnesses Special Agent Mary Blackerby, Agent Kyle Myles, and Professor Nathan Crystal. (Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248) at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to the testimony and exhibits presented during the hearings, the court has also considered the attachments to pleadings not otherwise objected to by opposing counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This court now determines (1) whether or not an attorney-client relationship existed between Drake and Smith Moore during 2012 and 2013 in the matter of the Grand Jury investigation; (2) whether the Government's advice to Drake, that she was neither a target nor a subject of the investigation, was accurate or whether it was misleading; and (3) if misleading, whether the Government's conduct requires or allows suppression of Drake's testimony or dismissal of the indictment as the result of (a) this court's supervisory powers over grand jury proceedings and/or (b) constitutional violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Whether an Attorney-Client Relationship Existed Between Drake and Smith Moore\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Smith Moore represented the Bank in civil litigation involving factoring that started around 2008 and may have been resolved in early 2013. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 54-55.) While that civil case was pending, an individual named Bruce Gregory Harrison, III, was prosecuted and convicted in the Middle District of North Carolina,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Harrison\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:10CR411-1 (M.D.N.C.), apparently for tax violations that were related to transactions in which the Bank had some involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 11, 2012, following the conviction and sentencing of Harrison, the United States issued a Grand Jury subpoena to the Bank for files related to Harrison\n   and his staffing companies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Earnest's Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Indictment (\"Def. Earnest's Mem.\"), Ex. 10, GrandSouth Bank Sept. 11, 2012 Subpoena (Doc. 146-10).) The subpoena was directed to \"GrandSouth Bank, Attn. Legal Order Processing\" and sought the production of records and correspondence between the Bank and several entities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Apparently, some of those entities were related to Harrison. Additionally, the subpoena sought the personnel file for Douglas Corriher, the Vice President of the Bank, and various emails between Corriher and others, including Drake. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Production was directed to occur on September 24, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Earnest was not mentioned specifically in the subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Earnest contacted an attorney with Smith Moore \"for representation because the firm had done corporate work for the Bank and represented the Bank in related civil litigation.\" (Earnest Aff. (Doc. 119) \u00b6 3.) Jim Medford, an attorney with Smith Moore and experienced in criminal law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4), handled the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not disputed that Earnest met with Medford and thereafter Medford and Smith Moore began working on the Bank matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bruce Ashley, an attorney with Smith Moore, represented the Bank in a related civil proceeding. Ashley testified that his understanding was that he represented the Bank through his work in civil litigation. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 64.) Ashley recalls attending a meeting with Medford and Drake after Drake testified before the Grand Jury for the first time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93-94.) Ashley testified that Medford had primary responsibility for the Bank's criminal investigation at Smith Moore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Laura Dildine was an attorney with Smith Moore beginning in 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that when she \"came on board, this was an existing matter, and [she] assisted with responding to subpoenas that the Government had served on GrandSouth Bank for documents and in preparing GrandSouth Bank employees to testify before the grand jury and the Government's investigation of Doug Corriher.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109.) Dildine did not understand the Government to be investigating Earnest or the Bank for criminal conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-14.) Dildine's recollection is that Earnest was \"strictly a fact witness as a bank employee in the Government's investigation of Mr. Corriher. ... in my mind, [Earnest] was testifying ... as the bank president, but not as someone separate and apart from the bank.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123.) Dildine has no recollection of acting as Earnest's attorney \"in a personal or individual capacity. Mr. Earnest, from [her] recollection, was\n   [Smith Moore's] primary point of contact for [the] Bank.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117.) Dildine testified that she did not recall that any officers or employees of the Bank were targets of the Government's investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112, 122, 164-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This court finds, for purposes of this case, that Jim Medford was lead counsel for the Bank at least during 2012 and 2013 with respect to the Grand Jury investigation. Ashley, although his recollection was limited, significantly participated in the representation, including making arrangements of counsel for Corriher and Drake. While Dildine's participation was extensive, it appears to this court that Dildine had limited involvement, and perhaps no involvement, in communications with clients regarding specific representation arrangements but instead acted primarily at the direction of Medford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   From September 2012 through July 2013, Smith Moore met with Earnest, Drake, and other Bank employees, produced Bank documents as called for in the original subpoena issued in September 2012 as well as a second subpoena issued in November 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Government's Am. Resp. to Def.'s Mot. to Preclude the Disclosure of Privilege Materials, Attach. 1, Resp. to Subpoena (Doc. 113-1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notably, during the period of mid-2012 until November 2013, the United States advised counsel for Earnest and Drake, as well as Earnest and Drake themselves, that neither individual was a target nor a subject of the Grand Jury investigation. (Government's Consolidated Resp., Ex. 1, Drake Sept. 25, 2012 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-1) at 3; Government's Consolidated Resp., Ex. 2, Drake May 29, 2013 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-2) at 2; Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 198.) Both individuals were told they were called before the Grand Jury as fact witnesses. (Government's Consolidated Resp., Drake Sept. 25, 2012 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-1) at 3; Government's Consolidated Resp., Ex. 2, Drake May 29, 2013 Grand Jury Test.

(Doc. 176-1) at 2-3; Government's Sixth Amendment Resp., Ex. 2, Ronald Earnest Aug. 27, 2013 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 176-2) at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Drake's First Grand Jury Appearance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Drake alleges in her affidavit that she received a subpoena to appear before a Grand Jury in the Middle District of North Carolina on September 25, 2012. (Tr. of Feb. 8, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 212), Ex. 3, Aff. of Shannon Michelle Drake (\"Drake Aff.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Drake further alleges that attorneys from Smith Moore contacted her and said they were going to represent her in connection with her testimony before the Grand Jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) A subpoena was in fact issued to \"Shannon Drake, Account Executive\" on September 11, 2012, compelling her appearance and testimony before the Grand Jury on September 24, 2012. (Government's Notice Containing Grand Jury Subpoenas (\"Government's Notice\"), Ex. 1, Subpoenas (Doc. 207-1) at 1-2.) That subpoena appears to have been issued at the same time as the subpoena mentioned above was issued directly to the Bank. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 17, 2012, Earnest sent Drake an email, with a copy to Jim Medford, advising as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Shannon: As I indicated to you earlier, Mr. Jim Medford is an attorney with the\n   firm of Smith Moore Leatherwood who is representing GrandSouth Bank. I have mentioned to Jim that you have been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury and that you may have a need to discuss your involvement with our counsel. Jim can be reached at [phone number]. If you wish, you may call Jim and he can tell you what to expect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Minute Entry 02/16/2018 (correspondence contained in binder produced by the Bank for in camera review).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On September 18, 2012, Bruce Ashley with Smith Moore sent a letter to the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") discussing the subpoena to the Bank and the subpoena to Drake. (Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248), Ex. 5, September 18, 2012 Letter from Bruce Ashley.) With respect to Drake, Ashley wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Also, as I indicated in my voice messages this week, we will be representing Shannon Drake, the [Bank] employee who recently received a witness subpoena from your office. Please contact us when you would like Ms. Drake to appear. In this regard, please keep in mind that Ms. Drake is based in the Greenville, South Carolina area, and at least two business days' notice would be very much appreciated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jim Medford was copied on that letter, but none of the other Smith Moore attorneys were copied. Ashley testified that he had no independent recollection of the letter, but did not have any reason to believe it was not accurate. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Drake appeared and testified before the Grand Jury on September 25, 2012. The transcript of that testimony reflects that Drake was initially advised that she was \"not a target of this Grand Jury investigation, nor are you a subject of it. And what that means is this Grand Jury is not investigating you, you are simply a fact witness in this investigation.\" (Def. Earnest's Mem., Ex. 6, Drake's Sept. 25, 2012 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 146-6) at 3.) After that advice, the following examination occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. Okay. And you have an attorney representing you today, do you not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. And that's Mr. Medford?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. And he's present outside the Grand Jury room?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. And you understand that at some point if you would like to speak with him, we'll take a break and you can step out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This court finds Drake's statements in her affidavit as well as to the Grand Jury, that Smith Moore represented her for purposes of her Grand Jury testimony on September 25, 2012, to be credible. An attorney-client relationship was formed between Drake and Smith Moore in September 2012. That relationship extended at least from September 18, 2012 through the conclusion of her debriefing following her appearance before the Grand Jury on September 25, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Drake's Second Grand Jury Appearance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Following Drake's appearance on September 25, 2012, it does not appear Drake continued to meet with Smith Moore or to have any direct involvement in the case until May 2013. On May 16, 2013,\n   a subpoena was issued compelling Drake to appear and testify before a Grand Jury on May 28, 2013. (Government's Notice, Ex. 1, Subpoenas (Doc. 207-1) at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   During Drake's second Grand Jury appearance, the prosecutor asked her \"are you represented by attorneys today?\" to which she responded \"I have attorneys with me that represent the bank. ... Steve and Laura. I'm not sure of their last names.\" (Government's Consolidated Resp., Drake May 29, 2013 Grand Jury Test. (Doc. 62-2) at 4.) The prosecutor then stated \"so they're, technically, the bank's attorneys, but they're here[,]\" to which Drake responded \"[y]es.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Prior to her appearance before the Grand Jury in May, 2013, Drake again met with attorneys at Smith Moore. One of those attorneys was Stephen Petersen, who had previously participated briefly in the Bank investigation in 2012, solely to help arrange counsel for Corriher and \"get the undertaking done.\" (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 173.) In May of 2013, Petersen helped with Drake's appearance before the Grand Jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When Drake was subpoenaed to testify before the Grand Jury in May 2013, Medford was having surgery. Petersen was called on May 22 to help prepare Drake. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 173-74.) Petersen met with Drake on May 23 to prepare for Drake's testimony before the Grand Jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135.) Other individuals present at the May 23 meeting included Cathy Hawkins, a Smith Moore paralegal, and Laura Dildine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 188.) Jim Medford participated by telephone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Drake states in her affidavit the following with respect to her May 2013 Grand Jury appearance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   I was contacted again in May 2013 by someone from Smith Moore, who told me the government wanted me to appear before the grand jury again. I again went to Smith Moore's Greensboro offices in or around May 23, 2013. At that time, I met with several lawyers and Jim Medford was on the phone. At no time, was I told that Smith Moore did not represent me. They told me they would again be outside the door when I testified before the grand jury and would provide advice and guidance to me if I had any questions during my testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Tr. of Feb. 8, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 212), Ex. 3, Drake Aff., \u00b6 8.) However, contrary to Drake's affidavit, Petersen testified that he provided Drake with an\n   <em>\n    Upjohn\n   </em>\n   warning. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 174.) Petersen testified that he advised Drake that he represented the \"entity,\" referring to the Bank, and if she wanted her own counsel, they would get her counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175.)

This makes the notes confusing, as Ashley had previously written the prosecutor to say that Smith Moore represented Drake. (Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248), Ex. 5, September 18, 2012 Letter from Bruce Ashley.) Medford's comments, as reflected in these notes, seem to suggest he does represent Drake, and the discussion relates to a conflict.

Drake then met with Smith Moore attorneys, including Medford, to prepare for her Grand Jury appearance. Drake's subjective belief that she was individually represented by Medford and Smith Moore for purposes of her Grand Jury appearance is evidenced by her answers before the Grand Jury regarding whether she was represented as well as statements in her affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The objective reasonableness of Drake's beliefs is evidenced by her stating in her affidavit that Smith Moore attorneys told her that \"they would again be outside the door when [she] testified before the grand jury and would provide advice and guidance to [her] if [she] had any questions during [her] testimony,\" (Tr. of Feb. 8, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 212), Ex. 3, Drake Aff., \u00b6 8), as well as Ashley's letter to the Government stating that \"we will be representing Shannon Drake,\" (Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248), Ex. 5, September 18, 2012 Letter from Bruce Ashley). Despite evidence to suggest that Drake understood at the time of her second Grand Jury Appearance that neither Petersen nor Dildine represented her individually, there is no evidence to suggest that Drake understood (1) that Medford did not represent her individually or (2) that Smith Moore did not represent both her and the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This court finds that Drake reasonably believed that she was receiving legal advice from her own attorney throughout the course of her first Grand Jury appearance.

Nor is this court aware of any prohibition on a change in status of an individual as an investigation progresses. In other words, there is no constitutional or statutory duty that prohibits a prosecutor from proceeding with an investigation targeting an individual after that individual has been advised that he or she is neither a target nor a subject of an investigation. Those are all matters for the exercise of the discretion of the Attorney General generally. For example, the Government has argued that Drake was not a target of the Grand Jury in 2012 and 2013, (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 14), and further argues that it was only after years of investigation and Grand Jury testimony in 2015 and 2016 that Drake's incriminating role in the scheme was revealed, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). These matters may be literally correct, as the Government may not have taken concrete steps to designate Drake as a formal target within the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), and the Government may have determined in 2013 to exercise its discretion\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   to not target Drake as a putative defendant in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   However, the Government's discretion and the processes associated with that discretion are not at issue in this case. Instead, this case presents the question of whether the Government, in its communications to counsel and a Grand Jury witness misled those individuals. Specifically, whether the Government's representation to Drake and her counsel that Drake was neither a target nor a subject of the investigation and was being called to testify as a fact witness was misleading. If this representation was misleading, the question then becomes whether this court has the authority to address the misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The terms \"target\" and \"subject\" carry no inherent constitutional or statutory significance. They are terms of art, created by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") to communicate specific information to attorneys and individuals during the course of a criminal investigation by the United States. Specifically, the DOJ defines a \"target\" as \"a person to whom the\n   <em>\n    prosecutor or the grand jury\n   </em>\n   has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime, and who, in the judgment of\n   <em>\n    the prosecutor\n   </em>\n   , is a putative\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep't of Justice,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Attorneys' Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-11.151 (emphasis added). A \"subject\" is defined by the DOJ as \"a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"999267\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/547/772/#p774\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It may very well be that Drake was neither a target nor a subject of the Grand Jury's investigation in 2012 and 2013 as that Grand Jury formally understood at that time and as argued by the Government, but that fact is not dispositive as to the circumstances of this case. A federal grand jury and the DOJ are separate entities. \"[T]he grand jury is mentioned in the Bill of Rights, but not in the body of the Constitution. It has not been textually assigned, therefore, to any of the branches described in the first three articles. It is a constitutional fixture in its own right.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/#p47\">\n    504 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/#p47\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/#p47\">\n    118 L.Ed.2d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because the grand jury and a prosecutor are two separate, independent entities, either the prosecutor or the grand jury may investigate evidence of criminal wrongdoing. This distinction is reflected in the DOJ's definition of \"target,\" which recognizes that a target may be one recognized by either the prosecutor or the grand jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't of Justice,\n   <em>\n    U.S.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attorneys' Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-11.151 (defining target as \"a person to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In 2012 and 2013, the DOJ was conducting an investigation related to bank fraud committed by Doug Corriher through the Grand Jury and through other agencies and entities. Therefore, a representation\n   by an AUSA that an individual is neither a target nor a subject, but only a fact witness in that investigation, communicates information to several parties - counsel, individuals testifying before the Grand Jury, the Grand Jury, and this court - upon which those parties rely and act. By using the DOJ's definition, that statement communicates that the individual is not \"a person to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime, and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is [not] a putative defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/#p47\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In making the statements in question to Drake and her attorneys, the Government communicated to them that neither the prosecutor nor the Grand Jury had substantial evidence linking Drake to the commission of a crime, and further that Drake, in the judgment of the prosecutor, was not a putative defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Nevertheless, in spite of the representation from the Government that Drake was neither a target nor a subject, an email sent by the prosecutor to investigators on May 5, 2013, roughly a little more than two weeks before Drake's second appearance before the Grand Jury, contained the following statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Here are my thoughts on what needs to be done on Corriher:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   3. We need to decide if we want to treat Shannon Drake as a target. She is a bank officer.

Instead, the Government argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   The government did consider in 2013 whether Drake should be made a target of the investigation at that time. By email dated May 5, 2013 ... the AUSA raised the prospect of whether Drake should be treated as a target based on her proximity to the nominee lending scheme within [the] Bank. The AUSA intended to raise a discussion point for the investigation team; consideration and re-consideration of targets is common during large investigations ... Nothing in that email suggests a plan to mislead or trick Drake. Rather, it shows that, if Drake were targeted, the government would have acted to ensure that she had her own counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 16-17.) This court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The email does more than query whether \"Drake should be targeted based on her proximity to the nominee lending scheme within [the] Bank.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the email suggests far more than proximity to an unlawful scheme. The email states: \"Drake was an essential cog in the Five Guys system and was well aware that these loans were a nominee arrangement.\" (Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248), Ex. 4, May 5, 2013 email.) While that phrase might be suggestive of proximity,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   remaining statements in the email eliminate that possibility. The phrase \"[g]ive her a break in response for full testimony\" suggests that the Government was considering exercising its prosecutorial discretion to not prosecute a putative defendant for criminal activity in exchange for full and truthful testimony. The following phrase, \"make her eat a false entry on bank books charge,\" suggests the Government had evidence of wrongdoing that would support a guilty plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Special Agent Blackerby understood that phrase to ask whether the Government should charge Drake and have her enter a plea of guilty to a criminal offense. (Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248) at 67.) It is fundamental that the entry of a plea of guilty requires a determination by a court that there is an independent factual basis for the guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7636604\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/649/#p652\">\n    104 F.3d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652 (4th Cir. 1997) (referring to requisite factual basis under former Rule 11(f) and stating that a court \"need only be subjectively satisfied that there is a sufficient factual basis for a conclusion that the defendant committed all of the elements of the offense\"). Therefore, the suggestion by a prosecutor that one viable alternative is the compulsion of a guilty plea by Drake reflects something more than Drake's \"mere proximity to an unlawful scheme.\" It suggests the Government \"has substantial evidence linking Drake to the commission of a crime, and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't of Justice,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Attorneys' Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-11.151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Second, the Government argues that the email is \"privileged and would ordinarily not be subject to discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2).\" (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 16 &amp; n.8.) This court agrees, and this court did not order the disclosure of this email. Instead, it was turned over voluntarily by prosecutors to defense counsel because of its possible appearance in light of contrary representations in briefs filed with this court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This court agrees that this email was appropriately disclosed in light of the representations made to the court in the Government's brief, which contains at least one statement that appears contrary to the information contained in the email. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Government's Resp. to Def. Shannon Drake's Mot. to Dismiss and Suppress Grand Jury Test. (\"Government's Resp.\") (Doc. 178) at 2.) Furthermore, the Government's voluntary disclosure of that email constitutes a waiver of that privilege with respect to the information contained in the email.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1498668\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/696/1069/#p1072\">\n    696 F.2d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1072 (4th Cir. 1982). Notably in this case, the Government has chosen not to present any further evidence which might permit this court to find those facts as argued in its brief, (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) ), that is, that this email is simply a reflection of an ongoing process in which the prosecutors and law enforcement agents were debating who should or should not be designated as a target in an investigation, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17). While this court accepts that there may ordinarily be some discussions about target status\n   among law enforcement and prosecutors, the email clearly communicates the Government's firm opinion as to wrongdoing by Drake and its consideration of her as a putative defendant. Absent some evidence to the contrary, this court is not able to find this email to reflect a nominal debate by investigators as to Drake's status. Finally, and notably, the DOJ's definition of target refers to the \"prosecutor or Grand Jury\" and makes no reference to law enforcement personnel making that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Third, this court agrees with the Government that, in response to the email, \"[a]t the hearing held on March 7, 2018, Agent Blackerby testified that she did not recall the email or recall having a conversation on that topic at that time.\" (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 17 (citing Excerpt of Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 226) at 20-22).) However, that testimony, which this court credits, does not diminish the significance of the statements in the email. This court cannot find, as the Government argues, that the prosecutor's email reflects merely a point of discussion as to the \"consideration and re-consideration of targets\" during an investigation. (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 16.) The only email recipient to testify at the hearings does not recall any such discussion. The two alternatives proposed by the prosecutor in the email for discussion both suggest some evidence of wrongdoing, at least sufficient to support either a guilty plea or an agreement whereby the Government exercises its discretion to not prosecute in exchange for full testimony. To find the statements contained in the email are simply a prelude to a general discussion of the case would require some reasonable inference that the Government might require an individual \"to eat a false entry on record keeping\" without some evidence known to the Government to support that particular option. That a prosecutor would threaten to compel a guilty plea without evidence to support that threat is an untenable position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Fourth, the Government contends the evidence supporting Drake's role in the scheme did not become clear until Y.S. and C.G. testified before the Grand Jury in 2016. (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 5-6.) Notably, the Government points out, it was during their testimony in 2016 that the Government learned things such as \"Drake had the primary duty to handle the factoring accounts associated with Harrison[,]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6), and that \"Corriher and Drake were lending clients (straw companies controlled by Harrison) new money to pay old, unpaid debt ... [,]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, the argument that Drake's role was not discovered until 2016 is at least somewhat belied by the prosecutor's statement in 2013 that Drake \"was an essential cog in the Five Guys system and was well aware that these loans were a nominee arrangement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248), Ex. 3, May 5, 2013 email.) It appears to this court that Drake was targeted at least as having committed criminal recordkeeping violations in 2013, and those charges were later abandoned in favor of the more serious offenses presently charged. In the absence of the presentation of any evidence to refute the prosecutor's statements that Drake was \"an essential cog in the Five Guys system\" and could be compelled to \"eat a guilty plea,\" this court declines to find that Drake's criminal activity was not known until 2016. Drake's testimony in 2013 makes it clear that that Government was well aware at that time of Drake's relationship to Corriher and her work at the Bank in relation to the five companies at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This court has considered the evidence, reasonable inferences from the evidence, and the specific language of the email. This court finds that Drake was not formally\n   identified by the United States as a target of its bank fraud investigation until 2016, nor was the United States under any constitutional or statutory duty to formally classify her as a target. However, this court further finds that by May 2013 Drake was a person about whom the prosecutor had substantial evidence linking her to the commission of a crime, and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, was a putative defendant as to a bank recordkeeping felony. The Government's advice to Drake and her counsel that she was neither a target nor a subject of the investigation, but was called to testify merely as a fact witness, was misleading to Drake and her counsel. When the Government affirmatively represented to Drake and her counsel that her status stood as \"not a target of this investigation,\" that statement was inconsistent with statements the prosecutor was making privately to co-counsel and law enforcement officers. It also appears to have been inconsistent with not only the evidence available to the Government at that time but also its intentions with respect to Drake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Not only was that advice misleading, but also those misleading statements have now affected all stages of this proceeding. First, and perhaps most significantly, the Government's advice was sufficiently misleading to deprive both Drake and her counsel of a reasonable opportunity to address a conflict of interest as a result of Smith Moore's joint representation of Drake and the Bank and in light of any criminal conduct by Drake. In a situation where the prosecutor either declines to comment on a witness's target status or notifies a witness of their target status, defense counsel considers the prosecutor's silence or statement and advises the client accordingly. In either situation, counsel here it appears would have advised Drake to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege or to seek separate counsel. On the other hand, where a witness's target status is misrepresented, defense counsel is prevented from intelligently rendering such advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Smith Moore had already directed the acquisition of separate counsel for Doug Corriher, an individual identified as a target of the investigation. (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 173.) Drake was deprived of this opportunity. As explained by Petersen in his testimony at the November 9, 2017 hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   My practice over the years has been if I'm representing the corporation, the way I communicate with a corporation is through a corporate officer. So if there is a grand jury subpoena for documents to a hypothetical corporation, the only way I have to communicate with the corporation about fulfilling that production obligation is communicating through a person on behalf of the entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   In doing that, if hypothetically Mr. Chut was involved, I would call Mr. Chut and say what's going on at this stage of this case as you perceive it? Mr. Chut might or might not tell me that my client, the corporation, was a target or a subject. He might not. But I would understand if Mr. Chut told me your client, the entity, is not a subject or a target. I understand fully that Mr. Chut could change his mind hypothetically the next day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   So I would also ask him the same question about the person conduit with whom I was communicating to the entity. If he told me that's a bad person in my mind, I would get that person separate counsel right then. If he told me we don't think that person is a bad person at this moment, I would proceed in helping that person get ready to go to the grand jury to give the documents and to answer[ ] questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Tr. of Nov. 9, 2017 Hr'g (Doc. 135) at 204-05.) Petersen's testimony on this topic illustrates\n   how defense counsel relies on a prosecutor's statements in assessing conflicts of interests during representation of a witness before the grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   More specifically as to this conflict of interest issue and as the Government notes, it appears there were discussions between Drake's counsel and the prosecutor with regard to Smith Moore's joint representation of the Bank and Drake. As the Government details in its brief, quoting a Smith Moore attorney's notes from a May 23, 2013 meeting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The AUSA raised the concern that it \"appears Ms. Drake [was] involved in that situation.\" Later in the conversation, the notes indicate a reference by the AUSA to \"millions of $'s in collections ... 90 days in arrears.\" Attorney Medford then indicated that \"all of these entities made peace that satisfied them.\" The AUSA is then noted as telling the [Smith Moore] lawyers that \"you guys represent the bank &amp; not individual ... at some point - you guys don't represent her directly.\" The notes show Attorney Medford responding: \"We've looked carefully - her role - what she knows ... no problem ... Think you [have] misread her involvement ... You're wrong about what she has.\" The AUSA is noted as saying on the government's part, \"Not having [an] opinion ... [but merely] raising issue\" and urging Attorney Medford, \"If it comes up ... be up front.\" Attorney Medford is noted to have reassured the AUSA: \"We [have] looked at this ... our conclusions ... if we found something out.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 8-10 (citing Government's Opp'n Br., Ex. 4, Dildine May 23, 2013 Notes (Doc. 244-4) at 1-5).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As noted earlier, the notes quoted in the Government's brief are not entirely clear. While they reflect the prosecutor stating that Medford and Smith Moore represented the Bank and not Drake individually, this is contrary to correspondence sent to the same prosecutor by Ashley. (Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248), Ex. 5, September 18, 2012 Letter from Bruce Ashley.) This court interprets Medford's statement \"no problem\" as reflected in the notes as most likely referring to a potential conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Government, interpreting the notes in a slightly different manner, argued at the April 13, 2018 hearing that the prosecutor made his concerns known to Medford and that the two of them discussed whether Drake needed her own counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   (Tr. of Apr. 13, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 251) at 65.) The prosecutor contends that after being assured by Drake's counsel, who from the prosecutor's perspective at the time was\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   the Bank's counsel, that Drake was okay, the Government proceeded ahead with Drake as a fact witness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Government's Opp'n Br., Ex. 4, Dildine May 23, 2013 Notes (Doc. 244-4) at 5 (\"Chut - You guys rep[resent] bank [and] not individual. At some point - you guys don't rep[resent] her directly.\").) The prosecutor argued that he was entitled to rely on the Bank's counsel's opinion on this matter. (Tr. of Apr. 13, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 251) at 65-66 (\"I discussed with Mr. Medford, as indicated in the notes, that I was concerned about her, and I was assured by Mr. Medford that I was wrong and that she was not factually involved. ... Based on that, we proceeded forward.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   This court is not persuaded by the Government's allegations. First, as noted previously, the Government has neither filed an affidavit nor presented any evidence to support those allegations, particularly as to the conclusion that the prosecutor may have relied upon Medford's representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Second, this court does not find the prosecutor's alleged reliance on the Bank's counsel's representations compelling. The prosecutor appears to have understood Medford to be the Bank's attorney, not Drake's. The prosecutor necessarily understood then, that Medford's duty was to the Bank, not Drake, and that any representation that Drake was \"okay\" was within these parameters. It seems to this court that a reassurance from the Bank's attorney, made to a prosecutor holding evidence sufficient in his opinion to support a guilty plea (based on this court's reading of the May 5, 2013 email) is insufficient to remedy any initial concern the prosecutor might have had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Third, the position taken by the prosecutor at the April 13, 2018 hearing, that he relied on Medford's representations as to Drake's criminal liability in 2013 despite having concerns of his own, is inconsistent with the position taken by the Government in its brief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 4-7 (arguing that Drake's role in the Five Guys scheme was not revealed until the 2015 and 2016 Grand Jury testimony of C.G. and Y.S. and after years of investigatory work).) More specifically, in his initial response to this court, the prosecutor stated that \"three years prior to her indictment, the defendant was not a subject or target of the investigation.\" (Government's Resp. (Doc. 178) at 2.) If, as the prosecutor contends, he did have concerns about Drake but relied solely upon Medford's assurance to drop those concerns, in his initial response to this court, the prosecutor should have explained the full circumstances of his early understanding of Drake's liability. Instead, the prosecutor, after the fact, has pointed to later discovery of information as an explanation for Drake not being advised that she was a target or at least a subject in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Nonetheless, the notes from that meeting reflect the prosecutor stating he does \"not hav[e] an opinion,\" suggesting the prosecutor declined to take a position on whether Drake was in need of separate counsel. If, as it appears from the May 5, 2013 email, the Government had evidence of Drake's criminal activity, relying upon an opinion of the Bank's counsel that things were \"okay\" is not compelling. Furthermore, even if it were reasonable for a prosecutor to rely on defense counsel's assessment of criminal liability, it is unclear how Medford's assurances as to the \"3.2 million dollar loan\" would have exonerated Drake from criminal liability for the known recordkeeping violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Third, if, as the Government alleges, based upon the Bank's counsel's representation, the prosecutor decided to call Drake as a \"witness\" before the Grand Jury, then it is entirely unclear whether that means the Government decided to \"give Drake a pass in exchange for her testimony,\" exercise its discretion not to prosecute Drake, or something else entirely. During the April 13, 2018 hearing, the prosecutor repeatedly stated that he chose to call Drake before the Grand Jury as a \"witness,\" which does not directly answer the question here, and does not mean that Drake was neither a subject nor a target. The term \"witness\" is not defined by the DOJ, but even its common understanding would suggest something different from a \"target\" or a \"subject.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Considering a second manner in which this statement was misleading, it appears to this court that advising a witness before the Grand Jury that the witness is neither a target nor a subject of the investigation, but is called as a fact witness, is misleading to the Grand Jurors. The absence of target or subject notification is reasonably suggestive to the Grand Jury that the Government has no evidence of wrongdoing by the witness. A \"fact witness\" characterization eliminates any of the inherent bias or credibility concerns that might be present if a subject or target were to testify. The Government's representation also allowed it to present to the Grand Jury the testimony of Drake as a fact witness in the investigation of Doug Corriher while at the same time avoiding any potential complexity of Drake seeking new counsel or invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege had the Government simply remained silent as to Drake's status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Third, the Government's misrepresentation was presented to this court. On January 12, 2018, the Government stated the following to this court in response to a motion filed by Defendant Drake:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The defendant twice testified before the grand jury in this case, on September 25, 2012, and May 29, 2013. She was eventually charged\n   <em>\n    three years\n   </em>\n   after she last testified before the grand jury. In her Motion to Dismiss, the defendant insists the government misled the defendant as to her status as a subject or target of the investigation at the time of her testimony.\n   <em>\n    This assertion is incorrect because, three years prior to her indictment, the defendant was not a subject or target of the investigation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (Government's Resp. (Doc. 178) at 2 (second emphasis added).) This court does not find that Drake was formally designated as a target of a Grand Jury investigation as might be associated with a formal internal process. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Government's Resp. to Def. Ronald Earnest's Mot. to Dismiss and Request for\n   <em>\n    Kastigar\n   </em>\n   Hr'g, Ex. 1, Decl. of Miguel Rivera (Doc. 181-1).) However, that response neglects to add that three years prior to her indictment, the Government had sufficient evidence to suggest that Drake had engaged in criminal wrongdoing and was a potential putative defendant in this court. As stressed previously, \"the test as to whether a witness is\n   a target of a grand jury investigation cannot be whether he 'necessarily' will be indicted, but whether according to an objective standard he could be indicted.\"\n   <em>\n    Crocker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"909861\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/568/1049/#p1055\">\n    568 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1054 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dep't of Justice,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Attorney's Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-11.151. Perhaps, at the time of Drake's Grand Jury testimony, the Government may have been focused on investigating and indicting Corriher. Despite learning extensively about Drake's role at the Bank and forming an opinion as to her criminal liability, the fact that Corriher was the target does not permit the provision of misleading statements by the prosecutor. Even if a grand jury witness is not a target solely by exercise of prosecutorial discretion, a statement that the witness is neither a target nor a subject but only a witness has a significant capacity to mislead as to the Government's knowledge and possible future consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This court is unable to find any way to rationalize a statement in a brief to this court that Drake was neither a target nor a subject of an investigation in 2013 while at that same time the Government was discussing whether to require Drake to either cooperate in exchange for a break or \"eat a guilty plea\" to a low level recordkeeping violation absent the presentation of some evidence to contradict the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     What Action or Remedy is Appropriate in Light of the Government's Conduct?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendant argues that the Government's misleading statements to Drake and her counsel rise to the level of a constitutional violation, and for that reason, this case may be dismissed. Although this court believes the misleading nature of the prosecutor's statements to Drake and her counsel are relatively easily identified, the determination of what right, if any, was violated and whether this court should take action is not as clear. This court considers whether a remedy in this case is justified by either (1) this court's supervisory powers and/or (2) a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     This Court's Supervisory Powers with Respect to Grand Jury Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bank of Nova Scotia v.

The conclusion that the Fifth Amendment did not provide a remedy in these cases is unsurprising, however, both opinions belabored the troubling nature of the Government's behavior that allegedly resulted in the defendants' choice to waive their Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gillespie\n   </em>\n   took a step further. The\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   court considered whether the totality of the circumstances supported a finding that the defendant was in fact misled into waiving his rights. The court seemed to presume that a due process claim was actionable in that case, but that proof of causation was lacking on the facts before it. Likewise, the\n   <em>\n    Gillespie\n   </em>\n   court suggested that use of supervisory powers might be permitted in a case where \"the government acted in bad faith in failing to provide the target warnings, or that it proffered an affirmative misrepresentation to [the defendant] regarding his target status[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gillespie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517258\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/796/\">\n    974 F.2d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court is unable to determine from this evidence whether any misleading statements were intentional but does find such statements to be affirmative misrepresentations. This case raises the issue not reached in\n   <em>\n    Gillespie\n   </em>\n   - what should happen when affirmative misrepresentations are made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Third, considering under a totality of the circumstances approach whether the false statement did in fact mislead Drake to waive her Fifth Amendment rights and testify,\n   <em>\n    Bumper\n   </em>\n   provides a useful analogy. Much like a homeowner presented with an officer claiming to have a warrant, a grand jury witness presented with an affirmative representation that he or she is \"merely a fact witness\" may rely on such a representation. The advice to Drake and her counsel that she was not a target but merely a fact witness certainly had the potential to mislead and induce Drake into waiving her\n   Fifth Amendment rights and testifying. As the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Babb\n   </em>\n   recognized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Even if we assume, for purposes of Babb's contentions, that the prosecutor purposely attempted to mislead Babb, the obvious reason for such misrepresentations would have been to induce Babb to waive his fifth amendment privilege and to give helpful testimony to the grand jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Babb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1649697\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/807/272/#p276\">\n    807 F.2d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Drake testified before the Grand Jury twice in reliance on the AUSA's representations that she was not a target but was merely a fact witness called to testify in the investigation targeting Corriher. Had the Government either correctly informed Drake of her status or simply declined to comment entirely, this court does not doubt that at least Petersen, based on his testimony, would have advised Drake to seek separate counsel, and either Petersen or new counsel may very well have recommended invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Intertwined with the guarantee of due process is a requirement of \"fundamental fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lassiter v. Dep't of Social Servs. of Durham Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313768\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/18/#p24\">\n    452 U.S. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313768\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/18/#p24\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313768\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/18/#p24\">\n    68 L.Ed.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981). By analogy, considering the doctrine of equitable immunity, the Fourth Circuit has stated \"if the promise was made to defendant as alleged and defendant relied upon it in incriminating himself and others, the government should be held to abide by its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This constitutional question will not be reached by this court, however, because a more fundamental problem prohibits the court from exercising its supervisory powers in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   First, during the April 13, 2018 hearing, the Government stated that it does not plan to introduce Drake's Grand Jury testimony at trial. Even if this court were to find that Drake's Fifth Amendment rights were violated in connection with her Grand Jury testimony, this court is not persuaded that such an error prejudices her if the testimony will not be used against her during the Government's case in chief.

It is clear that Petersen, had he been aware of Drake's potential status, would likely have advised her to seek independent counsel. Nevertheless, in the absence of a Sixth Amendment right attaching at the grand jury stage, there is no corresponding constitutional right to conflict-free counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204292\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/412/#p428\">\n    475 U.S. at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204292\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/412/#p428\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ayala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225424\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/256/#p272\">\n    601 F.3d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, Drake alleges generally that Smith Moore \"provided advice and information regarding [her] testimony before the grand jury.\" (Tr. of Feb. 8, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 212), Ex. 3, Drake Aff., \u00b6 5.) However, Drake never explains how any misleading information from the prosecutor misled her into waiving her Fifth Amendment privilege. Nor does she explain how the misleading advice affected her discussions with Medford and any advice she may have received. In other words, this court is unable to say that any advice Medford rendered or that any decision Drake made to testify following that advice was adversely affected by the prosecutor's statements. This is particularly significant in light of the fact that nothing would preclude a prosecutor from reconsidering her status, accurately stated, at a later time. Therefore, while there was misleading conduct, there is no evidence of harmful error as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The court is very concerned with what occurred in this case, namely with the prosecutor's comments made to Drake, defense counsel, the Grand Jury, and this court.

Following this disclosure, the Government has more recently contended that the May 5, 2013 email reflected discussions among the investigatory team, (Government's Opp'n Br. (Doc. 233) at 16-17), although no one seems to recall any discussions of that type, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Tr. of Mar. 7, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 248) at 68 (Blackerby testimony); Tr. of Apr. 13, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 251) at 67 (Chut testimony) ). Finally, the prosecutor contends that he disclosed concerns regarding Drake to Medford during a May 23, 2013 meeting, as reflected in notes cited by the Government in its brief. (Tr. of Apr. 13, 2018 Hr'g (Doc. 251) at 65-67; Government's Opp'n Br.

The court has not relied on these notes in reaching its decision because the Government has not seen these notes. While there may be some support in these related notes for discussions occurring regarding the prosecutor's concerns about Drake, it is not clear from reviewing these notes what those concerns were or what might have been disclosed. Those notes could be interpreted to suggest discussions over a potential conflict, concerns over Drake's criminal responsibility, or concerns over whether Drake had testified or would testify truthfully before the Grand Jury. This case has been aggressively litigated and this court has considered whether the Government should be provided access to these other notes in light of its current arguments, as it appears Drake has waived her privilege as to this particular work product. However, in light of the Government's shifting positions, as outlined above, and in the absence of any notes or evidence from the Government as to what occurred during meetings between defense counsel and prosecutors from May 23 to May 28, 2013, this court does not find any further argument as to interpretation of these notes helpful or appropriate. At present, the evidence stands that, regardless of what might have been discussed during that time frame, neither Dildine nor Peterson nor Drake understood Drake to have been a target or subject of the Government's investigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    During the course of the April 13, 2018 hearing, this court raised its concerns with the obvious conflict between the Government's briefs arguing that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to a witness before a grand jury, (United States' Opp'n. to Def. Shannon Drake's Mot. to Dismiss the Indictment (\"Government's Opp'n Br.\") (Doc. 233) at 26), and the prosecutor's advice to grand jury witnesses that under the Sixth Amendment they had a right to counsel at that time, (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Government's Opp'n Br., Ex. 1, C.G.

Regardless, to confuse the Sixth Amendment and the CJA Plan in rendering advice of rights to a witness is troubling. The Sixth Amendment and the CJA Plan are not coextensive, and advising a witness that they have a Sixth Amendment right is incorrect and at best a bad practice on the part of the prosecutor. While the Sixth Amendment is not substantively at issue in this case, as it does not attach at the grand jury stage of criminal proceedings, evaluating the evidence and determining what can and cannot be relied upon is at issue, and this type of practice does affect this court's assessment of the reliability of the evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    Drake does not directly raise arguments as to a violation of the Sixth Amendment, (\n    <em>\n     see generally\n    </em>\n    Drake Suppl.
