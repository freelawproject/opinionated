Both parties contend that no genuine issue of material fact exists and have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on liability (Docket ## 35, 41). Plaintiff additionally seeks summary judgment as to damages (Docket # 41) and also moves to strike portions of the Affidavit of Marie Johnson in Support of Ken's Foods' summary judgment motion (Docket # 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant purchased tomato paste from suppliers in California as one of the roughly 800 ingredients used to produce its salad dressings and other products. It contracted with Distribution Services of America (\"DSA\") to provide various services related to railroad shipments of the tomato paste. DSA's responsibilities included receiving and reviewing defendant's rail transportation invoices, after which defendant would pay DSA for the invoices and DSA would pay the railroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the 68 shipments involved in this case, defendant paid DSA for the freight charges billed by plaintiff, the rail carrier. DSA, however, failed to pay plaintiff. Plaintiff sued DSA on May 12, 2015 to recover the unpaid amounts, and DSA filed for bankruptcy in January 2016. Plaintiff then sought to recover the unpaid charges from defendant, filing this suit on January 26, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is undisputed that defendant was not notified about DSA's failure to pay the outstanding freight until November 2015 when plaintiff served a subpoena on defendant during the CSX/DSA litigation. By that point, nearly 16 months had passed since the first unpaid shipment. However, defendant was not completely ignorant of problems between plaintiff and DSA. For instance, DSA met with defendant \"at least usually once a year\" and at some point informed defendant that plaintiff was assessing finance charges for late payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Docket # 44-3 at 150. Nevertheless,\n   defendant never asked DSA to verify paying the freight charges. In fact, defendant never conducted any due diligence or evaluated DSA's financial condition at any point during the companies' 17-plus year relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relevant Contracts and Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Determining liability in this case requires analyzing several contracts and documents pertaining to the tomato shipments, including (I) defendant's rate quotation agreement with DSA; (ii) the purchase orders defendant issued to its paste suppliers and the suppliers' invoices; (iii) the suppliers' and railroad's bills of lading for the shipments; and (iv) the UP203-1100 pricing tariff and Union Pacific's \"General Rules Circular.\" I briefly describe each document/document category below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Defendant's Agreement with DSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 1, 2014, defendant and DSA entered into a rate quotation agreement for the paste shipments which specified how the tomato paste would be transported, including that the shipments should be sent \"freight collect\"; that they should travel on Union Pacific's rail lines from California and switch to CSX's lines in Chicago (\"UP-CHICAGO; CSXT\"); and that the consignee for the shipments should be listed as \"DSA For Ken's Foods\":\n  </p>\n  <attorneys id=\"p-18\">\n   Consignee Address: DSA For Ken's Foods c/o Foxboro Terminals 208 North Street Foxboro, MA 02035 Freight Charges: Ship freight collect Quote: UP 203-1100 Routing: UP-CHICAGO; CSXT\n  </attorneys>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Docket # 38-14 at 3. As discussed below, defendant's purchase orders, its suppliers' invoices, and the shipments' bills of lading are generally consistent with this information for the 68 shipments in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendant's Purchase Orders and the Suppliers' Invoices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When defendant purchased tomato paste, it generated purchase orders to one of two suppliers: Los Gatos Tomato Products (\"Los Gatos\") and The Morning Star Packing Co. (\"Morning Star\"). The suppliers then issued invoices to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Three of the relevant shipments contained Morning Star tomato paste. For example, on July 28, 2014, defendant purchased tomato paste from Morning Star and generated a purchase order therefor. According to the purchase order, the shipment was to be paid \"freight collect\" and shipped to \"Foxboro Terminal, 208 North Street, Routing UP-CHGO-CSXT, Foxboro, MA 02035.\" Docket # 44-16 at 3. Morning Star's invoice for this order lists the billing address as \"Ken's Foods, 1 De Angelo [sic] Drive, Marlborough, MA,\" and the shipping address as \"DSA for Ken's Foods c/o Foxboro Terminals.\" Docket # 44-18 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sixty-five of the relevant shipments contained Los Gatos tomato paste. For instance, on September 22, 2014, defendant purchased tomato paste from Los Gatos using a purchase order numbered 135035. Docket # 44-16 at 3. As above, the purchase order states that payment is \"freight collect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. It identifies the \"ship to\" address as \"Ken's Foods, Inc. 1 D'Angelo Drive, Marlborough, MA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Los Gatos's invoice for this order identifies \"Ken's Foods, Inc.\" as the recipient of the shipment and specifies delivery terms as \"FOB Huron.\" Docket # 44-17 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Bills of Lading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the shippers/consignors, both Morning Star and Los Gatos generated straight uniform bills of lading for the paste shipments. Morning Star's bill of lading for the July 28, 2014 purchase order, for example, identifies in relevant part: (1) the consignee's address as \"DSA for Ken's Foods c/o Foxboro Terminals 208 North Street, Foxboro, MA 02035\"; (2) the \"Contract Ref[erence]\" as \"Ken's Foods Marlborough MA\"; and (3) that the shipment would be paid \"collect.\" Docket # 44-20 at 2. The bill of lading further states that \"every service to be performed hereunder shall be subject to all the bill of lading terms and conditions in the governing classification on the date of shipment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Los Gatos's bill of lading for the September 22, 2014 shipment includes information similar to that on Morning Star's, such as identifying: (1) \"Ken's Foods, Inc.\" as the consignee and (2) \"Ken's Foods, Inc. c/o Foxboro Terminals 208 North Street, Foxboro, MA\" as the shipping address. Docket # 44-19 at 2. And like the Morning Star bill, the Los Gatos bill of lading also states that it is \"subject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of the issue of this Bill of Lading.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, origin rail carrier Union Pacific Railroad (\"UP\") also issued bills of lading for the above-referenced shipments containing similar information: (1) Foxboro, MA as the rail destination; (2) \"CC (Collect)\" as the method of payment; (3) UP203-1100 as the pricing tariff information; and (4) \"DSA for Ken's Foods\" as the consignee. Docket # 44-21 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The UP203-1100 Tariff and UP's General Rules Circular\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As noted above, defendant's contract with DSA and the UP bills of lading both reference \"UP203-1100\" as the \"rate authority\" or \"quote\" that set the price for the paste shipments. The parties agree that UP203-1100 is the UP tariff item covering movements of tomato paste in drums or wooden/plastic bins (just like the shipments in this case). Docket ## 38-22 at 2, 38-23 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though defendant disputes that the shipments were in fact subject to UP203-1100, it is undisputed that, if they were so subject, then the shipments' terms necessarily incorporate UP's \"General Rules Circular.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Docket # 49\n   \u00b6 50 and Response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Several provisions of the Circular are relevant here. First, Exempt Circular UP 4-F, Item 111, \"Liability of Consignee &amp; Consignor\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-30\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    liability of consignor, consignee and beneficial owner of shipment for charges\n   </em>\n   arising out of this offer and its acceptance, through tender of shipment by consignor and through acceptance of delivery by consignee,\n   <em>\n    is joint and several\n   </em>\n   except as provided in Section 7 of Item 25.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Docket # 38-24 at 30 (emphasis added). Second, Section 7 of Item 25, \"Terms and Conditions,\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) All freight and other charges are payable by the shipper, consignor, consignee or beneficial owner immediately upon delivery.\n   <em>\n    Acceptance by the consignee or beneficial owner of the property herein described shall be deemed acceptance by consignee or beneficial owner of responsibility for freight and other charges\n   </em>\n   accruing on said property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (emphasis added). And finally, Item 120, \"Suit to Collect Charges,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   In the event that suit must be filed to collect any charge or charges subject to the provisions of this publication,\n   <em>\n    the amount sued upon shall include interest from the date of shipment\n   </em>\n   at the maximum rate of interest allowed by law in the jurisdiction in which it is filed.\n   <em>\n    Court costs and reasonable attorney's fees shall be added\n   </em>\n   to such principal and interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant contends that it is entitled to summary judgment because it is not contractually liable under the shipping documents,\n   applicable tariffs and/or circulars. Alternatively, even if it is liable, defendant argues that plaintiff is barred from collecting the outstanding freight charges under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contractual Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant maintains that (i) it was not a party to the bills of lading because it was not the named consignee, and thus cannot be held liable for the freight charges; and (ii) even if it is party to the contracts, the bills of lading do not impose liability because they do not incorporate a specific UP tariff and/or circular and \"[n]othing in the Ken's-DSA contracts, the Ken's-Los Gatos contracts, or the Ken's-Morning Star contracts refers to UP and/or CSX services, tariffs or circulars.\" Docket # 48 at 2.

Thus, it argues, \"[i]n the face of such ambiguity on the bills of lading, Ken's cannot be liable under the theory that it is the named consignee.\" Docket # 48 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant's position is unpersuasive. The only reasonable reading of these bills is that defendant was the consignee of the shipments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n    241 F.3d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the agreement is ambiguous, a court may still grant summary judgment as long as the extrinsic evidence presented to the court supports only one of the conflicting interpretations.\").

May 10, 2012) (carrier was instructed by a third party acting \"on behalf of\" ultimate recipient of cargo, and therefore the recipient was the consignee and/or beneficial owner of the cargo).

Furthermore, defendant agrees that DSA received the shipments in Foxboro for the benefit of defendant, and that defendant was the ultimate user of the product. Accordingly, the record supports only one reasonable interpretation: defendant was the consignee and DSA was its service provider or \"freight forwarder.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 52-5 at 2 (DSA Application for Credit and Agreement with CSX describing the nature of its business as \"Freight Forwarder\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

UP203 and the UP's General Rules Circular\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition to defendant's liability as consignee of these \"collect\" shipments, the UP Rules Circular further reinforces defendant's obligation to pay the freight charges. Those Rules-which apply to any shipment using UP tariff UP203-1110-explicitly provide that the consignor, consignee, and beneficial owner are jointly and severally liable for the freight charges. Furthermore, the Rules clearly state that \"acceptance by the consignee or beneficial owner of the property ... shall be deemed acceptance ... of responsibility for freight and other charges ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 38-24 at 20. Both of these provisions support finding defendant liable for the freight charges, either as consignee or, alternatively, as the undisputed beneficial owner of the tomato paste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant contends that the Rules don't apply because the shipments' bills of lading did not incorporate UP203-1110 and/or the UP Rules Circular. It notes that the Morning Star and Los Gatos bills of lading do not explicitly reference UP203, and it contends that \"[n]othing in the Ken's-DSA contracts, the Ken's-Los Gatos contracts, or the Ken's-Morning Star contracts refers to UP and/or CSX services, tariffs or circulars.\" Docket # 48, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   These arguments miss the mark for several reasons. First, while the Morning Star and Los Gatos bills of lading do not explicitly reference a pricing authority, both state that they are subject to \"tariffs in effect on the date of the issue of this Bill of Lading.\" Docket ## 44-19 at 2, 44-20 at 2. It is undisputed that UP203 is the applicable UP tariff covering movements of tomato paste such as the shipments in this case. Second, apart from the suppliers' bills, the UP bills of lading expressly note that the rate authority is \"UP\" or \"UP203\" and the \"contract #\" is \"1100\" or \"2031100.\" Docket # 44-21. Third, defendant's own rate quotation agreement with DSA also explicitly references UP2031100 as the quoted rate. These facts entirely undermine defendant's argument that the shipments were not subject to the UP tariff. Because the undisputed facts show that the tariff did cover the 68 shipments, this provides an alternative basis for holding defendant liable for the freight charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Thus, that party might right reasonably rely upon the representation of payment and conclude that its obligations had been relieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While the application of equitable estoppel in these circumstances appears to be an issue of first impression in this circuit, I needn't resolve the divergent caselaw to conclude that defendant's defense fails. First, under the majority position, the defense is simply not available to defendant under the theory that, by hiring DSA and choosing to remit payment through it, defendant assumed the risk that DSA might fail to pay plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spedag Americas, Inc. v.

In addition, [defendant] undertook no actions to limit its liability.

The summary judgment record is clear that defendant hired DSA and that plaintiff never \"actually released\" defendant from its liability for the freight charges as consignee and/or beneficial owner of the tomato paste shipments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, even if I were to adopt the more lenient minority position under which equitable estoppel might apply, the record is clear that plaintiff made no material misrepresentations upon which defendant relied to its detriment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K-Mart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534969\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/907/#p912\">\n    875 F.2d at 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted above, the most common material misrepresentation in the equitable estoppel cases is a bill of lading marked \"prepaid.\" Here, however, it is undisputed that none of the bills of lading for the 68 at-issue shipments were so marked; instead, they were to be paid \"freight collect,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   by the consignee. That fact alone sets this case apart from the typical equitable estoppel decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant argues that plaintiff's failure to inform it of DSA's delinquency was a \"misrepresentation by conduct\" that should suffice for equitable estoppel, but that pushes the doctrine too far. While plaintiff's failure to promptly alert defendant to DSA's delinquent payments might reflect poor business practices, it does not amount to deceptive behavior evidencing plaintiff's intent to mislead defendant.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ANR Freight Sys., Inc. v.

Fact discovery had been closed for over four months by that time and summary judgment briefing was nearly complete. Second, the request evinces a lack of due diligence on the part of the defendant. Defendant does not point to newly discovered facts or any other legitimate excuse for this late shift in strategy. Rather, its stated reason for requesting leave to amend is \"to conform to a case relied on by CSX in its summary judgment papers.\" Docket # 48. But that decision is nearly ten years old, and plaintiff's citation to it does not justify this late request to amend.

Plaintiff contends that the total principal amount is $728,917, Docket # 49, at \u00b6 71, whereas defendant argues that the total amount is $701,301, Docket # 58, at \u00b6 12. However, Exhibit 13, which defendant cites to in support of its position, appears to be a spreadsheet of the 68 shipments showing that the total balance of unpaid freight charges, less the incidental finance charges, is $728,917. Thus, this amount is not seriously disputed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fr10\" name=\"fr10\">\n      10\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Nonetheless, although plaintiff is entitled to the relief it claims, the result of this litigation falls harshly on defendant, and the court urges the parties to resolve at least this last issue with grace.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fr11\" name=\"fr11\">\n      11\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    As to interest, Item 120 of the UP Rules Circular provides for prejudgment interest \"from the date of shipment\" and \"at the maximum rate of interest allowed by law in the jurisdiction in which the suit is filed.\" Docket # 38-24 at 34. Relying on this provision, plaintiff asserts that \"$399.41 in interest charges accrue daily on the unpaid Freight Charges\" based on a purported \"maximum legal [interest] rate in Massachusetts\" of twenty percent annually. Docket # 42 at 18 (citing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20271%2C%20%C2%A7%2049\">\n     Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, \u00a7 49\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). There are multiple problems with this argument. First, this suit was filed in federal court and plaintiff asserts a federal cause of action. It is therefore unclear why Massachusetts law is the \"law in the jurisdiction in which the suit is filed\" in this case. Second, even if Massachusetts law did apply, it is unclear why the \"maximum rate of interest allowed by law\" should be 20% as set by the usury statute cited by plaintiff and not 12% as allowed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, \u00a7 6C, the statute specifically concerning prejudgment interest in contract actions such as this one. These deficiencies make it currently impossible for the court to determine the appropriate amount of prejudgment interest to be assessed on the freight charges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    --------\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
