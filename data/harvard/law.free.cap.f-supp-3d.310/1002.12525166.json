(collectively referred to in the complaint as \"Express Scripts\") administer pharmacy benefits for third parties and also own and operate a mail-order pharmacy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 18; ECF No. 1.) Express Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefits manager (\"PBM\") in the United States, with over 97 percent of all retail pharmacies participating in its network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) A PBM \"manage[s] the pharmacy benefits for health plans and self-insured entities, negotiate[s] drug discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and develop[s] ... lists of drugs approved for reimbursement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) The decision of which PBM to use is made by patients' health insurance plans, which are usually chosen by patients' employers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) \"For a pharmacy that is not owned by a PBM to operate successfully, it is essential for the pharmacy to participate in all of the largest PBMs' networks, including Express Scripts'.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) To do so, independent pharmacies either contract directly with PBMS or indirectly through the pharmacy's agent, usually a Pharmacy Services Administrative Organization (\"PSAO\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Park Irmat Corp. (\"Irmat\"), a New York-based pharmacy in business since 1978, began concentrating on dermatological pharmaceuticals in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34-35.) \"As Irmat's dermatology business began to flourish, Irmat agreed to participate in patient assistance programs sponsored by leading drug manufacturers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Under such a program, the manufacturer covers a portion of the patient's insurance co-payment, thereby \"allow[ing] patients to obtain medications that their doctors prescribe without having to make burdensome ... co-payments ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Participation in these programs provided Irmat with the \"opportunity to significantly expand its business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"[The] manufacturers provided Irmat with marketing channels and a\n   potential customer base that extended nationwide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Consequently, \"Irmat could no longer confine its operations to its Park Avenue storefront... [and] began providing mail-order services to customers throughout the country.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"From 2012 to 2015, Irmat's business grew exponentially, both in revenue and geographic scope.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Its staff drew from 20 employees in 2012 to a high of 208. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also in 2012, Irma enrolled with a PSAO, AccessHealth, thereby gaining access to over 100 payors' pharmacy networks, including Express Scripts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2014, Express Scripts, Inc. (\"ESI\") sent a Pharmacy Provider Agreement (the \"Agreement\"). (Compl. Ex. 3.) This Agreement provided, in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1.4 \"Pharmacy\" or \"Pharmacies\" means the pharmacy or pharmacies listed on Exhibit B ... which are owned or operated by Provider, ... meets the definition of Retail Provider (as defined in Section 1.8) and has been approved by ESI to provide services hereunder....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.8 \"Retail Provider\" shall mean a pharmacy that primarily fills and sells prescriptions via a retail, storefront location, is determined by ESI to fulfill an ESI business need with respect to participation in its retail network(s), and meets such other criteria established by ESI from time to time including any specific needs of a population, as determined by ESI in its sole discretion. \"Retail Provider\" shall not include mail order, specialty, home infusion, dispensing physician or internet pharmacies or such other provider types that do not meet ESI's Retail Provider criteria established from time to time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2.2. b\n   <em>\n    Credentialing and Recredentialing.\n   </em>\n   Provider and its Pharmacies shall be eligible to provide services hereunder, including dispensing Covered Medications, only upon satisfaction of any credentialing/recredentialing and additional requirements imposed by ESI, including the providing of prompt written notice with any updates to the Provider Certification, as further prescribed in the Provider Manual.

Ex. 3 at 4, 5, 8, 12.) Irmat was identified in the Agreement as the Pharmacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) No pharmacies were listed on the Exhibit B form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In July 2015, Irmat was required by ESI to submit a re-credentialing application. (Compl. \u00b6 44 &amp; Ex. 1.) This application included eight practice types. (Ex. 1. at 6, 22.) Irmat checked \"Open Door Retail/Community\" and \"Mail Order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The former was 35 percent of its business; the latter was 65 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Of the mail order business, 5 percent was local and 95 percent was out-of-state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The application also asked, among other things, the names and license numbers of the pharmacists, the Drug and Enforcement Administration and the Medicaid license numbers of the pharmacy, the hours of operation, whether the pharmacy was an open-door pharmacy that filled prescriptions for walk-in customers, whether the pharmacy had been the subject of any disciplinary or legal action, and whether the pharmacy provided any compounding services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-12, 22-30.) In response to a question whether the pharmacy had previously participated in an ESI or Medco\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   pharmacy network, Irmat replied it had as of June 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) The completed application was submitted on July 31, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 7, ESI sent Irmat a two-sentence email. (Compl. \u00b6 45 &amp; Ex. 2 at 2.) The subject was \"Express Scripts credentials approved\" and the signatory was \"Express Scripts Provider Credentialing.\" (Ex. 2 at 2.) The first sentence read: \"We are pleased to inform you that your recently submitted credentials have been reviewed and you are approved to continue in the Express Scripts Holding Company pharmacy networks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The other sentence read: \"To access member and claims information, Payer Sheets and regulatory information register at our\n   <em>\n    Pharmacist Resource Center\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It was sent from an email box that did not receive emails but had the name of \"Ingrid Dominguez\" at the top. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There is no indication of what position at Express Scripts Ms. Dominguez held; she did not sign the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl Ex. 1-3 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Relying on the first sentence, \"Irmat made substantial investments in its mail-order business,\" including \"hir[ing] scores of employees, construct[ing] a multi-million dollar facility in New York,\" and spending \"considerable time and resources to obtain\" two pharmaceutical industry accreditations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In May 2016, \"Express Scripts sent Irmat a cease-and-desist letter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) The primary infraction allegedly committed by Irmat \"was dispensing medications to Express Scripts members by mail.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Express Scripts' letter wrongly claimed that Irmat misrepresented the nature of its pharmacy operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Other alleged infractions included \"fail[ing] to use its best efforts to achieve formulary compliance\" and discounting member copayments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48-49.) The latter apparently referred to the co-payment assistance programs Irmat participated in with drug manufacturers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Both allegations were incorrect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In June 2016, Irmat replied to the letter, \"remind[ing] Express Scripts\" of its August 2015 email representations and of its erroneous allegations about Irmat's formulary compliance and copayment collections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Irmat also reminded Express Scripts of its earlier inquiry into whether Express Scripts maintained a separate\n   mail-order pharmacy network and, when being informed it did not, of Irmat's willingness to join one should Express Scripts establish such a network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By letter dated July 15, 2016, Express Scripts informed Irmat it was terminating Irmat from the network effective September 14, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Reasons given were Irmat's mail-order business, in contravention of the definition of \" 'retail provider,' \" and alleged failure to use its best efforts to dispense formulary drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Irmat appealed its termination, \"again noting that Express Scripts expressly approved Irmat's mail-order business\" and again explaining that its dispensation of formularies was in compliance with New York law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   152.) On August 22, fourteen days after Irmat's appeal, Express Scripts informed Irmat its decision to terminate Irmat was affirmed and, in addition to the reasons earlier given, cited three disputes Irmat had had with state boards of pharmacy-disputes Irmat had already resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   153.) Express Scripts further stated that it was terminating Irmat \" 'without cause' \" and also for cause based on the alleged infractions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Express Scripts' termination of Irmat from its networks has caused Irmat \"catastrophic injury\" and significant harm to Irmat's customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The foregoing course of dealing between Express Scripts and Irmat reflects a conspiracy between Express Scripts and co-conspirator PBMs, including CVS Health Corporation (\"CVS Health\"), to suppress competition from independent pharmacies, including Irmat, for mail-order pharmacy business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2-3, 5, 17.) All the co-conspirator PBMs belong to a trade association, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (\"PCMA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Indeed, executives of Express Scripts and the co-conspirator PBMs serve on the PCMA's board of directors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) \"PBMs manage 95% of all the drugs prescribed and covered under group and individual health plans in the country. Express Scripts, CVS Health, and the two other largest PBMs control approximately 80% of the PBM market,\" with \"Express Scripts and CVS Health alone cover[ing] over 65% of this market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) CVS Health terminated Irmat from its pharmacy health networks in January or February 2017\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"after conducting several abusive audits of Irmat.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, 91, 92.) Irmat had been a participant in the networks since 2012, and been subjected \"for a number of years\" to meritless audits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Irmat alleges that the anticompetitive conduct of Express Scripts prevents customers \"from obtaining the benefit of competitive pharmacy expertise,\" harms those customers who would benefit from Irmat's dermatological expertise, and \"deprives consumers of the cost-saving benefits that they enjoy through Irmat's participation in drug manufacturer patient assistance programs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80-81.) Moreover, Express Scripts' conduct violates the Sherman Act, breaches their contract, and violates three states' Any Willing Provider laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Express Scripts counters that Irmat has failed to state a claim for any of the purported violations or breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Rule 12(b)(6) Standard.\n   </em>\n   \" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' in order to 'give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claims is and the grounds on which it rests.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

The allegations include a common course of conduct among the PBMs to foreclose Irmat and the other independent mail-order pharmacies. For instance, \"since 2014, the PBM conspirators engaged in abusive audits of competitor pharmacies, terminations of them, and unconscionable contracting practices.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 16-17, ECF No. 32.) The motive attributed by Irmat to Express Scripts' decision to terminate it from its network was to preclude it from the mail order pharmacy networks because Express Scripts operated its own such network. Irmat has submitted, however, an agreement with Express Scripts signed by Irmat in October 2014 representing that it was primarily a retail pharmacy, not a mail-order pharmacy. (As discussed below, that agreement was not unconscionable, nor was it novated.) Conversely, the pharmacy network Irmat participated in with CVS Health was a mail-order network. It joined this network three months after it was sent a cease-and-desist letter from Express Scripts and the month after it was terminated from Express Scripts' network. (Compl. \u00b6 91-92.) Irmat alleges it was terminated from the CVS Health network without cause after a four-month period of being reimbursed at lower rates than before it joined the network and being denied the ability to dispense 90-day supplies of prescriptions through that network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062238\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1011/#p1023\">\n    527 F.Supp.2d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1023 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (finding allegations of actions taken within three months of each other to \"fall short of unusual, lockstep ... behavior\" indicative of a conspiracy). And, although Irmat alleges CVS Health subjected it to abusive audits beginning in 20\n   <em>\n    12,\n   </em>\n   it does not allege that Express Scripts has. Although the result of Express Scripts' and CVS Health's conduct is that Irmat does not now participate in either PBM's networks as a mail-order pharmacy, the difference in how that result came to be does not suggest a common motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nor has Irmat alleged any action taken by Express Scripts that is against its self-interest. \"Evidence that the defendant acted contrary to its interests means evidence of conduct that would be irrational assuming that the defendant operated in a competitive market.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319477\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/350/#p360\">\n    385 F.3d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360-61 (3rd Cir. 2004). In the two compounding cases in which self-interest was discussed, the disclosure by Express Scripts to other PBMs of a detailed business plan to save money by eliminating coverage for compounded medications was held to sufficiently allege an action taken against self-interest.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grasso Enters.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20365434\">\n    2017 WL 365434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    Precision Rx Compounding,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204446801\">\n    2016 WL 4446801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. According to the allegations in those complaints, this plan was presented by Express Scripts in a PowerPoint document to third-party payors, published on Express Scripts' website, and described in a newspaper article.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Grasso Enter.,\n   </em>\n   No. 4:14cv01932 HEA, Amended Complaint at 20-30;\n   <em>\n    Precision Rx Compounding,\n   </em>\n   No. 4:16cv00069 RLW, Amended Complaint at 20-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Another \"plus factor\" to consider is market concentration. Irmat alleges that Express Scripts and CVS health cover 65 percent of the PBM market and, with the two other largest PBMs, cover 90 percent. In\n   <em>\n    In re Late Fee and Over-Limit Fee Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5757004\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/528/953/#p964\">\n    528 F.Supp.2d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court, relying on\n   <em>\n    Twombly,\n   </em>\n   held that a combined 70 percent share of the credit card market did not describe a concentration conducive to conspiracy. Moreover, Irmat is not alleging that it wishes to compete as a PBM; rather, it is alleging that it wishes to use the various pharmacy networks to dispense mail-order prescriptions. Irmat is also alleging that it gained access in 2012 to over 100 networks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Irmat contends that it has sufficiently described a high-level of interfirm communication when alleging that the PBM co-conspirators controlled the relevant trade association. (Pl.'s Resp. at 17.) Specifically, Irmat has alleged that Express Scripts and its co-conspirators are active members of the PCMA and that their executives serve on the PCMA's board of directors, including Tim Wentworth, the President of Express Scripts, and Jon Roberts the President of CVS/Caremark and Executive Vice-President of CVS Health. (Compl. \u00b6 83-84.) Irmat further alleges that \"Express Scripts and its co-conspirators joined together in approximately 2014-through the PCMA and/or otherwise-to collectively determine how best to eliminate coverage for the provision of mail-order pharmacy services by independent pharmacies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Hawaiian &amp; Guamanian Cabotage Antitrust Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191105\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/647/1250/\">\n    647 F.Supp.2d 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.
