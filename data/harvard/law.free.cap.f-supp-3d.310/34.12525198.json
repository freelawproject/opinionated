The CIA further determined that the requested information did not fall within the scope of any exception that would warrant a search of its exempted operational files, and, consequently, the agency did not search any of its operational files for responsive records.

Thus, Judicial Watch filed the instant complaint on March 7, 2016, alleging that the agency had failed to say whether or not it would comply with the FOIA request, and had not produced the requested records or otherwise demonstrated that the records were exempt from production. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9.) Accordingly, Judicial Watch's complaint alleged that the CIA had violated the FOIA by failing to respond timely to the FOIA request, and asked the Court to compel the CIA to\n   produce the requested records.

In response to the CIA's motion, Judicial Watch filed a cross-motion for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot.), and the CIA followed with a combined opposition and reply brief in support of its own motion for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Combined Opp'n and Reply (\"Def.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 13), which was accompanied by a second declaration from Shiner (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Antoinette Shiner (\"Second Shiner Decl.\"), ECF No. 13-1). At that same time, the CIA also provided notice that it was lodging a classified declaration in support of its motion for summary judgment, which was made available for this Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera, ex parte\n   </em>\n   review.

Finally, after Judicial Watch filed its reply brief in support of its cross-motion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply), the CIA filed yet another supplemental declaration from Shiner, on October 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Antoinette Shiner, ECF No. 18.) This Court heard the parties' arguments on the cross-motions for summary judgment during a motion hearing held on June 22, 2017, and both motions are ripe for this Court's review.

Moreover, by statute, judicial review is available for a challenge brought under section 3141(f)(4) only if the parties satisfy specific procedural requirements. As a first step, the CIA has the burden of \"demonstrating to the court by sworn written submission that exempted operational files likely to contain responsive records currently perform the functions\" of \"operational files\" as defined in the CIA Information Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3141(f)(4)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3141(b) (defining the three categories of exempted \"operational files\"). Then, only if the complainant \"disputes the [CIA's] showing with a sworn written submission based on personal knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence\" can the court proceed to order the CIA \"to review the content of any exempted operational file or files in order to\" support the claimed exemption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3141(f)(4)(B). Of course, \"if the court finds ... that the [CIA] has improperly withheld requested records because of failure to comply with any provision of [the CIA Information Act],\" the court must order the CIA \"to search and review the appropriate exempted operational file or files for the requested records and make such records, or portions thereof, available in accordance with the provisions of section 552 of Title 5 (Freedom of Information Act)[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3141(f)(6).

Again, to the extent that Judicial Watch means to challenge the\n   <em>\n    placement\n   </em>\n   of the requested records into an exempted operational file under section (f)(3), that argument is waived (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.6), and in any event, Judicial Watch has failed to provide the \"sworn written submission\" that section (f)(3) requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3). Furthermore, any argument that the requested pornographic materials do not fit the statute's definition of an \"operational file\" misunderstands the statute: a challenge brought under section (f)(4) is a challenge to the designation of\n   <em>\n    the file in which the requested records are placed\n   </em>\n   as \"operational,\" and is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a challenge to any individual records that are located in that file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

Therefore, this Court finds that the CIA's invocation of the operational files exemption is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The Requested Pornographic Materials Do Not Trigger The Special Activity Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In addition to the unavailing argument that the CIA has failed to support its invocation of the operational files exemption, Judicial Watch alternatively maintains that, even if the requested pornographic materials are located in appropriately exempted operational files, the agency must still search for the requested materials, because \"[t]he requested records satisfy the 'special activity' exception to the 'operational files exemption.' \" (Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 7.) The so-called \"special activity exception\" is one of three narrow carve-outs to the operational files exemption that Congress \"believe[d] deserve special treatment because of the important interests they involve.\" H.R. Rep. at 23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. at 15 (approving the special activity exception \"in recognition of the public interest in CIA 'special activities' (or covert action operations)\"). As explained in Part I.A above, notwithstanding the general exemption of operational files from searches in response to a FOIA request, Congress has required the CIA to search its operational files in accordance with ordinary FOIA procedures if the requester seeks \"information concerning\" (1) the requester himself, or (2) \"any special activity the existence of which is not exempt from disclosure under the provisions of [the FOIA,]\" or (3) \"the specific subject matter of [certain] investigation[s]\" by particular legislative or executive agency bodies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Here, Judicial Watch vigorously maintains that the requested records satisfy the second of these exceptions, and as a result, it asserts that the CIA must search for and review the records, even to the extent they are located in otherwise-exempted operational files. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 9.) This Court can-and does-assume\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the raid on bin Laden's compound counts as a \"special activity\" for the purpose of the statutory exception, and even so, it rejects the conclusion that the special activity exception applies under the circumstances presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To begin with, the Court observes that the plain language of section 3141(c)(2) establishes that there are three elements that must each be satisfied to obligate the CIA to search its exempted operational files on the basis of the special activity exception: (1) the operation that is the subject of the FOIA request must be a \"special activity\"; (2) the existence of the special activity must not be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA; and (3) the materials sought to be disclosed must constitute \"information concerning\" the special activity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Understandably, the parties here focus almost exclusively on whether or not the first two elements of the special activity exception are satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 8-9 (arguing that the raid on bin Laden's compound was \"a specific U.S. military operation\" that has been \"publicly acknowledged\" by \"U.S. officials\"); Def.'s Reply at 12, 14 (maintaining that \"the Government has never acknowledged the existence of any special activity in connection with the [b]in Laden raid[,]\" and that the raid was not even \"a covert action\").)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11965687\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/992/1249/#p1251\">\n    992 F.2d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that FOIA requests invoking the special activity exception \"must relate to 'a specific covert action operation, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion or the CIA's role in [the] replacement of the [President Jacobo Arbenz] Guatemala regime in the 1950s' \" (quoting S. Rep. at 24-25) ). But the statute also unambiguously provides that the CIA need only open its exempted operational files to \"search and review\n   <em>\n    for information concerning\n   </em>\n   \" any special activity of the CIA, which, in this Court's view, precludes the application of the exception to require the agency to search for the pornographic\n   materials requested here, even if the other two elements are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To be sure, \"\n   <em>\n    concerning\n   </em>\n   \" is a broad and inclusive term that, if considered out of context, could conceivably apply to almost anything, however tangentially related to the matter at issue.\n   <em>\n    See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, New College Edition\n   </em>\n   (1976), at 275 (defining \"concerning\" as \"[i]n reference to; regarding\").

And this narrow exception also reflects Congress's intent in enacting the CIA Information Act, insofar as this interpretation generally preserves the CIA's ability to avoid time-consuming searches of files that are unlikely to yield producible fruit, on the one hand, while at the same time ensuring that citizens have a meaningful opportunity to gather information about the workings of the agency with respect to covert operations, consistent with the FOIA, on the other.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. at 1 (\"The purpose of [the Act] is to relieve the [CIA] from undue burdens of searching and reviewing certain operational files for information in response to [FOIA] requests[.]\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (\"CIA officials have recognized that, within the spirit of what Congress intended FOIA to do for the American people, the Agency does possess information which the public may legitimately inquire about.\"). To read the special activity exception more broadly would be to require the CIA to give up its ability to fend off burdensome FOIA requests in pursuit of records that actually do not shed any light on the United States government's role in the planning or execution of a covert intelligence operation, and are, in fact, entirely\n   <em>\n    incidental\n   </em>\n   to that operation. And nothing in the FOIA or the CIA Information Act suggests that Congress intended that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A brief analogy elucidates the point. Without question, the United States government's 1961 invasion of Cuba's Bay of Pigs was a covert action of the CIA at the time that it was executed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States government later publicly acknowledged\n   this special activity; thus, the fact that it had occurred was not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. If the CIA properly places all of its records concerning the purpose, planning, and execution of the Bay of Pigs invasion in exempted operational files, the special activity exception would plainly require the agency to search those files and produce any non-exempt records if a FOIA requester asked the agency for \"information concerning\" that covert activity. But imagine a requester who is not interested in the purpose, planning, or execution of that covert operation, or any other aspect of the United States government's role in carrying out that special activity, and instead seeks to research the lifestyle of Cuban officials at the time. Such a requester might file a FOIA request asking for the documents and materials that (according to press reports) were collected by CIA-led forces at the scene of the invasion. In this scenario, the CIA's operation is indisputably the but-for cause of the agency's possession of such materials, and the requested materials concern the United States government's special activity in a general sense, but this Court cannot imagine that Congress intended for the CIA to have to discard the no-search pass that the CIA Information Act affords to the agency with respect to its operational files in order to undertake a search for Fidel Castro's grocery list, or his children's report cards, or any other conceivable item that might have been included among materials the United States government seized during the operation. And this is especially so given that Congress plainly specified that the FOIA's \"search and review\" obligations continue with respect to exempted operational files\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   as to \"information concerning\" three subjects that \"deserve special treatment because of the important interests they involve.\" H.R. Rep. at 23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Put another way, even if Judicial Watch is correct that the special activity exception is designed to further the public's interest in getting information from the government (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 34:7-10, 34:25-35:12 (noting the public and media have shown an interest in the requested pornographic materials) ), and even if Fidel Castro's personal records might be inherently interesting to the public, in this Court's view, the\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   public interest for the purpose of circumventing the CIA's special exemption from the FOIA's search and review obligations is the public's interest\n   <em>\n    in the activities of the United States government\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the public's freestanding interest in documents and information that reveal something about the preexisting circumstances of the target of the government's covert action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, in this context, section 3141(c)'s reference to \"information concerning\" is best construed as meaning \"information about.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. at 41 (additional views of Sens. Durenberger, Huddleston, Inouye, &amp; Leahy) (explaining that \"the bill makes no change in public access to releasable information in designated files\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   CIA covert action operations (or 'special activities')\"; therefore, \"[i]f the fact of the existence of the activity is not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, the CIA will have to continue to search and review operational files in response to a request for information\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   that operation in accordance with the FOIA\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. at 24 (noting the exception ensures \"access to files containing information\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   an acknowledged special activity\" (emphasis added) ). And, here, it cannot be seriously argued that Osama bin Laden's collection of pornographic materials constitutes information\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   the raid of the compound that United States special forces conducted, as Judicial Watch concedes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 5-6 (\"A collection of pornographic material, albeit from a terrorist, ... could not possibly document any meaningful conduct relating\n   to foreign intelligence operations[.]\").) In fact, it appears that bin Laden's collection of pornographic materials came into the CIA's custody purely by happenstance, days or weeks after the covert operation itself. Therefore, far from constituting information\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   the CIA's alleged special activity, the pornographic materials that Judicial Watch has requested pursuant to the FOIA are entirely incidental to it, such that the special activity exception does not apply to divest the CIA of the protection of the operational files exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, this Court concludes that the CIA is entitled to rely on the operational files exemption with respect to Judicial Watch's FOIA request, without regard to the special activity exception, which is inapposite. The Court also rejects Judicial Watch's suggestion that the CIA's decision to release other materials that were collected during or after the raid precludes its invocation of the operational files exemption over the pornographic materials presently at issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 34:18-35:5.)

By no means does the collection of pornography recovered from bin Laden's compound qualify as \"information concerning\" the United States government's raid on bin Laden's compound; consequently, this Court concludes that the special activity exception is inapplicable, regardless of whether the bin Laden operation actually was a special activity of the CIA.

Although no analogous cabining language appears in section 3141(c)(2), any such limitation would arguably be too narrow to accommodate a search for records pertaining to the purpose, planning, or execution of a special activity of the CIA, and in any event, Congress's view that \"an unreasonably expansive interpretation\" includes one that requires the CIA to search for information that is \"wholly unrelated\" to the subject at issue is instructive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
