Doe admits that he came to the dance drunk, danced aggressively, and ran twice from police, but he denies allegations that he groped one freshman girl and sexually harassed a second. Doe alleges that Blake's investigation into these allegations and its disciplinary process were negligent and violated Title IX, Title VI, and the Minnesota Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"), and moves for a preliminary injunction. Because Doe has not yet shown a fair chance of prevailing on his claims or that he will be irreparably harmed absent an injunction, the Court will deny Doe's motion.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   John Doe\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a mixed-race student attending The Blake School. (Compl. \u00b6 2,\n   Apr. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1.) He has worked as a camp counselor at Blake since he was 11, and has been involved in coaching youth sports. (Declaration of John Doe (\"Doe Decl.\") \u00b6 4, Apr. 11, 2018, Docket No. 14.) Doe, a senior, has attended Blake since kindergarten, and has received significant financial aid during the course of his enrollment. (Decl. of Joseph Ruggiero (\"Ruggiero Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 27.) Doe believes that he will not be able to afford to attend college without a scholarship. (Doe Decl. \u00b6 8.) In part through his involvement in sports at Blake, Doe earned a full Division I athletic scholarship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Blake School is a private prekindergarten through 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   grade school in Hopkins with roughly 1,375 students. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7.) Because Blake receives some federal funding, it is subject to Title VI and Title IX. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 15, 108.) Blake stresses its commitment to pluralism, noting that 30% of its students identify as students of color and 22% of its students receive financial aid. (Ruggiero Decl. \u00b6 5.) According to Doe, however, only 1.7% of Blake's upper school students are African-American males. (Decl. of Robert Bennett (\"Bennett Decl.\") \u00b6 3, Apr. 23, 2018, Docket No. 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE DANCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On Saturday, February 10, 2018, Doe and 20 to 25 other students drank at a classmate's house and rode a bus to a school dance at Blake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.) The dance was staffed by two Blake administrators, a Hopkins police officer, and adult volunteers. (Decl. of Mike Canfield (\"Canfield Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 22.) Students entered through a single point of access, where adults checked to see if they had brought prohibited items or appeared intoxicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Students were required to arrive between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Doe and the other students arrived at 8:45 p.m., took off their shoes, and danced. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Doe, he \"danced by jumping up and down, grinding, and twerking for approximately an hour with no objection from Blake staff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Doe says that, at one point, a girl pressed up behind him and he danced with her for a few moments before she walked away; then, as he went to get a drink of water, her friend told him that the way he had danced was inappropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-51.) Doe ignored her and went to a photo booth with his friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Blake, several freshmen girls approached freshman class dean Jeanette Vance to report that Doe had grabbed one of them (\"Student A\") inappropriately and that they believed that he had been drinking. (Decl. of Jeanette Vance (\"Vance Decl.\") \u00b6 4, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 28.) Specifically, Student A, who is African-American, alleged to Vance that Doe approached her, told her that he liked that she knew the words to the song that was playing, grabbed her by the hips and pulled her close, moved his hands down her hips, and then \"moved his hands all the way down her crotch and grabbed her vagina area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) The student and her friends moved to the other side of the dance floor; it is alleged that Doe followed them and again grabbed Student A by the crotch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) It was further alleged that the student's two friends told Doe to stop and pushed him away from Student A, he put his arms around one of them (\"Student B\"), began grinding against her from behind, and held her even as she tried to push him away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9,\n   15-16.) Eventually Doe moved away; the girls then left the dance floor and reported him to Vance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   These divergent narratives reunify when Doe was confronted by sophomore class dean Mike Canfield, who took him into a classroom to meet Vance and Officer Leland Coleman. (Compl. \u00b6 53; Canfield Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9-10.) Canfield told Doe that one or more students had complained about unwelcome touching,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that faculty suspected he was drinking, and that he would have to take a breathalyzer test. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55; Canfield Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14; Vance Decl. \u00b6 13.) According to Blake, Doe denied that he would put his scholarship at risk by drinking and stated his view that he was being singled out because he was black. (Canfield Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Vance Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.) Doe ran from the classroom without his shoes or coat, and, with Canfield and Coleman after him, was quickly apprehended. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; Canfield Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; Vance Decl. \u00b6 13.) Doe voluntarily got into a police car and was taken back to the school. (Compl. \u00b6 58; Canfield Decl. \u00b6 16.) When Coleman opened the door to give him a breath test, Doe again ran. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; Canfield Decl. \u00b6 17.) He surrendered when an officer pointed a weapon at him and ordered him to stop. (Compl. \u00b6 60; Canfield Decl. \u00b6 17.) Doe was eventually released to his mother's custody. (Compl. \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Doe's mother spoke with senior class dean Shawn Reid twice that evening. According to Doe, Reid told her that Doe was believed to have groped a girl at the dance but that she should not worry about it, because Doe \"wasn't doing anything different than anyone else.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-66.) According to Reid, he told Doe's mother that he was suspected of drinking, \"that he was accused of grabbing the crotch of one or more girls,\" and that he had run from police. (Decl. of Shawn Reid (\"Reid Decl.\") \u00b6 8, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 25.) According to Doe, an officer told Doe's mother that law enforcement was only interested in Doe's drinking and flight from police and was not investigating the groping allegation. (Compl. \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE ADJUDICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Blake's handbook sets out a policy for investigating and adjudicating harassment, including allegations of sexual misconduct. (Compl. \u00b6 26, Ex. 1 at 43-45, Apr. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1-1.) Specifically, it defines sexual harassment to include \"[u]nwelcome touching in any form\" and \"[p]hysical assault,\" and warns that sexual harassment \"may result in warnings, suspensions or immediate dismissal of a student.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) The handbook describes Blake's commitment to a full review of complaints, a \"thorough and fair\" investigation, and \"compassionate and confidential\" proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Harassment is considered a\n   \"major infraction,\" consequences for which \"usually include suspension or expulsion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The handbook also outlines Blake's disciplinary procedures for major infractions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43.) It states that students will be informed of the alleged infractions and asked to present an explanation in a meeting with their grade dean. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) The grade dean will consult with the upper school director to determine how discipline will be handled; from there, the process is at the discretion of the administration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Final authority for discipline rests with the upper school director unless expulsion is being considered, in which case it rests with the head of school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.) A Community Judiciary Board (\"CJB\") may be tasked with making recommendations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) The CJB includes eight students elected from grades 10 to 12, two faculty members, and upper school assistant director Paul Menge. (Decl. of Paul Menge (\"Menge Decl.\") \u00b6 3, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 23.) This year, three of the eight students are students of color; two identify as African-American. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On Monday, February 12, Reid-Doe's grade dean-told Doe that he would be going before the CJB because he was accused of drinking alcohol and dancing inappropriately. (Compl. \u00b6 73.) Doe alleges that his mother asked Reid about the latter accusation, and Reid told her that the main thing Doe should be concerned about was drinking and running from police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Reid told Doe to prepare a statement about his actions and advised him on its content. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71, 75.) According to Reid, in at least one of his conversations with Doe and his mother, Reid made clear that Doe was accused of grabbing girls in the crotch. (Reid Decl. \u00b6 12.) Reid says that Doe consistently denied that he grabbed any girls that way. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Also on Monday, a junior student (\"Student D\") approached a teacher and, with some reluctance, reported that Doe had grabbed her by the hips and moved his hands toward her crotch, followed her and a friend across the gym, and repeated his actions. (Decl. of Anne Rubin \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 26.) Student D said that she was not aware of the other complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) This complaint did not go to the CJB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On Tuesday, February 13, Doe says that he was told for the first time that he was facing accusations of sexual assault from two freshman girls. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 80-82.) Doe was shown the girls' statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.) Doe was taken before the CJB \"within minutes\" of being shown the statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) The CJB first heard from upper school director Joseph Ruggiero, who said that the CJB's recommendation would be advisory. (Menge Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Next it heard from Reid, who described his observations at the dance and his discussions with Doe afterward, and from Vance, who presented \"information from her investigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Finally, it heard from Doe, who read his prepared statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Doe's statement focused on drinking and running from police;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   however, Doe acknowledged that he had been \"jostling people more than necessary,\" that he was told both by a student and by Blake staff that he was dancing inappropriately, and that he \"may have needed to be removed from the dance floor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-77; Menge Decl. \u00b6 9, Ex. 1, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 23-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The CJB met to deliberate on both February 13 and February 14. (Menge Decl. \u00b6 10.) CJB members agreed that \"Doe's conduct at the dance constituted sexual harassment and/or sexual assault under School policies\" and that Doe should be punished both for those actions and for his choice to drink. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) The CJB was evenly divided as to its recommended punishment, with half of its members believing Doe should be expelled and half believing he should be required to finish his coursework off campus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) \"After receiving the CJB recommendations, Blake administrators met and deliberated at length regarding the appropriate consequences for Doe's actions.\" (Reid Decl. \u00b6 15.) In an email to the Blake Community, Head of School Anne Stavney stated that she made the ultimate decision based on a consensus of administrators. (Decl. of Robert Bennett \u00b6 4, Ex. 1 (\"Stavney Email\") at 3, Apr. 23, 2018, Docket No. 33-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. THE DISCIPLINE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On Friday, February 16, Ruggiero and Reid called Doe and his mother to school and informed them that Doe was to be suspended indefinitely, barred from campus, and prohibited from playing sports. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 88-89; Reid Decl. \u00b6 15; Ruggiero Decl. \u00b6 14.) However, Doe alleges that the administrators told his mother that \"the school would not put anything in [Doe's permanent file about the sexual allegations ... as long as he left the school quietly.\" (Compl. \u00b6 90.) Blake has not squarely denied the allegation; although Stavney's email stated broadly that \"[t]he student who perpetrated the assault was never told that the disciplinary action would be left out of his record,\" Doe's allegation is focused on reference to sexual misconduct. (Stavney Email at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On Sunday, February 18, Doe received a letter from Reid describing Doe's infractions (including \"[s]exual harassment of fellow students\") and his punishment. (Compl. \u00b6 91, Ex. 2 at 1, Apr. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1-2.) The letter noted that Doe would continue his coursework remotely so that he could earn his diploma on schedule and that Blake would provide a math tutor and college counseling as necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Doe's mother also received a copy of Doe's permanent file, which stated that the reason for the discipline was \"sexual\" in nature. (Compl. \u00b6 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Believing that this result would cost him his athletic scholarship, (Doe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8), Doe retained counsel and threatened legal action in the course of asking the school to reconsider, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 94, Ex. 3, Apr. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1-3.) Blake did reconsider, but concluded that its prior investigation was sufficient and its second look only reaffirmed its conclusions. (Compl. \u00b6 95, Ex. 4 at 1, Apr. 2, 2018, Docket No. 1-4.) Stavney wrote to Doe's mother that Doe had admitted that he had been told his dancing was inappropriate, that he had\n   denied to the CJB that he had grabbed girls' crotches, and that Blake's published disciplinary process was followed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Nonetheless, Stavney offered for Blake to assist Doe in gaining access to other athletic opportunities, including a post-graduate year in a high-level lacrosse program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Through counsel, Blake also offered to \"consider [Doe's] input\" regarding Blake's communication with the college that admitted him and to \"consult and advise [Doe] regarding the content of [his own] communication to put things in the most positive light with an objective of retaining his admission and scholarship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Doe's offer of admission and scholarship have since been irreversibly revoked. (Bennett Decl. \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Doe has obtained statements from four witnesses who he says \"would have supported [his] contention that he did not commit the acts he is alleged to have committed\" if he was given more time to assemble evidence for the hearing. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.) Two of the witnesses allege that the school treated allegations against white male students much differently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.) Blake denies this in part, stating that \"not all of the information ... about other alleged student misconduct and discipline is accurate.\" (Def.'s Opp. Mem. at 22, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 21 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 95, Ex. 4 at 1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    V. THIS ACTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Doe filed this action on April 2, bringing claims for (1) negligence in the student disciplinary process with respect to the standards set forth in Blake's handbook and Title IX; (2) a Title VI violation; (3) an MHRA violation; (4) declaratory judgment that Blake's student disciplinary process violates Title IX; (5) erroneous outcome under Title IX; and (6) deliberate indifference under Title IX. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 103-138). Doe ultimately seeks a declaration that Blake's actions violated its contractual obligations and Title IX and were willful and reckless and an order requiring Blake to expunge the process from its records, prohibiting Blake from referencing the process, and allowing Doe to tell third parties that he has not been accused of sexual misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) He also seeks an injunction directing Blake to comply with Title IX and its own handbook, compensatory damages, and attorney fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.) On April 11, Doe filed the Motion for Preliminary Injunction that is now before the Court. (Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Apr. 11, 2018, Docket No. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Minn. Oct. 26, 2017). As such, while Doe's claim would likely survive a motion to dismiss, it is not clear that he has shown a \"fair chance of prevailing\" on the merits for purposes of immediate injunctive relief. Because it is unclear, however, the Court will proceed to consider Doe's allegations of breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Doe alleges that Blake breached its duty to him by (1) failing to provide sufficient notice of the allegations and thereby failing to give him sufficient time to prepare for the hearing; (2) providing an advisor that misled him and his mother into believing the sexual misconduct allegations were not worth worrying about; and (3) using minor school children as factfinders. (Compl. \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The record shows that Blake gave Doe sufficient notice of the nature of allegations against him, even if it was not clear about their severity. Doe's complaint states that Canfield told Doe that a girl had complained about how he had touched her when he was removed from the dance; that Reid told his mother that Doe had groped someone when he called her on the night of the dance; that Doe was shown statements from the girls prior to the CJB hearing; and that Doe's prepared statement contained a version of events consistent with what he continues to maintain actually happened. As such, Doe cannot plausibly claim that he did not have notice of the allegations against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, Doe's claim that Reid and others downplayed the seriousness of the sexual misconduct allegations against him has merit. Blake says that it \"does not understand why anyone would believe that such serious sexual assault allegations 'were not worth worrying about.' \" (Def.'s Opp. Mem. at 22, Apr. 20, 2018, Docket No. 21.) One reason might be that a school administrator told the accused's mother \"not to worry about\" the allegations, because the accused \"wasn't doing anything different than anyone else.\" (Compl. \u00b6 66). Another could be that the same administrator later told the mother that \"the main thing [the accused] should be concerned about was the drinking and running from police.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) In contrast to Blake's straightforward denial of Doe's claim that he lacked notice, the record is curiously bereft of an explicit denial that Reid made the statements Doe imputes to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reid spoke extensively with Doe and his mother as Doe prepared his statement; as such, it is plausible that Reid's advice shaped Doe's statement, and, in turn, the CJB's recommendations and Blake's discipline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Doe falls short of showing a \"fair chance of prevailing\" on this claim-particularly given that it is not clear that Blake had a duty to Doe in the first place. As such, even if this claim is plausible, it cannot justify granting Doe the \"extraordinary remedy\" of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Doe's claim that Blake was negligent in using minor children as factfinders is without merit. The handbook makes clear that major infractions, including harassment, may be referred to the CJB for a recommendation. The handbook makes equally clear that this recommendation is only advisory. It does not appear that the CJB conducts factfinding; rather, it provides student input on disciplinary decisions. Nor does it appear that the process as applied to Doe differed in any material way from the process outlined in the handbook, particularly in light of the fact that the handbook explicitly states that the process will proceed at the discretion of school administrators. As such, Doe has not shown a fair chance of prevailing on the claim that it was negligent for Blake to seek a recommendation from the CJB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98). The second states that, when she accompanied a friend who reported being sexually assaulted by a white male Blake student, Blake told the friend that it would be hard on her socially if the school opened an investigation and she should go\n   to police instead because the assault took place off-campus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Blake denies these factual allegations in part, stating that \"not all of the information ... about other alleged student misconduct and discipline is accurate.\" (Def.'s Opp. Mem. at 22 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 95, Ex. 4 at 1).) Stressing its commitment to pluralism and inclusion, Blake steadfastly denies that race played any part in Doe's discipline, calling \"the notion that Blake would somehow become motivated to discriminate against\" Doe \"ill-conceived and nonsensical.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)

This is not to say that Doe will be unable to do so at a later date. Indeed, these allegations may present a strong claim against Blake.

Doe filed this action six weeks after his discipline was handed down and moved for a preliminary injunction soon thereafter. The reason for this short delay was that Doe first sought a negotiated solution. \"The Court will not fault a party for attempting to resolve a dispute more amicably.\"\n   <em>\n    Millennium Imp.

It is equally certain that such experiences cannot be valued. It is less certain, however, that this loss warrants the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction. Doe submits cases where courts discuss similar emotional losses in the course of finding irreparable harm, but the key to each finding is harm to the plaintiffs' education. Indeed, in all but one of Doe's cited cases the plaintiff would have been delayed from timely completing his or her course of study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the last, the court held that requiring a student to be home-schooled during a year-long suspension may cause irreparable harm-but that case relied on an earlier case holding that home schooling \"does not represent an educational experience sufficiently similar to in-school instruction to eliminate the possibility of irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder ex rel.

Here, by contrast, Blake is allowing Doe to complete his coursework remotely to earn his diploma on time. And, although Doe describes this alternative as \"reek[ing] of separate but equal,\" (Pl.'s Reply at 5), and this alleged harm admittedly presents a very close case, the Court finds that it is sufficiently similar to in-school instruction to mitigate the risk of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, it is likely that Doe's reputation has been harmed, at least to the extent that his identity is known within the Blake community. \"[T]he threat of reputational harm may form the basis for preliminary injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Kroupa v.

In\n   <em>\n    Kroupa\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit found irreparable harm based in part upon harm to plaintiff's reputation when a 4-H club's \"defamatory\n   state action served to confirm and validate what would otherwise have been peer rumor and suspicion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048892\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/813/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048892\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/813/#p820\">\n    at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stavney's email referring to the \"student who perpetrated the assault,\" (Stavney Email at 2), may have confirmed and validated the accusations, but she sent that email in response to media attention surrounding this case, it was sent only to the Blake community, and it did not identify Doe by name. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Kroupa\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that the widespread harm to her public reputation would destroy her chances of career in agriculture.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048892\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/813/#p820\">\n    731 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At this juncture, by contrast, the harm to Doe's reputation is limited to the Blake community. And, because Doe posits that success in this case is what can restore his reputation, the existence of irreparable harm relies on Doe's ability to show a fair chance of prevailing on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Third, Doe's allegations related to the loss of his athletic scholarship do not present the kind of irreparable harm that an injunction is designed to prevent. First, Doe's statement that he will be unable to afford to attend college without a scholarship shows that most of this harm is compensable through a damages award. Second, because Doe has already irrevocably lost the scholarship, this harm has already taken place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CDI Energy Servs. v. W. River Pumps, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650299\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/398/#p403\">\n    567 F.3d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (8th Cir. 2009) (affirming denial of preliminary injunction when harm had already occurred).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, because this disciplinary action must be disclosed on the Common Application for college admission, Doe argues that he may be unable to gain admission to any college or university. But Doe submits no support for this allegation. And counsel for Blake stated at the hearing on this motion that Blake's director for college counseling is certain that Doe will still be able to gain admission and financial aid. In general, speculative harm or the mere possibility of harm is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n    555 U.S. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Doe does submit two cases where courts discussed the impact of plaintiff's ability to enroll in comparable institutions in the course of finding irreparable harm. But in each, the key was again that the plaintiff faced delayed completion of his degree.\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Penn. State Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418513\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/300/#p314\">\n    276 F.Supp.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314 (M.D. Pa. 2017) (discussing plaintiff's inability to mitigate that harm through admission into other institutions);\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Ohio Mar. 13, 2015) (same). Although the harm alleged here presents an extremely close case, without more evidence it is too speculative for the Court to find that it is irreparable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Doe's most certain harm is the financial loss of his scholarship and the emotional harm caused by the loss of a senior semester's worth of memories. Both are compensable through money damages. As such, the Court finds that Doe has not shown the existence of irreparable harm requiring a clear and present need for equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. BALANCE OF HARMS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The remaining two factors do not clearly favor either party. Blake submits that it has an interest in disciplining its students and in preserving a campus free of sexual harassment and sexual assault. That interest is undoubtedly important. But Blake goes further, suggesting that issuing an injunction would send a message to victims that they should not come forward. Not so. The accused are not without rights. Even though Doe maintains that he is innocent, the motion the Court now adjudicates does not turn on what Doe did or did not do. It turns instead on whether Blake was negligent or discriminatory in how it handled the allegations against him. An injunction\n   would not be an exoneration of Doe; it would be an indictment of Blake. Likewise, Doe overreaches by depicting this action as \"a dispute between Plaintiff and Blake which will have little impact on anyone other than Plaintiff and Blake.\" (Pl.'s Supp. Mem. at 22, Apr. 11, 2018, Docket No. 15.) This ignores the fact that four students have brought serious allegations of sexual misconduct against Doe. According to Doe, a Blake dean told him that those allegations were less serious than his drinking and flight from police, and Blake previously declined to investigate similar allegations brought by others against white students. These allegations against Blake implicate not only Doe's rights, but those of the four students who brought complaints against Doe, those who brought complaints in the past, and the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court will deny Doe's motion for a preliminary injunction, but the message should be clear: victims of sexual misconduct, those who stand accused, and society as a whole all benefit from ensuring that allegations of sexual misconduct are handled in a non-negligent and non-discriminatory manner. Two of Doe's claims, that similar allegations against non-African-American students were handled differently and that he was improperly discouraged from responding to the claims of sexual misconduct, merit a more thorough review after the facts are developed in discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [Docket No. 11] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    United States Magistrate Judge Katherine Menendez granted plaintiff's unopposed motion to proceed under the pseudonym John Doe because the litigation is of a sensitive and personal nature.

The fact that Blake gave Doe financial support so that he could attend is not relevant to whether it discriminated against him once he was there-let alone once he was accused of sexual misconduct. The fact that Blake could have treated Doe more harshly is not relevant to the question whether it treated similarly-situated white students less harshly.

At the hearing on this motion, counsel for Doe said that students who enter a \"mosh pit\" generally consent to what happens therein and suggested that the freshman girls may have simply misunderstood Doe's conduct. But it should go without saying that consent may be withdrawn.
