BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Lara McElveen (\"McElveen\") alleges that she incurred a debt stemming from the financing of a motor vehicle that was subsequently reduced to judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [1], at \u00b6 9. After the debt went into default, Defendant Westport Recovery Corp. (\"Westport\") acquired the debt and garnished Plaintiff's wages.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. On September 14, 2016, Plaintiff sent Westport an email stating \"[t]his says I owe over 42,0000 [sic]. That was not the paperwork I received from the court. How is this possible I received paperwork that stated almost 20,000.00.\"\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. That same day, Defendant Debra L. Greenberg responded to Plaintiff on behalf of Westport with an email containing a statement (the \"Statement\") of the amount owed.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. According to Plaintiff, the Statement is false and misleading because it miscalculates the amount of interest due.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff also alleges that the Statement shows that Westport assessed Plaintiff's \"costs related to the garnishment prior\" to authorization by the state court.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. The Statement was the first time Defendants disclosed to Plaintiff their calculation of interest and the date of assessment of costs.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 18, 2017, Plaintiff filed her Complaint, alleging that Defendants violated Sections 1692e and f of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On December 18, 2017, Defendants filed the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [9].

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants allege that Plaintiff's Complaint should be dismissed because: (1) the Complaint is barred by the statute of limitations; (2) the Statement was not an attempt to collect on a debt; (3) Plaintiff's claim under Section 1692f is barred by the statute of limitations; (4) Plaintiff's claim under Section 1692f fails to state a claim; (5) Plaintiff's claim under Section 1692e fails to state a claim; and (6) Plaintiff's allegations, which form the basis of her claim under Section 1692e, cannot also establish a separate violation of Section 1692f.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [9]. The Court agrees that Defendants' first two arguments warrant dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice. The Court's analysis will accordingly be limited to these two arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Complaint is time-barred.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 1692k(d) of the FDCPA states, \"An action to enforce any liability created by this subchapter may be brought in any appropriate United States district court without regard to the amount in controversy, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, within one year from the date on which the violation occurs.\" Plaintiff acknowledges that \"the one-year statute of limitations would normally run Thursday, September 14, 2017.\" ECF No. [16], at 1. The Court, however, was closed on September 14, 2017, due to Hurricane Irma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [1], at \u00b6 14; ECF No. [16], at 1-3. Plaintiff alleges that the Complaint is therefore timely because it was filed once the Court reopened on September 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11404277\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/1125/#p1135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants, on the other hand, contend that the Court was not \"inaccessible\" because its electronic case filing system remained operational that day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [9], at 7-8. The Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Whether Plaintiff's Complaint is considered timely depends on whether the Court was \"inaccessible\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)(3), which states that if the Clerk's office is \"inaccessible ... on the last day for filing ... then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to its 2009 amendment, the rule referred to \"weather or other conditions\" as the reason for the inaccessibility of the clerk's office. As the advisory committee's\n   notes to the 2009 amendment to subdivision (a)(3) state: \"The reference to 'weather' was deleted from the text to underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to weather,\n   <em>\n    such as an outage of the electronic filing system\n   </em>\n   . Weather can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk's office. The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the concept will continue to develop through caselaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(3) advisory committee's notes to 2009 amendment (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Indeed, emerging caselaw suggests that, \"given the advent of electronic case filing (ECF), a clerk's office is no longer 'inaccessible' just because it may be physically closed on a particular day.\"\n   <em>\n    Domazet v.

The Clerk's office was not physically inaccessible due to inclement weather. [T]hat office remained open ... and was accessible to the general public.

Thus, the Court is not persuaded that\n   <em>\n    Chao Lin\n   </em>\n   precludes the Court's finding, considering the Eleventh Circuit's acknowledgement that the Lins' failure to contend that they lacked internet access to file documents electronically weighed against a finding that the Clerk's office was inaccessible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mindful of recent caselaw on the matter and Plaintiff's failure to allege that her counsel did not in fact have access to the internet or the Court's electronic filing system, the Court finds that the clerk's office was not \"inaccessible\" on September 14, 2017.

Considering the factors articulated above, the Court concludes, as a matter of law, that the Statement received by Plaintiff was not a communication sent in connection with the collection of a debt. On the one hand, the Statement specified an amount due and was sent by Defendants, a debt collector. On the other hand, the Statement did not demand payment; was unequivocally sent in response to an inquiry or request by the debtor; was not likely part of a strategy to make payment more likely, as the Statement did not include any phone numbers, addresses, or any other information regarding how payment could be made; did not state that it was an attempt to collect a debt;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and failed to threaten any consequences should the debtor fail to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [1-1]. On\n   balance, it is evident that the Statement was not a collection attempt or even an attempt to induce payment from Plaintiff. Instead, the Statement was \"merely a ministerial response to a debtor inquiry, rather than part of a strategy to make payment more likely.\"\n   <em>\n    Grden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5645097\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/169/#p173\">\n    643 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   173 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226905\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/141/1229/#p1240\">\n    141 F.Supp.3d at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Statements of account are not debt collection activity; rather, they are normal incidents of loan servicing.\").
