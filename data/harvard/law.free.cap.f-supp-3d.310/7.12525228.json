Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants routinely and systematically fail to abide by this statutory provision.

A non-citizen may quickly receive a bond hearing, but prompt action is not necessarily guaranteed. And, under the agency's position, a former unaccompanied alien minor now detained in an adult facility has no recourse for the period before such a hearing is scheduled. In this sense, the relief provided by that remedy is limited. Section 1232(c)(2)(B) requires that the agency \"tak[e] into account the alien's danger to self, danger to community, and risk of flight\" then \"consider placement in the least restrictive setting available.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B). While, as the agency argues, the provision includes no explicit temporal requirement, it strains credulity to imagine that Congress intended to permit DHS to make these determinations whenever it pleases. To find that a hearing before an immigration judge-which may come weeks or months after a former unaccompanied alien child's placement in an adult detention facility-suffices would undermine Congress's provision of special consideration for this class of young immigrants. Certainly, Defendants have not pointed to clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended immigration courts to provide the only source of relief for Plaintiffs' injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, the Court finds it significant that Section 1232(c)(2)(B) requires affirmative\n   action of DHS in the form of consideration of the least restrictive options available for placement of former unaccompanied alien children that they now detain, and it imposes no financial obligation on those individuals. For example, if ICE had concluded that Plaintiff Hernandez Alfaro could be safely released to her proposed sponsor, she likely would not have to pay anywhere near the $10,000 required to secure her release based on the immigration judge's order. In sum, the Court disagrees that review by an immigration court offers an adequate remedy for Plaintiffs' alleged injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

First, the letter makes clear that the reason that one of Mr. Garcia Ramirez's proposed sponsors was denied was because that sponsorship would not comply with ORR release requirements. As ORR sponsorship requirements are presumably more onerous than ICE sponsorship requirements,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Office of Refugee Resettlement, Sponsor Handbook, (listing duties for sponsors of unaccompanied alien children, including that they must ensure that the child has access to education and must protect the child's physical and emotional well-being), https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/orr/frp_8_sponsor_handbook_english_070716.pdf;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (special statutory protections for unaccompanied minors), it is not clear why ORR's consideration of sponsors under its standards might show that ICE had complied with its statutory obligations. Furthermore, this letter says nothing of ICE's consideration of the other potential placement that Mr. Garcia Ramirez had identified. And it likewise reveals no consideration of Mr. Garcia Ramirez's risk of flight, danger to self, or danger to community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Third, the agency relies on a declaration of Michael Leal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leal Decl., Ex. E, ECF No. 20-5. According to Mr. Leal, on September 23, 2017, ORR transferred Mr. Garcia Ramirez into the custody of ICE.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Leal's declaration tends to support Plaintiffs' contentions, not refute them. He provides no statement suggesting that ICE considered anything less restrictive than adult detention at the Phoenix Field Office before it transferred Mr. Garcia Ramirez to EDC. Any assertion that the later use of the Risk Classification Assessment suffices to meet Defendants' statutory obligations ignores the purpose of that assessment-to determine where to place Mr. Garcia Ramirez within an adult detention facility, not to determine whether he belonged there in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, Defendants rely on two sets of communications between ICE deportation officers and Mr. Garcia Ramirez's counsel. In the first, counsel requested that Mr. Garcia Ramirez be released on his own recognizance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Noriana C. Hermes (Sept. 22, 2017), Ex. D at 7, ECF No. 20-4. ICE's response to that letter-which reads in full \"Wilmer needs to be taken into custody d[ue] to a motion to re-calendar being submitted. Wilmer is scheduled to be picked up by ICE on [redacted] in the morning thanks\"-surely does not evidence any consideration of less restrictive placements than adult detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Deportation Officer (Sept. 22, 2017), Ex. D at 9, ECF No. 20-4. In the second communication, Mr. Garcia Ramirez's counsel submitted a detailed letter, arguing for Mr. Garcia Ramirez's\n   release pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from N\u00e9stor Allende-Aspar\u00f3 (Jan. 5, 2018), Ex. E at 20-23, ECF No. 20-5. In a response letter-which counsel may or may not have received-a Deputy Field Office Director from ICE denied the request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Albert E. Carter (Jan. 23, 2018), Ex. E at 24, ECF No. 20-5. Interpreting counsel's letter as a request for prosecutorial discretion, the Deputy Director contended that \"after completing [a] review, ... the totality of circumstances do not support a favorable exercise of discretionary authority in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, as Plaintiffs argue, this letter does not show that ICE considered the statutorily specified factors or that ICE considered placement on the continuum of alternatives instead of just regarding the request as one for release. Indeed, the contention that ICE had denied a request for \"favorable exercise of discretionary authority\" seems to overlook the fact that ICE's compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B) is mandated by statute and therefore not discretionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In sum, based on a combination of evidence supplied by Plaintiffs tending to show that Defendants did not comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B) and deficiencies in Defendants' submissions, which do not undermine-and in some places support-Plaintiffs' showing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing a likelihood of success with regard to claims about Mr. Garcia Ramirez's placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Next, the Court looks to similar evidence supplied by both parties with regard to the placement of Plaintiff Hernandez Alfaro. Plaintiffs again supply declarations, contending that this Plaintiff was transferred from ORR custody to DHS custody on her eighteenth birthday.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Sulma Hernandez Alfaro \u00b6 10, Ex. F, ECF No. 2-7; Decl. of Rosemary Gonzalez \u00b6 6, Ex. B, ECF No. 23-2. Plaintiffs also submit requests for release and for consideration of less restrictive placements-including a request for release to an identified sponsor-pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gonzalez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-19. Defendants contend that the agency did comply with the statutory provision. They rely primarily on (1) a declaration from Deportation Officer Robert Cantu, (2) a declaration of Supervisory Deportation and Detention Officer Jose Cortez, and (3) communications between ORR and ICE shortly before Ms. Hernandez Alfaro aged out of ICE's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n, Exs. A-B, ECF Nos. 20-1, 20-2. The evidence marshaled by Plaintiffs tends to show that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims regarding Defendants' failure to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B). By contrast, evidence supplied by Defendants does not sufficiently rebut this showing, and, indeed, with regard to some submissions, supports Plaintiffs' contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants rely heavily on Officer Cantu's declaration. Officer Cantu asserts that he met briefly with counsel for Ms. Hernandez Alfaro on February 7, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cantu Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. During that meeting, he denied Ms. Hernandez Alfaro's request for release to La Posada Providencia, primarily on the basis that people often abscond from the shelter\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and based on the\n   fact that Ms. Hernandez Alfaro has no strong family ties in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cantu Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Importantly, though, nothing in Officer Cantu's declaration-nor anything in the record-indicates that La Posada Providencia constituted \"the least restrictive setting available\" such that Defendants' rejection of this single request sufficed to meet Defendants' statutory obligation. Likewise, there is no indication that Defendants considered Ms. Hernandez Alfaro for any alternative to detention programs or that they even mentioned such options to counsel. In sum, while Officer Cantu's declaration evidences some \"account[ing]\" of Ms. Hernandez Alfaro's \"danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight,\" it does not show that ICE \"consider[ed] placement in the least restrictive setting available.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The declaration provided by Officer Cortez is also of limited aid to Defendants. According to Officer Cortez, DHS records show that on January 18, 2018, ICE initiated an electronic risk classification assessment during which Deportation Officer Anthony Martinez utilized an electronic risk classification assessment to determine whether to release, detain, or consider alternatives to detention for Ms. Henandez Alfaro. Cortez Decl. \u00b6 22, ECF No. 20-2. Officer Cortez contends that Ms. Hernandez Alfaro was \"determined to pose a high risk of absconding due to not having a sponsor or fixed, permanent address in the United States that she had lived in for at least six months.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    \u00b6 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As Plaintiffs note, Defendants do not provide any explanation from the officer who made the placement decision, any record of the risk classification assessment purportedly performed, or much else other than the bald assertion that Plaintiff did not have a suitable sponsor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 5. To the extent that ICE relied solely on the fact that Plaintiff had no immediate family in the United States and had not resided at a permanent address for more than six months, Defendants have failed to explain how these factors account for all of the required considerations set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B). Furthermore, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants \"appear to view its [ \u00a7 1232(c)(2)(B) ] decisionmaking as a binary choice between detention and release.\" Pls.' Reply at 6 n.2. Defendants offer no indication that they considered requiring, for example, ankle monitoring or any other option to reduce Ms. Hernandez Alfaro's risk of flight to render her eligible for a placement less restrictive than an adult detention facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, just like the records notifying ICE of Mr. Garcia Ramirez's impending transfer to DHS custody, the communications between ICE and ORR indicate only that ORR rejected certain proposed sponsors. ICE does not explain why ORR's consideration of certain proposed sponsors might suffice to meet ICE's statutory mandate. In sum, the Court finds that Ms. Hernandez Alfaro, too, has met her burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court next considers whether Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing irreparable harm. Plaintiffs argue that \"[e]ach day [that they] spend in immigration detention without ICE making a determination as to whether they can be held in a less restrictive setting and/or without ICE making alternatives to detention available, is a day in which Plaintiffs' freedom and fundamental liberty interests may be unlawfully deprived.\" Mot.

Defendants first complain that Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction overlaps substantially with the complete relief requested in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 22-23. Defendants do not explain, however, why this might lessen the harm associated with each additional day Plaintiffs endure purportedly inappropriate detention. The Court fails to see why it should deny relief on the basis that Plaintiffs might eventually secure release after this Court addresses all facets of their complaint. As for Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs' delay in filing the motion for a preliminary injunction cuts\n   against their contention that they have suffered irreparable harm,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 22-24, the Court also finds this ground insufficient to justify denying their motion.

Had Defendants done so, Plaintiffs likely would not have had occasion to file this lawsuit, which they brought in early March 2018, only two months after their communications with DHS. Because Plaintiffs were engaged in efforts to secure consideration of the statutory provision at issue in this case, and because they filed suit shortly after those efforts proved unsuccessful, the Court does not believe that the delay substantially undermines Plaintiffs' contentions that continued detention would harm them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Defendants\n   need offer no change in placement, unless warranted by this assessment. Furthermore, while Defendants are constrained by Congress's mandate, they have quite a bit of discretion in determining how to weigh the factors and whether to provide a less restrictive setting. By contrast, withholding relief might deny Plaintiffs an avenue through which to secure a means of release that Congress explicitly provided for unaccompanied minors who recently reached the age of eighteen. The balancing of the equities tip firmly in Plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. First, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' request should be held to a higher standard because they seek to alter the status quo rather than merely preserve it. It is true that some district courts in this Circuit apply a rule under which \"where an injunction is mandatory-that is, where its terms would alter, rather than preserve, the status quo by commanding some positive act-the moving party must meet a higher standard than in the ordinary case by showing clearly that he or she is entitled to relief or that extreme or very serious damage will result from the denial of the injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Columbia Hosp. for Women Found., Inc. v. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11681785\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/1/#p4\">\n    15 F.Supp.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4 (D.D.C. 1997). Assuming such a rule applies in this Circuit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   in this Court's estimation, Plaintiffs have carried their burden. Continued detention, where Plaintiffs might otherwise be eligible for less restrictive placements, constitutes very serious damage that merits a mandatory injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Second, Defendants note that Plaintiffs' requested relief overlaps substantially with the merits of this suit. However, the Court finds that the consequences of delaying relief justifies swift action even in the face of such overlap. Furthermore, the Court limited its consideration of the present motion to Plaintiffs Garcia Ramirez and Hernandez Alfaro and it offered Defendants substantial time to investigate these Plaintiffs' claims. Since filing an opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief, Defendants have not suggested that they lacked time or resources to thoroughly investigate these two Plaintiffs' claims.

Courts take a similar approach in the Freedom of Information Act context, where an agency typically supplies affidavits and indices that describe disputed documents and the requester has no access to the underlying documents.
