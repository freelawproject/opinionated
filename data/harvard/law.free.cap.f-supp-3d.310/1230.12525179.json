[16-CV-465, Doc. 1]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 16, 2016, the Navajo Nation filed its Complaint based on the Gold King mine spill. [16-CV-931, Doc. 1] On November 28, 2016, this Court consolidated the two cases. [Doc. 90] Both Plaintiffs filed motions for leave to amend their complaints. [Doc. 86; Doc. 141]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Generally, both Plaintiffs allege that, while conducting environmental remediation of the Gold King Mine in Colorado, the Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter, EPA), ER (a contractor for the EPA), and others \"breached a collapsed portal\" of the mine, \"releasing over three million gallons of acid mine drainage and 880,000 pounds of heavy metals into the Animas River watershed.\" [Doc. 1, \u00b6 1; accord. 16-CV-931, Doc. 1, \u00b6 1] The acid mine drainage traveled down-river, into the San Juan River, into New Mexico, and into the Navajo Nation, causing extensive environmental and economic damage. [Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3; 16-CV-931, Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 24]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   New Mexico brings six causes of action against ER: cost recovery and declaratory judgment under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); injunctive relief under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); public nuisance; trespass; and \"negligence and gross negligence.\" [Doc. 1, pp. 32-48; Doc. 86-1, pp. 41-61] Navajo Nation brings seven causes of action against ER: cost recovery and declaratory judgment under CERCLA; negligence; gross negligence; trespass; public nuisance; and private nuisance. [16-CV-931, Doc. 1, pp. 34-46; Doc. 141-1 pp. 46-58] ER challenges each cause of action by both Plaintiffs. [Doc. 32; Doc. 101]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While both Plaintiffs have moved for leave to amend their complaints [Doc. 86; Doc. 141], those motions are opposed and\n   remain pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 23, 2017, this Court entered a\n   <em>\n    Memorandum Opinion and Order\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that this Court will consider whether dismissal of the proposed amended complaints would be appropriate in light of the various Defendants'\n   <em>\n    Motions to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , thus analyzing whether the proposed amended complaints would be futile. [Doc. 118, p. 6] The Court further rejected ER's arguments that New Mexico's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   was untimely and that it prejudiced ER. [Doc. 118, pp. 6-7] Having addressed these issues, the only issue remaining to be considered in determining whether to grant New Mexico's (as well as Navajo Nation's)\n   <em>\n    Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   is whether amendment would be futile. Accordingly, for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    ER's Motions to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' claims, the Court considers the facts as alleged in the\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   , thereby conducting the futility analysis. [Doc. 86-1; Doc. 141-1] If dismissal is proper as against ER based on the facts alleged therein, then amendment of the claims as against ER would be futile and the claims against ER must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, on December 11, 2017, ER filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Transfer for Coordinated or Consolidated Pretrial Proceedings Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. [Doc. 191-1] Thereafter, the United States filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Temporarily Stay Proceedings Pending Decision by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 191] Some parties oppose the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay\n   </em>\n   , or oppose only a delay of the decision on their pending motions to dismiss. [Doc. 191, p. 2; Docs. 192, 195, 199] The Court does not address the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 191] in this\n   <em>\n    Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n   </em>\n   The Court exercises its discretion to rule on the present motion only, concluding that no cause has been shown to stay the issuance of this decision, including the factors of judicial economy and avoiding hardships and inequities to the moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pace v.

Water had been building in the mine and seeping out of the portal for years, and EPA, the contractors, and Colorado officials knew the water was highly acidic and laced with heavy metals. Colorado's records and EPA's work plan not only recognized that the mine was filled with water, but also highlighted the risk of a significant blowout-especially if workers attempted to dig away the blockage. Yet, the work plan ignored this well-understood risk. In fact, EPA's lead official at the Gold King Mine-who was on vacation when the crew triggered the release-had ordered EPA and DRMS employees and EPA's contractor\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to excavate the earthen debris blocking the portal\n   and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to drain the mine without setting up equipment to handle the discharge. Further, the lead EPA official-recognizing the hazards at the site-told the crew to wait to excavate until after he returned from vacation and consulted with an engineer from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Reclamation about the risks of EPA's actions at the site. Despite the clear dangers and explicit directions of EPA's project leader, the on-site crew dug into the portal without verifying the hydraulic pressure or taking necessary precautions-with catastrophic consequences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 4]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   New Mexico alleges that mining operations at the Gold King Mine ceased in 1992 [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 30] and, in 2004, the Level 7 adit\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   collapsed. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 63] The Colorado Division of Minerals and Geology inspected the Gold King mine in 1996 and found that it drained one to two gallons of acid mine drainage per minute. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 53] In 1996 a neighboring mine, the Sunnyside Mine, was sealed using a bulkhead (and a second bulkhead was installed in 2001), causing acid mine drainage to travel through a connecting tunnel, the American Tunnel, to the Gold King Mine. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41] As a result of the collapsed adit and the acid mine drainage from the American Tunnel, Gold King Mine's discharge grew to between 150 and 200 gallons per minute, depending on the season, by 2007. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 63]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2008 and 2009, in an attempt to address the acid mine drainage, the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (DRMS) \"secured\" the Level 7 adit portal, installed a \"grated closure ... to facilitate drainage,\" diverted the drainage, and then backfilled the Level 7 adit. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68] DRMS planned to install a drainage pipe at the floor of the adit, however, when they attempted to install an observation pipe, the timbers supporting the portal collapsed, and DRMS was never able to complete installation of its originally planned drainage pipe. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 68-72]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In 2014, DRMS asked EPA to re-open the Gold King Mine Level 7 adit and investigate the drainage situation.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 78] \"EPA requested a work plan for the Gold King Mine investigation from Environmental Restoration and issued a 'Task Order Statement of Work' ('Statement of Work') on June 25, 2014.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 79] ER submitted a RFP and EPA selected ER as a contractor, \"task[ing] Environmental Restoration with 'procur[ing] and manag[ing] the reopening and ground support construction at the Upper Gold King Mine-7 level adit.' \" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 80] EPA's Request for Proposal (RFP) also states that ER would select a subcontractor and \" 'conduct operations in oversight management of surface and underground work activities.' \" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 80] EPA, along with one of the sub-contractors, began work in September, 2014, however, after two hours of excavation the crew \"abruptly stopped work\" and EPA, ER and others determined \"that the drainage would require larger settling ponds and additional treatment.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 83] \"[B]efore EPA left the site [in 2014], the construction crew pushed large quantities of earthen material and debris in front of the DRMS-installed pipes, forming an earthen plug that prevented the mine from draining and caused a head of water to further build up behind the blockage.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 88]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   EPA asked employees of another contractor, Weston Solutions, to prepare a report, and EPA's on-scene coordinator\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   submitted the report to EPA Region 8. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 84-85] This report stated that drainage pipe installed by DRMS were \"adjacent to the adit roof,\" in contrast to earlier DRMS records which stated that the pipe was at the adit floor. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 85] Based on the purportedly erroneous conclusion that the pipe was at the roof, EPA's report stated that the adit floor was six feet below the level of the waste dump surface, again contrary to DRMS's records. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 86] Further, New Mexico alleges, the EPA \"fail[ed] to test and confirm the amount of water behind the adit\" despite successfully using this practice on two adjacent mines. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 87]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In May and June, 2015, ER submitted draft work plans to EPA to continue work on the Gold King Mine. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 90] EPA, ER, and other contractors visited the site several times \"to assess site conditions and drainage flows[;]\" collect water samples, grade the surface of the waste dump, and begin construction on a water management and treatment system. Nonetheless, no Defendant tested the \"hydrostatic pressure behind the blocked portal.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 90-92] On July 23, 2015, Steven Way, EPA's on-scene coordinator, contacted a Bureau of Reclamation engineer to conduct an independent review of the excavation plans. Mr. Way arranged for the review to be conducted on August 14, 2015, after Mr. Way returned from vacation. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 93] Mr. Way further arranged for another EPA employee, Mr. Griswold, to supervise the Gold King Mine site from August 3, 2015 until Mr. Way returned from vacation. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 94]\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 29, 2015, Mr. Way emailed specific instructions about the scope and timing of work at the Gold King Mine site to Matt Francis (Environmental Restoration), Elliot Petri (Weston Solutions), and Allen Sorenson (DRMS). Later that day, Mr. Way forwarded these instructions to Mr. Griswold. Mr. Way's instructions set out the \"priority and strategy\" for on-site work during the week of August 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 95] Before excavation of the earthen debris blocking the adit was to start, Mr. Way instructed ER to \"provide 'adit drainage control' and implement a 'water management system[,]' \" including setting up a pipe and filter bags; putting a sump and sump-pump in place to \"handle adit discharge\"; putting piping or a hose in place to direct discharge to a treatment pond; and ensuring that a \"stinger pipe\" was prepared and available. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 95]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 4, 2015, after Mr. Griswold arrived, \"the EPA crew\" began excavating the adit and drug out all but a small portion of the drainage pipe that DRMS installed in 2009. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 96] New Mexico alleges this work was done \"[w]ith an incomplete safety plan, an inadequate evaluation of the fluid hazard, and lacking any equipment to prevent or mitigate an uncontrolled release of water from the mine.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 96] The next day, August 5, 2015, the \"EPA crew\" resumed excavating the Level 7 adit, when a backhoe operator hit a \"spring.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 98-99] New Mexico alleges that because \"the pipes were visibly well below the plug, the EPA crew knew or should have known they were removing material at least several feet below the roof of the adit.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 98] No one present attempted to\n   plug the spring or \"blowout,\" and the blowout resulted in the release of over three million gallons of acid mine drainage and 880,000 pounds of heavy metals from the Gold King Mine into the Animas River. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 99] The Animas River joins the San Juan River and travels through portions of New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 1]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In sum, New Mexico alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]he work conducted by EPA, DRMS, Environmental Restoration, Weston Solutions, and Harrison Western in connection with the Gold King Mine amounted to reckless, careless, and grossly negligent conduct that was not driven or supported by social, economic, or public policy considerations. Furthermore, their actions substantially deviated from their own work plans, the mandatory directions given by Mr. Way, established engineering standards of care, and applicable federal and state regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 111]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Navajo Nation's Complaint alleges similar allegations as a basis for relief.

Again, because the government contractor defense is an affirmative defense, and because the court is considering ER's\n   <em>\n    Motions to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , ER must demonstrate that the defense plainly applies based on the facts alleged in the\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Reasonably Precise Clean-up Procedures\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   As pleaded, the Court cannot conclude that the EPA approved reasonably precise clean-up procedures, the first requirement for establishing that the actions fit within the scope of displaced state law. Plaintiffs allege that in late July 2015, EPA's on-site coordinator, Mr. Way, planned an on-site review of the plans by a Bureau of Reclamation engineer, which was scheduled to occur on August 14, 2015. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 93; Doc. 141-1, \u00b6 95] In the interim, Mr. Way went on vacation, but he arranged for another EPA employee, Mr. Griswold, to supervise the site while he was away. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 94; Doc. 141, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97] Mr. Way sent \"specific instructions about the scope and timing of work at the Gold King Mine\" to Mr. Griswold and employees of ER, Weston Solutions, and DRMS. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 95; Doc. 141-1, \u00b6 97]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Without alleging that they were instructed to do so by Mr. Griswold, Plaintiffs allege that the crew at the Gold King Mine did not follow the work plan or the instructions given by Mr. Way in his email. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 97; accord. Doc. 141-1, \u00b6 98] The\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   do not allege that Mr. Griswold gave any instructions, let alone the substance of the instructions. Thus, it is impossible to determine whether Mr. Griswold gave \"reasonably precise\" instructions to the crew.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 97] Instead, New Mexico points to several inconsistent reports, by various parties, concerning the cause of the Gold King Mine spill. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6\u00b6 102-110] One peer reviewer stated that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   actual cause of failure was some combination of issues related to EPA internal communications, administrative authorities, and/or a break in the decision path.

Despite EPA's repeated admissions of responsibility, EPA has not been forthcoming with information about the circumstances leading to the spill and its documentation of those efforts. EPA has also ignored congressional requests and subpoenas for documents and information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 106; accord Doc. 141-1, \u00b6\u00b6 130-131]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   contain no allegations as to whether Mr. Griswold gave any directions to the crew working at the Gold King Mine, let alone the substance of such direction (if any). Accordingly, the Court cannot determine that Mr. Griswold gave reasonably precise directions. Thus, at this stage in the proceedings, the Court cannot determine that the government contractor defense protects ER. However, the\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   allow an inference that Mr. Way gave reasonably precise instructions, and, arguably, that the work plan contained reasonably precise instructions. However, without either allegations that Mr. Griswold gave no instructions or allegations that Mr. Griswold gave instructions and the substance of those instructions, the Court cannot, on the face of the complaints, determine whether the EPA gave reasonably precise instructions to ER.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     ER's Compliance with EPA's Procedures\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Further, for the government contractor defense to apply, the Court must be able to conclude that ER followed EPA's reasonably precise instructions. If, for the sake of analysis, the Court were to assume that Mr. Griswold gave no instructions to ER, the Court cannot conclude that ER followed EPA's instructions. Plaintiffs allege that the crew at the Gold King Mine site \"substantially deviated from Mr. Way's written instructions, as well as the June 11 work plan.\" [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 97; accord. Doc. 141-1, \u00b6 98] Such deviations included digging without a pump, hose, stinger, sump or sump pump to treat discharged water. [Doc. 86-1, \u00b6 97; Doc. 141-1, \u00b6 98] Alternatively, if the Court were to assume that the EPA, through Mr. Griswold, approved reasonably precise clean-up procedures, the\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   contain no allegations that ER followed Mr. Griswold's instructions. Thus, looking only at the\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   , the Court cannot determine that ER followed EPA's reasonably precise instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Whether ER Revealed Dangers to the EPA\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Finally, for the Court to conclude that the government contractor defense applies, the\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   would have to plainly establish that ER revealed to EPA any dangers regarding the cleanup activity unknown to EPA. However, the\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   contain no allegations which would allow the Court to make such a determination. The\n   <em>\n    Proposed Amended Complaints\n   </em>\n   simply do not speak to this element of the government contractor defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Summary\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   In conclusion, ER has not established that its actions fall within the scope of action displaced by federal law, as enunciated by\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   and reformulated to the context of environmental response actions in\n   <em>\n    Gadsden I\n   </em>\n   . The facts alleged in the proposed amended complaints to do not plainly demonstrate that \"(1) EPA approved reasonably precise clean-up procedures,\" that \"(2) [ER] followed those procedures,\" or that (3) ER \"revealed to EPA any dangers regarding the cleanup activity unknown to EPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Gadsden I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365759\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/1218/#p1227\">\n    111 F.Supp.3d at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, ER has not persuaded the Court that it is plainly entitled to application of the government contractor defense based on the allegations in the proposed amended complaints.

Thus, the lack of a permit for the August 5, 2015 release does not alter the conclusion that the CWA preempts application of New Mexico law to a discharge with a point source in Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   New Mexico also argues that it is \"unclear if\n   <em>\n    Ouellette\n   </em>\n   's holding applies to sovereign entities such as New Mexico.\" [Doc. 58, p. 24 n.18] However, as discussed above, in both\n   <em>\n    Ouellette\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Arkansas\n   </em>\n   the Court recounted the historical development of the rule that federal law (first federal common law and later federal statutes) preempts state common law with regard to interstate water-related disputes.\n   <em>\n    Ouellette,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218766\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/481/#p487\">\n    479 U.S. at 487-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218766\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/481/#p487\">\n    107 S.Ct. 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Arkansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221218\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/91/#p110\">\n    503 U.S. at 98-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221218\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/91/#p110\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, it is well established that such preemption applies to states as well as individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   New Mexico next argues: \"As the CWA's savings clause applies on its face only to 'state actions,' it is unclear whether the limited holding in\n   <em>\n    Ouellette\n   </em>\n   extends to issues of apportionment of liability, as ER contends.\" [Doc. 58, p. 24 n.18] Finally, New Mexico argues that \"given that liability under the CWA is joint and several, application of Colorado's comparative fault regime would arguably conflict with the Act's regulatory scheme, and thus thwart the objectives that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Ouellette\n   </em>\n   sought to avoid.\" [Doc. 58, p. 24 n.18] First, the Court notes that the actual language of the pertinent saving clause does not discuss \"state actions,\" but rather, preserves source state law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\"Nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief.\"). Second, New Mexico's arguments ignore the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Arkansas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ouellette\n   </em>\n   , that the \"Clean Water Act taken 'as a whole, its purposes and its history' pre-empted an action based on the law of the affected State and that the only state law applicable to an interstate discharge is 'the law of the State in which the point source is located.' \"\n   <em>\n    Arkansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221218\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/91/#p110\">\n    503 U.S. at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221218\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/91/#p110\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ouellette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218766\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/481/#p487\">\n    479 U.S. at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218766\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/481/#p487\">\n    107 S.Ct. 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, the source state law is not preempted-and that law includes both the causes of action available and the remedies available. Finally, regardless of whether the CWA applies joint and several liability and Colorado tort law applies comparative\n   fault, Congress intended for the Colorado state law to be preserved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   ER also moves to strike Navajo Nation's punitive damages claim for a reason distinct from the CWA. ER argues: \"Plaintiff's punitive damages claim ... should also be stricken because Colorado\n   <em>\n    prohibits\n   </em>\n   punitive damage claims in initial pleadings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-12-102\">\n    Colo.

Colo. 2007). Moreover, without any discussion or analysis, ER asks this Court to apply a Colorado state procedural rule in the federal District Court of New Mexico. The Court will not do so absent argument or analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   In sum, the Court grants ER's\n   <em>\n    Motions to Strike\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 32; Doc. 101] as to Plaintiffs' allegations of joint and several liability for their state tort law claims. The Court denies the ER's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Strike\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 101] as to Navajo Nation's punitive damages claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     G.

As to Plaintiffs' new allegations against ER, the Court does not find the allegations futile. And, as noted above, the Court already concluded that there is no prejudice to ER based on the date the motions for leave to amend were filed. [Doc. 118] The Court therefore concludes that the motions for leave to amend should be granted as to the new allegations relating to ER. The Court nonetheless continues to hold the\n   <em>\n    Motions for Leave to Amend\n   </em>\n   in abeyance pending decision on the remaining pending motions to dismiss.
