Unless otherwise stated, the following are the undisputed facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This action arises from Sloan's employment with Repacorp.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   doc. 1. Repacorp is a company that manufactures labels for other companies and uses heavy machinery for the printing of such labels. Doc. 25 at PageID 245-46. Sloan worked for Repacorp from March 7, 2007 until February 28, 2014. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 74. The parties have different perspectives at to why Sloan's employment ended; Sloan contends he was fired (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 84), whereas Repacorp contends that Sloan abandoned his job (doc. 23-1 at PageID 53-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Throughout his employment with Repacorp, Sloan worked as a production manager. Doc. 25-1 at PageID 269. In that role, Sloan worked with, and around, Repacorp's heavy machinery, which included presses and rewinders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 274.

Sloan himself stated that the work environment at Repacorp was dangerous, especially if one does not have his or her \"head in the game.\" Doc. 24-1 at PageID 78. In fact, Sloan testified that, \"[i]f you're not careful, those presses will kill you.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because of the dangerous work environment at the Repacorp facility, Repacorp maintains an employee handbook that requires all employees to notify management if they are taking nonprescription or prescription medication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 25-1 at PageID 277, 286.

Doc. 24-1 at PageID 70. Between 2006,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the year prior to his\n   hiring, and the time of his termination in 2014, Sloan took prescription medication to cope with his neck and back pain. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 70-74, 80-81. Beginning in approximately June or July 2013, Sloan started taking prescription morphine medication. Doc. 25-1 at PageID 273. Specifically, Sloan was then prescribed 30 mg of time-released morphine, and 15 mg of instant release morphine he took twice a day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Without dispute, Sloan did not tell his supervisors at Repacorp that he was taking prescription morphine until the day of his termination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 273-74;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 24-1 at PageID 79.

In November 2013, Sloan disclosed to a co-worker that, during work hours, he had \"just cut 1 of [his] [m]orphine time release pills so [he could] get the medicine into [his] system faster.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sloan admits that \"cutting\" his morphine pill was not in accordance with his doctor's prescription and that such conduct could be viewed as an abuse of the prescribed medication. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to taking prescription morphine, Sloan also admitted to taking non-prescribed Vicodin, an opiate pain medication, on at least two occasions at work.\n   <em>\n    See infra.\n   </em>\n   In 2013, Sloan received a non-prescribed Vicodin pill from a co-worker and took it during work hours. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 80, 113-15. In February 2014, Sloan also disclosed in an email to a co-worker that he took one of his mother's Vicodin pills for which he had no prescription. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 80-81. On February 10, 2014, an employee allegedly told Sloan's immediate supervisor, Gary Parrott,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Sloan requested a Vicodin from the employee a few weeks earlier-an accusation Sloan disputes. Doc. 25-4 at PageID 409.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon hearing the allegation that Sloan solicited Vicodin from a co-worker, Parrott informed Repacorp's President, Tony Heinl, about the employee's alleged statement. Heinl immediately removed Sloan from the manufacturing floor and sent him for a drug test that same day,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , February 10, 2014. Doc. 25-2 at PageID 363. Sloan voluntarily submitted to the drug test,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was positive for hydrocodone,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the opiate found in Vicodin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 25-5 at PageID 411;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 24-1 at PageID 80, 83. While Sloan denies having asked his co-worker for Vicodin, he admits he otherwise took non-prescribed Vicodin that led to his positive drug test, and does not challenge the positive drug test result. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sloan was not immediately terminated for testing positive for non-prescription Vicodin\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, when asked why, Heinl testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [B]ecause I'm too damn nice. That's the reason. I should have said no, but I was trying to keep, let him keep his job because we had invested a lot of time in [Sloan] and [Sloan] ha[d] invested a lot of time in the company, so I tried to work with him as much as I could[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Doc. 25-1 at PageID 293. Repacorp referred Sloan to its Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") on February 17, 2014. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 83-84, 110; doc. 25-1 at PageID 270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Upon referral, Sloan's EAP coordinator requested that he provide certain information from his physician, namely: whether he was permitted to work as a production manager as a result of his medical condition; whether there were any limitations on his ability to work after receiving treatment for his condition; a list of his current medications; and whether the medications prescribed impact Sloan's ability to concentrate on the job. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 110. On that same day (February 17, 2014), Repacorp placed Sloan on paid leave pending receipt of information from his physician.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 25-1 at PageID 282. On February 20, 2014, Sloan's pain management physician, Suresh Gupta, M.D., faxed a document to the fax number provided by Sloan's EAP coordinator stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   This letter is regarding Robert [Sloan] working as production manager on MS Contin, MSIR, and Relafen. He is able to work full time without any restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Doc. 28-1 at PageID 439. Repacorp contends that it did not receive this information from Dr. Gupta until March 19, 2014,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , nearly three weeks after Sloan's employment ended. Doc. 25-8 at PageID 414.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   From the beginning of his leave on February 17, 2014 until his termination less than two weeks later on February 28, 2014, Sloan remained in constant contact with Repacorp, specifically Heinl.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 23-1 at PageID 53.

Heinl-who states that he was already concerned that Sloan had taken non-prescribed Vicodin because of the potential danger it caused to Sloan and other employees in the dangerous work environment at Repacorp-allegedly became further concerned upon learning that Sloan was also taking morphine. Doc. 23-1 at PageID 53. According to Heinl, because Sloan was taking prescription morphine and \"popping other drugs that he doesn't have a prescription for[,]\" he could no longer \"trust [Sloan] to not do it again and ... put the company at [risk for] a huge liability.\" Doc. 25-1 at PageID 292.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Heinl asked Sloan to consult with his doctor to determine if there were any alternative medications or treatment for his pain condition that did not include opiates. Doc. 23-1 at PageID 53, 55;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 25-1 at PageID 283-84, 290. According to Heinl, \"I guess what I was hoping to see is some doctor saying that they'll take full liability to put him on the floor taking Vicodin, popping Vicodin without a prescription, and taking [m]orphine.\" Doc. 23-1 at PageID 55. From Sloan's perspective, he felt that Heinl was only concerned with the fact that he was taking prescription morphine, and that Heinl had no concern with the fact that he also took non-prescribed\n   Vicodin. Doc. 25-1 at PageID 273, 275.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sloan, in response to Heinl's request, attempted to contact Dr. Gupta, but he was unable to speak with him. Doc. 24-1 at PageID 84. Without having directly consulted with Dr. Gupta, and after considering his situation, Sloan determined that he needed \"to stay on my medication\" and told Heinl that he \"wouldn't stop taking it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on such fact, it appears undisputed that Sloan failed to cooperate with Heinl's reasonable request for additional information concerning Sloan's alleged disability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513459\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Sloan, Heinl responded by saying that, \"We don't have any positions here at Repacorp that you can do if you're taking [m]orphine.\" Doc. 24-1 at PageID 84. Heinl testified that he \"tried to work with [Sloan] and ... was expecting some cooperation from him, but I got zero in regards to checking with his doctor.\" Doc. 23-1 at PageID 55.

No such evidence has been produced by Sloan in response to Repacorp's properly supported summary judgment motion.
