The search warrant application sought electronic communications and records related to a defendant's Google email accounts, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 2703(b)(1)(A), and 2703(c)(1)(A) of the SCA. The warrant sought to require Google to disclose all responsive information, regardless of whether it is \"stored, held or maintained inside or outside of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon review of the search warrant and accompanying documents, the Magistrate Judge found probable cause to issue the warrant. This Court, reviewing the warrant request and supporting affidavit, also finds probable cause exists. Before signing, the Magistrate Judge inquired as to why an Addendum, which had heretofore been submitted with other similar applications, was not attached.

The referenced Addendum would have the practical effect of preserving the information sought and, most likely, would set up a focused briefing of the issue.

Applications for warrants under the SCA are made with great frequency, as email communications replace regular mail. In many cases, simply waiting for a decision from a pending Supreme Court case is prudent. The issue in this case implicates numerous other investigations, many of which are no doubt time sensitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The SCA was enacted as Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (\"ECPA\").

In interpreting the SCA, the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Microsoft I\n   </em>\n   reversed the district court's denial of Microsoft Corporation's motion to quash a warrant issued under the SCA, which directed Microsoft to produce the contents of an email account that it maintained for a customer. A United States Magistrate Judge had issued a warrant on the Government's application, having found probable cause to believe that the account was being used in furtherance of narcotics trafficking. The warrant was then served on Microsoft at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft ascertained that, to comply fully with the warrant, it would need to access customer content that it stored in Ireland. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Microsoft I\n   </em>\n   that the Government was not entitled to the seizure of responsive records or communications because the information was stored abroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States petitioned the Second Circuit for a rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Microsoft II.\n   </em>\n   The entire Second Circuit split evenly on the request, which left the panel decision intact.\n   <em>\n    Microsoft II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276725\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/53/\">\n    855 F.3d at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jacobs, J., dissenting).

The panel majority held that the physical location of a server containing a customer's emails determines whether an SCA warrant seeking the disclosure of those emails is an extraterritorial application of the SCA. However, electronic data storage is more complex and haphazard than the panel majority's holding assumes. Many service providers regularly \"store different pieces of information for a single customer account in various datacenters at the same time, and routinely move data around based on their own internal business practices.\" Still other providers are unable to determine \"where particular data is stored or whether it is stored outside the United States.\" Consequently, in an effort to apply the panel majority's confected holding to the technological realities of electronic data storage, major service providers are adopting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276725\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/53/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judge Cabranes offers two examples of the \"baleful consequences\" of following\n   <em>\n    Microsoft I\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Google will now disclose \"only those portions of customer accounts stored in the United States at the moment the warrant is served.\" Google's policy is particularly troubling because \"the only [Google] employees who can access the entirety of a customer's account, including those portions momentarily stored overseas, are located in the United States.\" As a result, law enforcement might never be able obtain data stored in Google servers abroad, even with the help of [a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Yahoo! has advised law enforcement that it \"will not even preserve data located outside the United States in response to a [s]ection 2703 request.\" This policy, as the government points out in its\n   <em>\n    En Banc\n   </em>\n   Petition, creates \"a risk that data will be moved or deleted before the United States can seek assistance from\n   a foreign jurisdiction, much less actually serve a warrant and secure the data.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, reading the SCA to prohibit the disclosure of foreign-stored data would undermine an important tool for law enforcement and introduce arbitrariness to the statutory scheme. Google's network automatically moves some of its users' data-including emails that contain attachments, and the attachments themselves-around the world, at various times, depending on the workings of a computer algorithm aimed at creating network efficiency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Search of Information Associated with [Redacted]@gmail.com That Is Stored at Premises Controlled by Google, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202480752\">\n    2017 WL 2480752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268526\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/708/\">\n    232 F.Supp.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712-14 (E.D.

The operation of Google's network shines a light on\n   <em>\n    Microsoft I\n   </em>\n   's flawed rationale, which focuses on the geographic location of data instead of the act of production in the United States. Google's compliance with a \u00a7 2703 warrant requiring it to produce information stored in the United States-but not information stored abroad-would depend on the happenstance of where the data is located at the precise moment when the warrant is served or the provider accesses its network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Premises Controlled by Google, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202480752\">\n    2017 WL 2480752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2.

Or that the recipient of the warrant here-Microsoft-would itself manage over one million server computers, located in over forty countries, used by over one billion customers? Such developments in electronic communications could not have been anticipated at the time of the statute's adoption. Indeed, the task of applying statutes and rules from many years ago to unanticipated advances in technology has been undertaken in other contexts with much difficulty.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Yet, if a bank in Columbus, Ohio held copies of records, the originals of which were in Ireland, no one would seriously contend that the copies in Columbus were beyond the reach of a federal warrant. Emails of an American citizen stored by an American corporation located within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States are no different.
