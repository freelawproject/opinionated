(\"Phase 2\"), and Defendant CWP West Corp. t/a Mister Car Wash (\"Mister\"), alleging that a previous corporation, Maritime Autowash, Inc. (\"Maritime\"), subjected a class of Hispanic employees to a hostile work environment and that both Defendants are liable. Both Defendants have moved to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Phase 2 Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 15; Mister Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 23). The EEOC has responded in opposition to both motions (ECF Nos. 19, 25) and both Defendants have replied (ECF Nos. 22, 41).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, both motions are ripe for review. No hearing is necessary to resolve either matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). The Court construes both motions as, in part, motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and as, in part, motions for summary judgment under Rule 56. For the reasons stated below the Court will deny Defendants' motions in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     The Charging Parties' employment, complaints of discrimination, and termination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Maritime was a Maryland corporation that maintained two car washes, including one in Edgewater, Maryland. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, ECF No. 5; Decl. Elmer Escalante \u00b6 5, ECF No. 19-1.) A number of Hispanic employees worked at the Maritime facility in Edgewater, including Elmer Escalante, Godofredo Esquivel Platero, Luis Serrano, Jose Luis Dominguez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gabriel Espinoza, Saul Herrera, Santos Villacorta, Eddy Cervantes, and Merced Espinosa Diaz (\"the Charging Parties\"). (Decls., ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nos. 19-1 through 19-9.) The Charging Parties were subjected to harassment and discrimination while working at Maritime. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Charges of Discrimination, Decl. Rosemarie Rhodes Attachment C, ECF No. 19-10.) They were required to work longer hours with shorter breaks than their non-Hispanic counterparts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They were denied proper equipment for their jobs and paid less than their non-Hispanic colleagues as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 23, 2013, agents from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") conducted an audit of Maritime. (Aff. David Podrog \u00b6 4, ECF No. 15-3.) On May 7, 2013, ICE informed Maritime that thirty-nine of its employees were not authorized to work in the United States, including the nine Charging Parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) ICE further informed Maritime that, unless the thirty-nine employees could provide valid identification and employment eligibility documentation, Maritime would suffer civil, and perhaps even criminal, penalties if it continued to employ them. (Notice of Suspect Documents 2, ECF No. 15-4.) According to the Charging Parties, after being informed of the employees' status, Maritime General Manager Kyle Decker \"held a meeting with the Hispanic employees and told [them] that he and Owner [David] Podrog had made a decision to give those employees without proper documentation $150 so that they could obtain new papers and be re-hired ... under new names.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   Escalante Decl. \u00b6 11; Decl. Godofredo Esquivel \u00b6 5, ECF No. 19-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After being rehired, on July 27, 2013 the Charging parties and other Hispanic employees complained to David Podrog and Kyle Decker about the mistreatment they had been suffering. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Escalante Decl. \u00b6 19; Decl. Luis Serrano \u00b6 10, ECF No. 19-3.) Decker \"indicated\" that the employees would only get a thirty minute lunch break that day, and if they did not report back to work at 1:00 pm, they would be fired. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Escalante Decl. \u00b6 19.) The Charging Parties and other Hispanic employees did not report back to work at 1:00 p.m., and Maritime fired them. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   Escalante Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; Esquivel Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) (According to David Podrog, Maritime only fired seven of the Charging Parties, as well as other employees identified by ICE, and only because they were unable to provide documentation proving that they were eligible to work. (Podrog Aff. \u00b6 12.) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     EEOC's investigation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 30, 2013 the Charging Parties submitted intake questionnaires to the EEOC. (Intake Questionnaires, Decl. Rosemarie Rhodes Attach. A, ECF No. 19-10.) On February 4, 2014, the Charging Parties signed formal Charges of Discrimination, and notice of these Charges was then sent to Maritime. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Escalante Charge of Discrimination, ECF No. 15-6 (signed February 4, 2014); Escalante Notice of Charge of Discrimination, Decl. Rosemarie Rhodes Attach. D, ECF No. 19-10 (dated February 25, 2014).) The Charging Parties began their employment at Maritime at different times, and thus their Charges of Discrimination allege different dates for the earliest date on which the alleged discrimination took place, but most of the Charges allege that the latest date on which discrimination took place was July 27, 2013-the date on which the Charging Parties were fired. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Escalante Charge of Discrimination; Dominguez Charge of Discrimination, ECF No. 15-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After receiving the questionnaires\n   and complaints from the Charging Parties, the EEOC began to investigate Maritime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the course of its investigation, the EEOC served Maritime with a subpoena, to which Maritime was not responsive. In 2015, the EEOC came to this court to enforce the subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Maritime Autowash, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. GLR-15-869,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013158495\">\n    2015 WL 13158495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. June 23, 2015). The EEOC, in its Application to Show Cause Why Administrative Subpoena Should Not Be Enforced, alleged that it was investigating unlawful practices arising out of Elmer Escalante's charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Maritime argued that because Escalante was not legally authorized to work in the United States, he could not seek relief under Title VII, and therefore the EEOC could not enforce its subpoena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A judge of this court, in a very brief opinion, agreed, and denied the EEOC's Application for an order to show cause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The EEOC appealed and on April 25, 2016, the Fourth Circuit reversed.\n   <em>\n    See EEOC v. Maritime Autowash, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255495\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/662/\">\n    820 F.3d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit's decision will be discussed in greater detail below, but essentially Judge Wilkinson, writing for the Court, explained that \"[n]othing [in Title VII] explicitly bars undocumented workers from filing complaints,\" and that because the EEOC only needed to show an \"arguable or plausible basis for its jurisdiction\" at this \"very early stage,\" the subpoena was enforceable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255495\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/662/\">\n    820 F.3d at 663-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court declined to specifically address the \"particular issue that Maritime press[ed]-whether and to what extent Title VII covers undocumented aliens,\" noting that it was a \"novel and complex problem.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255495\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/662/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255495\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/662/\">\n    at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' changes in ownership\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While the EEOC was working to enforce its investigatory powers, corporate changes were underway at Maritime. In 2014 Mister began the process of purchasing Maritime's assets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Casey Lindsay \u00b6 3, ECF No. 23-2.) Both parties, Maritime and Mister, entered into a letter of intent which specified a purchase price \"in excess of $15,000,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) After signing the letter, \"the parties commenced the due diligence process and began negotiating the terms of an asset purchase agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mister did much to protect itself from any potential liability that Maritime might incur. The purchase was \"intentionally structured as an asset acquisition to avoid assuming any existing liabilities of Maritime,\" (Lindsay Decl. \u00b6 7), and the asset purchase agreement (\"APA\") explicitly provided that, except for any liabilities incurred after the closing date, and any liabilities specifically assumed by Mister, the \"Buyer is not assuming or becoming liable for any liabilities of Seller.\" (APA \u00a7 1.3, ECF No. 23-5.) All liabilities that Mister expressly assumed were listed in a Schedule attached to the APA, and this Schedule made no mention of any employment discrimination liability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   APA Schedule 1.3.) Maritime and Mr. Podrog agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Mister \"from and against any damages [and] liabilities ... of any kind or nature whatsoever...arising out of ... any failure by [Maritime] to perform and fully discharge any of the Excluded Liabilities as set forth in this Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mister also explored Maritime's potential liabilities as part of its due diligence process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Sarah Ross \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, ECF No. 23-3.) Mister asked Maritime \"to disclose any and all pending lawsuits or claims by employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Maritime responded in October 2014, by \"forward[ing] position statements\" its counsel had prepared in response to the Charges of Discrimination that the Charging Parties had filed in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) In addition to these position statements, Maritime sent a letter from its counsel \"stating that Maritime Autowash had an Employment\n   Practices Liability Insurance policy with $1,000,000 in coverage and that [he] would be 'surprised' if the Claimants' damages would exceed $1,000,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Mister, it never received the actual Charges of Discrimination from Maritime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Mister requested from Maritime, and received, a census of Maritime's \"then current employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) This request presumably came after the letter of intent in later 2014, well over a year since the Charging Parties had been terminated by Maritime, and, as one would expect, \"[n]one of the due diligence documents provided by Maritime Autowash indicated that any of the nine [Charging Parties] were then current employees of Maritime Autowash.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Mister, Maritime never disclosed to Mister that the EEOC had sought a show cause order, the subject of which was later litigated in court (and discussed above). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) It is undisputed that the Charging Parties were never employed by Mister, and no employees have filed charges of discrimination naming Mister as a respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 21, 2015, the parties closed the referenced deal, and Mister took ownership of Maritime's assets, including the Edgewater facility that had employed the Charging Parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   APA.) Even after its due diligence, Mister did not negotiate for a lower price, and paid over $15 million, \"the largest amount Mister Car Wash had ever paid for two stores in the history of the company.\" (Mister Mot. Summ. J. Mem. Supp. 6, ECF No. 23-1; Decl. Lindsay \u00b6 8.) As to branding, by the terms of the APA Mister had only purchased a limited license to use Maritime's trademark for twelve months after the closing date (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   APA \u00a7 1.2), and Mister set about transitioning away from Maritime's public facing marketing materials, such as its signage and social media. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ross Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) Mister did not change Maritime's website for several months after the sale, and continued to use Maritime's social media. (Rhodes Decl. \u00b6 5 and Attachs. B &amp; C.) But by October of 2015, Mister was no longer using Maritime's website or social media. (Ross Decl. \u00b6 11.) As a result of an \"unrelated trademark infringement claim over the name 'Mister Car Wash' \" the outdoor signage continued to show \"Maritime Autowash,\" but that has since been converted as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mister also made considerable internal changes, such as capital improvements worth roughly $600,000, changes to the car washing process in order to make the experience consistent with Mister's other facilities, and personnel changes. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 21-24.) Mister offered employment to all of Maritime's employees (not including the Charging Parties, who were not employees of Maritime at the time of the acquisition), but required all of the employees to provide valid documentation showing they were authorized to work in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.) Mister was only able to hire 31% of Maritime's employees (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18), but still, as of June 2015, almost half of Mister's workforce were former Maritime employees (Rhodes Decl. \u00b6 5). Mister asserts that it had to hire many new \"production-level employees\" (those who physically clean the cars), and due to the inexperience of these new employees Mister had to \"suspend its high-revenue detailing services at both stores, resulting in a significant decrease in the profits of each store.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) In other words, according to Mister, as a result of the differences between Maritime and Mister, it had to spend over $600,000 and lost revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To complicate matters further, after Maritime sold its Maryland car wash facilities, it too experienced some corporate change. On March 13, 2015, Phase 2 Investments (\"Phase 2\") was incorporated in Florida. (Podrog Aff. \u00b6 3.) David Podrog, who was President of Maritime, is also the\n   President of Phase 2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Subsequently, Maritime Autowash, as well as a third corporation of which Mr. Podrog was President, Maritime Autowash II, merged into Phase 2. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3; Mister Mot. Summ. J. Mem. Supp. at 2 n.3.) Under Florida law, when two corporations merge into a third corporation, the surviving corporation (here, Phase 2) \"shall thenceforth be responsible and liable for all liabilities and obligations of each corporation party to the merger.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20607.1106\">\n    Fla.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter of Determination, ECF No. 41-3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Letter, the EEOC stated that it had \"determined that Respondent Maritime violated Title VII by discriminating against [the] Charging Parties and Hispanics as a class with regard to harassment, intimidation, unequal terms and conditions of employment, lower wages, denial of promotional opportunities, disparate discipline and discharge because of their national origin (Hispanic) and in retaliation for engaging in protected activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The EEOC also found that \"Respondent Mister Car Wash is as [sic] a successor in interest for Title VII purposes,\" and invited both parties to engage in informal conciliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) On June 14, 2017, the EEOC determined that conciliation had failed and notified the Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. 6, ECF No. 40.) It then filed the instant action on August 28, 2017, and thereafter amended its complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1; Am. Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The EEOC's amended complaint alleged that Hispanic employees at Maritime were \"relegated\" to lower paid positions, denied overtime, and denied their fair share of tips. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; 42-43.) It alleged that Maritime would require the Charging Parties to perform additional tasks that it did not request of its non-Hispanic employees, such as cleaning the \"car tunnel and machinery, powerwash[ing] the property, perform[ing] landscaping duties,\" and performing tasks at Maritime's manager's homes, all without additional compensation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48-49.) Furthermore, the EEOC alleged that Maritime treated the Charging Parties and other Hispanic employees differently at work, forcing them to eat outside, \"drink unfiltered water, and utilize an unlocked unisex bathroom which needed repair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) It alleged that Maritime would not let them take full lunch breaks or take other work breaks, and that Maritime did not provide them with access to the indoor facilities or proper equipment to perform their work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.) The complaint described verbal harassment as well, alleging that Managers at Maritime would swear at the Charging Parties, \"bark[ ] commands to them,\" and threaten to fire them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Phase 2 filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or for summary judgment on October 27, 2017 (ECF No. 15) and Mister filed a motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or for summary judgment on November 27, 2017 (ECF No. 23). The EEOC also moved for attorney's fees under Rule 4(d)(2) after effecting alternative\n   service on Phase 2, and moved to strike certain portions of Mister's reply in support of its motion to dismiss. Those motions have been disposed of in an earlier order. (ECF No. 39.) The EEOC has responded to both Phase 2 and Mister's motions to dismiss and both Defendants have replied. These motions are therefore ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Nature of the motions and their standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The motions submitted by Defendants are captioned as motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (and, for Mister's motion, Rule 12(b)(1) ) or \"in the alternative\" for summary judgment. As both Defendants make challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court considers each of Defendants' motions in part under Rule 12(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neal v.

When, however, \"the movant expressly captions its motion 'in the alternative' as one for summary judgment, and submits matters outside the pleadings for the court's consideration, the parties are deemed to be on notice that conversion under Rule 12(d) may occur; the court 'does not have an obligation to notify parties of the obvious.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pevia v.

So it is hard to see how a court could have jurisdiction over a Title VII claim against a defendant only after finding that, based on a variety of factors, the equities favor holding that defendant liable for the acts of its predecessor. To do so would seem to put the cart before the horse. But to apply successor liability to Title VII and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   read the doctrine as providing a jurisdictional exception would also be to endorse an odd conclusion: successor corporations could be held liable for the actions of their predecessors, but courts would almost never have jurisdiction over these claims (because employees and the EEOC would rarely, if ever, name a potential successor corporation in their charges of discrimination). Or, the rule would be that after a successor corporation purchases a predecessor, the charging parties (or the EEOC) must refile additional charges of discrimination against that successor. Such a rule would prejudice plaintiffs who may not learn of a successor until after the statute of limitations has run, and at the very least would create unnecessary additional paperwork.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

There is, in effect, a preliminary question of \"successor jurisdiction,\" as well as a more substantive question of \"successor liability.\" This first question does not require the Court to engage in a balancing of equities to make a determination. Rather, the question is whether jurisdictional requirements were met as against the predecessor corporation, and then whether the successor corporation had notice of the charge and an opportunity to voluntarily comply with the law. Put differently: A federal court has jurisdiction over a Title VII claim against a defendant-employer who was not named in an administrative charge of discrimination when the theory of liability rests on the actions of a different employer who\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   named in the charge of discrimination, and the defendant-employer had notice of the charge and an opportunity to voluntarily comply prior to the plaintiff bringing the claim in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, Mister may not have been named in the charges of discrimination, but it has been given ample notice of these charges prior to the initiation of\n   this lawsuit, and was given an opportunity to conciliate.

But here it is thin enough. The Charging Parties allege that they were discriminated against as a class for being \"Hispanic.\" The term \"Hispanic\" does not describe a nation.

Furthermore, to the extent that there are allegations in the complaint that go beyond the behavior in the charging documents, those allegations could reasonably have grown out of an investigation conducted by the\n   EEOC. Many of the allegations that Phase 2 contends were not properly exhausted are simply more specific statements of the allegations in the charges. For example:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-69\"><strong>Charge</strong> <strong>Complaint</strong> Alleged that the Charging Parties were Alleges that the Charging Parties were required \"subjected to unequal terms and conditions of to \"eat outside ... drink unfiltered water, and employment.\" utilize an unlocked unisex bathroom.\" Alleged that the Charging Parties were forced Alleges that the Charging Parties were denied to work \"longer hours with shorter breaks, and overtime and full tips and forced to perform paid less wages.\" additional duties without compensation. Alleged that the Charging Parties were \"not Alleges that \"Defendants provided higher [given] proper equipment.\" quality collared shirts and warm jackets to the non-Hispanic employees,\" and \"when [the Charging Parties were] cleaning the tunnel or the 12,000 gallon underground recycling tanks ...

In these, and other, instances the EEOC's complaint simply puts meat on the bones of the allegations put forth by the Charging Parties in their charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   What exactly the EEOC uncovered during its years-long investigation is not dispositive in this case. The issue here is one of notice: the charging documents must contain enough material that the Defendant would have been able to comprehend the accusation, investigate on its own, and either root out the problem or come to the conciliation table with eyes wide open. For example, in\n   <em>\n    General Electric\n   </em>\n   , two male charging parties alleged racial discrimination, and accused the defendant of discriminating via a biased testing procedure.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10590281\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/532/359/#p366\">\n    532 F.2d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, the charging document had sufficient information that the defendant could have investigated the alleged bad practice and reasonably uncovered what was afoot. Such is the case here. The charging documents contain enough information to have provided Maritime with a blueprint, and the EEOC's later construction of a claim was faithful enough to that blueprint that the Court will not dismiss any claims on the ground that they were not exhausted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Both Defendants additionally argue that any claims by a \"class\" of Hispanic employees are not exhausted because, beyond the Charging Parties, no members of this class filed charges of discrimination. This argument is without merit.

A charge is necessary for the EEOC to begin its investigative process.

The Court will first discuss Mister's successor liability, then both Defendants' arguments regarding the statute of limitations, and finally the impact of the Charging Parties' immigration status on this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Successor Liability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In addition to making the argument that the Court does not have jurisdiction over the claims against Mister because Mister never \"employed\" the Charging Parties, Mister has also made the substantive argument that it should not be treated as a successor for liability purposes under Title VII. Although the Fourth Circuit has not addressed successor liability under Title VII at all (either in the context of a \"jurisdictional exception\" or as an alternative basis for liability), the Court is on better traveled ground here as many other courts have addressed what factors should be considered in determining whether a successor corporation should be liable under Title VII for the actions of its predecessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   To begin, successor liability under Title VII is a matter of federal common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

Successor liability here is an equitable doctrine, borrowing from other statutory contexts, but addressing a particular problem of employment discrimination: \"Failure to hold a successor employer liable for the discriminatory practices of its predecessor could emasculate the relief provisions of Title VII by leaving the discriminatee without a remedy or with an incomplete remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/#p1093\">\n    503 F.2d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, the Court was concerned with whether the Defendant had notice of the charges prior to the EEOC bringing its complaint in this Court, and thus whether the Defendant had the benefit of the notice and conciliation requirements that undergird Title VII's exhaustion requirement. Now the Court considers whether Mister had notice of these charges\n   <em>\n    prior to purchasing Maritime's assets.\n   </em>\n   Such notice can be actual or constructive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lipscomb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20691605\">\n    2011 WL 691605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.

Supp. at 28 (noting that Mister asked Maritime to \"disclose any and all pending lawsuits and claims by employees,\" and that Maritime \"provided position statements earlier prepared by its counsel responding to EEOC charges\").) It is admittedly unclear of the extent of that notice-i.e. what exactly Mister knew about the EEOC charges and the status of that investigation prior to purchasing Maritime-but it knew that Maritime was facing potential employment discrimination liability. At the very least, Maritime had constructive notice. In\n   <em>\n    Lipscomb\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant had\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   notice of the charge.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20691605\">\n    2011 WL 691605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Nevertheless, the court noted that \"[w]ith some due diligence, [the] [d]efendant would have been able to ascertain that [the] [p]laintiff had filed an EEOC charge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20691605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mister seems to be a fairly sophisticated consumer in this situation, and could have acted upon the red flags thrown up by Maritime's counsel. Courts look to notice in this context to protect innocent purchasers that were themselves blindsided, not to reward purchasers that choose to enter deals blindly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To be fair, Mister does not so much argue that it entered this deal blindly, but\n   rather stresses the lengths it went through to protect itself from any liability Maritime might incur. Unfortunately for Mister, its evidence and argument demonstrating due diligence, careful contracting, and ironclad indemnification does not move the Court in the direction it had hoped. First, the APA is an agreement between Mister and Maritime. Should the EEOC prevail on liability in this case, and Mister suffer economic hardship as a result, then it may well look to the APA to seek recourse against Maritime (or Phase 2, or Mr. Podrog), but that does not help Mister\n   <em>\n    vis \u00e0 vis\n   </em>\n   the EEOC. Second, the lengths to which Mister went to protect itself from liability, such as structuring the sale as an asset purchase, inquiring into Maritime's liabilities, listing the assumed liabilities in a schedule, and including an indemnification clause, actually demonstrate the fairness of holding Mister liable as a successor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Musikiwamba v.

To be sure, Mister has changed much at the Edgewater facility since its purchase, and the EEOC makes too much out of Mister's temporary use of Maritime's marketing materials during the transition. The Court is satisfied for these purposes that the transaction between Maritime and Mister was not a sham, entered into on paper only to escape liability-the legal equivalent of a new coat of paint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ecurie Alford, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20389433\">\n    1993 WL 389433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (finding a successor company liable when \"[o]nly the\n   form [was] different.

Making all factual inferences in the Plaintiff's favor, these questionnaires satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Holowecki\n   </em>\n   standard: they contain, at least, a \"written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties, and to describe generally the action or practices complained of,\" 29 C.F.R. 1601.12(b), and they request that the agency take remedial action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holowecki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675573\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/389/#p402\">\n    552 U.S. at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675573\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/389/#p402\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205836917\">\n    2015 WL 5836917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding that an EEOC intake questionnaire \"serve[d] as a charge for the purpose of establishing the limitations period because it satisfie[d] EEOC regulations and the additional\n   <em>\n    Holowecki\n   </em>\n   requirement.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because charges were filed on July 30, 2013, all conduct that occurred after October\n   3, 2012 (300 days prior) is within the filing period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Second, the continuing violation doctrine clearly applies to this case. The EEOC's complaint asserts, at bottom, one cause of action under Title VII: a hostile work environment. Although the EEOC labels Count I \"Hostile Work Environment\" and Count II \"Inferior Economic Terms and Conditions of Employment,\" both counts allege that the same conduct violated the same statutory provisions. Thus, the Court will look past the formal (and hollow) statement of two claims and view the EEOC's complaint as alleging a single count of hostile work environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hostile work environment is a single \"unlawful employment practice\" that can be comprised of a number of different actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n    536 U.S. at 116-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any of those actions constitutes part of the \"unlawful employment practice,\" and therefore if any of those actions occurred within the filing period, then, generally speaking, all of the actions that constitute that unlawful practice can be considered for purposes of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The EEOC alleges that the Charging Parties were subjected to a hostile work environment comprised of actions that occurred \"[s]ince at least April 1, 2006.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 34.) The Charging Parties were fired on July 27, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62;\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Escalante Decl. \u00b6 19.) Thus, some of the actions comprising the hostile work environment were alleged to have occurred between October 3, 2012, and July 27, 2013, which is within the filing period. The EEOC's hostile work environment claim is therefore timely, and the Court can consider actions that contributed to the hostile work environment but occurred prior to October 3, 2012, under the continuing violation doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   There is one final issue with regard to the statute of limitations: consideration of \"discrete acts.\" Both Defendants correctly note that the continuing violation doctrine does not permit a plaintiff to rehabilitate claims of discrete acts of discrimination simply by alleging that they were part of a \"hostile work environment.\" As the\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   Court noted: \"discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts\n   alleged in timely filed charges. Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n    536 U.S. at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What precisely delineates a \"discrete\" act from a single act that nonetheless is part of an ongoing hostile work environment can be difficult to discern. But \"[d]iscrete acts such as termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire are easy to identify.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n    at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p116\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court has further identified denial of overtime as a discrete act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camacho v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 13-cv-1303-JKB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202772314\">\n    2014 WL 2772314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D. Md. June 17, 2014). A \"discrete act,\" however, can still comprise part of a hostile work environment claim, so long as it falls within the filing period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guessous v. Fairview Property Invs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336129\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/208/#p221\">\n    828 F.3d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221-22 (4th Cir. 2016). Thus, when a plaintiff brings a hostile work environment claim, that claim is timely if any of the acts, discrete or otherwise, occurred within the filing period, but the court can reach back and include only acts that occurred prior to the filing period if those acts are not \"discrete.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The EEOC alleges that the Charging Parties were subjected to a number of discrete actions. However, the nature and posture of this case make this fact largely inconsequential, even if the parties expend a number of pages discussing it. The EEOC alleges that the acts constituting the hostile work environment, including the discrete acts, occurred since April 2006, and therefore occurred during the filing period. Accordingly, the Court finds that all of the acts alleged can be considered as part of the EEOC's timely hostile work environment claim. It is worth noting here that, despite the already lengthy history of this case, with a trip to the Fourth Circuit, a years-long investigation, multiple corporate transfers, and a sizeable memorandum and order already issued by this Court, this case nevertheless remains in relative infancy. Formal discovery has not yet begun. On the limited record before the Court, and granting all inferences in the Plaintiff's favor, then, the Court finds that instances of all the alleged actions occurred within the filing period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later, discovery and a different standard of review (and factfinder) may overcome that finding. But, given that finding, appropriately made at this early stage, the Court has no trouble determining that the alleged timely acts-including denial of overtime and tips, being forced to perform additional duties without pay, being forced to eat outside and use a separate toilet, being sworn at and threatened with termination (to name a few)-if proven at trial, would be sufficiently severe and pervasive so as to constitute a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Title VII and Undocumented Aliens\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, the Court will address the elephant in the room; this is the issue that \"Maritime presse[d]\" two years ago before the Fourth Circuit, and that Phase 2 hangs its hat on here: must this case be dismissed if the Charging Parties were undocumented aliens?\n   <em>\n    See Maritime Autowash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255495\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/662/\">\n    820 F.3d at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as the Fourth Circuit did in 2016, this Court will \"begin by emphasizing what [it] need\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   address in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255495\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/662/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255495\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/662/\">\n    at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether or not undocumented aliens can bring Title VII suits is not before the Court. Phase 2 argues throughout its papers that undocumented aliens do not have a cause of action\n   under Title VII, but that is not exactly the issue. Even if the Charging Parties themselves did not have a cause of action, that does not necessarily mean that these claims brought by the EEOC should be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Restaurant Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4122302\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/490/1039/\">\n    490 F.Supp.2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1046 n.1 (D. Minn. 2007) (\n   <em>\n    Restaurant II\n   </em>\n   ) (finding, in a similar case, that \"even if the Court were to conclude that [the undocumented alien plaintiff-intervenor] lack[ed] standing to pursue her federal civil rights claims, there is no question that the EEOC could still pursue the claims\"). The question raised by Phase 2's argument, then, is more properly phrased thus: is discrimination against an undocumented alien an unlawful employment practice under Title VII? Despite seemingly contrary language in some Fourth Circuit cases, the Court answers that question in the affirmative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry v. Mobil Oil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857805\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/502/\">\n    186 F.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1999) ;\n   <em>\n    Egbuna v.

To explain why, the Court will begin, as it must, with the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 \"to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Griggs v. Duke Power Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/#p429\">\n    401 U.S. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429-30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/#p429\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/#p429\">\n    28 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). The act authorized suits against employers for discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion or sex. It did not restrict the class of persons who could bring such suits by citizenship or immigration status. The relevant statutory text remains unchanged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (defining,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"person\" and \"employee\" without reference to immigration status);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/#p429\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2000e-2 (setting forth what constitutes an unlawful employment practice without reference to immigration status).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Three things, however,\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   changed since Title VII was passed. First, the Supreme Court decided the seminal case of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    411 U.S. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    36 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). In that case, the Court set forth a prima facie case for a disparate treatment claim under Title VII, and in doing so enshrined the concept of an employee's \"qualification\" in the fabric of employment discrimination litigation. Quoting\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , the Court noted that \"Congress did not intend by Title VII ... to guarantee a job to every person regardless of qualifications.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    411 U.S. at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court went on to hold that a Title VII plaintiff can establish a prima facie case \"by showing (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied\n   <em>\n    and was qualified for\n   </em>\n   a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his\n   <em>\n    qualifications\n   </em>\n   , he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons\n   <em>\n    of complainant's qualifications.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). After\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   , if a person believed she had not been hired on account of her race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, but did not have direct evidence to support that belief, she had to show that she was qualified for the position in order to present a prima facie case under Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The second relevant occurrence between the passage of Title VII and today was that Congress, in 1986, passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, Pub. L. No. 99-603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Stat.%203559\">\n    100 Stat. 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"IRCA\").

In furtherance of that goal, IRCA made it illegal to employ aliens who were not authorized to work in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a. IRCA did not, at least explicitly, amend or impact in any way then-existing employment\n   discrimination statutes, such as Title VII. \"To the contrary, the legislative history explicitly cautions that IRCA should\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be interpreted as extinguishing an undocumented alien's rights under these statutes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   [T]he committee does not intend that any provision of this Act would limit the powers of State or Federal labor standards agencies such as the ...

Time-Life Libraries, Inc\n   </em>\n   . In that case, a Nigerian plaintiff who was unauthorized to work in the United States brought a suit against his former employer alleging that the employer had not rehired him because he had participated in an EEOC matter. In 1989, the plaintiff had started working for Time-Life Libraries Inc. (\"TLLI\") on the authority of a student work visa.\n   <em>\n    Egbuna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n    153 F.3d at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While working at TLLI, the plaintiff had corroborated the account of a coworker who had claimed that he had been sexually harassed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiff then changed his mind and reapplied for work at TLLI, though at that time he was unauthorized to work in the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Fourth Circuit noted that a Title VII plaintiff \"may seek equitable remedies from the courts for the discriminatory employment practices of an employer,\" remedies such as \"hiring of the applicant, reinstatement, back pay, and injunctions against further violations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Considering the history of Title VII, the import of an employee's \"qualifications,\" the purpose behind the law, and the facts behind\n   <em>\n    Egbuna\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry\n   </em>\n   , however, that conclusion strikes this Court as wrong. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Egbuna\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry\n   </em>\n   stand for a more specific, and obvious, proposition: that an undocumented alien alleging (at least) a discriminatory failure to hire cannot present a prima facie case under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   because IRCA makes that person legally unqualified for the position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   These cases do not preclude the EEOC from bringing this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they do not require its dismissal. That\n   <em>\n    Egbuna\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry's\n   </em>\n   holdings are so limited is demonstrated both by common sense and precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On the common sense front, a plaintiff's \"qualifications\" for a position do not appear in every Title VII prima facie case. Where, as here, the plaintiff alleges a hostile work environment, \"a plaintiff must show that there is (1) unwelcome conduct; (2) that is based on the plaintiff's [protected characteristic]; (3) which is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the plaintiff's conditions of employment and to create an abusive work environment; and (4) which is imputable to the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guessous\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336129\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/208/#p221\">\n    828 F.3d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in the original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether or not the plaintiff was \"qualified\" for the position is understandably missing from the essential elements of the claim. An employer is not entitled to harass an employee with, say, racial epithets and demeaning behavior on the ground that the employee was not very good at her job. The same logic suggests that an employer cannot harass an employee and escape Title VII liability because of the employee's immigration status. In fact, \"the immigration status of the plaintiff is usually not relevant to the issue of whether the employer discriminated against the plaintiff in violation of Title VII.\"\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

Much like the NLRA, there is nothing in the text of Title VII that precludes application to discrimination against undocumented aliens, and enforcement of the statute in that context does not necessarily undermine the Congressional policy evinced in IRCA. Beyond the persuasive logic of these cases, the Court notes that the NLRA and Title VII share much in common.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/#p1093\">\n    503 F.2d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying on NLRA cases in determining that successor liability applies to Title VII and noting that \"Title VII was molded, to a large degree, after the Labor Act\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Although the Fourth Circuit has not addressed this issue, and explicitly refused to reach its merits two years ago in this case, it expressed understandable reservations about the position advanced by Phase 2 here. \"The employer,\" the Fourth Circuit noted, \"is asking the court for carte blanche to both hire illegal immigrants and then unlawfully discriminate against those it unlawfully hired.

Punishing an employer for firing an undocumented alien in compliance with an order from ICE, or requiring reinstatement, would certainly create conflict between Title VII and IRCA, and would, as the Court in\n   <em>\n    Egbuna\n   </em>\n   noted, \"sanction the formation of a statutorily declared illegal relationship.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703758\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/184/\">\n    153 F.3d at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But so would the holding sought by Phase 2. Taking the EEOC's allegations as true but applying Phase 2's legal theory, Maritime received a sizeable benefit by hiring the Charging Parties-it was able to pay them less, make them work longer hours, and make them perform additional duties without compensation, all without violating Title VII. Even if Maritime was unaware of the Charging Parties' immigration status when it hired them, if the Court were to \"sanction the formation of [that] statutorily declared illegal relationship\" by shielding Maritime (and its successors) from Title VII scrutiny, other employers may well find an incentive to look the other way when potential employees are unable to provide proper documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Enforcing Title VII in this context does not, therefore, eviscerate IRCA.

Miller,\n    <em>\n     Federal Practice and Procedure\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1350 (3d ed.) ) (alterations omitted) (\"In most circumstances, a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment is an inappropriate method for challenging the district court's subject matter jurisdiction.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Mister argues that it is not a successor to Maritime for purposes of Title VII liability, but nowhere argues that successor liability does not apply to Title VII.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    It may be worth noting at this juncture that charges of discrimination were never technically filed against Phase 2, either. Only Maritime was named as a respondent in charges of discrimination in this case. Although Phase 2 does not challenge the Court's jurisdiction on this ground, the Court's reasoning as to why it has jurisdiction over the claims against Mister applies with equal force as to why the Court has jurisdiction over the claims against Phase 2-i.e. that liability is premised on Maritime's actions for which Phase 2 is responsible (under Florida statutory law, as opposed to Federal common law) and Phase 2 had sufficient notice and an opportunity to conciliate. It is also worth noting that the Court's holding does not require the EEOC (or an individual Title VII plaintiff) to literally send notice of a charge of discrimination to a successor defendant, as the EEOC did here. (There may be a case where a successor and predecessor are so similar that the Plaintiff can carry its burden of proving subject-matter jurisdiction by alleging that the successor had notice and an opportunity to conciliate by way of the predecessor. In fact,\n    <em>\n     MacMillan\n    </em>\n    seems to be such a case; it does not appear that the EEOC ever sent MacMillan notice of the charge of discrimination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/#p1093\">\n     503 F.2d at 1088-89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    In other words, the Charging Parties did not allege in their charges that Maritime's managerial staff singled them out for being from, say, Argentina, or El Salvador.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Court will briefly note that the Defendants' arguments regarding exhaustion were based on the scope of the Charging Parties' charges of discrimination, not the scope of the Letter of Determination. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Phase II Mot. Summ. J. Mem. Supp. at 15-18; Mister Mot. Summ. J. Mem. Supp. at 18-19.) Mister suggests that the Letter of Determination was deficient in some respects in its Reply, but does properly raise that argument. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mister Reply at 3; Mem. 17, ECF No. 40 (noting that Mister did not raise the argument that EEOC failed to conciliate claims but \"[t]hen, in [its] reply it appeared to argue for the first time that the EEOC failed to conciliate.\").) Regardless, the Letter of Determination is sufficient. It did not explicitly state that \"race\" discrimination was at issue, but for the reasons explained above that is not a troubling defect. Furthermore, it stated that the claims were on behalf of a class of aggrieved employees, and therefore the Defendants had an opportunity to conciliate such claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The fact that Mister did not lower its purchase price, while perhaps unfortunate for Mister in hindsight, is immaterial here. What matters is that Mister had the opportunity to negotiate for a lower price, and the sophistication to uncover the possible need to do so. After all, Mister did have the forethought and sophistication to indemnify itself against both Maritime and Mr. Podrog. (APA \u00a7 8.2.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Mister argues in its reply that this case is very similar to\n    <em>\n     Prince v. Kids Ark Learning Center, LLC\n    </em>\n    , in which the Eighth Circuit upheld a district court's decision finding that a successor was not liable even though it maintained the same business on the same facility with roughly the same staff.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787045\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/992/#p994\">\n     622 F.3d at 993-96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This case\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    similar to\n    <em>\n     Prince\n    </em>\n    , and the Court agrees with the Eighth Circuit that in that case \"several factors support[ed] the imposition of successor liability,\" including that the successor \"had notice of the discrimination charge,\" that the predecessor was \"unable to provide relief,\" that the successor \"operat[ed] in the same location,\" and that the successor had some of the same employees.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787045\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/992/#p994\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787045\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/992/#p994\">\n     at 995\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, the district court concluded that successor liability would not be equitable in that case because of circumstances that are not applicable here, and the Eighth Circuit ultimately concluded that given those circumstances the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787045\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/992/#p994\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787045\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/992/#p994\">\n     at 995-96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Phase 2 argues that because the Intake Questionnaires are significantly redacted, including portions describing the discriminatory conduct, \"we must assume that the EEOC is hiding critical information that refutes its argument.\" (Phase 2 Reply 7, ECF No. 22.) Given the posture of this motion, that is exactly wrong. The Court makes all inferences\n    <em>\n     in favor\n    </em>\n    of the Plaintiff, not against it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Scott v. Harris\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n     550 U.S. at 378\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1769\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Mister makes a similar analytical error. The Intake Questionnaires filled out by the Charging Parties are in Spanish, and the EEOC provided a blank intake questionnaire in English. Mister argues that because the Court has no translation of the actual Intake Questionnaires filled out by the Charging Parties, it has no evidence of what information those Questionnaires contain. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mister Reply 17-18, ECF No. 41.) Again, given the standard for reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court finds that, given the EEOC's provided translation, the Intake Questionnaires contain sufficient information to constitute a charge under\n    <em>\n     Holowecki\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The EEOC engages in some very curious pleading practices, changing a handful of words in Count II but otherwise alleging the same conduct. The only real difference between Count I and II is that in Count II the EEOC alleges that \"[t]he effect of the practices complained of above in Counts I and II has been to deprive [the] Charging Parties ... and a class of aggrieved Hispanic employees of equal employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status as employees because of race and national origin.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 82.) As best as the Court can tell, this is simply a conclusory and formulaic restatement of the third element of a hostile work environment claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Guessous v.

The parties were employed at some point during either filing period (October 2, 2013 to July 30, 2013 or April 10, 2013 to February 4, 2014), and the conduct allegedly occurred during their entire employment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    For example, the EEOC alleges that the Charging Parties and class of aggrieved employees were sworn at (a non-discrete act) and passed over for promotion (a discrete act) \"since April 2006.\" Making all inferences in the EEOC's favor, the Court finds that some of the Charging Parties and/or members of the class were sworn at and passed over for promotion during the filing period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    <em>\n     Egbuna\n    </em>\n    itself suggests that its scope is cabined to the hiring/firing context.
