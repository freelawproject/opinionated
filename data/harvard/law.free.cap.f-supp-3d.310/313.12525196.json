Almond's Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\") (ECF No. 113) recommending that the Court grant Defendants Cox Rhode Island Telecom, LLC's and CoxCom, LLC's (collectively, \"Cox\") Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 83) and deny Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 89). Plaintiffs timely objected to the R &amp; R (ECF No. 114) (\"Objection\"). After careful review of the R &amp; R, Plaintiffs' Objection, and the relevant papers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court ACCEPTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   the R &amp; R and adopts its recommendations and reasoning. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2 First, Plaintiffs argue that Magistrate Judge Almond contravened his duty to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs (as the nonmovants) in construing Cox's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Pls.' Mem. in Support of Obj. to R. &amp; R. (\"Pls.' Obj.\") 2.) Specifically, Plaintiffs posit that, \"the R &amp; R ignores all 265 of Plaintiffs' proffered undisputed facts-most of which are not disputed by Cox-and all but 8 of Plaintiffs' 104 disputed facts.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    Id. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiffs appear to suggest that, when reviewing Cox's Motion for Summary Judgment, in addition to considering Cox's Statement of Undisputed Facts and Plaintiffs' responsive Statement of Disputed Facts, the magistrate judge must also consider Plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Facts submitted in support of their cross-motion for summary judgment. ( See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) Plaintiffs' argument is a nonstarter. Magistrate Judge Almond, as he was required to do, considered the factual record attached to Cox's motion in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. ( See R. &amp; R. Part I.) In this context, the presence of cross-motions for summary judgment does not alter the applicable framework. Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc. ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9127352\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1/#p6\">\n    328 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (1st Cir. 2003). That is, \"the court must mull each motion separately, drawing inferences against each movant in turn.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9127352\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1/#p6\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing Blackie v. Maine ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"830\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/716/#p721\">\n    75 F.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (1st Cir. 1996) ). Magistrate Judge Almond appropriately viewed the factual record set forth by Cox's motion, composed of Cox's Statement of Undisputed Facts and Plaintiffs' responsive Statement of Disputed Facts, through which Plaintiffs conceded several facts by either not responding at all or not responding with sufficient substance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See DRI LR 56(a)(3) (\"[A]ny fact alleged in the movant's Statement of Undisputed Facts shall be deemed admitted unless expressly denied or otherwise controverted by a party objecting to the motion.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs posit that Magistrate Judge Almond \"[i]mproperly relie[d] on other cases involving telecommunications installers, which are based on different facts and assumes that because in those cases a particular indicia of control, standing alone, did not indicate a joint-employer relationship[,] no combination of those indicia could lead to a determination that a joint-employer relationship exists.\" (Pls.' Obj. 2.) This specific averment goes hand in hand with a larger theme that fills Plaintiffs' fifty-seven-page objection: a suggestion that Magistrate Judge Almond neglected to consider the totality of the circumstances. ( See, e.g. , id. at 9-13, 16-17, 55-56.) Contrary to Plaintiffs' characterization of the R &amp; R, Magistrate Judge Almond conducted what the Plaintiffs correctly recognize is required: a \"pragmatic, holistic, totality-of-the-circumstances, economic-reality approach for joint-employment ....\" (Pls.' Obj. 9-10.); see also Baystate Alternative Staffing, Inc. v. Herman ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11782253\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/668/#p675\">\n    163 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[T]o determine whether an employment relationship exists ... courts look ... to the 'economic reality' of the totality of the circumstances bearing on whether the putative\n   employee is economically dependent on the alleged employer.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   34 To break down Plaintiffs' argument, it is helpful to start with the basics. This is important because Plaintiffs' suggestion that Magistrate Judge Almond applied the incorrect standard is premised upon a fundamental misconception of what that standard is. To be certain, the applicable standard in this context dictates that, \"it is the totality of the circumstances, and not any one factor, which determines whether a worker is the employee of a particular alleged employer.\" Baystate ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11782253\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/668/#p675\">\n    163 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   676 ; accord Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158712\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/722/#p730\">\n    331 U.S. 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158712\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/722/#p730\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158712\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/722/#p730\">\n    91 L.Ed. 1772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1947) (\"[T]he determination of the [employer-employee] relationship does not depend on such isolated factors but rather upon the circumstances of the whole activity.\"). In other words, using the four-factor standard adopted in Baystate as a guide, the court must holistically consider the case's circumstances to decipher whether the \" 'economic reality' of the situation\" aligns with an employer/employee relationship.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11782253\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/668/#p675\">\n    163 F.3d at 675-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is precisely what Magistrate Judge Almond did. And his holistic analysis lead to the correct conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs' Objection to the R &amp; R reveals that Plaintiffs' problem is not the standard applied but the conclusion reached. This Court has the benefit of not writing on a blank canvas; many courts have considered nearly identical arguments in nearly identical factual circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See generally, e.g. , Crosby v.

Each of those courts, in considering the totality of the circumstances of substantially analogous facts, granted summary judgment for the defendant-cable company. Magistrate Judge Almond considered these decisions, where other federal district courts principally tested the facts and arguments against the same four-factor standard. And he correctly deemed them highly persuasive. Like Magistrate Judge Almond, this Court finds these cases highly persuasive, and Plaintiffs have not convincingly explained why the circumstances of this particular case are any different than the near-dozen cases in which summary judgment was granted on the issue of joint-employment on practically identical facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The best Plaintiffs can do is to exclusively rely on an outlier case, Perez v. Lantern Light Corp. , No. C12-01406 RSM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203451268\">\n    2015 WL 3451268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Wash. May 29, 2015). ( See, e.g. , Pls.' Obj. 13-19, 23, 28, 31, 40, 47.) Alas, the persuasiveness of this case\n   does not increase with the number of times Plaintiffs cite to it in their objection. Plaintiffs suggest that Magistrate Judge Almond, in refusing to follow this case's reasoning, \"[i]mproperly reject[ed] the most authoritative and factually apposite case ... merely because M + M's contract with Cox was not exclusive, even though M + M has never worked for another cable company and is totally economically dependent upon Cox ....\" (Pls.' Obj. 2.) But each fact that Plaintiffs attach significance to from Perez is present in abundance in the other cases in which summary judgment was granted, and-as Magistrate Judge Almond recognized-this case is factually distinguishable from Perez in more fundamental and material ways. ( See R. &amp; R. ---- n.2.); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) (\"As to materiality, the substantive law will identify which facts are material. Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\"). For instance, Plaintiffs pinpoint a \"laundry list of similar facts\" shared between the instant case and Perez , including, among other things, Cox requiring background checks, qualifications to install cable, collecting quality control data on installers, requiring uniforms, badges, and logos on vehicles, and providing payment on a \"piece rate.\" (Pls.' Obj. 15.) Just as these facts did not compel the conclusion that cable companies were joint employers in other, factually similar cases, they do not do so here. See, e.g. , Crosby ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201549552\">\n    2017 WL 1549552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"But simply requiring a background check has not been found sufficient to conclude that a communication company possesses authority to hire and fire.\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201549552\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\"[T]he purpose of identifying Cox on the technician's badge and vehicle is to ensure customer safety and the purpose of the surveys and quality control checks is to ensure satisfaction of Cox customers.

Despite Plaintiffs' attempt to minimize this fact, as Magistrate Judge Almond recognized, it matters that this case lacks the \"exclusivity language\" present in Perez .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203451268\">\n    2015 WL 3451268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (noting DirecTV \"Services Provider Agreement\" included \"exclusivity language\" that \"forbade [installation company] and its Installers from serving companies offering comparable programming or television services\"); cf. Crosby ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201549552\">\n    2017 WL 1549552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"Importantly, because the contract with Cox is not exclusive , [the installation company] is not precluded from obtaining other installation work ....\" (emphasis added) ). Here too, it is undisputed that the installation company, M + M, could have chosen to contract with other cable companies. ( Compare Pls.' Statement of Disputed Facts, ECF No. 88-2, with Cox's Statement of Undisputed Facts, ECF No. 84, \u00b6 17.) Like the many courts before it to consider-and reject-Plaintiffs' exact argument,\n   the Court is not persuaded that Cox is a joint employer of M + M simply because M + M chose to only perform work for Cox. ( See Pls.' Obj. 16); see also Thornton ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204794320\">\n    2014 WL 4794320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (granting summary judgment despite that cable company was installation company's only customer where \"the Agreement did not bar [installation company] from contracting with other cable or satellite installation companies\"); Zampos ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129127\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/970/794/\">\n    970 F.Supp.2d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"W &amp; E's apparent dependence on Comcast simply does not translate into functional control by Comcast over W &amp; E technicians.\"); Jacobson ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154497\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/683/\">\n    740 F.Supp.2d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Installation Companies work primarily, if not exclusively, for Comcast.

Cox argues that although these cases arise in other Districts, Cox operates similarly state to state, and the cases provide a framework this Court should follow. Cox also points out that, in addition to the cases involving Cox, there is a body of case law that has considered the joint employer liability of other telecommunications companies and ruled in favor of the telecommunications companies. In short, Cox is arguing that the Court should find that the facts demonstrate that it was not a joint employer of Plaintiffs because it \"had no direct control or supervision of any part of the employment of the technicians with only minimal quality and safety measures such as background checks, customer service surveys, identification badges, labeled vehicles, a contract between the installer and communication company establishing certain requirements for the performance of services, work initially distributed by the communication company but subject to redistribution by the installer without consent of the communication company, and an ability of the communication company to de-authorize a technician for poor quality work.\"\n   <em>\n    Gremillion v.

Plaintiffs make the argument that the \"total economic dependence\" of M + M on Cox \"colors all the other facts\" even though other Courts have found that a similar arrangement was merely \"consistent with a legitimate subcontracting relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154497\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/683/\">\n    740 F.Supp.2d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zampos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129127\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/970/794/\">\n    970 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   805 ) (stating that the \"apparent dependence\" of the installation company on the cable company \"does not translate into functional control\" by cable company over technicians). This Court declines to place paramount significance on the fact that M + M was established to conduct installations for Cox, because the First Circuit has never dictated that this factor takes precedence over the \"totality of the circumstances\" in the economic realities test and also because\n   it is clear that M + M was never required to work solely for Cox, but chose to operate in that manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Doc. No. 84 at \u00b6 17). The parties have extensively briefed the issues, and the Court has thoroughly reviewed the facts and arguments set forth. With the framework of the \"economic realities\" test and the guidance of Courts that have previously considered this issue, the Court undertakes its consideration of whether Cox is a joint employer of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Hiring and Firing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is undisputed that Cox has no authority to hire or fire M + M Technicians. While some of Cox's contractual requirements impact M + M's hiring practices, these specifications do not amount to direct or even indirect power over hiring and firing. For example, Cox requires that M + M maintain qualified and experienced personnel and that Technicians must pass a criminal background check and drug screening before Cox will permit them to enter a Cox customer home. These specifications amount to minimal quality controls and safety measures and do not indicate that Cox controls which applicants are hired or how many.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, there is no dispute that Plaintiffs submitted their applications to M + M and that Cox did not hire them, M + M did. Under similar circumstances, the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana recently found that Cox's lack of involvement in the hiring and firing process weighed against a finding of joint employment. That Court noted that \"[s]imply requiring a background check has not been found sufficient to conclude that a communication company possesses authority to hire and fire.\"\n   <em>\n    Gremillion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201321318\">\n    2017 WL 1321318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204794320\">\n    2014 WL 4794320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2, *14 (finding the communication company was not a joint employer where the Technicians applied and interviewed with the install company, although the communication company pre-approved Technicians and required background checks);\n   <em>\n    Jean-Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146263\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/838/111/#p137\">\n    838 F.Supp.2d at 123-124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the communication company was not a joint employer where the install company interviewed and hired Technicians, although the communication company required a background check).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Similarly, in other District Court cases, Plaintiff/Technicians have argued that Cox's ability to deauthorize a Technician equated to the ability to effectively fire Technicians. The Courts that have entertained such an argument have roundly rejected it. In\n   <em>\n    Gremillion\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Court noted that \"[a] technician de-authorized by Cox could be employed by [M + M] elsewhere or could perform duties that do not require entry into customers' homes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201321318\">\n    2017 WL 1321318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204794320\">\n    2014 WL 4794320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (finding no joint employer relationship although the communication company could de-authorize a technician);\n   <em>\n    Jean-Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146263\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/838/111/#p137\">\n    838 F.Supp.2d at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203451268\">\n    2015 WL 3451268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *17 (finding a joint employer relationship where the communication company could de-authorize a technician pursuant to an exclusive contract with the install company). As the\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   court explained, the ability to de-authorize a technician \"was to ensure customer safety and quality service\" and did \"not evidence a joint employer relationship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204794320\">\n    2014 WL 4794320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zampos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129127\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/970/794/\">\n    970 F.Supp.2d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To the extent [the communication company] plays a role in the hiring and firing process, it is only in the context of quality control, safety and security of [its] customers....\"). In short, the undisputed facts establish that it was M + M that was responsible for hiring and firing its Technicians and the specifications set forth by Cox amounted to minimal safety and quality measures. Accordingly, this factor weighs against finding a joint employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Supervision and Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is undisputed that Cox does not supervise or control the work schedules or conditions of employment of M + M Technicians. The method by which Cox's work orders are distributed to Cox changed in 2014, and currently Cox allocates work orders to Technician Numbers via a web-based automatic routing program called ETA. M + M can then reassign the work orders as it sees fit for efficiency and can do so without discussing with Cox or obtaining Cox's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Cox notes that \"numerous\" recent Federal Court decisions have noted that auto-routing computer programs that assign work to a technician number do not evidence control over a Plaintiff-installer's work schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (ECF Doc. No. 96 at p. 20) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valdez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201203726\">\n    2012 WL 1203726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3-4 ). Coupled with the testimony of Plaintiffs in which they admitted that they reported to M + M facilities each morning to receive their work orders from William Dowling and that he could modify work orders, Plaintiff's position that Cox exerted \"intensive, specific and micromanaging\" control of their work schedules is unsupported. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Doc. No. 96 at pp. 21-22) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' deposition testimony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs also broadly contend that Cox dictated the manner, method and mode by which M + M Technicians were to complete their work including \"the color of ground tags, the type of pen used to mark tags, providing product literature, and picking up trash at the work site.\" (ECF Doc. No. 88-1 at p. 16.) In its Reply, Cox argues that all of the examples set forth by Plaintiffs are evidence of \"safety and quality control, as opposed to the type of control employers display with employees.\" (ECF Doc. No. 96 at p. 2). This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Further, although Cox requires that M + M Technicians wear clothing and drive vehicles identifying them as Cox-approved, Cox argues this safety measure is to ensure that Cox customers know that the appropriate person is entering their home. Cox's random quality control checks and customer surveys result in feedback to M + M, not directly to the Technicians. The\n   <em>\n    Gremillion\n   </em>\n   Court joined several other courts in noting that \"even a high degree of supervision or control may not trigger a joint employer finding where the purpose of the control is to maintain customer safety, whereas this factor might indicate a joint employer relationship where the purpose of the control is day-to-day management.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201321318\">\n    2017 WL 1321318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6. Here, the undisputed facts show that the purpose of identifying Cox on the Technician's badge and vehicle is to ensure customer safety and the purpose of the surveys and quality\n   control checks is to ensure satisfaction of Cox customers. These examples do not amount to day to day supervision or control of an M + M Technician's schedule or working conditions. This factor also weighs against finding a joint employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   There is no dispute that Plaintiffs received paychecks and tax forms from M + M. It is also undisputed that Cox had no involvement in how M + M paid Plaintiffs or the amount, if any, that was deducted from their paychecks. Pursuant to the FSA, Cox paid M + M under a point-based system. Importantly, Cox did not dictate how M + M paid its Technicians. In\n   <em>\n    Zampos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129127\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/970/794/\">\n    970 F.Supp.2d at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court rejected the argument that Comcast controlled the rate and method of payment of technicians' pay by setting terms of pay to technicians' direct employer for services rendered. \"An employee's income, received from its direct employer, will always be 'determine[d] and influence[d]' by what a contractor decides to pay the direct employer for services rendered by the employee. To find that this arrangement places Comcast in control of Plaintiffs' wages would dramatically expand the FLSA to subsume traditional independent contractor relationships.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154497\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/683/\">\n    740 F.Supp.2d at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). The Court is persuaded to follow the reasoning of these cases and rejects Plaintiffs' assertions that this arrangement constitutes evidence of control over payment of M + M Technicians. (ECF Doc. No. 88-1 at pp. 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Employment Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is uncontested that the only records Cox maintains are related to the Technician Badges which include a Technician's name and identification number as well as any quality-control information. It is also uncontroverted that Plaintiffs submitted their time sheets to M + M and that M + M maintained records of the same. Plaintiffs argue that Cox maintained records of work order data including \"including customer satisfaction records,\" \"amount of points earned\" and similar data. (ECF Doc. No. 88-1 at p. 24.) Assuming this information to be accurate, it is precisely the type of information needed by Cox to make its payment to M + M, and also to ensure customer safety. Cox argues that the quality control reports, work orders and invoices do not constitute \"employment records\" in any event. (ECF Doc. No. 96 at p. 34.) Accordingly, this factor weighs against finding a joint employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion on FLSA Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The undisputed facts establish that Cox is not Plaintiffs' joint employer under the FLSA. As discussed herein, Cox's purported control over Plaintiff's hiring and firing, including the background check requirement, Cox's distribution of work orders through a computer system and its method for retrieving customer feedback reflect no more than a legitimate contractor relationship. I recommend that the District Court find that Cox is not Plaintiffs' joint employer under the FLSA, and that its \"involvement in hiring, firing, supervision, scheduling, and payment of technicians is minimal and indirect at best.\"\n   <em>\n    Gremillion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201321318\">\n    2017 WL 1321318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Conclusion on RIMWA Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It is undisputed that, \"Rhode Island law governing wages is similar to the FLSA.\"\n   <em>\n    Harbor Cruises LLC v. R.I. Dep't of Labor\n   </em>\n   , No. PC-05-5076,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204961656\">\n    2008 WL 4961656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. Super. Ct. Nov. 10, 2008). Accordingly, in their pleadings, both parties acknowledge that Plaintiffs' RIMWA claims \"should be analyzed under the same standard as the FLSA [claims].\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Doc. No. 100 at p. 5 n.3). Plaintiffs even point out that there was no need to separately address \"joint employment liability in the context of the RIMWA\" because the RIMWA mirrors the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204961656\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because I am recommending that the District Court GRANT Cox's Motion for Summary Judgment under the FLSA, I further recommend Cox's Motion be GRANTED as to the RIMWA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the reasons stated, I recommend that the District Court GRANT Cox's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF Doc.

Plaintiffs argue that\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    is most analogous to this case because the installation company in that case lacked a separate economic existence, just as Plaintiffs argue that M + M does in this case. Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, however, in\n    <em>\n     Perez,\n    </em>\n    the Installation Company was forbidden from \"serving companies offering comparable programming or television services\" via \"exclusivity language\" in the DirectTV contract.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6. \"Under the exclusivity agreement, Installers who did not get DirecTV work orders could perform no alternate installation work.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In the present case, the undisputed facts demonstrate that Cox did not dictate who M + M could perform work for, instead M + M made a business decision to work solely for Cox. Where a company is forbidden from conducting work outside of the parameters of its contract, its economic dependence is unquestionable. There is no dispute that the facts in this case are different because M + M is not subject to an exclusivity clause.
