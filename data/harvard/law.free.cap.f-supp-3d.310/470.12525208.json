(\"Kelly\"), on December 11, 2015, alleging various violations of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681a - 1681x.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 1.) On February 22, 2016, Kelly filed a motion to compel arbitration (Doc. No. 39), and J &amp; J filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and to compel arbitration or, in the alternative, stay all proceedings (Doc. No. 40). On March 3, 2016, the Court stayed the action pending disposition of both motions. (Doc. No. 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 7, 2016, the Court denied both Defendants' motions without prejudice as to their right to refile the motions after conducting arbitration-related discovery. (Doc. Nos. 61, 62, 63.) The Court then ordered arbitration-related discovery beginning on September 7, 2016 and lasting for sixty (60) days. (Doc. No. 62.) After the arbitration-related discovery period concluded and the parties notified the Court of their disagreement as to the results of the discovery (Doc. No. 70), J &amp; J filed the instant renewed motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss or, alternatively, to stay proceedings on January 30, 2017 (Doc. No. 74). Kelly also filed a renewed motion to compel arbitration on that date. (Doc. No. 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 6, 2017, the Court issued a Memorandum and Order granting Kelly's motion to compel arbitration. (Doc. Nos. 83, 84.) As to J &amp; J's motion, the Court ordered the parties \"to file additional briefing, specifically addressing the issue of the applicability of the theory of equitable estoppel to the motion in light of the Third Circuit's recently-issued precedential opinion in\n   <em>\n    White v.

No. 85), and Plaintiff filed a brief in opposition on December 4, 2017 (Doc. No. 86). On December 22, 2017, J &amp; J filed a reply brief. (Doc. No. 87.)

In effect, to determine whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate, a district court \"must initially decide whether the determination is made under Fed. R. Civ.

More specifically, J &amp; J maintains that equitable estoppel is warranted under\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    because: (1) there is a close relationship between J &amp; J and Kelly, and (2) there is a sufficient relationship between J &amp; J's alleged wrongs and its contractual obligations and duties. (Doc. No. 75 at 15-16.) As to the first requirement, J &amp; J states that it is closely related to Kelly, as the complaint alleges that J &amp; J \"operates more than 250 companies located in 60 countries, and that in order to provide these services, [J &amp; J] uses Kelly to provide some recruitment and hiring services.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Doc.

To that end, J &amp; J asserts that Plaintiff's claims \"indisputably arise out of his potential employment at Kelly\" because Plaintiff is alleging that, contrary to the FCRA provisions related to use of consumer reports in employment decisions, he was not provided with proper notice as part of his potential employment.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Lastly, J &amp; J asserts that \"the propriety of applying the equitable estoppel theory here is further bolstered by the significant extent to which Plaintiff accuses [J &amp; J] and Kelly of engaging in concerted misconduct,\" stating that \"Plaintiff's [c]omplaint describes virtually every factual allegation as one committed by '[J &amp; J] and Kelly' or by 'Defendants.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7) (quoting Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In its supplemental briefing on the relevance of the Third Circuit's opinion in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    , J &amp; J states that\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    \"does not affect the applicability of the equitable estoppel doctrine\" to this case because\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    \"endorsed the equitable estoppel doctrine, applying a similar test to that which [J &amp; J] has asked this [C]ourt to apply, but found it inapplicable to the facts presented in that case.\" (Doc. No. 85 at 2.) According to J &amp; J, the facts at play in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    are materially distinguishable from those in the instant case on three grounds. First, J &amp; J states that while the plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    brought suit against only the non-signatory (Sunoco), here, Plaintiff \"specifically brings his claims against both Kelly and [J &amp; J], relying on the identical set of alleged facts and Kelly's conduct to support his claims against [J &amp; J].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9.) Second, J &amp; J maintains that in contrast to\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    , where the court \"decline[d] to speculate as to whether White ha[d] some related grievance against [the signatory],\" Plaintiff has alleged that Kelly acted on J &amp; J's behalf and J &amp; J relied \"upon Kelly's use of the [d]isclosure [f]orm to obtain background reports.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) (first alteration in original). Third, according to J &amp; J, unlike the fact pattern in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    , \"where Citibank's narrow agreement was limited to disputes regarding the plaintiff's account or relationship with Citibank, here, Kelly's [b]inding [a]rbitration [a]greement covers all claims relating to Plaintiff's employment, which Plaintiff alleges was to be with [J &amp; J] through Kelly.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Plaintiff's Arguments Against Applying Equitable Estoppel and Compelling Arbitration\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In opposition, Plaintiff argues that J &amp; J has failed to demonstrate the applicability of equitable estoppel.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Doc. No. 77 at 10.) First, Plaintiff maintains that, under the two-pronged test enunciated in\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    , equitable estoppel would be inapposite because J &amp; J has not established that Plaintiff's claims against it are \"intertwined with the underlying contractual obligations,\" as \"Plaintiff's claims do not depend on Kelly's freestanding [a]rbitration [a]greement.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12.) Plaintiff refers to the complaint and states that the complaint does not mention the arbitration agreement, and maintains that because Plaintiff's claim against J &amp; J \"relies on\n    the fact that J &amp; J failed to send Plaintiff a pre-adverse action notice, copy of the consumer report procured from Yale, and a written description of Plaintiff's rights under the FCRA,\" any determination that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable \"would not affect Plaintiff's claims against J &amp; J (or Kelly) whatsoever.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12.) Second, Plaintiff argues that \"J &amp; J does not have a close relationship with Kelly\" for purposes of the relevant analysis employed by the Third Circuit, as \"[c]oncerted activity alone is not enough,\" and \"J &amp; J fails to cite [ ] a single case in which concerted activity, by itself, established the necessary close relationship.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16-17.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In his additional briefing on the applicability of equitable estoppel following\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiff asserts that \"two main approaches to equitable estoppel have emerged: a strict test and a range of somewhat more lenient tests,\" identifying \"the strict test\" as the aforementioned analysis discussed in\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Doc.

According to Plaintiff, \"[t]his test does not allow concerted misconduct among the defendants to substitute for either essential element of the test.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7.) Highlighting that the Court of Appeals in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    characterized the standard articulated in\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    as effectively the same as the governing analysis under Pennsylvania law, Plaintiff likens J &amp; J's motion to that which was denied by the district court in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    . (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9.) Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that \"[t]he reasons Sunoco's motion would have failed under Pennsylvania law are the same as why J &amp; J's equitable estoppel argument fails,\" as J &amp; J does not \"show any relationship whatsoever between the claims raised in Plaintiff's [c]omplaint and Kelly's freestanding arbitration agreement,\" and \"does not have the requisite close relationship with Kelly.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Plaintiff also disputes J &amp; J's interpretation of\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    on the basis that \"J &amp; J's claim that\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    endorses its concerted misconduct theory relies on a misinterpretation of\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    \" in that \"\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    applie[d] the more lenient approach to equitable estoppel only because it determined that this theory is viable under Florida and South Dakota law.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9-10.) However, Plaintiff adds, \"even if J &amp; J were correct that concerted misconduct has some relevance under Pennsylvania law ... J &amp; J openly concedes that it still must prove 'a close relationship' between the 'alleged wrongs' to the non-signatory's obligations and duties in the contract.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10.) According to Plaintiff, \"even under this somewhat more lenient standard advanced by J &amp; J, J &amp; J's argument still fails for the simple reason that J &amp; J alleges nothing but concerted misconduct.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Lastly, Plaintiff states that \"[i]f anything, Kelly's arbitration agreement\n    is narrower than that in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    , because it limits the covered claims to those 'that arise between me [Plaintiff] and Kelly Services, its related and affiliated companies, and/or any current or former employee of Kelly Services or any related or affiliated company.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11) (second alteration in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

First, the Court notes that the requirements for equitable estoppel, whether under Michigan law, Pennsylvania law, or the approach recognized by the Third Circuit in\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    , have not been satisfied. Even if the Court were to conclude that a close relationship exists between J &amp; J and Kelly for purposes of the relevant analysis, equitable estoppel would not apply because Plaintiff's claims against J &amp; J are not \"intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9467471\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/187/\">\n     269 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    199 (citing\n    <em>\n     Thomson-CSF\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414732\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/773/#p778\">\n     64 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    778 ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In the instant case, Plaintiff alleges that both J &amp; J and Kelly violated Section 1681b(b)(3)(A) of the FCRA by failing to provide him with the relevant consumer report before taking an adverse employment action against him. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.) However, notwithstanding the Court's previous conclusions as to the underlying employment agreement and arbitration agreement (Doc. No. 83 at 11), Plaintiff maintains a separate means of recovering against J &amp; J, which militates against applying equitable estoppel.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Devon Robotics\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204362822\">\n     2009 WL 4362822\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5 (\"The essential question ... is whether plaintiffs would have an independent right to recover against the non-signatory defendants even if the contract containing the arbitration clause were void.\");\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miron v.

Because Plaintiff seeks relief against J &amp; J under the FCRA, which requires a party using a consumer report for employment purposes to provide the report \"to the consumer to whom the report relates\" prior to taking any adverse action based on the report,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(b)(3)(A), Plaintiff's claim against J &amp; J does not rely on any underlying contractual agreement with Kelly as a basis for asserting its claim against J &amp; J.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Turkey Run Props.

Although the\n    Third Circuit in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    affirmed its acceptance of the theory of equitable estoppel, the Court of Appeals' analysis as to its applicability was governed by South Dakota and Florida law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275186\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/257/\">\n     870 F.3d at 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that \"both South Dakota and Florida courts would apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel\" and concluding that \"White cannot be forced to arbitrate under principles of equitable estoppel under either South Dakota or Florida law\"). As the Court of Appeals noted, those states' analyses include a determination of whether \"a plaintiff-signatory alleges concerted conduct on the part of both the non-signatory and another signatory,\" which differs from the framework recognized by the court in\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275186\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/257/\">\n     870 F.3d at 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9467471\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/187/\">\n     269 F.3d at 199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Further, this Court concludes that\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    did not change any aspect of\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    that is relevant to the case at bar.

Because J &amp; J's motion may be analyzed under either Michigan or Pennsylvania law, as explained\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , this Court's use of\n    <em>\n     DuPont\n    </em>\n    does not conflict with the Court of Appeals' analysis of equitable estoppel in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    .
