SLEET, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In two related patent-infringement actions, plaintiffs Genentech, Inc. and City of Hope (collectively, \"Genentech\") have asserted multiple counts against defendant Amgen Inc. (\"Amgen\") based on Amgen's plans to commercialize Mvasi\u2122, a biosimilar version of Genentech's Avastin \u00ae. During the parties' so-called patent dance, Amgen made a statement pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20262\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(3)(B) that it did not intend to begin commercial marketing of Mvasi\u2122 before December 18, 2018. Amgen later served notice that it would not commence commercial marketing before April 4, 2018, a date earlier than the one previously provided. Accordingly, Genentech seeks a declaratory judgment in both actions that Amgen cannot market Mvasi\u2122 before December 18, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-1407, D.I. 41 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-42 (count I); Civ. No. 17-1471, D.I. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 336-46 (count 30) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amgen has moved to dismiss these counts-which the court will refer to as the \"commercial marketing\" claim-for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1) respectively. (Civ. No. 17-1407 at D.I. 45; Civ. No. 17-1471 at D.I. 43). For the reasons stated below, the court finds that it currently lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Genentech's commercial marketing claim. Accordingly, Amgen's motion is granted, and Genentech's commercial marketing claim is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 4, 2017, the FDA accepted Amgen's Abbreviated Biologics License Application (\"aBLA\") for Mvasi\u2122, thereby\n   kicking off the \"patent dance\" prescribed by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (\"BPCIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20262\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ). (D.I. 41 \u00b6 2, 5). The patent dance is a carefully calibrated statutory scheme that requires the \"reference product sponsor\" (i.e., Genentech) and the \"applicant\" (i.e., Amgen) to disclose and exchange information in furtherance of \"preparing to adjudicate, and then adjudicating, claims of infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Sandoz, Inc. v.

At that point, Amgen had to make a choice under paragraph (3)(B): argue that the patents are \"invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the commercial marketing of [Mvasi\u2122],\" or make a \"statement that [it] does not intend to begin commercial marketing of [Mvasi\u2122] before the date that such patent expires.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20262\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 23, 2017, Amgen served its response. (D.I. 41 \u00b6 9). It challenged 19 of the 27 patents as \"invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed\" and declared that it does not intend to begin commercial marketing of Mvasi\u2122 before December 18, 2018, when all of the 8 remaining patents will have expired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Then, on October 6, 2017, Amgen provided notice under paragraph (8)(A) that it \"will commence commercial marketing of Mvasi\u2122 ... no earlier than 180 days from the date of this letter.\" (D.I. 41 at \u00b6 17; D.I. 47-1, Ex. A). In other words, Amgen provided notice that it would not commence commercial marketing before April 4, 2018, which is 8 months earlier than the December 18, 2018 date previously provided. Genentech's commercial marketing claim seeks to enforce Amgen's earlier representation that it would not launch Mvasi\u2122 until the later December date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Amgen argues that there is no cognizable legal theory that would grant Genentech the relief it seeks from the commercial marketing claim. (D.I. 46 at 12-13, D.I. 53 at 4-11). In the alternative, Amgen argues that if Genentech is relying on a quasi-contract theory, there is no binding representation, no breach of a binding of representation, and no detrimental reliance. (D.I. 46 at 13-16). Genentech responds that its commercial marketing claim is not based on a quasi-contract theory. (D.I. 53 at 10-11). Instead, the claim is based on a private right action arising under the BPCIA itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This is a novel legal theory not yet addressed by any court. More important, there is no need to delve into this unchartered territory at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For a court to exercise jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, there must be an \"actual controversy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Del. June 13, 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal &amp; Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359204\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/270/#p273\">\n    312 U.S. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359204\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/270/#p273\">\n    61 S.Ct. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359204\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/270/#p273\">\n    85 L.Ed. 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1941) ). It is unclear whether Amgen will actually launch Mvasi\u2122 before December 18, 2018. Genentech points to no evidence of an actual controversy other than the notice of commercial marketing. The 180 days in the commercial marketing notice expired on April 4, 2018, and there is no indication that Mvasi\u2122 has actually launched. The court recently heard from the parties at a scheduling conference. The parties are currently engaged in discovery and appear interested in cooperating. The court is left with the impression that the commercial marketing claim is not of \"sufficient immediacy\" to warrant the issuance of a novel declaratory judgment. If this claim ripens into an actual controversy, where Amgen launches Mvasi\u2122 before December 18, 2018, there will be an opportunity for Genentech to seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 54, Exs. 1-7). On a motion to dismiss, the court is confined to the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference, and items subject to judicial notice.\n    <em>\n     Szczuka v.
