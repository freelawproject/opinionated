Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both ORI and FRI sell, or seek to sell, glucomannan dietary supplements. According to both parties, glucomannan is a soluble-viscous fiber derived from the Konjac plant root. (JSUMF \u00b6 4; FACC \u00b6 24; ECF No. 345 at 2.) Glucomannan is used to manufacture fiber-based weight loss supplements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSUMF \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FACC \u00b6 24; FAC \u00b6 10.) Both parties also represent that numerous studies have shown that at least some types of glucomannan are effective for losing weight. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 5-7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FACC \u00b6 24; FAC \u00b6 10). One of the main disputes between the parties is whether different types, grades, places of origin, processing procedures, and/or characteristics, including viscosity, of the specific glucomannan products alter its effectiveness on weight loss. (ECF No. 339 at 7-11, 13-15; ECF No. 345 at 3-5, 6-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    b. ORI and Lipozene\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In 2002, Fiber Thin, LLC entered into an agreement with its contract manufacturer, Natural Alternatives, Inc. ('NAI'), to manufacture a fiber-based weight loss supplement also called FiberThin.\" (FACC \u00b6 1.) \"At the time of the 2002 agreement between Fiber Thin, LLC and NAI, NAI had an agreement to source all glucomannan from Shimizu [Chemical Corporation ('Shimizu') ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) According to ORI, in 2003, Fiber Thin, LLC's contractual rights to sell glucomannan were assigned to ORI, who eventually sold glucomannan as a supplement under the product names of \"Propolene\" and \"Lipozene.\" (ECF No. 345 at 4 (citing to Ex. 22\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ); JSUMF \u00b6 1.) For the Fiber Thin and Propolene products, ORI contracted with NAI to manufacture these products, and NAI sourced its glucomannan from Shimizu. (JSUMF \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In sum, ORI's former glucomannan products were branded as Fiber Thin and Propolene, sourcing glucomannan from Shimizu through NAI. Currently, ORI sells its glucomannan supplements branded as Lipozene, which is not manufactured with Shimizu's glucomannan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Relevant Clinical Testing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"In 2003, ORI and NAI agreed to jointly fund a clinical study [ (the \"Kaats Study\") ] and NAI hired Dr. Gilbert Kaats and his clinical research organization, Health &amp; Medical Research Foundation.\" (JSUMF \u00b6 5.) \"When comparing those in the placebo group to those in the treatment group Dr. Kaats found 'a highly significant reduction\n   in scale weight ... % body fat ... and fat mass ... without a loss of fat-free mass or bone density.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) \"The difference in mean weight lost was 4.93 pounds, and in fat lost was 3.86 pounds; thus, Dr. Kaats found that 78% of weight lost was attributable to fat.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) ORI's references in its Lipozene advertising to clinical findings of \"78% fat loss\" and its \"holiday study\" relate to the Kaats Study. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) \"The Kaats Study was neither developed nor paid for by either Shimizu or FRI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) An additional glucomannan study referenced by the parties is a 1984 study completed by Dr. David Walsh (the \"Walsh Study\"). (Ex. 118.) Yoshi Shimizu, the Chief Executive Officer of Shimizu, represents that Shimizu supplied the glucomannan studied in the Kaats Study (Propol KW) and Walsh Study (Propol A). (ECF No. 360-15 (\"Shimizu Opp. Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When advertising Lipozene, ORI makes several claims about its effectiveness and composition, and uses the Kaats Study to support some of these claims. (JSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 10-15.) For example, Lipozene's packaging advertises that it \"Helps Reduce Body Fat.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) More specifically, Lipozene's advertising references the Kaats Study as showing that seventy-eight percent of the weight lost while taking Lipozene was fat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exs. 2-4, 99\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (showing the difference in the mean weight lost was 4.93 of which 3.86 pounds were fat).) Lipozene also states in its commercials that the study's participants \"were asked not to change their diet or exercise.\" Lipozene also characterizes the study as \"major university double blind study.\" (JSUMF \u00b6 11.) Additionally, Lipozene's packaging stated that there are \"[n]o known allergens in this product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    d. FRI and Shimizu\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   FRI is a Nevada limited liability corporation that was formed on December 22, 2014. (JSUMF \u00b6 20.) Shimizu and FRI entered into a Distribution and Claims Assignment Agreement on February 21, 2015 (\"February 2015 Agreement\"). (Ex. 94.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Section I, titled \"Assignment of Legal Claims,\" the agreement states \"Shimizu hereby assigns to Fiber Research all rights title and interest it has to any legal claim related to the false advertising claims relying on Shimizu's studies for the products with improper Glucomannan ingredients against Obesity Research Group (Lipozene).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 I(a).) The assignment section also states that \"[t]his assignment of legal claims, which is incidental to the distribution rights under Section II [Assignment of Distribution Rights in the United States], shall have a term of Three (3) years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 I(d).) Section II, titled \"Assignment of Distribution Rights in the United States,\" states \"Shimizu hereby grants to Fiber Research the right to distribute its propriety Glucomannan product in the United States in retail, on the internet and to end users.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II(a).) Further, the agreement states \"[a]s to this Section II only, this assignment of distribution rights in the United States shall have a terms of Three (3) years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II(c).) This section also includes an exclusivity\n   provision that states \"Fiber Research agrees only to sell, handle or use only Shimizu provided Glucomannan powder, Konjac powder, Yam flour or any other Glucomannan product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II(d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shimizu and FRI subsequently amended the February 2015 Agreement, making changes to the scope and duration of the legal claims assignment provision. On August 18, 2017, Shimizu and FRI amended Section I(a) to state \"Shimizu hereby assigns to Fiber Research all rights title and interest it has to any legal claim related to violation of the Lahnam [sic] Act or similar law claim, false advertising, fraud, trademark, copyright, intentional interference, or any other similar claim, including, without limitation, relying on Shimizu's studies and any trademark claim, against Obesity Research Group (Lipozene).\" (Ex. 93 at 1.) To be effective February 1, 2017, the parties replaced Section I(d) with the following: \"\n   <em>\n    Permanent Assignment of Legal Claims\n   </em>\n   . The assignment of Legal Claims in Section I a. of the [February 2015] Agreement, as amended, shall be permanent and without limitation, unless agreed by the Parties in writing.\" (Ex. 95 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 10, 2015, FRI sent a letter to ORI's general counsel regarding Lipozene and its advertising. (Ex. 107.) The letter stated, among other things, that ORI's Lipozene contains \"adulterations,\" \"is not an equivalent glucomannan product,\" and \"has less viscosity [than Shimizu's products].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the letter, FRI also accused ORI of \"falsely and fraudulently market[ing] and promot[ing] Lipozene\u00ae using three clinical studies on pure, unadulterated glucomannan,\" taking the position that ORI's reliance on \"the glucomannan studies is not scientifically valid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter also contains accusations that ORI caused \"significant damages\" to FRI and that ORI \"[stole] ... research on the more expensive, pure product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And finally, FRI concluded its letter by stating that this \"commercial injury gives rise to a suit for a claim under the Lanham Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 16, 2015, ORI filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against FRI asking the Court to declare that ORI has no liability under either the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FFDCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1.) On April 13, 2015, FRI filed an Answer, in which it asserts the affirmative defense of unclean hands, and related counterclaims. (ECF No. 16.) FRI amended its counterclaims, and filed the FACC on May 28, 2015. (ECF No. 41.) The FACC alleges a violation of the Lanham Act (false advertising, unfair competition, and false designation in violation of section 1125(a)(1) ), a violation of California's unfair competition law (\"UCL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal.

Shimizu moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (ECF No. 207), and the Court granted Shimizu's motion. (ECF No. 335.)

The Court declines to address each objection, and will rather grant or deny an objection as needed for this order. Additionally, if addressed individually, the majority of ORI's objections would be dismissed as baseless because ORI misapplies the standard for evidence at summary judgment. ORI argues that the form of the evidence at summary judgment must be admissible at trial. That is squarely wrong.

First, the Court will analyze whether Shimizu's assignment of its legal claims is enforceable under Nevada law. Second, the Court will address whether Shimizu has a \"case or controversy\" and will discuss its previous order, which ORI argues determined that Shimizu lacked Article III standing. Lastly, the Court will address whether FRI lacks statutory standing under the Lanham Act to bring Shimizu's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Assignment of Shimizu's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   ORI challenges whether Shimizu's assignment of its legal claims to FRI was valid. ORI argues that Nevada law prohibits the assignment of tort and fraud legal claims. Additionally, ORI argues that, if legal claims were assigned, Shimizu assigned \"bare\" claims to FRI because the assignment was unaccompanied by an interest in Shimizu's underlying intellectual property. ORI further contends that if FRI did receive an interest, FRI received no more than a non-exclusive license. FRI objects to these characterizations of its agreement with Shimizu, and instead contends FRI was validly assigned Shimizu's legal claims along with an exclusive interest to sell Shimizu's products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that, through the February 2015 Agreement, Shimizu assigned FRI the legal claims asserted in this case.

Commercial Interest Conveyed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the purposes of this motion, the Court finds FRI held a non-exclusive license to distribute Shimizu in the United States when it filed its counterclaims. First, FRI and Shimizu's agreement is, by definition, not exclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining an \"exclusive right to sell\" as a \"right to sell a principal's products ... to the exclusion of all others, including the owner.\"). Mr. Shimizu's declaration states \"Shimizu negotiated an exclusive distribution agreement with FRI, in which we transferred distribution rights with the United States to Propol\u00ae ... (with the\n   <em>\n    exception of a few existing customers\n   </em>\n   ).\" (Shimizu Opp. Decl. \u00b6 22 (emphasis added).)

The only \"exclusive\" interest granted by the February 2015 Agreement belongs to Shimizu. (Ex. 94 \u00a7 II(c) (binding only FRI to distribute Shimizu's products exclusively and is silent as to Shimizu's obligations).) Second, the agreement amounts to a license because FRI received a shared right to use and sell Shimizu's product. Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining a \"nonexclusive license\" as a \"license of intellectual-property rights that gives the licensee a right to use, make, or sell the licensed item on a shared basis with the licensor and possibly other licensees\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

ORI argues that the Court made this determination in its Order. ORI skips several analytical steps. In its previous Order, the Court determined that \"ORI failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that it has standing to pursue a declaratory-judgment claim against Shimizu.\" (ECF No. 335 at 10.) Specifically, ORI \"fail[ed] to present facts, either alleged in the FAC or provided in evidence, that there is a 'substantial controversy' between itself and Shimizu 'of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This decision was based largely on the lack of evidence and allegations presented by ORI that Shimizu's claim was \" 'actual' or 'imminent.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"In fact, ORI wholly neglects an essential component of demonstrating standing in its opposition-immediacy.\").) Shimizu previously stated that it had no intention of bringing any legal claims against ORI on behalf of itself because Shimizu believed it had assigned its relevant legal rights to FRI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) ORI had failed to provide evidence or allegations that stated otherwise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Contrary to what ORI infers, this Court's Order included no determination regarding the \"claim\" Shimizu may have against ORI or the validity of the assignment agreement between Shimizu and FRI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 345 at 11 (arguing that \"the Court has already determined that,\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   Shimizu never assigned anything to FRI and instead maintained all claims, no case or controversy exists to adjudicate ORI's alleged false advertising.\") (emphasis in original).) ORI misinterprets the Court's previous reasoning. (ECF No. 335 at 7 (\"Even if the Court assumes, for the sake of argument, all of ORI's points as true, ORI ultimately fails to carry its burden of demonstrating that it has standing to pursue a declaratory-judgment action against Shimizu.\").) To be clear, the Court granted Shimizu's Motion to Dismiss in part because\n   <em>\n    ORI failed\n   </em>\n   to carry its burden of showing Article III standing existed. The Court rejects ORI's attempt to use the result of its earlier \"neglect\" to now dismiss claims against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Instead, for the first time, the Court analyzes whether FRI has Article III standing to bring Shimizu's claims, and finds that it does. The first prong of standing is satisfied because FRI provides support to show that Shimizu was injured in fact by losing opportunities to expand into the weight loss supplement market through its distributors and failing to realize gains from its research and development investments.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Lastly, while it is not a direct competitor with Lipozene, Shimizu also distributes glucomannan, which is the main ingredient in Lipozene, and supplies glucomannan to FRI, who seeks to compete with Lipozene in the glucomannan supplement market.

Falsity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   FRI argues that ORI makes six distinct false advertising statements: (1) the weight lost while taking Lipozene is \"78% fat\"; (2) Lipozene is \"clinically studied\"; (3) the clinical study results on Lipozene are from a \"major university study\"; (4) the test subjects in the Kaats Study were given a \"no lifestyle change\" instruction; (5) Lipozene is made of \"pure glucomannan\"; and (6) Lipozene has \"no known allergens.\" (ECF No. 339 at 17-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   These false advertising statements fall into two categories. The first four statements relate to the clinical studies at issue here: the Kaats Study and the Walsh Study. These claims either depend on whether the studies actually analyzed Lipozene (the first two statements) or depend on the specifics of the Kaats Study (the third and fourth statements). The last two statements relate to Lipozene's product composition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Whether the Studies Apply to Lipozene\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The crux of FRI's claim is that the Kaats and Walsh Studies did not analyze Lipozene, and thus ORI cannot use these studies to support its advertisements for Lipozene. FRI claims that, instead of\n   studying Lipozene, the Kaats and Walsh Studies evaluated Shimizu's Propol-branded glucomannan, which is a distinct, superior product. For example, FRI states that \"[o]nly Shimizu Propol glucomannan has been clinically proven to effect weight loss, while the non-Shimizu glucomannan in the studies on which Obesity Research relies have shown no effect.\" (ECF No. 339 at 2.) ORI disagrees and states that the Kaats Study (which ORI designed and sponsored) and related Walsh Study apply to Lipozene because Lipozene is same glucomannan supplement in those studies. Specifically for the Kaats Study, ORI represents that Lipozene is simply a rebranded and updated version of Fiber Thin, which Dr. Kaats used. (ECF No. 345 at 4.) Additionally, in creating the version of the product that Lipozene is today, ORI used the specifications from the Kaats Study as a guide and \"floor\" for the ingredients they ultimately chose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Thus, ORI argues that Lipozene is as effective, or more effective, than the specific earlier version of the product studied in the Kaats Study, as well as the Walsh Study. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In addressing these arguments, both FRI and ORI cite to various studies, deposition testimony, and expert reports. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 28 (Dr. Kaats deposition transcript) (\"Kaats Dep. Tr.\"); Ex. 31 (Wolever expert report); Ex. 45 (Brian Salerno deposition transcript); Exs. 71-78 (testing regarding Lipozene's product); Ex. 67 (testing on Shimizu Propol blend); Ex. 98 (Lerner expert report); Ex. 99 (Kaats Study); Exs. 27, 101-02 (Henny den Uijl deposition transcript); Exs. 26, 103 (Jim Ayres deposition transcript); Ex. 110-11 (John Alkire deposition transcript).) Each side highlight different aspects of the glucomannan root, including its production conditions, testing methods, and viscosity results. Additionally, the parties engage in various arguments regarding why their evidence should be accepted and the other side's discredited. These arguments are best saved for a jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Apple Computer Securities Litigation,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537213\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/1109/#p1116\">\n    886 F.2d 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1116 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing\n   <em>\n    Bieghler v.

It is clear to the Court that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the Kaats Study or the Walsh Study, or both, studied Lipozene under the parties' competing theories of what that statement means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Thus, the Court denies the parties' requests for summary judgment on the element of falsity of the \"78% fat lost\" claim and the \"clinically studied\" claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. \"Major University\" Study Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   ORI claims in its advertisements that the Kaats Study is a \"major university study.\" FRI argues that this claim is false because the Kaats Study was conducted by Dr. Kaats's then-private clinical research organization, Health and Medical Research Foundation, and is not considered a \"major university\" study. ORI disputes that this statement is false by arguing that the Kaats Study's design was approved by Texas Women's University and because two of the named reviewers of the Kaats Study are affiliated with two major universities-Georgetown University and the University of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Court finds that FRI meets its initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact that this claim is false. First, though the parties did not jointly submit to the Court that ORI is referencing the Kaats Study when it makes this claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties concede\n   this. (ECF No. 339 at 2; ECF No. 345 at 33). Second, FRI provides sufficient support to show that the Kaats Study was not a major university study, nor did it involve a major university. Dr. Kaats, the lead author of the study, stated in his deposition that he is not affiliated with a major university, that no university was involved in the measurements for the study, and that he does not consider the Kaats Study a university study. (ECF No. 339 at 19 (citing to Dr. Kaats's deposition testimony at 135:13-20, 330:23-332:12, and 364:4-366:14).) In fact, Dr. Kaats stated that he called ORI previously to tell ORI to stop referring to his study as a Georgetown University-sponsored study because \"it was not university sponsored.\" (Kaats Dep. Tr. at 330:23-332:12.) Additionally, nowhere in the Kaats Study does it reference the sponsorship or significant involvement of a major university. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Court now turns to the evidence ORI provides to show that its \"major university study\" claim is not false. Tellingly, nowhere in ORI's briefing does it argue that the Kaats Study is a \"major university study.\" At best, ORI now claims that the Kaats Study is a \"university-affiliated study\" and thus, because \"the Kaats Study was university-affiliated in multiple ways, the 'Major University Study' claim is not false.\" (ECF No. 345 at 33.) It follows that ORI's evidence is insufficient in showing a reasonable juror could find this to be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Even when construing the evidence in the light most favorable to ORI, ORI's evidence barely amounts to a mere existence of scintilla of evidence, if at all. ORI supports its argument by citing to the Kaats Study's design approval from Texas Women's University, as well as its tangential affiliations to Georgetown University and University of Texas. Without assessing whether Texas Women's University would qualify as a \"major university,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   ORI fails to provide any evidence to show that the involvement of an \"institutional review board\" (\"IRB\") transforms a study's sponsorship or affiliation into that of the IRB. Instead, the evidence shows that almost all studies require an IRB and that the IRB's \"primary purpose is [to] make sure the [study's] subject is being protected.\" (Kaats Dep. Tr. at 134:15-135:12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 345 at 33.) No evidence infers, let alone supports, that clinical studies take on the IRB's sponsorship or affiliations in every (or any) instance. Nor is there any evidence that this occurred in regards to the Kaats Study. Instead, the record is void of ORI, Texas Women's University, Dr. Kaats, or anyone else ever referring to or considering the Kaats Study as a Texas Women's University study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Additionally, ORI's argument that, because two of the reviewers-as individuals-are affiliated with Georgetown University and the University of Texas, the Kaats Study is a \"major university study\" is likewise unsupported. Nowhere does ORI cite to evidence showing that a reviewer's affiliation with a university allows the study to adopt that university's affiliation or sponsorship. In fact, the evidence disputes that as it relates to Georgetown University. (Kaats Dep. Tr. at 330:23-332:12; Ex. 59\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"I have addressed this\n   issue with the co-investigators.... Dr. Preuss at Georgetown (who is still unhappy about the references to a Georgetown University study).\"); Ex. 169 (Preuss Dep. Tr.) at 88:4-16.) Moreover, similar to Texas Women's University, the record is also void of any evidence showing that anyone referred to the Kaats Study as a University of Texas study. Lastly, ORI and NAI's independent agreement stating that they desired a \"university-affiliated\" study before hiring Dr. Kaats and his team does not show this term was actually met, especially by a \"major university.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court finds that FRI has demonstrated the absence of a genuine issue of material fact that ORI's \"major university\" claim is false, and is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court grants FRI summary judgment as to this falsity element of its Lanham Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. \"No Lifestyle Change\" Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   ORI advertises that, in the Kaats Study, the test subjects were \"asked not to change their lifestyle\" and \"asked not to change their diet or exercise.\" Specifically, for example, a 2014 Lipozene commercial stated, \"in a clinical study, people who took Lipozene lost weight, all while being\n   <em>\n    asked not to change their lifestyle.\n   </em>\n   That means they were\n   <em>\n    asked not to change their diet or exercise.\n   </em>\n   They were simply instructed to take Lipozene. And by just taking Lipozene, they lost weight.\" (ECF No. 345 at 34; Ex. 5 at 0:35-1:12 (emphasis added).) FRI argues that this statement is literally false because the test subjects were given no instruction-one way or another-as to their lifestyle, including diet and exercise. (ECF No. 339 at 2.) In other words, because the subjects were given no instruction on their lifestyle, any statement stating that subjects were \"asked\" to do anything at all, is literally false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Citing to the Kaats Study, FRI shows that participants were not given any instruction relating to their lifestyle, including their diet and exercise routines. (Ex. 99 at ORI 000617.) The \"Method\" section of the Kaats Study states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Subjects were instructed to take the supplement 30-minutes prior to each meal with a minimum of 8 ounces of water.\n   <em>\n    No instructions were provided to study participants with regard to diet and exercise\n   </em>\n   ; participants were free to follow, or not to follow, any diet and/or exercise program of their own choosing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) ). Additionally, in the \"Discussion\" section, the Kaats Study states: \"Since no diet/exercise recommendations were provided, participants were free to follow any diet/exercise plan of their own choosing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ORI 000632.) This section goes on to discuss the reasoning behind the specific choice to provide no lifestyle instructions. It debates how a participant in a weight loss study may be motivated to either follow \"a diet/exercise of their own choosing\" or \"make no alterations in diet and exercise relying, instead, on the supplement to achieve their weight loss goals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It reasons that \"either way\" the study shows the benefit of taking the supplement is not dependent on \"whether or not [the subject] participated in a diet/exercise plan of their own choosing.\" The relevant pieces of the Kaats Study make it clear that the study was aimed at testing the product in a \"real world\" experience and with little experimental intervention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ORI 000632-33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 345 at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   ORI agrees with this conclusion and does not provide any additional evidence beyond the Kaats Study. (ECF No. 345 at 34-35 (\"The goal (and result) was to evaluate the efficacy of the supplement\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   , without including a requirement that participants change their diet or exercise regimen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (emphasis in original).) ) Instead, ORI's counterargument focuses on attacking FRI for \"cherry-pick[ing] and re-characteriz[ing]\" ORI's advertisements and ignoring the \"overall thrust\" and \"significant basis\" of the \"no lifestyle change\" claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) But it seems that rather ORI is attempting to re-characterize its own advertisements. Confusingly, ORI concludes that \"[i]ndeed, because participants were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   asked to change their diet or exercise, the alleged 'no lifestyle change' is not false.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (emphasis in original).) In considering the entire context of the statement, the evidence shows that ORI sought to communicate to its consumers that, despite\n   <em>\n    being required\n   </em>\n   to make no changes to their diet and exercise routines, people taking Lipozene lost weight. (Ex. 5 (\"That means they were\n   <em>\n    asked not to change their diet or exercise.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added).) ) Thus, an essential piece to this claim is that participants in the Kaats Study were affirmatively asked not to change their diet and exercise, implying that any weight lost while taking Lipozene could not be due to a lifestyle change. However, this representation is false. The Kaats Study specifically wanted to evaluate weight loss in a \"free life,\" and was designed not to ask, recommend, or otherwise instruct its participants to continue their diet and exercise as usual. Instead, participants could change their diet or add an exercise routine if they wanted, which could have affected the weight they lost. ORI's statement implies the opposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Though a jury may still find that the difference between the true and false statements is not material, the Court finds that FRI is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that the \"no lifestyle change\" statement is false. The Court grants FRI summary judgment as to this falsity element of its Lanham Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. \"Pure Glucomannan\" Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   ORI first argues that this claim should be dismissed because the FACC does not contain allegations relating to this statement. However, the Court construes FRI's argument as a motion for leave to amend the FACC and grants FRI leave to amend. \"Where plaintiffs fail to raise a claim properly in their pleadings, if they raised it in their motion for summary judgment, they should be allowed to incorporate it by amendment under Fed.

FRI pled related claims of false statements involving Lipozene's product composition, and ORI included argument against this claim in its opposition. (ECF No. 345 at 35-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   For this false statement, FRI argues that ORI's claims on its website-\"Take pure Glucomannan from the finest Konjac Plants and see results\" and \"Lipozene is made with 100% pure Glucomannan, which comes from the root of the Konjac plant\"-are false because Lipozene is not made of \"pure glucomannan.\" (ECF No. 339 at 20; Ex. 17 at 1 (showing a snapshot of ORI's website from 2012).) FRI cites to evidence and testimony that shows that Lipozene is made of a combination of ingredients, with the majority being glucomannan. (ECF No. 339 at 20.) ORI disputes that ORI's statements convey that Lipozene is entirely made of \"pure glucomannan.\" Instead, it claims these statements only relate to the main ingredient in Lipozene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The Court finds that ORI has met its burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact that its claim relating to \"pure glucomannan\" is not false. The evidence shows that ORI does not advertise that Lipozene is made from only glucomannan as FRI contends. Rather, in considering the statement in its full context, ORI advertises a narrower set of claims that Lipozene \"is made with\" glucomannan and by taking Lipozene, a consumer \"takes\" glucomannan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17);\n   <em>\n    c.f. Pow\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wonderful LLC v.

Cal. July 17, 2008) (addressing false claims such as \"[e]ach bottle of Purely Juice is 100% Pomegranate Juice\"). The evidence also supports that the majority of Lipozene is made of glucomannan. (ECF No. 339 at 20 (stating that, at worst, \"Obesity Research's own testing demonstrates the finished product contains [over half of] Glucomannan\").) FRI fails to cite to any evidence that raises an alternative interpretation of ORI's statement in support of its argument. Additionally, though a statement that is literally true can still be actionable under the Lanham Act if it is misleading, FRI does not argue or provide evidence to support this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court finds that no reasonable juror could find that ORI was advertising that it was entirely made with glucomannan, and that its \"pure glucomannan\" statements are not false. Thus, the Court grants ORI's request for summary judgment on this element and FRI's Lanham Act claim as to the \"pure glucomannan\" statement fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    v. \"No Known Allergens\" Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The last advertising statement that FRI challenges is ORI's claim that Lipozene contains \"no known allergens.\" FRI states that this claim is false because Lipozene contains excessive sulfite levels. (ECF No. 339 at 6, 20.) FRI argues that these excessive sulfite levels qualify as a \"known allergen\" under FDA regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.100\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) ORI disputes this by stating that, under Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (\"FALCPA\"), excessive sulfites do not qualify as a \"major food allergen.\" (ECF No. 345 at 37.) Moreover, ORI states that Lipozene does not contain any of the ingredients actually listed under the FALCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20321\">\n    21 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing items such as milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Neither party has not met its burden to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the \"no known allergens\" statement is false or not. Though FRI provides sufficient evidence to show that Lipozene contains an excessive level\n   of sulfites per the FDA requirements, FRI has not shown that these FDA requirements should apply to ORI's statement. Likewise, ORI has not shown that only \"major food allergens\" under the FALCPA apply to advertising statements regarding \"known allergens.\" Instead, a genuine issue of material fact remains as to which standard or definition should apply to advertisements regarding what \"known allergens\" are contained in a dietary supplement. It is possible for a jury to find that this statement only applied to the commonly known major food allergies, such as nuts, milk, and other common allergies, or that it instead meant additional irritants, such as sulfites. Accordingly, the Court denies both parties' requests for summary judgment on this element of the Lanham Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Deception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   FRI seeks summary judgment as to the second element of its Lanham Act claim: that ORI's false statements \"actually deceived or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience.\"\n   <em>\n    Southland Sod Farms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638011\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1134/#p1139\">\n    108 F.3d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ORI does not address deception separately, and instead argues falsity and deception together, which is consistent with Ninth Circuit case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has found that \"[t]he expenditure by a competitor of substantial funds in an effort to deceive consumers and influence their purchasing decisions justifies the existence of a presumption that consumers are, in fact, being deceived.\" It further reasons that the party \"who has attempted to deceive should not complain when required to bear the burden of rebutting a presumption that he [or she] succeeded.\"\n   <em>\n    U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v.

The Court finds no reason not to extend this reasoning to the false statements here, nor has ORI rebutted this presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Court grants FRI summary judgment as to the deception element of its Lanham Act claim for the \"major university\" and \"no lifestyle change\" statements. Because falsity has not been established for the remaining Lanham Act claims, the Court denies FRI's request for summary judgment on this element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Next, FRI asks this Court to find that, as a matter of law, ORI's false advertising statements are material. (ECF No. 339 at 20-21 (\"Thus, the actual falsity of the statements challenged in this motion also establishes materiality.\") );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southland Sod Farms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638011\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1134/#p1139\">\n    108 F.3d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating the third element of a Lanham Act claims as the \"deception is material, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision\"). FRI argues that, if the Court finds that ORI's statements are false, then materiality is presumed. (ECF No. 339 at 20-21 (citing to\n   <em>\n    Pom Wonderful\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-2633 CA (JWJx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204222045\">\n    2008 WL 4222045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (C.D. Cal. July 17, 2008) (collecting cases).) ) ORI argues that FRI has not met its burden because FRI failed to cite to any supporting evidence and instead relies on \"presumptions\" to establish this element. (ECF No. 345 at 28 (\"[R]ather than providing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence reflecting FRI's injuries, materiality and causation, or consumer deceit, FRI instead argues that the Court may presume these elements are satisfied upon a finding of literal falsity.\" (emphasis in original) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Because FRI has not established falsity for the \"78% fat lost,\" \"clinically studied,\" and \"no known allergens\" statements, FRI's argument fails for these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   FRI has cited no other evidence to support its materiality arguments, and thus has not met its burden. Likewise, ORI does not establish that there is no genuine issue of material facts that these statements are not material. The Court denies the parties' requests for summary judgment on the materiality element for these three claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   For the two remaining statements (\"major university study\" and \"no lifestyle change\"), FRI argues that the Court should determine these statements are also material because \"actual false claims are presumed material\" under the Lanham Act. (ECF No. 339 at 20-21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pom Wonderful\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204222045\">\n    2008 WL 4222045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (citation omitted) ).)

(ECF No. 345 at 37-38 (citing Ex. 99) (arguing there is no effective difference between a statement suggesting study participants were asked not to change their lifestyle verses the study's instructions that participants were given no instructions on lifestyle).)

The Court disagrees. The \"no lifestyle change\" statement concerns one of the test conditions for the participants in the Kaats Study. This instruction is not \"inherent\" to the quality or characteristics of Lipozene in the same way as statements relating to Lipozene's product composition and proven effects on weight loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Lastly, even accepting that no presumption of falsity applies, FRI argues that the \"major university\" conducted study statement is likely to affect a consumer's purchasing decision. ORI does not specifically address the \"major university\" statement's materiality, and instead generally objects to FRI's lack of evidence to support materially. However, a \"major university\" affiliation invokes a level of legitimacy and assurance for a consumer that would likely affect a consumer's decision to purchase Lipozene. FRI cites to Dr. Kaats's deposition testimony stating that a study done by a university would cost around fifty percent more to commission. (Kaats Dep. Tr. at 366:17-367:1 (\"[O]ne of the ways that we stay in business, is the fact that we can get the same result in less time and in less money.\").) Additionally, ORI points specifically to its desire to have a \"university affiliated\" study in its proposal with NAI when designing the Kaats Study. Even when inferring the evidence in the light most favorable to ORI, the Court finds that no reasonable juror could find that the \"major university\" statement would not likely influence a consumer's purchasing decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Accordingly, the Court grants FRI's request for summary judgment on the material element of its claims relating to the \"major university\" statement, but denies its requests for the remaining statements.

As discussed above, Mr. Alkire and Mr. Shimizu state in their declarations that they both sought to expand into the glucomannan supplement market, but were shut out of the market by ORI and its advertising using studies about Shimizu's products. Further, they state that, because Lipozene contains a \"cheap,\" less effective version of glucomannan, FRI and Shimizu risk damages to their reputation when Lipozene does not work as it is advertised.

Though the Court did not consider the market activities that FRI has engaged in since the filing of its counterclaims for standing purposes, it may do so now. Mr. Alkire stated that FRI received an opportunity to expand its distribution, created a website and advertisements for direct to consumer sales, and made a sale to a customer who markets Propol to end consumers. (Alkire Opp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   However, FRI fails to argue or cite to any evidence to show that ORI acted willfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   ORI focuses largely on the lack of evidence provided by FRI to argue that FRI and Shimizu were not likely injured. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 345 at 18-21, 37-39; Ex. 130 (Beaton Supp. Report).) ORI's expert provides a report finding that neither FRI nor Shimizu was injured based on the evidence that he reviewed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 130.) This opinion appears to be based largely on the lack of evidence provided by FRI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264843\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/426/#p441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 345 at n.27.) The Court does not discount the lack of financial documents and analysis documenting FRI's damages, but finds that the weighing of each party's evidence (or lack thereof) is best suited for a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether FRI and Shimizu were likely injured. Accordingly, because FRI seeks monetary damages for its false advertising claims, the Court denies FRI's and ORI's requests for summary judgment on this element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Permanent Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Though FRI does not need to prove injury when requesting injunctive relief for the elements of a Lanham Act claim, FRI still must meet all the prongs for permanent injunction. A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must establish:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.

The Court recognizes that, as it relates to injunctive relief, FRI has shown actual success on the merits of its Lanham Act claim for the \"major university study\" statement. But the Court finds that FRI has not met its burden to show it will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. Though FRI does not need to prove injury to satisfy the \"likelihood of injury\" element for its Lanham Act claim, this showing does not equate to satisfying the irreparable harm prong for a permanent injunction. FRI does not cite to any evidence to show it will suffer irreparable harm, and instead, at best, relies on out of circuit case law\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that irreparable\n   harm is presumed when a statement is found to be false. (ECF No. 360 at 10-11.) Even assuming the Ninth Circuit would apply this presumption, the Court finds that ORI has rebutted this presumption. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 345 at 18-21, 37-39; Ex. 130 (Beaton Supp. Report).) As stated above, a jury is best suited to assess the evidence relating to FRI's damages, including those relating to irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Court denies FRI's request for summary judgment for a permanent injunction against ORI's false advertising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    f. UCL and FAL Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   FRI also seeks summary judgment for its FAL and UCL claims on the same bases as its Lanham Act claims. Likewise, ORI's arguments for summary judgment for the UCL and FAL claims hinge on the Court granting summary judgment for the Lanham Act claims. Based the foregoing reasons, ORI is entitled to summary judgment for the FAL and UCL claims as the claims relate to the \"pure glucomannan\" statement. Otherwise, because FRI's Lanham Act claims remain to be litigated for the five other statements, the UCL and FAL claims remain. Accordingly, the Court denies the parties' request for summary judgment for the UCL and FAL claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    3. ORI's Additional Requests for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In addition to its standing arguments and cross summary judgment request for FRI's Lanham Act claims, ORI asserts alternative bases for summary judgment against FRI. ORI fails to carry its burden on these arguments, and the Court denies each one in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Laches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   ORI argues that FRI is barred by laches from bringing its claims because Shimizu, and in turn FRI, waited over ten years to bring its claims. (ECF No. 345 at 21-26.) ORI states that this delay was unreasonable and allowing the case to move forward is prejudicial to ORI. Additionally, ORI argues that the public does not have a strong enough interest in this case to override that prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \"Laches is an equitable defense that prevents a plaintiff, who with full knowledge of the facts, acquiesces in a transaction and sleeps upon his rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Danjaq, LLC v.

ORI argues that Shimizu first knew (or should have known) about the allegedly false advertising in 2005. However, ORI cites to emails referencing products that differ from Lipozene because they contain Shimizu's glucomannan and are distributed in other countries, such as Australia. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 133.) For example, ORI cites to one email to show that Mr. Shimizu wanted to pursue legal action in the early 2000's. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 125.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Mr. Shimizu's \"threats\" to take legal action are unrelated to the core false advertising issues in this lawsuit. Mr. Shimizu stated that he wanted to bring legal action against ORI for \"mix[ing] [Shimizu's] product with other lower grade products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That issue is distinct from the issue at hand-falsely advertising that a study using Shimizu's product to advertise a product that does not contain any of its product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) ORI also claims that Shimizu should have known it had viable legal claims ten years ago because ORI ceased to source Shimizu's glucomannan in 2005. (ECF No. 345 at 23-24.) However, this evidence seems to resolve Mr. Shimizu's earlier threats of litigation because it forecloses on ORI continuing to \"mix [Shimizu's] product with other lower grade products.\" It does not follow that Shimizu should have known that ORI would use clinical studies involving Shimizu's product to \"falsely\" market a different finished product based on these facts. This is especially true given Mr. Shimizu lives in Japan and states that he did not see the advertising until years later. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shimizu Opp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   (stating he first learned of Lipozene's advertising on its website in late 2014).) Moreover, because the standard for laches involves whether FRI's delay, if any, was \"reasonable\" or not, this issue is better suited for a jury's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to delay, the Court finds ORI's argument that FRI's claim is barred by laches fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Unclean Hands\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   ORI also argues that FRI is barred from making any claims regarding the Kaats Study because of the doctrine of unclean hands. ORI conflates FRI's advertisements to argue that FRI is also engaged in the same misleading and false advertising that is at issue in this litigation. (ECF No. 345 at 39.) However, ORI fails to meet its burden, and is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The doctrine of unclean hands \"bars relief to a plaintiff who has violated conscience, good faith or other equitable principles in his prior conduct, as well as to a plaintiff who has dirtied his hands in acquiring the right presently asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    Dollar Sys., Inc. v.

Under ORI's \"unclean hands\" theory, ORI must show that FRI engaged in similar false advertising of its product that related to the Kaats Study. The evidence does not support this allegation. For example, FRI states in its advertisement that its \"OptiFiber Lean\" product contains the Shimizu's Propol A as an ingredient and that \"studies support its health effects.\" (Ex. 150.) ORI argues that FRI cites to the Kaats study to support this statement, but it is unclear which study this statement references. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The statement does not include a footnote and the advertisement lists eighteen clinical studies, including the Walsh Study, which studied Propol A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing the Kaats study specifically twice, along with other studies including the Walsh Study, to support claims regarding glucomannan generally).) Additionally, ORI cites to an email from Mr. Alkire to its current client. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 149.) The email discusses, in part, two sets of documents attached to the email. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Alkire points out that Propol A is the highest grade of glucomannan on the attached viscosity chart, and then notes that the Kaats Study is of particular interest because of the significant weight loss shown in a set of clinical trial documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Considering the email in its entirely, it is not clear that Mr. Alkire is inferring that Propol A was tested in the Kaats Study or making any other \"false\" statements about Propol A's characteristics or the Kaats Study. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 149 (stating that the \"kaats trial is highly interesting due to the significant amount of [fat] at loss\").) Thus, this evidence fails to prove inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Because ORI fails to provide evidence that FRI is engaged in any similar misleading or false advertising, the Court denies ORI's request for summary judgment on the doctrine of unclean hands.

(ECF No. 394 at 8) This argument misses the mark. FRI maintains it could not enter the market with \"a dietary supplement form of Propol\" like the product tested in the Kaats study because of Lipozene's low price. Though FRI has a dietary supplement containing Propol for sale, it appears that FRI is still prohibited from introducing a higher priced, higher quality product into the market. Moreover, Mr. Alkire continues to represent that \"FRI finds it incredibly difficult to compete with ORI's price point\" and that it is \"unable to make inroads into the direct to consumer\" market as a direct result of ORI's allegedly false claims.
