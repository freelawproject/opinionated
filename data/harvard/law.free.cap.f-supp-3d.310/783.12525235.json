Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Kimberly Thames, a 57-year old pro-life advocate, brought this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   suit arising out of her arrest and weekend detention at a Westland police station holding cell, after an abortion clinic's security guard accused her of stating, \"I prophesy bombs, I prophesy bombs. There is going to be a bombing in the near future.\" Thames denies making any statement involving the word, \"bombs.\" Thames brought suit against Defendants the City of Westland, the Westland Chief of Police, four Westland police officers involved in her arrest, the Northland Family Planning Clinic, Inc. (\"Northland\") and its Chief Executive Officer, Renee Chelian, its employee Mary Guilbernat, and John Doe, the clinic's security guard. By prior order of the court, Northland, Chelian, and Guilbernat have been dismissed. Now before the court is a motion for summary judgment brought by the remaining Defendants as to the federal claims, and a cross-motion for partial summary judgment as to liability brought by Thames for most of the same claims. Oral argument was heard on March 15, 2018 and informs this court's decision. Also, in rendering its decision here, the court has reviewed the audiotape of the 9-1-1 call and various video recordings of Thames' arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, summary judgment shall enter for the City of Westland and Police Chief Jedrusik because there is no basis for\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   or supervisory liability. However, Defendants' motion for summary judgment for the arresting Defendants on Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment wrongful arrest claim shall be denied. Also, Defendants' motion for summary judgment shall be denied as to Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim as to Defendants Officer Gatti and Sergeant Brooks, but shall be granted as to Officers Soulliere and Tardif. Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment as to liability shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On Saturday, August 27, 2016, Thames, a Roman Catholic and pro-life supporter, stood on a public sidewalk outside the Northland abortion clinic holding a rosary and a sign in defense of the unborn. Thames was known to the Northland clinic as a frequent protestor. At the same time, a religious sister was also peacefully protesting near Thames. Thames engaged the security guard, Robert Parsley, standing outside the clinic in conversation and informed him that she was praying for him and hoped he could find a new position. She alleges that he then informed her that there have been bomb threats against abortion clinics, to which she claims she responded that she was not aware of any bombings in Michigan. After their conversation, Thames left in her car to use a nearby restroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Parsley's version of their conversation is quite different. In two different accounts, he claims that Thames threatened that bombs would fall. He reported these allegations to employees of the clinic. One of the clinic's employees, defendant Guilbernat, placed a 9-1-1 call to the police. In that call, Guilbernat stated, \"We have protestors outside and one of them just made a statement that there's going to be a bombing.\" (Doc. 35, Ex. B at 00:04:09). The 9-1-1 operator asks her, \"What exactly did they say?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 00:09:12, and Guilbernat repeats, \"There's going to be a bombing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 00:12-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The operator sought a second time to clarify the threat, asking, \"That's all they said is there's going to be a bombing? That's what they said, word for word?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 00:14-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To which Guilbernat, replied, \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 00:18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The operator then sought a third time to clarify the threat, to which Guilbernat accused Thames of stating \"there's going to be a bombing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 01:57-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Guilbernat then gave the operator a description of the woman in question, describing her as dark complexioned, with dark hair in a bun, wearing a light blue short-sleeved top, a long blue skirt and flip-flops.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 00:30-33, 1:01-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to the 9-1-1 call, four Westland police officers responded to the clinic: Officers Jason Soulliere, John Gatti, Adam Tardif, and Sergeant Norman Brooks. These officers are named Defendants. Officer Halaas appeared later on the scene, and he has not been named in the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thames returned to the location to continue protesting and saw several police vehicles and officers speaking to Parsley. Officer Gatti arrived on the scene first and interviewed Parsley and Guilbernat. Both identified Thames to him as the person who had made the statement. (Doc. 36, Ex. B at 8:50:19-25, 08:51:41-2, 08:52:01-03). Parsley told Officer Gatti that Thames stated, \"I prophesy bombs are going to fall and they're going to fall in the near future.\" (Doc. 36, Ex. B at 8:51:31-8:52:53, Ex. K at 53:5-23). Parsley also accused Thames of stating, \"I prophesy bombs are going to fall and they're going to fall on you people.\" (Doc. 40, Ex. E at 08:52:46-52). But when Parsley gave his written statement to Defendant Tardif a few minutes later, his story changed and he accused Thames of stating, \"bombs, bombs, on America, and bombs will blow up this building.\" (Doc. 36, Ex. E, Ex. M at 18:22-25 and 19:1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Soulliere asked Thames if she had made a bomb threat, and she denied it. (Doc. 36, Ex. J at 40:23-25-51:1-20; Ex. B at 8:51:21-8:15:36). But she never specifically answered Officer Soulliere's questions about what exactly she did say to the guard, merely reiterating that she did not make a bomb threat, did not know what she had said to him that could have been misconstrued, and mentioned that he was the one who brought up alleged bombings at abortion clinics.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 08:51:41-2, 08:51:43-08:52:31; Doc 36-3, 57:24-25 to 58:1-17. She also relayed her conversation with Parsley in which he told her about bombings for which she responded she was unaware of that activity. (Doc. 36, Ex. J at 57:24-25-58:1-17, Ex. B at 8:53:47-8:55:07; Ex. I at 42:18-25; 51:1-4; Ex. 1 at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The senior officer on the scene, Sergeant Brooks, ordered Thames' arrest for making a terrorist threat. (Doc. 35, Ex. C at 30). Specifically, she was arrested for violating Michigan's anti-terrorism statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .543m. Thames has not challenged the constitutionality of the statute. Officer Soulliere then handcuffed Thames. (Doc. 35, Ex. D at 30). After her arrest, Thames pleaded with the religious sister to come to her aid. (Doc. 36, Ex. J at 68:14-15). The religious sister told Officer Soulliere that she did not hear Thames make a bomb threat, implored him\n   to question Thames and Parsley together so he could determine who was lying, and insisted that the ones that should be arrested were the clinic's owner and staff who were the ones \"killing God's children.\" (Doc. 36, Ex. J at 69:12-71:22). Officer Gatti told the religious sister that she was a \"disgrace.\" (Doc. 36, Ex. K at 19:23-25-20:1-5). The officers did not take a written statement from the sister or from two other persons who were outside the clinic when the alleged threat was made. (Doc. 36, Ex. J at 59:13-25-60:1-13; Ex. L at 23:24-25-24:1-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Thames' arrest, she was placed in the back of Officer Halaas' patrol vehicle, but when he was called away to respond to another incident, she was moved to Officer Soulliere's patrol vehicle. (Doc. 35, Ex. E at 08:57:35-09:01:49; Ex. F at 75-5). At the time she was placed in Officer Halaas' vehicle, Thames told him, \"You got the wrong person,\" to which he replied, \"Ma'am, I don't give a shit! I got to go!\" (Doc. 36, Ex. O at 46:18-25 to 47:1-10). After her arrest, Officers Soulliere and Halaas searched her vehicle, but did not find any explosives or any other contraband. (Doc. 35, Ex. E at 08:57:36-09:02:50; Ex. F at 72-3.) The officers did not search the clinic, the adjacent parking lot, or nearby dumpster, nor did they use any bomb sniffing dogs. In fact, the Westland police department does not have any bomb sniffing dogs, but would have to call the state police for such a search. The officers did not impound Thames' vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officers Gatti and Soulliere testified at their depositions that the City of Westland did not train them to distinguish between true threats and protected speech. (Doc. 36, Ex. J at 36:16-19, Ex. K at 117:4-7). Sergeant Brooks testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I don't know the exact verbiage that-that he said to Officer Gatti. My-there's only one word that concerns me in this whole thing and that's bombs. Just like you can't yell fire in a crowded theater, you can't say anything about bombs near a facility that performs abortions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Doc. 36, Ex. at 29:20-25). At his deposition, Sergeant Brooks was asked why the officers did not search the surrounding vicinity of the abortion clinic for a bomb, and he responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   At that-at that point we were not concerned about a bomb being physically there at that particular time because of the amount of protesters and employees and patients of the clinic. The reason we were sent there was because of the threat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Doc. 36, Ex. L at 28:9-13). Sergeant Brooks was then asked, if the threat was credible, why did they not evacuate the clinic, and he responded, the \"threat doesn't have to be credible according to the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750\">\n    at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, at the scene of the arrest, Sergeant Brooks also said, \"Anybody who has anything to do with this whole thing, [they're] fanatics.\" (Doc. 36, Ex. C at PgID 597).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Soulliere drove Thames to the Westland police station, booked and placed her in a holding cell where she remained over the weekend. (Doc. 36, Ex. O at 63:1-10). She was released Monday morning at 10:14 a.m. Thus, she was in police custody for a little over 49 hours. Thames did not eat or sleep during that time, although she was offered food. (Doc. 36, Ex. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-40). The holding cell had a cement slab for sleeping and a toilet which was visible to all. (Doc. 36, Ex. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-40, Ex. G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Officer Soulliere's report regarding Thames' arrest would not have come to the attention of the on-call detective that weekend, Detective Jerry Farrar, until Sunday because the report was not approved by a sergeant until after Detective Farrar's shift ended on Saturday. (Doc. 45, Ex. J at 18-21). Detective Farrar was\n   handling a homicide investigation which began on Sunday morning, and thus, was not able to address Thames' case until Monday morning. (Doc. 45, Ex. I at 65:22-25-66:1-13; Ex. J at 19-21, 22-28, 39). Thames was unable to attend Mass on Sunday or receive the Eucharist. (Doc. 36, Ex. 1 at \u00b6 34). Upon reviewing the case, Detective Farrar made the decision to release Thames finding that \"though there was probable cause to arrest Kimberley, I find at this time there is insufficient evidence to charge her with a crime.\" (Doc. 45, Ex. J at 27:8-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Detective Farrar did not talk to the prosecutor before making his decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750\">\n    at 25:9-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In his incident report, Detective Farrar wrote that he read Robert's written statement accusing Thames of stating \"bombs, bombs, bombs on America. And bombs will blow up this building,\" and determined that \"I do not see a direct threat where Kimberly threatened to bomb the clinic.\" (Doc. 36-3 at PgID 611). After her release, the police denied Thames' request that they take her to her car so she walked about a mile to her vehicle. (Doc. 36, Ex. 1 at \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Thames' release, the City police department conducted an internal investigation, and concluded that Thames' arrest was reasonable and justified and was consistent with its policies, practices, and procedures. (Doc. 36, Ex. O at 49:5-10, 91:5-22, Ex. C). However, Officer Gatti received a verbal reprimand for telling the religious sister that she was a disgrace. (Doc. 36, Ex. O at 47:17-48:2). The Chief of Police, Jeff Jedrusik, reviewed the report of the internal investigation and accepted its findings. (Doc. 36, Ex. O at 44:6-25-45:1-3). Deputy Chief Brian Miller, the witness designated by the City pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6), testified Thames' arrest and detention were consistent with the policies and practices of the police department. (Doc. 36, Ex. O at 86:1-10). However, Officers Gatti and Sergeant Brooks were cautioned to refrain from \"[e]ngaging in political or religious/morality discussions with bystanders.\" (Doc. 36, Ex. C at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thames filed this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   lawsuit against the City of Westland; Police Chief Jeff Jedrusik; Officers Soulliere, Gatti, Tardif, and Brooks; Northland, Northland's CEO Chelian, Northland's employee Guilbernat, and John Doe, Northland's security guard.

For the reasons set forth below, an issue of fact exists as to whether the officers had probable cause to arrest Thames which precludes the entry of summary judgment for the arresting officers. The security guard accused Thames of making the following statement before her arrest: \"\n   <em>\n    I prophesy bombs are going to fall and they're going to fall in the near future\n   </em>\n   .\" After her arrest, he reported she said, \"\n   <em>\n    bombs, bombs, on America, and bombs will blow up this building.\n   </em>\n   \" The fact that the security guard arguably changed his story may call into question his credibility. Also, the religious sister present at the scene denied that Thames had made the statement. Thus, a reasonably prudent officer on the scene might doubt the security guard's story. Whether or not the security guard provided reasonably trustworthy information is a question of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nevertheless, assuming that a reasonably prudent officer would accept the security guard's version of events as true, the court considers whether these two statements give rise to probable cause for her arrest.

Comp. Laws \u00a7 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .543m only criminalizes \"true threats\" which involve a \"serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence,\" the court considers whether the statements allegedly attributable to Thames meet this threshold. First, the court considers her pre-arrest statement, \"\n   <em>\n    I prophesy bombs are going to fall and they're going to fall in the near future.\n   </em>\n   \" In considering this statement, the court gives the term \"prophesy\" its ordinary\n   meaning. According to Merriam-Webster, prophesy means, \"to utter by or as if by divine inspiration,\" \"to predict with assurance or on the basis of mystic knowledge,\" or to \"prefigure.\" An example of the word in its ordinary usage is Mark Twain's text in\n   <em>\n    A Connecticut Yankee\n   </em>\n   , \"every time he\n   <em>\n    prophesied\n   </em>\n   fair weather it rained.\" In essence, to \"prophesy\" means to prognosticate, but it does not suggest willful conduct or that the speaker will be responsible for carrying out the prediction. In the vague context allegedly used by Thames, at least a jury question exists as to whether it amounts to a true threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The evidence suggests that Defendant Officers did not consider the statement to be a true threat as they did not direct evacuation of the clinic, did not request the assistance of a bomb squad, did not request the assistance of a bomb sniffing dog, did not search the clinic for a bomb, did not search the surrounding area for a bomb, did not search the adjacent parking lot for a bomb, did not search the dumpster for a bomb, and did not impound Thames' vehicle for fear that a bomb might be planted in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The security guard did not make his written statement until after Thames was arrested. Even so, the court considers whether that statement amounts to a \"true threat\" which would give rise to probable cause for arrest. That statement was, \"\n   <em>\n    bombs, bombs, on America, and bombs will blow up this building\n   </em>\n   .\" This statement presents a closer question than the first, but like the \"\n   <em>\n    prophesy\n   </em>\n   \" statement, it is a vague prediction about the future and does not suggest any present intention on the part of Thames to carry out a crime of violence against the clinic. Once again, the officers' failure to make any attempt to locate a bomb or vacate the clinic or surrounding vicinity suggests that an objectively reasonable officer on the scene might not view the statement as a true threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Having found that a jury question exists as to whether the security guard's allegations against Thames gave probable cause for her arrest, the court next considers whether the arresting officers are still entitled to qualified immunity. \"[U]nder \u00a7 1983, an arresting agent is entitled to qualified immunity if he or she could reasonably (even if erroneously) have believed that the arrest was lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information possessed at the time by the arresting agent.\"\n   <em>\n    Everson v.

City of Villa Hills, Ky.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030869\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/210/#p214\">\n    635 F.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214 (6th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Thames, a jury question exists as to whether a reasonable officer on the scene could have believed that her arrest was lawful. Also, all four of the arresting officers are potentially liable for the arrest. Sergeant Brooks ordered the arrest. Officer Gatti investigated the complaint at the scene. Officer Soulliere questioned Thames, placed her in handcuffs, searched her vehicle, transported her to the police station and initiated her booking. Officer Tardif took the security guard's written statement. Under Sixth Circuit precedent, those police officers present at the scene of a wrongful arrest who have the opportunity and means to prevent the harm from occurring, may be liable under \u00a7 1983 for failing to intervene to prevent the wrongful arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smoak v. Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674455\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/768/#p784\">\n    460 F.3d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 784 (6th Cir. 2006) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v.

Based on the foregoing discussion, Defendant officers are not entitled to summary judgment on the wrongful arrest claim. A jury question remains as to whether there was probable cause for the arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Retaliatory Arrest Pursuant to the First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because Thames groups her First Amendment violations of freedom of speech and the right to free exercise of her religion together in her motion for partial summary judgment, the court likewise does so. As the Sixth Circuit has observed, \"[f]ree exercise claims are often considered in tandem with free speech claims and may rely entirely on the same set of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Bible Believers v. Wayne Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357567\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/228/#p256\">\n    805 F.3d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256 (6th Cir. 2015). First, the court considers whether Thames has raised a genuine issue of material fact that Officers Soulliere, Gatti, Tardif, and Brooks violated her right to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. Thames alleges that she was engaging in protected speech when she protested outside an abortion clinic based on her sincerely held religious beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Unlike wrongful arrest claims brought under the Fourth Amendment, motive is relevant to Thames' claim that Defendant officers arrested her in retaliation for her exercise of her First Amendment rights. The Sixth Circuit has identified three elements that a plaintiff must prove to establish a retaliatory arrest claim: \"(1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between elements one and two-that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiff's protected conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Villa Hills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030869\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/210/#p214\">\n    635 F.3d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   An issue of law exists as to whether Thames must also prove a fourth element-that there was an absence of probable cause for her arrest-in order to prevail on her retaliatory arrest claim under the First Amendment.

Second, her arrest and 49-hour detention in a holding cell would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The only question then is whether there is a causal connection between her pro-life activities and her arrest-that is, whether her arrest was motivated at least in part by her protected conduct. In support of her claim that the Defendant officers had retaliatory animus, Thames relies on the following evidence: (1) Sergeant Brooks who ordered the arrest, testified that \"you can't say anything about bombs near a facility that performs abortions,\" (Doc. 36. Ex. L at 29:20-25); (2) Defendant Brooks referred to people who protest on behalf of the unborn as \"fanatics,\" (Doc. 36, Ex. C at 10) (3) Defendant Gatti told the religious sister who was protesting alongside Thames that \"You should not be in the position you are in, you're a disgrace, (Doc. 36, Ex. K at 19:23-25 to 20:1-5) and (4) Defendant Gatti testified, \"the comments that were made by her, it's a very politically religiously charged issue.\" (Doc. 36, Ex. K at 34:11-12, 35:18-22). Also, the court considers the fact that the arresting officers did not evacuate the clinic or make any serious efforts to locate a bomb. Based on this evidence of animus against pro-lifers, Thames has raised a genuine issue of material fact in support of her First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim. As previously discussed, the right to be free from retaliation for expressive religious activity is clearly established; thus, Officer Gatti and Sergeant Brooks are not entitled to qualified immunity on Thames' First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim. Because\n   there is no evidence of retaliatory animus on the part of Defendant Officers Tardif and Soulliere; however, they are entitled to summary judgment on the retaliatory arrest claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Thames argues that the Sixth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Bible Believers\n   </em>\n   supports her First Amendment claim. In that case, Bible Believers had been proselytizing their religious message peacefully at an international Arab festival, but nevertheless, their signs and banners had led to a violent reaction from a group of adolescents at the festival who began hurling water bottles and other objects at them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357567\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/228/#p256\">\n    805 F.3d at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In support of this claim, she relies primarily on the same evidence summarized above in support of her retaliatory arrest claim, namely (1) Officer Gatti's testimony that the arrest was justified because of the \"very politically, religiously charged\" issue of abortion and that the \"threats that she made have been carried out in the past,\" (Doc. 36, Ex. K at 34:11-18), (2) Officer Gatti called the religious sister a \"disgrace,\" (Doc. K at 19:23-25 to 20:1-5), (3) Sergeant Brooks' statement that those involved in the abortion debate are \"fanatics,\" (Doc. 36, Ex. C at 10); (4) the Internal Investigation report statement that, \"[f]amily planning centers across the country and across the world operate on a consistent heightened state of security. This is common knowledge amongst law enforcement agencies across the country and, based on this violent history, has lent itself to be a contributing factor when establishing enforcement actions in and around family planning centers,\" (Doc. 36, Ex. C at 15), and (5) Defendant Officers relied solely on the security guard's statements which were not credible because his statements varied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on this record, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Officers Gatti and Sergeant Brooks arrested Thames for her pro-life activity, and not because she made a \"true threat.\" Significantly, Defendants failed to evacuate the abortion clinic or make any meaningful attempt to locate a bomb. As there is no evidence of discriminatory animus on the part of Tardif and Soulliere; however, they are entitled to summary judgment on Thames' equal protection claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Having found a question of fact exists as to whether Officer Gatti and Sergeant Brooks violated Thames' equal protection rights, the next question is whether a constitutional right was clearly established. If not, as described above, Defendant Officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Just as with Thames' First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim, the\n   law was clearly established that the police could not arrest a peaceful speaker engaged in protected speech on a public sidewalk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bible Believers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357567\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/228/#p256\">\n    805 F.3d at 258-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants seek summary judgment on this claim. Thames has not responded to the argument in her response brief, nor addressed the issue in her own motion for partial summary judgment. It appears that Thames has abandoned the claim. Even if not, there are no genuine issues of material fact as to Thames' conspiracy claim, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Municipal Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The court next considers whether the City of Westland may be liable for alleged violations of Thames' Fourth, First, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Municipalities are not entitled to qualified immunity, and thus, the City of Westland may be liable for alleged violations of Thames' Fourth, First, and Fourteenth Amendment rights if Thames can prove liability under\n   <em>\n    Monell.\n   </em>\n   Thames argues that that the arresting officers lacked probable cause to arrest her, and that the City's failure to train the officers on what constitutes a \"true threat\" was the motivating force behind the arrest, or that the City was liable because the Chief of Police ratified the conduct by approving an investigation of the incident which concluded that the arrest was reasonable and justified.

At a minimum, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must show that a supervisory official at least implicitly authorized, approved or knowingly acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct of the offending subordinate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969866\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/629/#p643\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969866\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/629/#p643\">\n    at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff sought to hold the police Commander responsible for excessive force and other constitutional violations, arising from plaintiff's alleged beatings and mistreatment in prison, under the theory of supervisory liability because the Commander investigated plaintiff's complaints and concluded there was no evidence to support his claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969866\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/629/#p643\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969866\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/629/#p643\">\n    at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Also, Thames' efforts to recover against Chief Jedrusik on the basis that he failed to properly train his subordinates is not actionable under \u00a7 1983 under the circumstances presented here.
