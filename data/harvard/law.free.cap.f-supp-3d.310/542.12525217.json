Bredar, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mirna Rubidia Artiga Carrero (\"Plaintiff\") filed a five-count Complaint against various state and federal officials and entities seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages stemming from her alleged unlawful arrest in 2014, which she contends was caused in part by federal policy regarding the identification and apprehension of aliens, like her, that are subject to a final order of removal. Defendants the United States of America; Jefferson B. Sessions III, Attorney General of the United States; Elaine C. Duke, Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"); and Thomas D. Homan, Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") (the \"Federal Defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, which the Court granted in part and held in abeyance in part. (Order, ECF No. 34.) Now pending before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 43.) For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's Motion will be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In her original Complaint, Plaintiff alleged five causes of action stemming from the entry of her information in the National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\") database and her subsequent seizure based on that information. Three of those claims, Counts Three through Five, were asserted against the Federal Defendants. Specifically, in Count Three she alleged that the Federal Defendants' entry and maintenance of her civil administrative warrant in NCIC caused her to be unlawfully seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that she was at imminent risk of suffering another unlawful seizure in the future. In Count Four, she alleged that the individual Federal Defendants exceeded their statutory\n   authority by including civil warrants like hers in the NCIC database. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief for her claims in Counts Three and Four.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's claims for prospective relief (i.e., Counts Three and Four) were premised on the Federal Defendants' continued maintenance of her civil administrative warrant in NCIC, yet the Federal Defendants presented evidence that Plaintiff's civil warrant was \"cleared\" from the NCIC database on September 11, 2014, more than two years before she filed her Complaint. (Reply Mem. in Supp. of the Fed. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 32, at 7 n.7.) As a result, the Court found that Plaintiff lacked standing to assert her claims for injunctive and declaratory relief because she could not show that her purported injury-\"risk of suffering an unlawful seizure by state or local law enforcement officials in the future,\" (ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 62)-was real or imminent. However, because the Federal Defendants had not presented this jurisdiction-stripping evidence until their reply brief, the Court held in abeyance its decision regarding Plaintiff's standing. The Court granted Plaintiff ten days to \"provide ... 'further particularized allegations' in support of her contention that the Federal Defendants continue to maintain a civil warrant of removal for her in the NCIC database.\" (Memorandum, ECF No. 33, at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff has not provided any additional allegations in support of her claim that the Federal Defendants continue to maintain a civil warrant of removal for her in the NCIC database. Instead, she seeks leave to amend her complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Legal Standard for Motion for Leave to Amend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend her Complaint is governed by Rule 15(a), which directs the Court to \"freely give leave when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The Fourth Circuit has stated that leave to amend under Rule 15(a) should be denied only in three situations: when the opposing party would be prejudiced, when the amendment is sought in bad faith, or when the proposed amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    Laber v.

She contends that her amended pleading plausibly alleges both a present injury and a substantial risk of future injury stemming from her \"cleared\" record in NCIC. First, Plaintiff contends that \"the presence of [her] identifying information in the NCIC database, suggesting a criminal history, subjects her to a substantial risk of increased police scrutiny, including unlawful seizure and investigation.\" (ECF No. 43, at 4.) This is the same injury that Plaintiff asserted in her original complaint (i.e., the threat of unlawful seizure in the future). Second, she argues for the first time that maintaining her information in NCIC subjects her to a present and ongoing injury-\"[s]tigma and reputational harm\" by painting her as a criminal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Federal Defendants contend that Plaintiff's motion should be denied because her proposed amendments are futile. The Court agrees with the Federal Defendants, and therefore Plaintiff's Motion will be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's first argument-that she is subject to increased scrutiny and an imminent risk of future arrest based on her \"cleared\" record in NCIC-is unavailing. Plaintiff's proposed Amended Complaint has simply been revised to reflect the accurate status of her NCIC record as \"cleared.\" But the Court already found that Plaintiff lacked standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief based on these very facts. The Court explicitly found that because \"Plaintiff's information was \"cleared\" from the NCIC database on September 11, 2014, ... she cannot show that she is in real and imminent danger of\n   future injury.\" (ECF No. 33, at 38.) Now, Plaintiff simply asks that the Court reconsider its decision; this is not proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless, the Court has reviewed Plaintiff's new arguments and finds them without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's purported risk of future injury is far too speculative and implausible to confer standing. Plaintiff contends that the presence of her \"cleared\" record in NCIC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 alerts law enforcement personnel that Ms. Artiga was,\n   <em>\n    at one time\n   </em>\n   , subject to arrest; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 subjects her to the substantial risk that she will be targeted by law enforcement personnel for further stops, scrutiny, and investigation, based on their knowledge of a\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   arrest warrant against her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Amended Compl., ECF No. 43-1, \u00b6 39-40 (emphasis added).) As an initial matter, Plaintiff's NCIC record does not indicate that she was \"subject to arrest\" or that there was \"a prior arrest warrant against her.\" The record simply says \"cleared.\" Moreover, even assuming that Plaintiff's NCIC record conveyed this historical information, the fact that Plaintiff was, \"\n   <em>\n    at one time\n   </em>\n   , subject to arrest,\" does not put her at imminent risk of being arrested\n   <em>\n    in the future.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 (emphasis added).) Plaintiff also alleges that \"[t]here is a substantial likelihood that officers will stop Ms. Artiga and will see her record in the NCIC database.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) This argument puts the cart before the horse. The presence of her information in NCIC does not create a \"substantial likelihood that officers will stop [her]\"; rather, such information would be accessed only after an officer stopped Plaintiff for some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   reason. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   [her] Motion to Reopen her immigration case or her applications for further relief are denied, civil immigration information about Ms. Artiga\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   again be unlawfully entered into the NCIC system,\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   as early as October 18, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 (emphasis added).) These allegations-which depend entirely on a host of future events which may or may not occur-are far too \"conjectural\" and \"hypothetical\" to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p102\">\n    461 U.S. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p102\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument-that the Federal Defendants' conduct subjects her to a present and ongoing reputational injury-also fails to cure the jurisdictional defects in her Complaint. \"[R]eputational injury that derives directly from government action will support Article III standing to challenge that action.\"\n   <em>\n    Foretich v.

In other words, Plaintiff does not dispute that she is properly classified as an immigration violator. Instead, she argues that placing her identification information with the notation \"cleared\" in an \"Immigration Violator File\" within a larger \"crime\" database constitutes a free-standing, reputational injury sufficient to confer standing. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At most, Plaintiff's \"cleared\" record in NCIC has an incremental effect on her reputation \"over and above that caused by\" her actual, undisputed status as an immigration violator.\n   <em>\n    Lebron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711795\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/540/#p562\">\n    670 F.3d at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McBryde v.

In other words, Plaintiff presumes that she is stigmatized based on her inclusion in the Immigration Violator File while ignoring the possibility that the harm to her reputation, if any, in fact flows from her uncontroverted status as an immigration violator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petitioners Seeking Habeas Corpus Relief in Relation to Prior Detentions at Guantanamo Bay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5884928\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/700/119/#p134\">\n    700 F.Supp.2d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134 (D.D.C. 2010) (\"Petitioners also ignore the fact that the alleged stigma may derive from the underlying conduct for which they were previously detained at Guantanamo, as opposed [to] their prior designation as enemy combatants.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The fact that NCIC is nominally a \"crime\" database does not change this calculus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiff may assert stigma or reputational harm based on information that is not widely disseminated or available to the public.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

But assuming that she can, including her information in NCIC does not paint her with as broad a brush as she claims. The NCIC database includes twenty-one files, including at least four of which (in addition to the Immigration Violator File) contain identification records on individuals who need not have committed a crime. For instance, the \"Missing Persons File\" includes \"[r]ecords on individuals, including children, who have been reported missing to law enforcement.\" FBI,\n   <em>\n    National Crime Information Center (NCIC), available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ncic (last accessed April 10, 2018). The \"Identity Theft File\" includes \"[r]ecords containing descriptive and other information that law enforcement personnel can use to determine if an individual is a\n   <em>\n    victim\n   </em>\n   of identity theft.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176818\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/341/#p348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The \"Protection Order File\" includes \"[r]ecords on individuals against whom protection orders have been issued,\" which presumably would include civil protection orders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176818\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/341/#p348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the \"Unidentified Persons File\" includes \"[r]ecords on unidentified deceased persons, living persons who are unable to verify their identities, unidentified victims of catastrophes, and recovered body parts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176818\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/341/#p348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   All of these files contain identifying information about people in a \"crime\" database who have not themselves been convicted of a crime (or at least need not have been).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Indeed, the entire premise of Plaintiff's Complaint is that NCIC includes noncriminal information, a fact which certainly cannot elude the thousands of law enforcement personnel who regularly access the database for various purposes. Plaintiff herself even alleges that when Officer Farrelly accessed the NCIC database it \"revealed that [she] had only an outstanding administrative warrant of removal,\n   <em>\n    and no criminal record.\n   </em>\n   \" (ECF No. 1, \u00b6 21; ECF No. 43-1 (emphasis added).) Thus, based on Plaintiff's own allegations, the information about her in NCIC accurately conveys to law enforcement personnel that she does not have a criminal record. It appears that Plaintiff's actual concern is that law enforcement personnel may erroneously conflate a civil warrant of removal (or simply a \"cleared\" record) with a criminal arrest warrant. However, the facts of this case bely that concern: Officer Farrelly did not independently arrest Plaintiff based on the civil warrant he found in NCIC but instead called ICE and arrested her only after receiving direction to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff's (un)alleged reputational injury based on the inclusion of accurate information about her in NCIC is insufficient, standing alone, to confer standing, and therefore her proposed Amended Complaint would be futile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

Those claims were dismissed by the Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and are the subject of a separate motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff. Although Plaintiff has submitted superficial amendments to Count Five, they are not relevant to the Court's resolution of the instant motion. Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider is addressed separately.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Plaintiff has styled her motion as a \"Sur-Reply in Opposition to Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint.\" (ECF No. 43.) The Court, however, did not grant Plaintiff permission to file a surreply. Local Rule 105.2(a) (\"Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, surreply memoranda are not permitted to be filed.\"). Rather, the Court granted Plaintiff the opportunity to present \" 'further particularized allegations' in support of her contention that the Federal Defendants continue to maintain a civil warrant of removal for her in the NCIC database.\" (Memorandum, ECF No. 33, at 40.) Regardless, the Court has considered all of her arguments advanced in favor of standing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Plaintiff has not been charged or convicted of entering without inspection. However, because Plaintiff was ordered removed in absentia by an immigration judge, she was necessarily found inadmissible by \"clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Plaintiff also asks that the Court allow her jurisdictional discovery \"to determine why her information was cleared from the NCIC database, the nature of the information about her remaining in the database, how that information is used by state and local law enforcement officers, and under what circumstances immigration information about her will be re-entered into the database.\" (ECF No. 43, at 2.) The Court has \"broad discretion in [its] resolution of discovery problems,\" including whether to allow for limited jurisdictional discovery.\n    <em>\n     Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Akzo, N.V.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1883032\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/2/56/#p64\">\n     2 F.3d 56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 64 (4th Cir. 1993) (quoting\n    <em>\n     In re Multi-Piece Rim Prods. Liab. Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3534270,1465903\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/653/671/\">\n     653 F.2d 671\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 679 (D.C. Cir. 1981) ). The Court finds that jurisdictional discovery is not warranted because none of the specific topics cited by Plaintiff are relevant to her standing. First, \"why her information was cleared from the NCIC database\" is irrelevant to her injury, or lack thereof. In any event, the Federal Defendants have already indicated that the information was cleared after Plaintiff was arrested. Second, unless the Federal Defendants are misleading the Court (and there is no reason to believe that is the case), \"the nature of the information about her remaining in the database\" is already known. Third, discovery into \"how that information is used by state and local law enforcement officers\" is a strikingly open-ended request that would presumably involve third-party discovery. And, in the unlikely event that a statistically significant number of state and local law enforcement officers (presumably based on sampling) indicated they would arrest someone based on a \"cleared\" record in NCIC, this would not be a valid basis for standing. Such an arrest would be unlawful and therefore far too speculative to confer standing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lyons\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p102\">\n     461 U.S. at 103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p102\">\n     103 S.Ct. 1660\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that, in evaluating standing, courts \"assume that [individuals] will conduct their activities within the law\"). Likewise, Plaintiff's desire to learn \"under what circumstances immigration information about her will be re-entered into the database\" is too speculative to support standing. Indeed, this information-\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    she may again be placed in NCIC-is one step further removed from the argument rejected by the Court\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , that she \"may again be unlawfully entered into the NCIC system.\" (ECF No. 43-1, \u00b6 51 (emphasis added).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
