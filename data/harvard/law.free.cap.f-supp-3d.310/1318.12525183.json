BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Defendant Lyle Woody Begay's Motion to Suppress Statement and Supportive Memorandum, filed July 22, 2014 (Doc. 28)(\"Suppression Motion\"); and (ii) the United States' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony from Suppression Hearing, filed August 16, 2017 (Doc. 128)(\"Exclusion Motion\"). The Court held evidentiary hearings on August 17-18, 2017, and on November 20, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether Dr. Richard Leo, a Professor of Law and Psychology at the University of San Francisco School of Law, may offer expert testimony regarding police interrogation tactics; (ii) whether Dr. Leo may offer expert testimony regarding false confessions; (iii) whether Eric Lucero, a former\n   New Mexico State Police officer and certified polygraph examiner, may offer expert testimony regarding polygraph examinations; (iv) whether Defendant Lyle Woody Begay's July 18, 2013, interview was a custodial interrogation; (v) whether Begay's statements during the July 18, 2013, interview were voluntary; (vi) whether Begay's July 19, 2013, interview was a custodial interrogation; (vii) whether Begay's statements during the July 19, 2013, interview were voluntary; (viii) whether Begay validly waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights during the July 30, 2013, interview; and (ix) whether Begay's statements during the July 30, 2013, interview were voluntary. The Court concludes that: (i) Dr. Leo may testify about police interrogation tactics generally, but not about the application of such techniques to this case; (ii) Dr. Leo may not testify regarding false confessions, because the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has indicated that such testimony is unreliable; (iii) the Court will exclude Lucero's testimony, because it is irrelevant; (iv) Begay's July 18, 2013, interview was not a custodial interrogation; (v) Begay's statements during the July 18, 2013, interview were voluntary; (vi) Begay's July 19, 2013, interview was not a custodial interrogation; (vii) Begay's statements during the July 19, 2013, interview were voluntary; (viii) Begay validly waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights during the July 30, 2013, interview; and (ix) Begay's statements during the July 30, 2013, interview were voluntary. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Suppression Motion and grant in part and deny in part the Exclusion Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Court to state its essential findings on the record when deciding a motion that involves factual issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(d) (\"When factual issues are involved in deciding a motion, the court must state its essential findings on the record.\"). The findings of fact in this Memorandum Opinion and Order shall serve as the Court's essential findings for rule 12(d) purposes. The Court makes these findings under the authority of rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which requires a judge to decide preliminary questions relating to the admissibility of evidence, including the legality of a search or seizure and the voluntariness of an individual's confession or consent to a search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In deciding such preliminary questions, the other rules of evidence, except those with respect to privileges, do not bind the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 104(a).

Regarding the application of police interrogation techniques to this case, Dr. Leo's methodology involves listening to interrogation recordings, studying the transcripts,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   identifying which techniques were used, and what I think about those techniques in light of the issues that the attorney directs me to. If there is a fully recorded interrogation, then it's all there.

If the interrogation was not recorded, Dr. Leo's methodology involves interviewing those present at the interrogation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 210:16-25 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   82.

The police interrogation process is not designed for innocent people; rather \"it's designed for guilty people to move them from denial to admission.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 187:17-20 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   84. Police officers \"are taught and trained to make a judgment that somebody is guilty [of the] crime before they interrogate ... and that the goal of the interrogation is to get a confession.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 192:5-10 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   85. Police officers are often taught various techniques to get a confession, including, first, \"to convince the suspect he or she is caught; the evidence establishes their guilt ... [and] there is no way [out],\" Second Hearing Tr. at 195:4-6 (Leo), and, second, to induce \"a suspect to think that it's to their advantage, to their benefit, whether for moral or psychological or legal or other reasons to confess,\" Second Hearing Tr. at 195:9-12 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   86. Another interrogation technique is to minimize a confession's consequences or to magnify the consequences of refusing to confess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 194:4-9 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   87.

Regarding the frequency of false confessions,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   We cannot say how frequently [false confessions] occur, because there is no database maintained by the government or a private organization that makes all police interrogations available to us, from which we could do a random sample and then come up with an error rate or, you know, a false confession rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 223:17-23 (Leo)(alteration added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   91. Although social scientists have documented hundreds of false confessions, \"[w]hen we document a proven false confession, it's very hard to prove the negative.

The United States adds that at no point was Begay handcuffed or arrested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppression Response at 10. From these facts, the United States concludes that all three interviews were consensual encounters between Begay and the law enforcement agents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Suppression Response at 10, and that Begay made his statements voluntarily,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Suppression Response at 13.

Dr. Leo is a Professor of Law and Psychology at the University of San Francisco School of Law who plans to testify about false confessions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Hearing Exhibit O at 1. Lucero is a former New Mexico State Police officer and a certified polygraph examiner who plans to testify regarding polygraph procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Hearing Exhibit U at 1. The United States argues that the Court should not permit Dr. Leo or Lucero to testify, because neither have provided \"reports, any literature to support their testimony, or any analysis of what they reviewed in order to become familiar with this case.\" Exclusion Motion at 1. The United States contends that, without such information, Dr. Leo and Lucero \"failed to meet Rule 702's\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   requirements.\" Exclusion Motion at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Next, the United States avers that the Court should exclude Dr. Leo's testimony because it is not reliable, and that \"false confessions experts such as Leo are unable to accurately predict the frequency and causes of false confessions.\" Exclusion Motion at 3. The United States also anticipates that Dr. Leo will testify about \"law enforcement practices, training, and assumptions generally without tying them directly to the practices, training, or assumptions of the agents who interviewed the Defendant.\" Exclusion Motion at 6-7.

Begay continued that, contrary to his previous testimony, he did not read that portion of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   Form, but rather, Sullivan \"ran this by me.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 141:1-2 (Begay). Begay further contradicted Sullivan's testimony, saying that she had not read aloud parts of the forms nor did she have him read aloud any part of the forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 142:16-17 (Begay).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Begay then called his first expert witness, Dr. Leo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 174:22 (Samore). Dr. Leo testified that he is a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 176:1-9 (Leo). According to Dr. Leo, approximately thirty-five years of empirical research and dozens of peer-reviewed books exist on the topic of police interrogations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 176:19-25 (Leo). Dr. Leo testified that the study of police interrogations is generally accepted in the social scientific community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 177:15 (Leo). Dr. Leo continued that he has published dozens of peer-reviewed articles, and several books, and that he has \"been researching and writing in this area longer than almost anyone else.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 178:1-5 (Leo). Dr. Leo further stated that he has testified as an expert witness approximately 300 times over the past twenty years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 179:15 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Begay then offered Dr. Leo as an expert witness \"in the general areas of social psychology and criminology\" and in the areas of \"police interrogation, psychological coercion and involuntary confession.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 183:18-22 (Samore). The United States objected to Dr. Leo's admittance as an expert, arguing that \"he has provided no opinion,\" that \"there are problems with the methodology,\" and that, \"in this case, specifically, we don't have anything to rely on.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 184:1-6 (Wilson). The Court said that it would take Dr. Leo's testimony and later decide if Dr. Leo satisfies\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , but added that \"it doesn't sound like there is a disagreement that he's qualified to offer opinions in social psychology, criminology and ... police interrogation so I'll allow those opinions to be offered in this case. Then we'll decide whether they meet\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standards.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 184:12-21 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Dr. Leo then explained that the police interrogation process is not designed for innocent people; rather \"it's designed for guilty people to move them from denial to admission.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 187:17-20 (Leo). Dr. Leo distinguished between the terms \"interview\" and \"interrogate\" in the police context, explaining that \"there is no reason an innocent person should ever be interrogated according to police training,\" and that the police \"interview\" innocent\n   people rather than \"interrogating\" them. Second Hearing Tr. at 187:20-23 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Dr. Leo elaborated that a problem with police interrogations is that the police \"are taught and trained to make a judgment that somebody is guilty [of the] crime before they interrogate ... and that the goal of the interrogation is to get a confession.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 192:5-10 (Leo). According to Dr. Leo, \"when they say we're just trying to get the truth what they really mean is they're trying to get what they already believe to be the truth.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 192:10-13 (Leo). Dr. Leo explained that the police are taught techniques to get a confession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 192:24-25 (Leo). Specifically, according to Dr. Leo, police are taught to do two things: first, \"to convince the suspect he or she is caught, the evidence establishes their guilt ... [and] there is no way [out],\" and, second, to induce \"a suspect to think that it's to their advantage to their benefit whether moral or psychological or legal or other reasons to confess.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 192:25 (Leo);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 193:1-12 (Leo). Dr. Leo added that another technique is to minimize a confession's consequences, or to magnify the consequences of refusing to confess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 194:4-9 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Dr. Leo then discussed the interrogations that occurred in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. 213:20-21 (Leo). He testified that \"there were a number of interrogation techniques, some of which I've described, used on [July 18th, 2013].\" Second Hearing Tr. at 213:20-22 (Leo). Dr. Leo stated that, \"particularly on the 18[th], there had been many techniques used that were standard guilt presumptive.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 214:9-11 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Dr. Leo then spoke about Sullivan's unrecorded July 30, 2013 interview with Begay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 214:14-19 (Leo, Samore). Dr. Leo thought that \"this was a guilty presumptive interrogation,\" Second Hearing Tr. at 215:1-2 (Leo), because Sullivan was told that Begay's statements on July 18th, 2013 were confessions, and Sullivan assumed that Begay's statements were true,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 215:19-21 (Leo). Dr. Leo was also concerned about the way in which Sullivan described the July 30th interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 216:17-19 (Leo). Dr. Leo stated that the interview was not a polygraph pre-test,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   but rather, was an interrogation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 216:17-19 (Leo). Dr. Leo added that \"I'm concerned there was no recording, I think [Sullivan] should have recorded within FBI policy, this was not a pretest it was a guilt presumptive interrogation.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 217:5-8 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Dr. Leo then testified about false confessions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 232:14-17 (Leo). He stated that \"interrogators are trained when somebody says they don't remember a crime, don't tell them they remember. That increases the risk [of] false confessions.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 232:15-17 (Leo). Dr. Leo continued that \"we see this over and over again in the interrogation on the 18[th]. [Begay] keeps saying I don't remember.... There is a type of false confession where the person admits to something despite having no memory.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 232:18-22 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Dr. Leo elaborated that a sign of this false confession is conditional or subjunctive\n   language where the suspect says \"I could have done this, I probably did this. I would have done that, I might have done the other.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 232:24-25 (Leo); 233:1 (Leo). Dr. Leo stated that the July 18, 2013, interrogation \"is rife with this. Mr. Begay is essentially adopting their suggestion[s].\" Second Hearing Tr. at 233:4-5 (Leo). On cross-examination, however, when asked if he could say that a false confession occurred in this case, Dr. Leo stated: \"No, I think that would be outside the scope of my testimony.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 241:8-9 (Leo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Court continued the hearing on November 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 1:3-6 (Nayback, Court). Begay called Lucero to the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 4:14-15 (Court). Lucero testified that he is a licensed polygraph examiner in New Mexico,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 5:2-4 (Lucero), and that he previously worked for the New Mexico State Police for twenty-one years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 5:9-10 (Lucero). Lucero explained that, when he was a police officer, he was selected to go to polygraph school and attended the Baxter School of Lie Detection, where he received polygraph training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 6:8-11 (Lucero). He added that he has testified in New Mexico state courts fifty-seven times,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 11:4-5 (Lucero), and in federal courts three times,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 10:23-24 (Lucero).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Begay then offered Lucero as an expert in polygraphy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 11:10-11 (Samore). The United States objected and began to voir dire Lucero.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 11:13-14 (Nayback). On voir dire, Lucero stated that he planned to testify about polygraph standards that the American Polygraph Association makes, in contrast to federal polygraph policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 14:21-23 (Nayback, Lucero).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   On continuation of direct, Lucero spoke about polygraph pre-test procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 25:3-4 (Lucero). He explained that a polygraph pre-test interview usually takes twenty or thirty minutes, and that, in his opinion, a three-hour pre-test interview is not proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 25:3-10 (Lucero). He further stated that the only thing which the FBI does differently from the American Polygraph Association's standards is that the FBI does not record its polygraphs, including the pre-tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 25:12-19 (Samore, Lucero). Lucero continued that \"a polygraph is not set up to do an interrogation,\" Third Hearing Tr. at 31:17-18 (Lucero), and that, during the July 30, 2013 interview, Sullivan \"shifted away from the pre-test interview and actually went into a subtle interrogation,\" Third Hearing Tr. at 32:14-16 (Lucero).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The United States began cross-examining Lucero.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 34:3-6 (Court, Nayback). On cross-examination, Lucero stated that \"a polygraph test was not administered to Mr. Begay.\" Third Hearing Tr. at 34:15-16 (Lucero). At the conclusion of Lucero's testimony, the Court stated that it would allow Lucero to offer opinion testimony about polygraphy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 51:25 (Court). At the hearing's conclusion, the Court stated that it was inclined to admit Dr. Leo's testimony, at least partially,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 70:21-25 (Court); 71:1-5 (Court), and that its inclination was that Begay's statements were voluntary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Hearing Tr. at 71:22-24 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     RELEVANT LAW REGARDING EXPERT TESTIMONY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \"Since the Supreme Court of the United States decided\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

Further, although Sullivan may have started a polygraph pre-test during her July 30, 2013, interview with Begay, by Lucero's own admission, Sullivan \"shifted away from the pretest interview and actually went into a subtle interrogation.\" Third Hearing Tr. at 32:14-16 (Lucero); FOF \u00b6 100, at 19. Additionally, although the Court will not consider Dr. Leo's testimony regarding the extent to which the FBI used on Begay the interrogation tactics that Dr. Leo describes, Dr. Leo testified that Begay's July 30, 2013 interview with Sullivan was not a polygraph pre-test, but rather, was an interrogation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 216:17-19 (Leo); FOF \u00b6 88, at 17.

The Court concludes that Schaeffer and Boyd did not engage in prolonged accusatory questioning, but, rather, tried to minimize the gravity of a confession and to sympathize with Begay in an attempt to get him to admit that he engaged in sexual acts with Davis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First FBI Tr. at 38:6-7 (\"You know, I want to try to help you out.\")(Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 38:19-20 (\"You made a mistake, I understand that.

Indeed, the July 18, 2013, interview is filled, not with prolonged accusatory questioning, but rather, with questioning designed to\n   minimize or to sympathize with a confession.

Schaeffer and Boyd took Begay, by himself, into their Suburban for questioning,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Hearing Tr. at 165:18-25 (Schaeffer, Wilson);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 166:1-2 (Schaeffer, Wilson); FOF \u00b6 10, at 5, so they separated him from others and isolated him in a nonpublic questioning room,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   their Suburban. There were multiple officers, Schaeffer and Boyd, inside the vehicle with Begay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hearing Tr. at 165:18-25 (Schaeffer, Wilson);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 166:1-2 (Schaeffer, Wilson); FOF \u00b6 10, at 5. Although Schaeffer's firearm was not visible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Hearing Tr. at 164:10-17 (Schaeffer, Wilson); FOF \u00b6 5, at 5, Boyd's firearm was,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 22:12-14 (Boyd); FOF \u00b6 7, at 5, so at least one agent displayed a weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first four factors thus indicate a finding of police domination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The fifth and sixth factors, however, cut against police domination. Nothing in the record suggests that Schaeffer and Boyd physically contacted Begay, and the Court concludes that Schaeffer and Boyd's language did not suggest that Begay had to comply with their requests. On the contrary, Schaeffer told Begay, at the beginning of the interview, that Begay was not under arrest, that, if Begay wanted to stop the interview or to not answer a question, he could do those things, and that Begay was free to leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hearing Tr. at 168:1-14 (Schaeffer, Wilson); FOF \u00b6 17, at 6. Further, Begay confirmed that the interview was voluntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First FBI Tr. at 3:19 (Begay); FOF \u00b6 19, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Having analyzed all of the factors, the Court concludes that the FBI dominated the July 18, 2013 interview, because a majority of the police domination factors indicate such a finding, and because the Court does not find the two contrasting factors particularly weighty. The Court ultimately concludes, however, that the July 18, 2013, interview was not a custodial interrogation, because police domination is only one factor, and two of the three custodial interrogation factors cut against a custodial finding.

Nothing in the record indicates that Schaeffer and Boyd made any leniency promise to Begay during the July 18, 2013, interview. Further, the use of prolonged accusatory questioning from the custodial interrogation analysis may be relevant to determining which way this factor cuts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For the reasons explained above, the Court concludes that Begay's statements during the July 18, 2013, interview were voluntary, and the interview was not a custodial interrogation.

The Court has reviewed the Second FBI Transcript, documenting the July 19, 2013, interview,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second FBI Tr. at 3:3 (Schaeffer), and concludes that Schaeffer did not engage in prolonged, accusatory questioning. Rather, Schaeffer engaged in little questioning at all and allowed Begay to speak at length about topics, including his family history and his relationship with Davis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second FBI Tr. at 10:8-25 (Begay, Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 11:1-25 (Begay, Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 37:9-25 (Begay, Schaeffer).

Several factors indicate police domination of the encounter: (i) separating the suspect from others who could lend moral support; (ii) isolating the suspect in nonpublic questioning rooms; (iii) the threatening presence of multiple officers; (iv) displaying of weapons by an officer; (v) physical contact with the suspect; and (vi) use of language or vocal tones which suggest that compliance with an officer's request is compulsory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Additionally, nothing in the record suggests that Schaeffer displayed a weapon during the July 19, 2013, interview, or that Schaeffer physically contacted Begay. Finally, nothing suggests that Schaeffer used language or vocal tones implying that Begay was required to comply with his requests. The only real request that Schaeffer made was when Schaeffer asked Begay if Begay was willing to take a polygraph examination, and Begay agreed to take a polygraph.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hearing Tr. at 181:17-21 (Wilson, Schaeffer); FOF \u00b6 34, at 8.

Like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Toles\n   </em>\n   , Begay has a GED.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppression Motion at 1; FOF \u00b6 68, at 14. Further Begay was approximately twenty-six years old at the time of the FBI interviews, making him several years older than the defendant in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nothing in the record indicates that Schaeffer made any leniency promise to Begay during the July 19, 2013, interview. Further, the use of prolonged accusatory questioning from the custodial interrogation analysis may be relevant to determining which way this factor cuts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As explained above, Schaeffer did not engage in prolonged, accusatory questioning, but rather, engaged in little questioning at all and allowed Begay to speak at length about topics, including his family history and his relationship with Davis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second FBI Tr. at 10:8-25 (Begay, Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 11:1-25 (Begay, Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 37:9-25 (Begay, Schaeffer). The third factor therefore suggests voluntariness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   The fourth factor, \"whether the defendant was advised of his constitutional rights,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For the reasons explained above, the Court concludes that Begay's statements during the July 19, 2013, interview were voluntary, and the interview was not a custodial interrogation.

The Court therefore concludes that the first factor indicates voluntariness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   The second factor, the detention length, also indicates voluntariness. The unrecorded portion of the July 30, 2013, interview with Begay lasted about three hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 136:9-13 (Begay); FOF \u00b6 62, at 13.

The Tenth Circuit has ruled that a custody length of five hours \"weighs in favor of voluntariness.\"\n   <em>\n    Sharp v.

Given Begay's 4.5 hour interview, the Court concludes that the detention-length factor indicates voluntariness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   The third factor, the questioning's length and nature, cuts against voluntariness, \"based upon the totality of the circumstances, considering ... the details of the interrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

During the interview, Sullivan \"was very talkative and she had almost more to say than [Begay] did, in fact anytime [Begay] had a chance to speak she would ... stop [Begay] and ... imply and suggest ... whatever direction she wanted to take it.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 136:9-13 (Begay); FOF \u00b6 57, at 13. Further, although Sullivan did not yell at Begay, she made \"little outbursts here and there ... where she was displease[d] at what [Begay] was saying.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 140:6-11 (Nayback, Begay); FOF \u00b6 58, at 13. Finally, Begay \"felt as though that if [he] didn't answer according to her that [he] wasn't going to be able to leave.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 95:14-16 (Begay); FOF \u00b6 60, at 13. Essentially, Sullivan's questioning was aggressive, prolonged, and accusatory. Such questioning contrasts with Schaeffer's on July 18, 2013, in which he tried to minimize the gravity of a confession and to sympathize with Begay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First FBI Tr. at 38:6-7 (\"You know, I want to try to help you out.\")(Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:19-20 (\"[Y]ou made a mistake, I understand that. Stuff happens.\")(Schaeffer). Sullivan's questioning also differs from Schaeffer's July 19, 2013, interview, in which he allowed Begay to speak at length about topics including his family history and his relationship with Davis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second FBI Tr. at 10:8-25 (Begay, Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 11:1-25 (Begay, Schaeffer);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 37:9-25 (Begay, Schaeffer). The Court therefore concludes that this factor cuts against voluntariness \"based upon the totality of the circumstances, considering ... the details of the interrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"969607\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/437/1059/#p1063\">\n    437 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted).

The fifth factor, \"whether the defendant was subject to physical punishment,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"969607\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/437/1059/#p1063\">\n    437 F.3d at 1063-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , indicates voluntariness, because nothing in the record suggests that the agents physically punished Begay in any way during the July 30, 2013, interview. Four of the five voluntariness factors therefore indicate that Begay's statements were voluntary. For the reasons explained above, the Court concludes that Begay's\n   statements during the July 30, 2013, interview were voluntary, and Begay validly waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. The Court will therefore not suppress the evidence relating to the July 30, 2013, interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   In sum, the Court's impression of Begay is that he is intelligent and made voluntary statements to agents on multiple occasions. He tried to talk his way out of the allegations, and that attempt fared badly. He should not have-at least without an attorney-been so agreeable to interviews by skilled law enforcement agents. In the end, Begay's actions were not involuntary, but just bad decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the requests in the Motion to Suppress Statement and Supportive Memorandum, filed July 22, 2014 (Doc. 28), are denied; and (ii) the requests in the United States' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony from Suppression Hearing, filed August 16, 2017 (Doc. 128), are granted in part and denied in part. Evidence relating to Defendant Lyle Woody Begay's July 18, 2013, July 19, 2013, and July 30, 2013, FBI interviews will not be suppressed. Richard Leo may testify at trial regarding police interrogation techniques generally, but not about the application of such techniques to this case, about false confessions, or about why people may falsely confess.

Begay testified that Sullivan did not read the Polygraph Consent Form to him, but rather \"explained what it was and kind of left it for me to read myself.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 77:12-14 (Begay). Begay further testified that, when Sullivan showed him the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    Form, \"at no point in time did she have me recite anything, nor did she read anything off of the form or anything.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 130:12-14 (Begay). The Court accepts Sullivan's version of events, because Sullivan, who is now a retired FBI agent,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    First Hearing Tr. at 5:10 (Sullivan), has nothing to gain from potentially perjuring herself, whereas Begay has charges pending against him, and has incentive to lie. The Court observed Sullivan's and Begay's demeanor on the stand, and found Sullivan credible when her testimony differed from Begay's, and did not find Begay credible when he differed from Sullivan. That Begay contradicted his testimony of having read and understood the Polygraph Consent Form,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Second Hearing Tr. at 99:17-21 (Nayback, Begay)(stating that he read and understood the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    Form and the Polygraph Consent Form); Second Hearing Tr. at 108:15-17 (Begay)(stating \"I skimmed through [the Polygraph Consent Form] not having [read] and comprehended word for word as I did and do [right] now\")(alterations added), also underscores his credibility in relation to Sullivan's.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-324\">\n    The Court recognizes that Begay later contradicted his testimony of having read and understood at least one of these two forms. When first asked if he had read the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    Form and the Polygraph Consent Form, he responded \"I read them.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 99:17-19 (Nayback, Begay). When asked if he understood them, he responded \"Yes.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 99:21 (Nayback, Begay). Begay later contradicted himself, however, stating, \"I skimmed through [the Polygraph Consent Form] not having [read] and comprehended word for word as I did and do [right] now.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 108:15-17 (Begay)(alterations added). Given that Begay at one point testified that he read and understood both forms, and that Sullivan testified, regarding the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    Form, that \"when we went over the form and he was advised of his rights, I certainly understood that he knew what each of the rights meant,\" First Hearing Tr. at 136:5-7 (Sullivan), the Court finds that Begay read and understood the forms. The Court accepts Sullivan's version of events, because Sullivan, who is now a retired FBI agent,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    First Hearing Tr. at 5:10 (Sullivan), has nothing to gain from potentially perjuring herself, whereas Begay has charges pending against him, and has incentive to lie.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    Begay's testimony contradicts Sullivan's. According to Begay, Sullivan said that, if Begay confessed that he was an adult when he allegedly molested Davis, and that he sexually desired to molest her, then Sullivan could get Begay's family some form of help such as family counseling.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Second Hearing Tr. at 93:12-25 (Begay);\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 94:1-22 (Begay);\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 95:10-14 (Begay). In contrast, when Sullivan was asked if she made \"any promises of leniency such as counseling or family therapy,\" First Hearing Tr. at 33:8-10 (Nayback), Sullivan responded: \"Never. I don't do that. I've never done that. Nor was there any discussion about family counseling.\" First Hearing Tr. at 33:11-13 (Sullivan). The Court accepts Sullivan's version of events because, as explained above, Sullivan is now a retired FBI agent,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    First Hearing Tr. at 5:10 (Sullivan), and has nothing to gain from potentially perjuring herself, whereas Begay has charges pending against him, and has incentive to lie. If Sullivan had said that she sometimes makes promises of leniency, but did not here, then Begay's testimony might have some weight, but given that Sullivan testified that she never makes such promises, and Begay offers no evidence that she has done so in other cases, the Court credits Sullivan's testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    According to Lucero, in a polygraph pre-test, the examiner establishes that the examinee is suitable for a polygraph, explains to the examinee how a polygraph works, and ensures that the examinee knows about the allegations against him.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Third Hearing Tr. at 25:3-7 (Lucero).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-327\">\n    The Backster School of Lie Detection is a polygraph training school located in San Diego, California.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \"Contact Information,\" Backster School of Lie Detection, http://backster.net/info.asp (last viewed January 8, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-328\">\n    At the hearing, Schaeffer clarified that this \"shotgun\" was actually the M-4 carbine described above.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    First Hearing Tr. at 167:15-17 (Schaeffer).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-329\">\n    Fed.

The Court continues to think that the law should be more nuanced than the Tenth Circuit wants.

Jurors may not, however, know this reality. It seems useful to let an expert tell the jury that there are false confessions. After all, the Tenth Circuit says a jury should scrutinize confessions with care. Specifically, the \"Voluntariness of Statement by Defendant\" Tenth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction says that evidence relating to a defendant's statement \"should always be considered by you with caution and weighed with care. You should give any such statement the weight you think it deserves, after considering all the circumstances under which the statement was made.\" Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction Committee of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\n    <strong>\n     CRIMINAL PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n    </strong>\n    1.25, at 38 (\n    <strong>\n     2011 Edition\n    </strong>\n    Updated January 2017)(VOLUNTARINESS OF STATEMENT BY DEFENDANT). It seems odd to give this jury instruction, and then not let an expert tell the jury that there are false confessions and why people who give false confessions do so. The Court would, on a clean slate, give the jurors the tools to take the defendant's statements \"with caution.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-339\">\n    The Court could distinguish the Tenth Circuit's decisions in\n    <em>\n     United States v. Benally\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     United States v. Adams\n    </em>\n    , because the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district courts' exclusions of false confessions expert testimony, but did not say that the admission of such expert testimony would be an abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The Tenth Circuit might affirm, under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the admission of a false confessions expert, but that argument would probably be slicing the bologna too thinly and would be disrespectful to the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit-at least five of its judges-has indicated that it does not like false confessions expert testimony. The Court wishes that the law it could apply was more nuanced and a little friendlier to defendants, who, under pressure, make confessions. Nevertheless, the Court must, and will, follow Tenth Circuit authority which holds that it is not only appropriate to exclude false confessions experts, but also strongly suggests that district courts should not permit such experts to testify.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-340\">\n    Although the Court finds that Begay did not see the FBI's M-4 carbine inside the Suburban,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    First Hearing Tr. at 210:11-23 (Schaeffer); FOF \u00b6 14, at 6, the Court notes that, even if Begay saw the M-4, it would not change the Court's analysis, because that additional information would not outweigh the other evidence indicating that the interrogation was not custodial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-341\">\n    Begay does not appear to say anything particularly damaging during the July 19, 2013, interview.
