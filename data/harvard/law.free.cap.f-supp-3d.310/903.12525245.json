Doc. 10. At issue is whether the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") erred in a decision issued on January 19, 2016 by finding Plaintiff not \"disabled\" and therefore unentitled to Disability Insurance Benefits (\"DIB\"). This case is before the Court on Plaintiff's Statement of Errors (doc. 13), the Commissioner's memorandum in opposition (doc. 12), Plaintiff's reply (doc. 13), the administrative record (docs. 6, 7),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiff claims disability as a result of a number of alleged impairments including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , cervical spine degenerative disc disease, bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees, lumbar spine degenerative disc disease, irritable bowel syndrome, residuals of right shoulder injury and corrective surgery, affective (depressive) disorder, and anxiety.

ALJ Bruning issued a decision on September 7, 2010 finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 148-57.

ALJ Lombardo issued a decision on July 12, 2013 finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 71-90.

First, records from Drs.

On mental status examination, Drs.

PageID 1236-42, 1812-14.

In reviewing the arguments presented by the parties, the undersigned agrees with Plaintiff that the ALJ erred in relying on the opinions of non-examining sources who did not review the complete record, including numerous objective imaging findings. As set forth above, Drs. Cruz, Bolz, and Terry-upon whom the ALJ relied in determining the RFC-did not review the entire body of medical evidence, and specifically, the extensive objective imaging findings relied upon by Drs. Pan, Atiq, Hill, Hoover, and Mathai.

Therefore the only medical opinions remaining are those of treating sources Drs.
