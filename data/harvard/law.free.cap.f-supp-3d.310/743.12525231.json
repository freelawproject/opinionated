Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a record producer, singer, and songwriter residing in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. (Doc. 51 at 2). Defendant is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California that is engaged in the business of manufacturing, distributing, and selling records in various mediums and formats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tyga Music, LLC (\"Tyga Music\") is an entity formed to furnish the recording services of Michael Stevenson (\"Tyga\") exclusively to Young Money Entertainment, LLC (\"Young Money\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Young Money is \"party to an agreement\" with Cash Money Records, Inc. (\"Cash Money\") providing Cash Money the right to exclusively manufacture, distribute, promote, and exploit\n   records from Young Money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). At all relevant times, Defendant exclusively provided Cash Money access to record manufacturing and distribution services \"throughout the World.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2011, Plaintiff produced a wordless musical composition entitled \"Molly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He was the owner of the copyright in this composition and \"all exclusive rights under copyright.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2012, Plaintiff signed an agreement offering to \"convey\" Molly to Tyga Music so that Tyga could add lyrics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Tyga Music agreed to pay Plaintiff an advance of $10,000 plus royalties based on the sale of the completed composition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After Tyga added lyrics, Tyga and Tyga Music \"conveyed\" copyright in the completed composition to Young Money and Cash Money \"and/or their agents and assigns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At some later date, Young Money or Cash Money \"conveyed\" copyright in the completed composition to Defendant, which began exploiting it as a single in March 2013 and on Tyga's album in April 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Tyga Music never paid Plaintiff the advance or the full value of the royalties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). Therefore, Plaintiff filed suit in state court and, in April 2015, the agreement between Plaintiff and Tyga Music was judicially dissolved, with the court reserving to Plaintiff the right to seek damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June 2015, Plaintiff sent Cash Money and Defendant a cease-and-desist letter notifying them that the agreement between him and Tyga Music had been dissolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In August 2015, Plaintiff filed a copyright registration for the version of Molly without lyrics and has received confirmation of the filing of his copyright case and made a \"complete material deposit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Plaintiff, Plaintiff and Defendant are the co-owners of the completed composition \"[b]y virtue of the exclusive transfer of copyright ownership by [Tyga], Tyga Music, Young Money and/or Cash Money to [Defendant] (i.e. [Defendant] stepping into the shoes of [Tyga], Tyga Music, Young Money and/or Cash Money) and the dissolution of the September 1, 2012 Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Defendant has sold thousands of copies of Tyga's album and of the completed composition, and also has leased, licensed, or rented the completed composition, but Defendant has failed to pay Plaintiff his share of the income earned from the completed composition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). Plaintiff also contends that Defendant \"claims to be the exclusive transferee of copyright\" in the completed composition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the foregoing grounds, Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint seeks an accounting of the profits earned from the completed composition and alleges claims of \"unjust enrichment/quantum meruit/constructive trust,\" conversion, and negligence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This action was initiated on September 9, 2015, by the filing of a Complaint (Doc. 1), which was superseded almost immediately by an Amended Complaint (Doc. 2). In relevant part, the Amended Complaint alleged that Plaintiff was the sole copyright holder in Molly and that Defendant had infringed Plaintiff's \"copyright and exclusive rights under copyright\" by distributing or selling Molly without Plaintiff's \"permission or consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). The Amended Complaint also raised state law claims for \"unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent business practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings, (Doc. 16), and the Court ultimately granted the motion, (Doc. 44). The\n   Court analyzed the authorship of the completed composition and ruled that \"the evidence, even viewed in light most favorable to Plaintiff, indisputably shows that [the completed composition] was a joint work by [Tyga] and Plaintiff. Therefore, they are co-authors and co-owners.\" (Doc. 44 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court then considered the scope of the rights that Tyga could convey or license to Cash Money and, ultimately, to Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-24). The Court ruled that Tyga could grant an \"exclusive license\" as to his own interest but not as to Plaintiff's interest; \"Plaintiff, for all intents and purposes, may regard the alleged 'exclusive license' as a nonexclusive license that does not infringe upon his copyright.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). The Court also dismissed Plaintiff's state law claims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-31). Plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of his state law claims, arguing that diversity jurisdiction existed. (Doc. 45). The Court ruled that it would permit Plaintiff to further amend his pleadings to clearly allege diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 48 at 10, 15). The Court also stated that Plaintiff was \"free to allege additional state law causes of action under the facts currently alleged.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). It also stated that Plaintiff would not be permitted \"leave to allege new factual allegations to which Defendants did not already have notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (\"Plaintiff will not be permitted to state new factual allegations in his amended complaint.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Third Amended Complaint was filed June 7, 2017. (Doc. 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. (Doc. 54 at 1). First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's allegation that he and Defendant co-own the completed composition is a \"new factual allegation\" of which Defendant did not have notice and is inconsistent with his prior allegations and theories and the Court's prior ruling. (Doc. 54-1 at 6-7). Relatedly, Defendant argues that, consistent with the Court's prior ruling, it is a licensee, not a co-owner, and as such it is not susceptible to a claim for an accounting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that the Copyright Act preempts Plaintiff's unjust enrichment, conversion, and negligence claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-16). Defendant further maintains that Plaintiff's unjust enrichment, conversion, and negligence claims are prescribed under state law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17). Finally, Defendant argues that (1) unjust enrichment is unavailable because Plaintiff has other remedies at law; (2) Plaintiff's conversion claim fails because he did not allege interference with \"a moveable or chattel\"; and (3) Plaintiff's negligence claim fails because he has not alleged facts to support the conclusion that Defendant owed him a duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff first claims that Defendant is a transferee of a co-ownership interest in the completed composition because it received an exclusive license from Cash Money to distribute \"Cash Money product\" in the United States. (Doc. 60 at 4-7). Next, Plaintiff argues that Defendant did not timely oppose the filing of the Third Amended Complaint and that Defendant had notice of Plaintiff's allegations, as they are based on Defendant's \"agreements with Cash Money, the scope of the rights granted and the legal effect of the exclusive grant of rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8). Plaintiff argues that, because Defendant and Plaintiff are co-owners of \"at least some quantum of copyright,\" an action for accounting is proper, and the Court should deny the Motion or delay ruling until discovery is complete. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that his claims for unjust enrichment, conversion, and negligence are not preempted by the Copyright Act and that the prescriptive period for these claims began to run in June 2015, when Defendant continued distributing the song after receiving a cease-and-desist letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). Plaintiff also requests that, if the Court considers this motion as a motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff receive an opportunity to be heard and present further materials in opposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In reply, Defendant reiterates the arguments raised in its Motion, arguing that the opposition does not meaningfully address the Motion's arguments regarding unjust enrichment, conversion, or negligence. (Doc. 61 at 1-3). With respect to Plaintiff's request for an accounting, Defendant reiterates that it is not a co-owner of the completed composition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Motion seeks dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, summary judgment. (Doc. 54 at 1). The Court will set forth both standards and then determine which standard to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The standard, under the specific language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), remains that the defendant be given adequate notice of the claim and the grounds upon which it is based. The standard is met by the \"reasonable inference\" the court must make that, with or without discovery, the facts set forth a plausible claim for relief under a particular theory of law provided that there is a \"reasonable expectation\" that \"discovery will reveal relevant evidence of\n   each element of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Lormand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642025\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/228/#p257\">\n    565 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   257 ;\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , [550] U.S. at 556,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p556\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Diamond Servs. Corp. v.

A transferee however has an absolute duty to account to all of the joint owners. It is, then, obvious that the sometimes shadowy distinction between\n   a license and a transfer may become crucial for these purposes.... Under the current Act a grant of any exclusive right comprised in a copyright is treated in the same manner as an assignment (either of which is called a \"transfer\") while a non-exclusive grant is not a \"transfer\" but only a license.\n   <em>\n    Since ... a grant executed by less than all of the joint owners of a copyright is necessarily non-exclusive, it follows that any such grant constitutes a non-exclusive license. Under the current Act is an exclusive licensee of certain limited rights to be regarded as a transferee for the purpose of subjecting him to a duty to account to the other owners of the work? It appears that there is no such duty\n   </em>\n   , and that, indeed, there is no relationship of joint ownership as between such a transferee and the transferring joint owners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   1\n   <em>\n    Nimmer on Copyright\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.12(C)(3) (2017) (emphasis added). Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Siegel v. Warner Bros. Entm't Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Central District of California analyzed a similar issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs ... take a different view of the licenses, arguing that \"Warner has stepped exclusively into DC's shoes with respect to such motion picture and television copyrights.\" In other words, the exclusive license had the net effect of substituting WBEI for DC Comics as a joint owner with plaintiffs (assuming the successful termination of the 1938 grant) insofar as the exploitation of the copyright in the mediums in which those licenses are concerned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   This theory, however, requires large legal leaps that are not countenanced by current law. To begin, in order for an exclusive license in the entirety of the interest in a joint work itself (such as Superman) to be effective, the consent of both joint owners in the copyrighted work is required. The same requirement for prior consent holds true even with respect to the wholesale transfer of exclusive licenses in subparts to a copyright, such as a license transferring all the stage rights (not just the joint owner's rights) to a novel but not the movie or literary rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Such consent simply did not occur here. DC Comics unilaterally sought to give an exclusive license to the entirety in the Superman property's movie and television rights to WBEI post-termination. As a result, the attempt to provide an exclusive license was ineffective. At best, all that was conveyed was a non-exclusive license, and, at worst, a license agreement whose terms are null and void absent ratification by plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Applying these principles in a vacuum, the Court would readily reach the conclusion championed by defendants: WBEI, as a licensee, is answerable only to DC Comics as its licensor; that DC Comics is the only entity that must account for profits to plaintiffs; and, absent exploitation of the works by DC Comics itself, that DC Comics' accounting to plaintiffs is limited to those profits derived from licensing the Superman copyright to WBEI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771498\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/542/1098/#p1143\">\n    542 F.Supp.2d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143-44 (C.D.

In analyzing a similar claim for an accounting, the Eastern District of Louisiana ruled as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Scantlin recognizes that if Burkitt has any claim against him based on copyright, it is a claim for an accounting. On the other hand, the Universal Defendants contend that plaintiffs have no right of action for an accounting against them because they are licensees and not co-owners. Plaintiffs acknowledge the general rule that licensees are not subject to accounting claims by co-owners. However, plaintiffs maintain that the Universal Defendants were granted an\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   license which is a transfer of ownership, thereby subjecting them to plaintiffs' accounting claims. Plaintiffs' argument is without merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   An exclusive license can only be accomplished by agreement of all co-owners. Because plaintiffs maintain that they did not consent to the license granted to the Universal Defendants, any license granted by Scantlin merely granted a license of the rights of the copyright owner, i.e. a non-exclusive license, rather than a transfer of ownership which is a transfer of all of the rights, i.e. an exclusive license. While a transfer of rights and/or ownership could not be effected by Scantlin alone, the absence of plaintiffs' permission does not nullify the licensing agreement itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Taking the factual allegation of plaintiffs' amended complaint as true, Scantlin, without plaintiffs' consent or authorization, only granted a non-exclusive license to the Universal Defendants, thereby making the Universal Defendants licensees. As plaintiffs concede, a licensee is free from liability to a co-owner for an accounting. Accordingly, plaintiffs' claims for an accounting against the Universal Defendants are dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13-14 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the reasons set forth in these authorities, and indeed for many of the same reasons the Court previously discussed, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 22-23), the conduct alleged by Plaintiff could give rise to, at most, a non-exclusive license.
