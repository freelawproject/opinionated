They seek an injunction ordering the District not to destroy the unattended personal belongings of homeless residents without first storing them for 60 days so they can be reclaimed. They seek to represent a proposed class consisting of all homeless persons who reside in public spaces that are subject to District, rather than federal, government oversight and have been or will be subject to encampment clearings by the District. Now before me are Plaintiffs' Motions for a Preliminary Injunction and for Class Certification. Because the Plaintiffs have not made the showing required to justify either a preliminary injunction or class certification, both of which are exceptional measures, the Plaintiffs' motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The basic facts of this case are undisputed. The District of Columbia has adopted a Protocol for the Disposition of Property Found on Public Space and Outreach to Displaced Persons. Compl. Ex. 2. By following this Protocol, the District provides homeless individuals an opportunity to prevent their property from being destroyed if they wish to keep it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   at Exs. 3, 4; Defs.'

That said, the Protocol does not specifically address the proper treatment of property that appears to be abandoned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the District destroyed Plaintiffs' personal property and the personal property of other homeless individuals upon finding it unattended-and, according to the District, apparently abandoned-in public spaces. Compl. Decls. of Charlaine Braxton (Braxton Decl.) and Shanel Proctor (Proctor Decl.);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Exs. 3-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The District of Columbia's Protocol\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Protocol applies to property left in public spaces maintained by the District \"when the property left in the public space presents a security, health, or safety risk, interferes with community use of public space, or becomes a significant community nuisance.\" Compl. Ex. 2, 3. The Protocol establishes a detailed procedure for standard disposition of this property, providing District employees a guide to follow before, during, and after cleanup of a public space where homeless individuals have an encampment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Protocol has three main purposes. Horen Decl. \u00b6 5. First, it seeks to address immediate and persistent public health and safety concerns, including concern about homeless people's exposure to the elements, the risk of fires caused by cooking and heating inside tents, the spread of disease caused by improper disposal of human waste and by vermin attracted to garbage and food waste, and the use of closed tents as sites for drug use and prostitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it seeks to \"enroll residents in safer, healthier living arrangements through an array of housing, mental health, and other services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Third, it seeks to ensure that public spaces are clean and accessible to the public.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before cleaning an encampment, the Protocol directs District employees to post conspicuous signs throughout the immediate vicinity identifying the area to be cleaned, stating the date and time of the cleanup, warning that items left in the area at the time of the cleanup will be subject to removal and disposal, and providing the contact information of homeless support agencies. Compl. Ex. 2, 4. An initial notice is posted 14 days before cleanup, and a final notice is posted at least 48 hours before cleanup.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The District of Columbia's Practice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The District of Columbia's actual conduct of encampment cleanups appears to be informed by the Protocol's orientation toward assisting homeless people while maintaining clean public spaces. The parties do not dispute that the District posts notice before conducting a cleanup, as the Protocol directs. There does appear to be some tension between the Protocol's instruction that the notice should include a warning that \"any items not removed by the cleanup deadline are subject to removal and disposal\" and the sign's actual warning that items not removed by the cleanup time \"are subject to removal and disposal\"\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the items are personal belongings packed in containers provided for storage or are personal belongings in plain sight of obvious value.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Horen Decl. \u00b6 12. But in addition to posting notice, outreach workers visit the site several times in the weeks before a cleanup to determine who lives there, to explain what will happen, and to explain that tents and other belongings may be preserved by moving them or by packing them for temporary storage by the District.

Even so, the District will sometimes discard documents, functional tents, and other items that the Protocol says should not be discarded, if DHS staff determine that the property is clearly abandoned or at least can be considered abandoned.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing designation and treatment of property deemed to be abandoned);\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Mot.

For example, if the District learns that the property owner has been detained or hospitalized, the property is reviewed for storage rather than considered abandoned and discarded.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Decl.

When asked to point to their most flagrant evidence of a Fourth Amendment violation, Plaintiffs' counsel highlighted the destruction of Ms. Proctor's property. Tr. 25. But it is far from clear that the destruction of either of the Plaintiffs' property was unconstitutional. Ms. Proctor's bedding, clothing, food, documents, and other items were destroyed during an encampment cleanup because outreach workers had not been able to contact her during any of their visits during the two-week notice period, other encampment residents did not know who owned the tent, and other encampment residents reported that they had not seen the owners \"in a while.\" Proctor Decl. \u00b6 5; Horen Decl. \u00b6 59.

On the record as it currently stands, I agree that the District could reasonably conclude Plaintiffs had abandoned their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even if the destruction of Plaintiffs' property were unconstitutional, Plaintiffs have not shown that it took place under a custom of the District of Columbia that is actionable under Section 1983. Although the District has discarded unattended property on occasion, the record does not show that it has done so under circumstances that made an abandonment determination unreasonable. The record shows that homeless individuals often abandon property in public places when they acquire new property, move, or obtain housing. Horen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 30, 88. The District does have a policy and practice of cleaning up abandoned property. But as explained above, the District takes extensive precautions to reduce the risk of destroying property that is wanted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.

Reply ISO Mot. Prelim. Inj.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Horen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 53. Plaintiffs may be right. But it is unnecessary for me to decide this question because the record contains no clear examples of the District deeming property abandoned based on the simple fact that notice was posted and the property was left unattended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the contrary, the record contains several examples of the District evaluating a combination of circumstances to determine whether property had been abandoned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Plaintiffs do not suggest\n   that they were misled by the notices, or even read them. Even if the District has sometimes made unreasonable abandonment determinations, the Plaintiffs have not adequately showed either that their constitutional rights were violated or that any violations that occurred resulted from a District custom actionable under Section 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs' heavy reliance on\n   <em>\n    Lavan\n   </em>\n   does not help their case. In\n   <em>\n    Lavan\n   </em>\n   , the City of Los Angeles posted only a general notice that cleanups could happen anywhere in the Skid Row district on any weekday between 8:00 a.m and 11 a.m., leaving homeless residents of Skid Row unable to anticipate exactly when or where a cleanup would take place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lavan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519411\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1022/\">\n    693 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Callahan, J., dissenting).

Horen Decl. \u00b6 10.

Ex 9. The District's practice is unquestionably much more narrowly tailored and respectful of the rights and property of its homeless residents than the practice at issue in\n   <em>\n    Lavan\n   </em>\n   . Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Lavan\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here have failed to establish a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights and have failed to establish an unconstitutional District custom actionable under Section 1983. For both these reasons, they have not made a clear showing of a likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The second point on which Plaintiffs must make a clear showing is that they would suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief.\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172291\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/1/#p6\">\n    838 F.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As explained above, Plaintiffs have not made a clear showing that the District has a pattern of\n   destroying property in violation of the Fourth Amendment. And if the District schedules another cleanup that affects Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs can protect their property by moving it or designating it for storage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiffs have not made an adequate showing on the second prong of the test for evaluating a preliminary injunction motion. Although they have identified an irremediable harm, they have not shown that they would suffer this harm without preliminary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The third and fourth points that the Plaintiffs must show are that the balance of the equities and the public interest favor injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172291\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/1/#p6\">\n    838 F.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Memo. ISO Mot. Prelim. Inj., 9-10; Pls.' Reply ISO Mot. Prelim. Inj., 9. As has already been explained, it is not clear that denying a preliminary injunction would lead to the Plaintiffs suffering any deprivation of their constitutional rights. On the other hand, the District's cleanup efforts serve the important interests of public health and public safety, and the relief the Plaintiffs propose would impede these efforts. A court order directing the District to store all unattended property except property that poses a public health or safety risk would likely chill the exercise of discretion inherent in determining what items pose such risks and would also impose on the District the unnecessary and potentially significant cost of storing abandoned property. The balance of the equities and the public interest tip in favor of the District, like the other factors that I have considered above. The Plaintiffs are thus not entitled to a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
