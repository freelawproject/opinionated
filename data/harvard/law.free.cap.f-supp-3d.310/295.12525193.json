(\"Ace\"), as subrogee of Eric Slifka, initiated this action against Oyster Harbors Marine, Inc. (\"Oyster Harbors\") concerning a vessel that was sold by Oyster Harbors to Slifka and later sustained fire damage. Additional parties have since joined the case, including the vessel's manufacturer, Regulator Marine, Inc. (\"Regulator\"), the distributor and installer of the vessel's bow thruster, Florida Bow Thrusters, Inc. (\"Florida Bow\"), and the manufacturer of the bow thruster, Vetus Maxwell, Inc. (\"Vetus Maxwell\"). Currently pending before the Court are Florida Bow's motions to dismiss Vetus Maxwell's crossclaims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue [ECF No. 52] and for failure to state a claim [ECF No. 56]. For the reasons that follow, the Court\n   <em>\n    GRANTS\n   </em>\n   the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue [ECF No. 52] and\n   <em>\n    DENIES\n   </em>\n   the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as moot. [ECF No. 56].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2011, Oyster Harbors, located in Massachusetts, agreed to purchase a 34-foot yacht later named \"E=mc\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   \" (the \"Vessel\") from Regulator, the Vessel's manufacturer. [ECF No. 7 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8] (\"Complaint\"). The sale included the installation of a Vetus Maxwell brand bow thruster on the Vessel. Compl. \u00b6 17; [ECF No. 65-6 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8]. Regulator engaged Florida Bow, a distributor of Vetus Maxwell products, to perform the installation, which was completed prior to the Vessel being transported to Massachusetts. [ECF No. 45 at 15-16]; [ECF No. 53-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21]; [ECF No. 65-6 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 15]. Shortly after completing the purchase of the Vessel, Oyster Harbors sold the Vessel to Slifka. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. A few years later, on or around July 11, 2014, Slifka was operating the Vessel in the Nantucket Harbor when a fire ignited onboard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. After noticing a burning odor and seeing smoke near the Vessel's center console,\n   Slifka moored the Vessel, turned off the battery, and boarded another boat that was passing by.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. Although the fire severely burned the Vessel, no other person or property appears to have been injured or damaged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ace, as subrogee of Slifka, brought the initial lawsuit against Oyster Harbors pursuant to this Court's admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), seeking to recover at least $200,000 for the damage to the Vessel and asserting claims for breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and the implied warranty of merchantability, negligence, and strict liability. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-34. Oyster Harbors then filed a third-party complaint against Regulator for breach of warranty, indemnification, and contribution. [ECF No. 10 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-22]. Following an inspection of the Vessel by the parties on July 15, 2016, Ace's expert determined that the Vessel's bow thruster was the likely cause of the fire. [ECF No. 34 at 1]. The parties suspended the examination of the evidence to notify Florida Bow and Vetus Maxwell of the potential claims against them and to invite them to participate in the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On July 27, 2016, the Court granted the parties' joint motion to stay the action for 60 days. [ECF Nos. 33, 35]. Regulator eventually filed a fourth-party complaint against Florida Bow and Vetus Maxwell, asserting claims for breach of warranty, negligence, strict liability, common law indemnification, and contribution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 41]. Vetus Maxwell in turn filed counterclaims for common law indemnification and contribution against Regulator, a crossclaim for common law indemnification against Oyster Harbors, and crossclaims for express and implied contractual indemnification, common law indemnification, contribution, and breach of contract against Florida Bow. [ECF No. 45]. On February 13, 2018, the Court held a hearing on Florida Bow's pending motion to dismiss Vetus Maxwell's crossclaims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Jurisdictional Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Florida Bow is a family-owned corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Florida with its principal office in Florida. [ECF No. 53-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5]. It has never had an office in Massachusetts; been registered to do business in Massachusetts; maintained a registered agent for service of process in Massachusetts; listed a mailing address or telephone number in Massachusetts; owned or leased property in Massachusetts; held corporate meetings in Massachusetts; or had an officer or director who was a resident of Massachusetts while holding such position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Florida Bow acknowledges, however, that it ships to and installs some products in Massachusetts. According to Vetus Maxwell, between May 2009 and May 2017, Florida Bow shipped \"various parts and products\" to Massachusetts on 84 separate occasions, some of which included product installations performed by its employees for whom Florida Bow had obtained nationwide liability insurance. [ECF No. 65 at 5-6, 9, 14]. Florida Bow also admits that its website advertises its installation and servicing of bow thrusters nationwide, and that it occasionally participates in boating trade shows in Massachusetts. [ECF No. 68 at 1]. Vetus Maxwell adds that Florida Bow's website displays at least one customer testimonial written by a Massachusetts resident, and that it suggests that Florida Bow attends trade shows in other New England states that market to Massachusetts residents. [ECF No. 65 at 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With regard to the sale of the Vessel, Regulator contracted Florida Bow for the purchase and installation of the Vetus Maxwell bow thruster for the price of $6,000. [ECF No. 53-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-23]. A work order, which identified Oyster Harbors and its Massachusetts address as the customer and shipping destination, was affixed to the Vessel at the time that Florida Bow installed the bow thruster. [ECF No. 65-6 at \u00b6 9-11]. On or around June 27 or 28, 2011, Florida Bow performed the installation\n   at Regulator's facility in Edenton, North Carolina but Florida Bow was not involved in transporting the Vessel to Oyster Harbors. [ECF No. 53-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-24]. The Vessel was one of three Regulator yachts on which Florida Bow installed a bow thruster for sale to Oyster Harbors in 2011.

Florida Bow is incorporated under Florida law and maintains its principal place of business in Florida. As stated above, it has never had an office in Massachusetts, registered to do business in Massachusetts, maintained a registered agent in Massachusetts, or owned or leased\n   property in Massachusetts. According to Vetus Maxwell, Florida Bow has made 84 shipments of marine products over the eight-year period between May 2009 and May 2017. [ECF No. 65 at 9, 17-18]. The supporting evidence, however, does not establish the dates of these shipments, the types of products shipped or their value, or that a Florida Bow employee performed any related installations. [ECF No. 65-3]. This small number of intermittent shipments of unspecified products, and Florida Bow's attendance at an occasional trade show, do not in any way suggest that Florida Bow is \"essentially at home\" in Massachusetts or otherwise demonstrate that this is an exceptional case for finding general jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Presby Patent Trust v.

Florida Bow's alleged contacts with Massachusetts are negligible in comparison. Although Florida Bow installed bow thrusters on two other Regulator yachts that were ultimately sold to Oyster Harbors in 2011, the evidence does not show that these installations were performed in Massachusetts or that Florida Bow participated in the sale or transportation of those vessels to Oyster Harbors. Moreover, there is no credible support for finding that Florida Bow shipped products to Massachusetts during the relevant time period that are comparable to the bow thruster installed on the Vessel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The affidavit of Vetus Maxwell's Chief Financial Officer and the accompanying exhibit show, at most, that Florida Bow shipped \"marine equipment\" to Massachusetts at various points in time between May 2009 and May 2017.

Florida Bow has shipped some marine equipment to Massachusetts, but as discussed above, the lack of detail about these shipments prevents the Court from drawing any inference that they were significant or numerous, that they included similar products to the bow thruster at issue, or that Florida Bow employees traveled to Massachusetts to install or service the equipment.

Florida Bow's advertising of nationwide services on its website and nationwide liability coverage are also not suggestive of\n   any effort to specifically cultivate a market in Massachusetts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vetus Maxwell culled one customer testimonial written by a Massachusetts resident on Florida Bow's website, but the website itself generally does not display the location or residence of the featured customers, and, importantly, did not identify this particular customer as hailing from Massachusetts [ECF No. 65-4]. Such evidence does not demonstrate an attempt to advertise directly to Massachusetts residents, so much as it shows that Florida Bow performed services for a Massachusetts resident at some unspecified point in time. Finally, the work order posted to the Vessel, at most, made Florida Bow aware that the Vessel had been sold to a Massachusetts customer, but mere awareness \"that the stream of commerce may or will sweep the product into the forum State does not convert the mere act of placing the product into the stream into an act purposefully directed toward the forum State.\"\n   <em>\n    Asahi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p112\">\n    480 U.S. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p112\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274662\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/244/237/#p244\">\n    244 F.Supp.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]here must be more than a mere awareness or expectation a defendant's product will end up in the forum state.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After having parsed the unsubstantiated allegations, all that remains in support of specific jurisdiction is Florida Bow's attendance at trade shows in Massachusetts and neighboring states. The evidence does not show how often Florida Bow attended or participated in trade shows. Other than Florida Bow's own admission of occasional attendance at such events, Vetus Maxwell relies on irrelevant evidence showing that Florida Bow anticipated attending trade shows in 2017, long after this case was filed. Although attendance at trade shows in the forum State is one factor that supports a finding purposeful availment, standing alone, the occasional trade show suggests isolated rather than purposeful contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, Vetus Maxwell's allegations and proof lack the \"something more\" required under the stream-of-commerce plus standard and therefore fail to establish purposeful availment.\n   <em>\n    Asahi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p112\">\n    480 U.S. at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p112\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Reasonableness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because Vetus Maxwell \"failed to satisfy the first two prongs of the due process inquiry, its argument for specific\n   jurisdiction fails.\"\n   <em>\n    A Corp. v.

Vetus Maxwell is already defending against claims asserted by Regulator in Massachusetts, and if its claims against Florida Bow are not litigated here, they would likely be refiled in Maryland pursuant to a forum selection clause in the parties' governing agreement. Because commencing an action in Maryland would add a third pending action over the damage to the Vessel, the most efficient resolution of the controversy would likely be to exercise jurisdiction in Massachusetts.
