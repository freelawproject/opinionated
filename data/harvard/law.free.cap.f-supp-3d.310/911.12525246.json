The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office (\"MCSO\") is in charge of operating and managing the Jail. Doc. 124-5 at PageID 3795-96. On May 19, 2012, the MCSO employed Defendants Jackson, Lewis, Henning, Beach, Mayes, Marshall, Stumpff, and Wittman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant NaphCare, Inc. (\"NaphCare\") is a correctional healthcare provider that provides medical services at the Jail pursuant to a contract with the MCSO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 3795. Defendants Felicia Foster, R.N.; Krisandra Miles, LPN; and Steven Stockhauser, EMT were employees of NaphCare on May 19, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Brenda Garrett Ellis, M.D. was a contractor of NaphCare.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 17, 2012, Richardson was arrested on a\n   <em>\n    capias\n   </em>\n   issued from the Montgomery County, Ohio Juvenile Court as a result of his failure to appear for child support enforcement proceedings. Doc. 123-4 at PageID 3638; doc. 123-9 at PageID 3671. Richardson was found and arrested, then booked into the Jail on May 17, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later that same day, without having appeared before any court, Montgomery County Juvenile Judge Anthony Capizzi entered an order imposing upon Richardson a 30-day jail sentence, from which Richardson could be released upon the payment of $2,500.00 to Montgomery County Child Support Enforcement Agency (\"SEA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 123-6 at PageID 3630. Although no other Juvenile Court records or transcripts are before the Court on summary judgment, the undersigned presumes-construing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor-that Judge Capizzi issued this sanction upon finding Richardson in contempt for failing to appear and/or for failing to pay child support obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 123-4, 123-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon arriving at the Jail, Richardson underwent a medical screening. Doc. 124-5 at PageID 3796. Records from such screening show that Richardson was six feet tall, weighed 280 pounds, had high blood pressure, and was not taking any medications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the Jail, Richardson shared a cell with Marcus Maxwell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 123-9 at PageID 3671. On May 19, 2012, upon returning to his cell after visiting with his fianc\u00e9, Richardson began suffering from an apparent medical issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 78 at PageID 843-44. According to responding corrections officers, Richardson appeared to be having a seizure and was making seizure type movements, such as thrashing his body around.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 78 at PageID 845.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant Ted Jackson, a Sergeant with the MCSO, was the first to arrive at Richardson's cell, along with Defendant Justin Johnson, a MCSO corrections officer. Doc. 83 at PageID 1109. When Jackson and Johnson arrived, Richardson was sitting on the floor, attempting to stand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1109. Richardson had blood and saliva coming from his mouth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1111. He was disoriented (\"he's looking at you, but he isn't\"), had accelerated breathing, was lethargic, and was unable to comprehend officers' verbal commands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1109-11. Throughout the entire incident, MCSO corrections officers consistently testified that Richardson neither hurt anyone nor attempted to hurt anyone\n   in his disoriented state. Doc. 83 at PageID 1118. Because Richardson appeared unbalanced and uncoordinated, MCSO officers did not want him standing and decided to remove him from the cell where there were sharp metal objects-such as the bed, toilet, and a bench-in a very confined space.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Initial Response and Handcuffing of Richardson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   MCSO officers successfully removed Richardson from his cell without issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1113. Once removed, Richardson was in a face down position on the concrete floor outside the cell on the second floor walkway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once removed from the cell and lying face down on the ground on the upper level walkway of the cell block, Richardson kept \"drawing his arms into-under his body ... in a natural position to lift himself up, because he's still trying to stand up at this point.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1114. Because a disoriented Richardson was attempting to stand up and posed a risk to his own safety-as well as the safety of others on the second floor walkway-Jackson made the decision to handcuff Richardson in an effort \"[t]o gain more control over him[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Michael Stumpff, Sergeant Brian Lewis, and Officer Matthew Henning all arrived on the scene after Jackson and Johnson, and assisted in cuffing Richardson by holding his arms. Doc. 85 at PageID 1230-31; doc. 89 at PageID 1381. Officer Marshall and Defendant Stockhauser-a NaphCare medic-were also on the scene while officers were handcuffing Richardson. Doc. 87 at PageID 1309; doc. 108 at PageID 3266, 3274-76. Although all County Defendants state otherwise, Medic Stockhauser testified that, as MCSO Defendants were handcuffing Richardson, he and one of the NaphCare nurses \"told corrections [officers],\" namely Lewis, \"to cuff [Richardson] in the front so [medical staff] could better assess [him].\" Doc. 108 at PageID 3266, 3274-76. Medic Stockhauser's medical recommendation was not followed by corrections officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Restraint of Richardson Following Handcuffing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Richardson was cuffed in under one minute and, thereafter, officers remained on the scene to restrain Richardson to the floor. Doc. 83 at PageID 1117. Marshall restrained Richardson's right shoulder, applying pressure when needed to control Richardson from moving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1309-10. Marshall admitted that, at times, he placed one to two hands on Richardson's back to control his movements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Stumpff was positioned at Richardson's left shoulder near his head-where he saw blood and mucus coming from Richardson's mouth and nose-and restrained Richardson from lifting his shoulder. Doc. 89 at PageID 1385. Johnson assisted by straddling Richardson's lower body at his thigh/hip area. Doc. 84 at PageID 1163-64. Officer Henning assisted in kneeling over Richardson's legs. Doc. 82 at PageID 1085.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After about seven minutes on the scene, Johnson's shift ended and he was relieved of duty by Officer Beach, who took over straddling Richardson legs. Doc. 84 at PageID 1169; doc. 77 at PageID 816-17. Officer Henning was relieved of duty and left the scene after nine minutes and the record is unclear as to whether Henning-a\n   trainee who was completing his first day on the job-was specifically replaced on the scene. Doc. 82 at PageID 1087. Fifteen minutes into the incident, Officer Mayes entered the scene for Medic Stockhauser and took over restraining Richardson's head-he placed one hand under Richardson's head and his other hand on top of Richardson's head to prevent him from putting his head up. Doc. 88 at PageID 1351. Officer Wittman came onto the scene approximately sixteen minutes into the incident and relieved an officer near Richardson's left arm-presumably Stumpff. Doc. 90 at PageID 1426.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Medical Response\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With regard to medical care, once Richardson was handcuffed and the scene was safe, Medic Stockhauser-noting at that time Richardson's disorientation and that he was suffering a likely seizure-began wiping bloody sputum from Richardson's face and trying give him oxygen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 108 at PageID 3281-82 (stating that \"oxygen is the first ... thing to use on somebody that just had a seizure\"). Medic Stockhauser also placed a towel under Richardson's head to prevent it from striking the concrete. Doc. 105 at PageID 2938. Nurse Miles, who arrived on the scene around the same time as Medic Stockhauser, was trying to talk to Richardson and assess him. Doc. 105 at PageID 2930-32. Otherwise, Nurse Miles stood and watched Medic Stockhauser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 2934.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nurse Foster arrived on the scene after Richardson had been handcuffed and left after a couple of minutes to speak with Dr. Ellis. Doc. 107 at PageID 3162-63. Dr. Ellis, after being advised by Nurse Foster, ordered that Richardson be given Ativan. Doc. 105 at PageID 2875, 2959; doc. 107 at PageID 3165. Nurse Miles delivered the Ativan syringe to Nurse Kruse, which was not successfully injected and, instead, spilled onto the floor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A second dose of Ativan was then ordered, which Nurse Foster delivered to the scene and administered herself in Richardson's gluteal muscle. Doc. 107 at PageID 3165-66. Notably, no Ativan was detected in Richardson's blood on autopsy, however.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 94 at PageID 172. Nurse Foster then left the scene shortly after administering the second Ativan shot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 3175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Soon thereafter, all medical staff backed away from the scene so that Richardson could presumably be placed into a restraint chair. Doc. 105 at PageID 2886. During Richardson's restraint, inmates at the jail state they heard him tell those on the scene that he could not breathe. Doc. 92 at PageID 1587. Officer Stumpff himself testified that Richardson may have indicated he could not breathe while being restrained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 89 at PageID 1375.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Richardson's Death\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After approximately twenty-two minutes of being restrained on the floor, MCSO officers realized that Richardson had stopped breathing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1387-88. Richardson subsequently died.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1389. While the parties dispute the ultimate cause of Richardson's death, Plaintiff presents evidence that, when construed in his favor, shows that Richardson died as a result of positional or restraint asphyxia while being restrained in a prone position by multiple corrections officers at the Jail on May 19, 2012. Doc. 123-1 at PageID 3582; doc. 124-2 at PageID 3758-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Policies Regarding Prone Restraint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff presents expert evidence from Michael Berg, a corrections expert, who states that, within the field of corrections, it has long been understood that pinning individuals to the ground in prone restraint for unreasonably long periods of time is dangerous and likely to cause death. Doc. 123-8 at PageID 3636. Berg further testifies that corrections facilities must develop clear policies governing the\n   restraint of individuals in prone position and that it is necessary to adequately train officers on such policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 3, 2009, prior to Richardson's death, then-Ohio Governor Ted Strickland issued Executive Order 2009-13S, titled \"\n   <em>\n    Establishing Restraint Policies Including a Ban on Prone Restraints\n   </em>\n   ,\" wherein he ordered a number of state agencies, including the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to immediately adopt a policy on the use of, among other uses of force, prone restraint. Doc. 96-2 at PageID 2109. Specifically, the Executive Order-consistent with the opinion of Berg-states that \"[a]ccepted research has shown that there is a risk of sudden death when restraining an individual in a prone position,\" and further ordered implementation of the following policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   PRONE RESTRAINT: The use of the prone restraint is prohibited across all state systems. Prone restraint is defined as all items or measures used to limit or control the movement or normal functioning of any portion, or all, of an individual's body while the individual is in a face-down position for an extended period of time. Prone restraint includes physical or mechanical restraints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 2110. The policy advanced in the Executive Order permitted, under certain conditions, a \"\n   <em>\n    brief\n   </em>\n   physical positioning of an individual face down for the purpose of quickly and effectively gaining physical control of that individual in order to prevent harm to self and others, or prior to transport to enable the individual to be transported safely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2110-11 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similar to the prohibition advanced by former Governor Strickland in Executive Order 2009-13S, the Montgomery County Jail's official policies prohibit \"placing prisoners who are in restraints in prone ... position[ ][.]\" Doc. 96-4 at PageID 2131. Despite existence of this policy, however, County Defendants testified that there was \"nothing in our training that says we cannot have somebody in a prone position and handcuffed.\" Doc. 85 at PageID 1238; doc. 90 at PageID 1420 (wherein Defendant Stumpff testified that \"I've been through many trainings, and I've never been told not to do that\"). In fact, some County Defendants testified that they are trained to do the opposite,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , place people in a prone position with hands cuffed behind their back.
