CHUANG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Dr. Chang Lim, a former Commissioner's Fellow with the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), has filed this action against the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\"the Secretary\" or \"HHS\"), the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, and three FDA officials (collectively, \"Defendants\"), alleging that he was subjected to a hostile work environment and discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, as well as unlawful retaliation for filing complaints with the FDA and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), all in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2012). Presently pending before the Court are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Lim's Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint (\"Motion to Amend\"). Having reviewed the submitted materials, the Court finds that no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Md. Local R. 105.6. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion to Amend is GRANTED, and the Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2008, Dr. Chang Lim, an Asian American of South Korean descent, was selected as one of 50 FDA Commissioner's Fellows (\"Fellows\"), a program that allowed scientists such as Lim to work on specific research projects under the guidance of a senior FDA scientist, known as a \"preceptor.\" Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16, ECF No. 68-2. In the following months, Lim's relationship with his colleagues in the program deteriorated. Another Fellow, Juandria Williams, asserted that Lim had sent a condescending email to the other Fellows as part of a proposal to start a study group with membership conditioned on a certain level of commitment. On March 5, 2009, Lim received a memorandum from L'Tonya Davis, the Executive Officer in the FDA Office of the Commissioner, which set forth expectations for appropriate interactions with other FDA employees. In response, on March 16, 2009, Lim submitted a 29-page \"Internal Memorandum\" accusing Williams and other Fellows of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, professional misbehavior, extortion, and conspiracy based on emails sent during the discussions about the proposed study group and the selection of a representative to communicate information from Fellows to the management of the Commissioner's Fellows Program. SAC \u00b6 27; Internal Memo., J.R. 1205-33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   took no formal action in response to Lim's memo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in December 2008, Lim's preceptor, Dr. Jonathan Sackner-Bernstein, required Lim to develop a research project independently. Between December 2008 and March 2009, Sackner-Bernstein provided various positive comments on Lim's research proposal, but none of his proposals were accepted. According to Lim, Sackner-Bernstein also prevented him from attending various mandatory classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lim further alleges that, on March 15, 2009, Sackner-Bernstein learned from Kelly Wilkicki, the coordinator of the Commissioner's Fellows Program, that Lim is of Korean origin. By April 1, 2009, Sackner-Bernstein was expressing serious concerns about Lim. Dissatisfied with one of Lim's research proposals, Sackner-Bernstein wrote to Wilkicki and Nathan Dickey, an FDA Human Resources Specialist, \"I don't think he sees the big picture that we need to craft a project and its proposal quickly.\" SAC \u00b6 35. Sackner-Bernstein stated in a separate email to Wilkicki and Dickey that \"I must conclude that [Lim] is unlikely to make great progress as a member of the Agency\" and that Lim \"doesn't understand scientific methods nor possess the interpersonal skills to work effectively/productively in a large or intense organizational structure.\" Sackner-Bernstein Email at 2, J.R. 1235. On April 2, 2009, Sackner-Bernstein wrote to Wilkicki and Dickey that, \"If you were to decide it best for [Lim] to leave, I would not disagree.\" SAC \u00b6 37. He added that Lim \"does not appear to know what he does not know and does not understand where the limits should be for him in a group setting.\" SAC \u00b6 31. On April 13,2009, Sackner-Bernstein told Lim \"[s]orry, I can't work with Korean like you.\" SAC \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 15, 2009, Lim submitted a \"Petition for Waiver\" to Wilkicki requesting permission to begin his proposed research project without Sackner-Bernstein's approval. Wilkicki never responded to this request. From December 2008 to May 2009, Lim made repeated, unsuccessful requests that FDA allow him to change his preceptor. FDA, however, allowed at least four white Fellows to change their preceptors during the same time period. During the same time frame, according to Lim, FDA management concealed his findings from a study relating to \"patient safety risk signals.\" SAC \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 20, 2009, Lim applied for a \"Flexible Workplace Arrangement Plan,\" a temporary accommodation that allows an employee to work from home, in order to allow his wife to travel to Korea to be with Lim's terminally ill father.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The FDA denied this request but granted FWAP requests by two white employees with unspecified circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 5, 2009, the FDA terminated Lim's employment based on both his conduct and his performance. Specifically, FDA cited the March 16, 2009 \"Internal Memorandum\" as \"unprofessional, disrespectful,\" and a waste of \"valuable agency resources.\" Termination Memo. at 2, J.R. 1252. Lim refused to sign the termination memorandum. Instead, Lim wrote a statement below the signature line stating that he intended to file a lawsuit alleging \"[d]iscrimination based on national origin,\" \"retaliation,\" and \"negligence.\" SAC \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Termination Mem. at 3, J.R. 1253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following Lim's termination, he was not paid for 124 hours of unused vacation time and was instead charged for 68.63 hours of \"negative work hours.\" SAC \u00b6 54. According to Lim, the FDA altered his leave and earnings statement, created various false\n   financial accounts showing that he owed more than $20,000, and over the next four years referred these accounts to debt collection agencies and the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The FDA also falsely characterized Lim's departure as voluntary, thus preventing him from obtaining unemployment benefits. In September 2009, however, the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (\"DLLR\") found that Lim was entitled to unemployment benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Lim, between 2009 and 2015, FDA implemented various programs based on his previously rejected research proposals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 16, 2009, Lim filed a formal complaint with the FDA Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Management (\"EEO Office\"). On the complaint form, Lim asserted claims of race, color, and national origin discrimination and retaliation. The issues he identified were non-sexual harassment, termination, performance evaluations, assignment of duties, duty hours, reassignment, reinstatement, time and attendance, and terms and conditions of employment. On September 22,2009 and October 16,2009, Lim amended his complaint to add two retaliation claims, specifically that both FDA's characterization of his departure as voluntary, and its claims at a DLLR hearing that he had sent condescending emails, lacked an understanding of scientific language, and had showed no signs of improvement, were forms of retaliation for filing complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 29,2010, the EEO Office informed Lim that it had accepted for investigation six discrete claims from his complaint and amendments, consisting of Lim's claims that (1) he was not allowed to change his preceptor; (2) his research proposals were rejected; (3) FDA did not consider his FWAP application; (4) he was inappropriately terminated; (5) his supervisors inappropriately criticized his scientific knowledge; and (6) FDA management concealed his findings related to patient safety information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The EEO Office conducted an investigation into these claims and issued a report on May 4, 2010. Lim elected to proceed to a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge (\"AJ\"), which was held May 4-5, 2011. On April 8, 2013, the AJ issued a decision denying each of Lim's claims. HHS issued its final decision dismissing Lim's complaint on April 29, 2013, which Lim appealed to the EEOC Office of Federal Operations. That office affirmed HHS's decision on August 6, 2015. On November 9, 2015, Lim filed the instant case in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. On October 6, 2016, following a successful Motion to Transfer Venue filed by Defendants, the case was transferred to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 27, 2010, during the processing of his first EEO complaint, Lim filed a second formal complaint with the EEO Office alleging post-termination retaliation. Specifically, Lim alleged that on August 2, 2010, the Chief of the HHS Debt Services Section referred Lim to a debt collection agency, which resulted in Lim receiving a collection letter in retaliation for his prior complaints. The EEO Office dismissed the complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) on the grounds that the AJ had not accepted these claims for consideration in the proceedings on the first complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 7, 2011, Lim filed a third formal complaint with the EEO Office, alleging that he was retaliated against for his prior complaints when he was reported to the IRS and a debt collection agency. This complaint was dismissed on October 4,\n   2011 for failing to state a claim that affected the terms, conditions, or privileges of Lim's employment. Lim also claims that he filed a fourth formal complaint on January 9, 2013 alleging retaliation after he \"received two documents from the U.S. Treasury stating 'Debt Information,' \" but he has not provided copies of the complaint or decision. SAC \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In their Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint, Defendants argue that (1) because the Secretary of HHS is the only proper defendant in a Title VII action, all claims against the other Defendants must be dismissed; (2) Lim fails to state a plausible Title VII hostile work environment claim; (3) Lim's discriminatory treatment claims should be dismissed because he has not asserted any adverse employment actions within the meaning of Title VII, with the exception of discriminatory termination, for which he has failed to state a plausible claim; (4) Lim's pre-termination retaliation claims should be dismissed because Lim did not engage in protected activity until he was terminated; and (5) Lim failed to exhaust administrative remedies relating to his post-termination retaliation claims and some of his discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Lim filed a memorandum in opposition to the Motion as well as a Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint. The proposed Second Amended Complaint does not add new claims or defendants, but \"accounts for the factual findings that have occurred since the [First Amended Complaint] was filed.\" Mot. Amend at 1, ECF No. 68. Defendants have opposed the Motion to Amend, arguing that granting Lim a third opportunity to amend the complaint is excessive and that amendment is otherwise futile for the same reasons articulated in the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), \"[a] party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within 21 days after serving it, or if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). \"In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Rule 15 dictates that \"[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although Lim claims that the proposed Second Amended Complaint is intended to account for factual developments since the filing of the First Amended Complaint on July 10, 2017, a review of Lim's proposal shows that all of the additional facts occurred prior to 2013 and therefore could have been included in either the original Complaint or the First Amended Complaint. Many of Lim's changes appear to be stylistic edits, such as changing \"asked\" to \"threatened,\" SAC \u00b6 25, or adding conclusory statements of law, such as \"Lim exhausted administrative remedies,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 39, 45, 57, 67, 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The most substantive additions are Lim's details regarding post-termination retaliation, his filing of formal complaints with the EEO Office, and his assertion that he was forced to conceal safety information. Lim also expands on his claim that his supervisors inappropriately criticized his scientific knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lim has not put forth a compelling justification for failing to include these facts in the First Amended Complaint. However, the additional facts asserted in the Second Amended Complaint do not affect the Court's analysis of Lim's claims. Defendants' arguments in their Motion to\n   Dismiss are equally applicable to the Second Amended Complaint, and Defendants were explicitly provided the opportunity to supplement, in their memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Amend, their argument for dismissal by specifically addressing how even with the additional facts in the proposed Second Amended Complaint, Lim's claims should be dismissed. The Court therefore finds that Defendants are not prejudiced by the Second Amended Complaint. Given Lim's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status in this case, the Motion to Amend will be granted. Lim will not be granted any additional opportunities to amend absent exceptional circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To the extent that Defendants seek dismissal of Lim's discrimination and retaliation claims based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the Motion should be construed as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Calvert Group, Ltd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5753115\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/297/#p300\">\n    551 F.3d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300-01 (4th Cir. 2009).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that subject matter jurisdiction exists.

However, he identifies only two situations in which other Fellows outside of his protected class allegedly received more favorable treatment.

Employment practices made unlawful by Title VII are those that discriminate against employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (delineating unlawful employment practices under Title VII). To establish\n   <em>\n    aprima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation, a plaintiff must present facts that establish that (1) the plaintiff engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (3) \"there was a causal link between the two events.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyer-Liberto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190918\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/264/#p277\">\n    786 F.3d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Pre-Termination and Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants argue that Lim's retaliation claims arising from his termination and actions taken prior to his termination cannot support a cause of action for retaliation because Lim did not engage in any protected activity before he filed his EEO complaint on September 16, 2009. In response, Lim argues that he engaged in protected, oppositional activity to discriminatory conduct on three separate occasions: (1) by filing the \"Internal Memorandum\" on March 16, 2009; (2) by requesting to change his preceptor; and (3) by refusing to sign his termination memorandum and instead stating that he intended to file a lawsuit based on discrimination and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Courts take an \"expansive view of what constitutes oppositional conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    DeMasters v.

Although Lim now labels his preceptor, Sackner-Bernstein, as an intolerant \"Jewish extremist\" in support of his claim that his requests to change preceptors constituted attempts to oppose discrimination, Lim does not allege in the Second Amended Complaint or elsewhere that he communicated his views about Sackner-Bernsteinss motivations to agency officials when making his requests. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 3, ECF No. 61. Finally, the statement written by Lim on his termination memorandum announcing his intention to file a discrimination complaint cannot constitute protected activity underlying a claim of retaliatory termination because the FDA's decision to terminate Lim had already taken place, and had been communicated to him, before Lim wrote that statement. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Lim's claims that his termination or any pre-termination actions constituted unlawful retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Post-Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants argue that Lim's post-termination retaliation claims, in which he asserts that FDA retaliated against him by providing misleading information to the DLLR and by falsifying debts and referring them to collection agencies, should be dismissed because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Lim filed his first EEO complaint on September 16, 2009, in which he alleged discriminatory treatment and termination, hostile work environment, and retaliation for pre-termination conduct. He then amended his EEO complaint on September 22 and October 16, 2009 to include claims of retaliation based on the FDA's representations to the DLLA allegedly aimed at causing his post-termination\n   claim for unemployment benefits to be denied. On August 9,2010, Lim contacted an EEO counselor to assert a claim of retaliation based on FDA's August 2, 2010 referral of Lim's account to a debt collection agency. Lim filed a second formal EEO complaint on this issue on September 27, 2010, which was denied on January 5, 2011 because the AJ had declined to accept the claim in the adjudication of the first EEO complaint. On May 10, 2011, Lim contacted an EEO counselor to report allegedly retaliatory activity consisting of the referral of three financial accounts in his name to the IRS and a debt collection agency. Lim filed a formal complaint on this issue on July 7, 2011. The complaint was denied on October 4, 2011, on the grounds that it was an identical matter to one of his earlier EEO complaints. With the Final Agency Decisions on the second and third EEO complaints, Lim was notified that he could file an appeal to the EEOC within 30 days of the Final Agency Decision, and that he must file a civil action within 90 days of the Final Agency Decision if he did not file an appeal or within 90 days of the EEOC's appeal decision. Lim did not appeal those decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants argue that where Lim failed to file appeals of the second and third EEO complaints or file a federal lawsuit within 90 days of the Final Agency Decision, he did not exhaust administrative remedies. They also claim that he did not pursue any part of the administrative process, beginning with contacting an EEO counselor, for any other post-retaliation claims, including his allegations that he was retaliated against through the fabrication of negative leave balances and alleged false statements to the DLLA that his termination was voluntary. The Court concludes that Lim's claim that FDA's statements to the DLLR constituted post-termination retaliation may proceed, because that claim was added to the September 16, 2009 EEO complaint by amendment and was thus exhausted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Unlike a discrimination claim, a retaliation claim can be alleged for the first time in federal court if it alleges retaliation for the filing of the EEOC charge or EEO complaint itself.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5753115\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/297/#p300\">\n    551 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   302 ;\n   <em>\n    Nealon v.

The fact that Lim filed additional EEO complaints for some of his post-retaliation claims but did not complete the administrative process does not alter this conclusion, particularly where the EEO complaints relating to post-termination retaliation appear to have been summarily dismissed because the issues were already\n   being addressed in the first EEO complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Churchill v.

On the first prong of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   retaliation claim, Lim engaged in protected activity by participating in post-termination EEO counseling between June 11, 2009 and September 8, 2009, and by filing a formal EEO complaint on September 16, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hashimoto v.

Lim has also satisfied the second prong. Unlike a discrimination claim, an \"adverse employment action\" for the purposes of a Title VII retaliation claim is any action which \"could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p67\">\n    548 U.S. at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p67\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accepting as true Lim's allegation that FDA falsely declined to pay him for his unused vacation time and falsely created debts amounting to $20,000 against him, such actions would be sufficient to dissuade a reasonable worker from pursuing a discrimination claim following their termination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aviles v.

Lim claims that FDA altered his civilian leave and earnings statement of August 29, 2009, approximately 12 weeks after Lim informed HHS that he intended to file a lawsuit against the agency and during his informal pre-complaint counseling with the EEO Office. Lim alleges that the debt collection referrals began in August 2010, which was almost a year after the filing of his first EEO complaint in September 2009, but was three months after the completion of the EEO investigation and during discovery prior to the May 4-5, 2011 EEOC hearing.

Lim asserts that the referrals were made by Dickey who, as a Human Resources Specialist, was aware of Lim's EEOC actions. Moreover, it appears that Lim's only interaction with the FDA following his termination was through the EEO process, either through the filing of complaints or participation in the adjudication of his complaints. On a motion to dismiss, the temporal proximity with Lim's ongoing engagement in the EEO process is sufficient to state plausibly that the debt collection referrals, by someone with knowledge of Lim's EEO complaint, were caused by a retaliatory motive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waag v.
