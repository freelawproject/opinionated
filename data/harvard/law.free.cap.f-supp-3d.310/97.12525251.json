The Forum Selection Clause is Inapplicable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Edwards argues that Ms. Beall's case must be transferred because the employment agreement requires that Ms. Beall bring \"any action to enforce the terms of the Agreement\" in California.

Edwards argues that Ms. Beall's claims fall within the scope of the employment agreement because they \"relate\" to her \"employment relationship\" with the company and because the employment agreement specifically governs claims regarding Ms. Beall's \"hours, wages, benefits, position, working conditions, and other terms of employment.\" Def.'s Supp. Mot, ECF No. 14 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Beall argues that the employment agreement is inapplicable because she is not suing to \"enforce\" the terms of the agreement.
