BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (the Union) is the designated bargaining representative for employees working in the signalman class or craft, including signalmen employed by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, known as Amtrak. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, Dkt. 1. Union signalmen install and maintain Amtrak's railroad signal and communications systems and equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The Union and Amtrak have a collective bargaining agreement that establishes the rates of pay, rules, and working conditions for signalmen employed by Amtrak.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6; Collective Bargaining Agreement (Agreement), Dkt. 7-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jindal Decl. \u00b6 3, Dkt. 7-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rule 7 of the collective bargaining agreement divides Amtrak lines and facilities into districts. Compl. \u00b6 6. Relevant here, Southern Seniority District 3 is the \"Chesapeake Division\"; it covers the Amtrak lines and facilities from Darby, Pennsylvania to the southern limits of the Washington Terminal in Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement Rule 7, Dkt. 7-3 at 6. Notably, the collective bargaining agreement has not always covered the Washington Terminal, which was owned by the Washington Terminal Company until the early 1980s. Jindal Decl. \u00b6 7. When Amtrak acquired the Washington Terminal in the early 1980s, Amtrak and the Union supplemented their collective bargaining agreement to cover signalmen work at the Terminal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 1984, they added Appendix B-11, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In view of the transaction which will result in the assumption by Amtrak of the Communication and Signal work formerly performed by employees of the Washington Terminal Company, the parties agree to the following ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Seniority District No. 3-Chesapeake Division as described in the [collective bargaining agreement] is modified to include the former Washington Terminal Company property within that seniority district ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Agreement App. B-11, Dkt. 7-3 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rule 1 of the collective bargaining agreement-the scope rule-describes the scope of work that accrues to the Union. As to covered districts like the Chesapeake Division, the scope rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   These Rules, subject to the exceptions hereinafter set forth, shall constitute Agreements between Amtrak and its Communication and Signal Department employees of the classification herein set [forth] engaged in the installation and maintenance of all signals, interlockings, telegraph and telephone lines and equipment including telegraph and telephone office equipment, wayside or office equipment of communicating systems (not including such equipment), highway crossing protection (excluding highway crossing gates not operated in conjunction with track or signal circuits) including repair and adjustment of telegraph, telephone and signal relays and the wiring of telegraph, telephone and signal instrument cases, and the maintenance of car retarder systems, and all other work in connection with installation and maintenance thereof that has generally been recognized as telegraph, telephone or signal work-represented by the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and shall govern the hours of service, working conditions and rates of pay of the respective positions and employees of Amtrak, specified in Rule 2 hereof, namely Electronic Specialists, Electronic Technicians, Inspectors, Assistant Inspectors, Foremen, Assistant Foremen, C &amp; S Maintainers, Maintainers, Signalmen, Assistant Signalmen, Trainees and Helpers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The employees in the Communication and Signal Department shall continue to install, maintain and repair, and do testing incident thereto, of all devices and apparatus ... which are part of the signal or telegraph and telephone systems, to the extent that such work is now being performed by employees of the Communication and Signal Department. This paragraph shall not, however, prejudice any rights which such employees may have under the Scope Rule, exclusive of this modification, to claim work performed by other crafts in violation of the Scope Rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Agreement Rule 1, Dkt. 7-3 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The scope rule also contemplates that Amtrak may contract out \"scope work\" in certain circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Amtrak may not contract out work normally performed by an employee in a bargaining unit covered by a contract between a labor organization and Amtrak or a rail carrier that provided intercity rail passenger transportation on October 30, 1970, if contracting out results in the layoff of an employee in a bargaining unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Agreement Rule 1, Dkt. 7-3 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This dispute concerns whether the collective bargaining agreement requires Amtrak to assign work in the Railway Express Agency (REA) Building to Union-represented signalmen. The REA Building, outlined in red below, is located at 900 Second Street Northeast, Washington, D.C., adjacent to Union Station.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Graber Decl. \u00b6 2, Dkt. 7-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   District of Columbia Geographic Information System, Real Property Finder, http://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3ca919beca684ea7bd7d1ced0dbbf636. From 1989 to 2015, Amtrak leased space in the REA Building, most recently from a company called Fluorine, LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Graber Decl. \u00b6 2. In connection with plans to expand Union Station, Amtrak acquired ownership of the REA Building through eminent domain and took possession of the building on October 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 31, 2017, Union Chairman David Ingersoll asked Amtrak whether their collective bargaining agreement required Amtrak to assign the signalmen work in the REA Building to the Union.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 10; Dkt. 7-11 at 4. After some back-and-forth, Amtrak responded that signalmen work in the REA Building is not within the scope of the collective bargaining agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-20; Dkt. 7-11 at 2-3. Meanwhile, on March 21, 2017, Amtrak notified the Union that Amtrak intended to contract out the renovation of the REA Building, including signalmen work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 30, 2017, the Union filed its complaint, which alleges that Amtrak violated the collective bargaining agreement and thus the Railway Labor Act by (i) not acknowledging that signalmen work in the REA building accrues to the Union and (ii) not assigning signalmen work in the REA Building to the Union. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-27. Amtrak moved to dismiss on July 27, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7, and the case was reassigned to the undersigned judge on December 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Per the scope rule, Union-represented employees \"shall\n   <em>\n    continue\n   </em>\n   to install, maintain and repair ... all devices and apparatus ... which are part of the signal or telegraph or telephone systems,\n   <em>\n    to the extent that such work is now being performed\n   </em>\n   by [Union-represented employees].\" Agreement Rule 1, Dkt. 7-3 at 3 (emphasis added). According to the Union's reading of this language, the scope rule governs the \"types of work\" reserved for the Union, not the locations where such work is performed, so the Union merits the same types of work at the newly acquired REA Building.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 26-27, Dkt. 10. But the language of the collective bargaining agreement does not clearly mandate that interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it is plausible that the scope rule guarantees to the Union all existing work at the time of the agreement, but not new work in new locations, such as signalmen work in the newly acquired REA Building. That is how another judge of this Court read a very similar scope rule that guaranteed to a train-services union the \"work presently recognized as the exclusive work of passenger train service employees on main lines, or branch lines or within yard facilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l R.R.

As in that case, the scope rule here \"does not specifically identify the work that belongs exclusively to the [Union], but rather identifies it by reference to work recognized as the exclusive work of the [Union] as of [the date of the agreement].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820920\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/832/7/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820920\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/832/7/#p9\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the dispute thus \"relates to the interpretation and application of an existing agreement\" and Amtrak presents a justifiable interpretation, \"Amtrak's reliance on [the scope rule] to support ... its actions can hardly be said to be 'obviously insubstantial.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820920\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/832/7/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Consol.

The Appendix states that the \"Chesapeake Division ... is modified to include the former Washington Terminal Company property within that seniority district.\" Agreement App. B-11, Dkt. 7-3 at 11. The Union argues that Appendix B-11 must encompass the REA Building because the Building \"was always part of the Washington Terminal\" and qualifies under Appendix B-11 as \"former Washington Terminal property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But when the parties added Appendix B-11 to the collective bargaining agreement in 1984, the Washington Terminal Company did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   own the REA Building, having sold it to Mount Claire Properties\n   in 1981. Graber Decl. \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7-17 (deed transferring the REA Building in 1981). Thus, it is arguable that the REA Building does not qualify as \"former Washington Terminal Company property\" and Appendix B-11 does not bring the REA Building within the scope of the collective bargaining agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, even if the scope rule covers new work in the REA Building, the rule does not necessarily guarantee that new work to the Union. The scope rule arguably permits Amtrak to hire contractors to perform scope work as long as Union-represented employees are not laid off as a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement Rule 1, Dkt. 7-3 at 5 (\"Amtrak may not contract out work normally performed by an employee in a bargaining unit covered by a contract between a labor organization and Amtrak ... if contracting out results in the layoff of an employee in a bargaining unit.\"). Amtrak, through its Director of Labor Relations, represents that \"[n]o Amtrak forces will be furloughed, as a result of this contracting of work.\" Jindal Decl. \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Letter from Jindal to Ingersoll (Mar. 21, 2017), Dkt. 7-12 at 3 (same). The scope rule thus plausibly permits Amtrak to contract out work in the REA Building. In these ways, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement arguably justify Amtrak's actions, making this a minor dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Were that not enough, the parties' \"practice, usage and custom\" confirms that the scope rule does not automatically capture new work gained through an Amtrak acquisition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Consol. Rail Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213315\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/299/#p302\">\n    491 U.S. at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213315\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/299/#p302\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Amtrak acquired new property in the past, Amtrak negotiated with the Union to amend the collective bargaining agreement and bring new work within its scope. Most relevant here, when Amtrak acquired the former Washington Terminal Company property in the 1980s, the parties negotiated and amended the collective bargaining agreement via Appendix B-11, which added the Washington Terminal Company property to the Chesapeake Division.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jindal Decl. \u00b6 7; Agreement App. B-11, Dkt. 7-3 at 11. More recently, in 2012 when the Michigan Department of Transportation contracted with Amtrak for maintenance work in certain Michigan territory, Amtrak and the Union executed a Memorandum of Agreement to confirm that the collective bargaining agreement covered the work and territory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Woodcock Decl. \u00b6 2, Dkt. 7-13; Memorandum of Agreement, Dkt. 7-14. Although isolated examples may not necessarily demonstrate an established prior practice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BMWED\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271487\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/249/#p255\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this case involves relatively rare circumstances: acquiring new facilities. Such circumstances \"might well be so rare an occurrence that one instance would be enough\" to establish a past practice,\n   <em>\n    Maine Cent. R. Co. v. United Transp.

Since 1999, Amtrak has contracted out scope work at least 62 times via the \"Labor Clearance Process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jindal Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7-6 at 13 (Union President W.
