Lake Ridge alleges that Plaintiff's wrongful death action is subject to arbitration pursuant to a mutual, binding Arbitration Agreement signed by the decedent's power of attorney when the decedent was admitted to Lake Ridge's nursing home facility. Because the Court will find that Plaintiff's claim is derivative and therefore bound by the Arbitration Agreement, the Court will grant Lake Ridge's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of its Mot. to Compel Arb. at 1-2, July 14, 2017, Docket No. 6.) When she admitted her mother, Kassim held a limited power of attorney and signed two documents on behalf of her mother: (1) the Admission Agreement and (2) the Resident and Facility Arbitration Agreement (\"the Arbitration Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Def.'s Notice of Removal \u00b6 1, Ex. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 18, July 11, 2017, Docket No. 1.) Schultz died in the hospital on September 1, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 21.) Plaintiff alleges that Schultz's death, due to complications resulting from an extremity fracture, was the result of negligence by Lake Ridge and its staff.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lake Ridge removed the case on July 11, 2017, alleging diversity jurisdiction. (Def.'s Notice of Removal.) On July 14, 2017, Lake Ridge filed this Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings.

On a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), the Court does not determine the merits of the substantive issues, but simply whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Express Scripts, Inc. v.

When considering such a motion, the Court is therefore limited to determining: (1) whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and (2) whether the specific dispute is within\n   the scope of that agreement.\n   <em>\n    Pro Tech Indus.

VALIDITY OF THE AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute that Jeanne Kassim signed the Arbitration Agreement or that she had legal authority to sign on Ms. Schultz's behalf. However, Plaintiff alleges in his initial Complaint that the Arbitration Agreement \"is void and unenforceable on the grounds of impossibility, illegality, contravention of public policy, fraud in the inducement based on material misrepresentation and omission, and unconscionability based on material misrepresentation and omission.\" (Compl. \u00b6 13.) These generally applicable contract defenses may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doctor's Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746265\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/681/#p687\">\n    517 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746265\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/681/#p687\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but at the motion hearing Plaintiff indicated that he wished to reserve these defenses for arbitration rather than advance them in response to this motion. Because the Court finds that these issues are appropriate for arbitration, the Court will not address them at this time. Thus, the Court concludes that the Arbitration Agreement is a valid agreement to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court also finds that this wrongful death action falls within the purported scope of the Arbitration Agreement. When interpreting arbitration agreements, courts should construe them liberally and resolve any doubts in favor of arbitration.\n   <em>\n    MedCam, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972007\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/972/#p976\">\n    414 F.3d at 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the plain language of the Arbitration Agreement sets forth a scope that includes Plaintiff's wrongful death action. The alleged harm suffered by Ms. Schultz \"ar[ose] out of...service or health care provided by the Facility to the Resident,\" and the Arbitration Agreement \"bind[s] the parties, their successors, and assigns, including without limitation... all persons whose claim is derived through or on behalf of the Resident.\" (Arbitration Agreement.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nevertheless, the parties dispute whether the Arbitration Agreement's purported scope is legally permissible. Plaintiff argues that, as a matter of contract law, Ms.\n   Schultz's heirs cannot be bound by an arbitration agreement they were not party to. Lake Ridge argues that Plaintiff is bound by the Arbitration Agreement because his wrongful death action is a derivative action in which he must step into Ms. Schultz's shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\"\n   <em>\n    United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p582\">\n    363 U.S. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p582\">\n    80 S.Ct. 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p582\">\n    4 L.Ed.2d 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960). Under the FAA, a determination of who is bound by an agreement to arbitrate is a question of federal law.\n   <em>\n    Flink v. Carlson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524871\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/44/\">\n    856 F.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 n.2 (8th Cir. 1988). However, federal courts should look to state law for guidance because the question involves the application of contract principles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524871\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/44/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus the Court looks to Minnesota state law to determine whether a decedent can prospectively bind her heirs to arbitration of a wrongful death action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court is bound by the decisions of Minnesota's highest court, but because the Supreme Court has not decided this question, the Court must \"apply the rule of decision that [it] believe[s] the state's highest court would apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Cassello v.

In\n   <em>\n    Chmielewski\n   </em>\n   , the court found that a trustee's wrongful death action \"is clearly dependent upon the decedent's right to maintain the action\" because Minnesota's statute allows for a wrongful death action only \"if the decedent might have maintained an action, had he lived.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677622\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/323/781/#p782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court distinguished Minnesota's Dram Shop Act, which gave an independent right of recovery to the wife of the injured party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677622\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/323/781/#p782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bakke v.

Minnesota state court precedent demonstrates that wrongful death claims are derivative in nature.

Furthermore, federal and state public policy favors arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piper Jaffray, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10765795\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/530/790/#p795\">\n    530 N.W.2d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the beneficiaries have a statutory right to a jury trial because Minnesota's wrongful death statute states that recovery \"is the amount the jury deems fair and just.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20573.02\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 573.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd.1. Plaintiff's argument fails for two reasons. First, even if the statute established a right to a jury trial, such a right can be waived. If the claim is derivative and thus bound by the defenses and contracts that the decedent was bound by, the right to a jury was waived when the decedent signed the arbitration clause. Second, the statute cannot be read to guarantee a jury trial because to do so would prohibit the arbitration of wrongful death claims, which would conflict with the FAA. The FAA, as federal law, is supreme.\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Mobility LLC v.
