(ECF 74 and 75). Plaintiff Data Research and Handling, Inc., filed a response in opposition (ECF 81) and NAR filed a reply (ECF 88). For the reasons discussed below, the motion is GRANTED and the Plaintiff's claims against the NAR are dismissed.

The NAR filed a previous motion to dismiss based on these same arguments (and more), but the Court deemed that motion moot after granting Data Research and Handling's motion to file a Second Amended Complaint. Opinion and Order, Sept. 30, 2017 (ECF 65). The Court explained in that order that \"the NAR's jurisdictional arguments will have to be presented anew in a subsequent motion[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 21, n. 4.

At this juncture, only an abbreviated summary of Plaintiff's allegations and claims is necessary. Data Research, an Indiana corporation, is \"engaged in providing relocation benefit plans to employers, unions, affinity groups and membership organizations which in turn are offered to employees, as union benefits or affinity benefits.\" Second Amended Complaint (ECF 66), p. 4. Data Research was planning to launch a program designed to provide financial assistance to individuals purchasing homes, known as an Employer-Assisted Housing Benefit Plan. Data Research alleges that the Defendants engaged in coordinated efforts to damage Plaintiff's business by defaming Data Research just as it was about to launch a major marketing initiative consisting of a \"substantial rollout and on-site promotion in northeast Indiana on February 27, 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211478\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/857/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 5. According to Data Research, the Defendants ruined the planned rollout by telling others that \"Plaintiff was operating an illegal down payment assistance program, and that Plaintiff was an illegal company.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211478\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/857/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 10.

Plaintiff's case is summarized by the following sentence from its Second Amended Complaint: \"The Defendants have, through a combination of acts and through conspiracy, incorporated illegal and suppressive measures to prevent an innovative business model from forming and thriving in the market, and have acted to restrain trade.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211478\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/857/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 14.

The NAR's activities in this state consist of collecting dues from Indiana real estate professionals and businesses who choose to join the Association, and offering various services in exchange (such as seminars and marketing and advertising opportunities). The NAR does indeed maintain a \"presence\" in this state, at least in a generic and tenuous sense, but that presence does not render the Association \"at home\" in Indiana under the applicable due process standard.

These acts directly affected an Indiana resident, and involved activities in Indiana. Although employees and agents of NAR may not have stepped foot in the state, their actions in coordinating with an Indiana co-defendant, and their forum-related activities directly harmed Plaintiff.... Contrary to assertions by NAR that the alleged tortious conduct took place outside of Indiana, the direct communications with other Defendants, and the concerted effort to destroy the Plaintiff did take place in Indiana. There are sufficient contacts with the state, and sufficient malfeasance alleged to qualify and expose NAR to specific jurisdiction of the forum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490667\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/84/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Data Research's argument is a house of cards, built on a wobbly foundation and held together by conclusions. Data Research makes a gallant effort to argue that the NAR's contacts with Indiana are sufficient to subject the Association to specific jurisdiction by presenting them in the context of the Plaintiff's collusion theory. Put another way, Data Research weaves the very few contacts the NAR had with Indiana into a much larger quilt, i.e., its theory that NAR was part of a larger conspiracy, to make them appear more significant. But when the Plaintiff's irrelevant assertions and conclusory allegations are removed from the equation, the actual \"contacts\" it alleges the NAR had in this state are exposed for what they are, which is minimal at most.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to Data Research's own assertions and allegations in its Second Amended Complaint, as quoted above, the NAR's contacts with Indiana included the following: 1) a couple of \"contacts\" initiated by Moskerintz, over the course of five months, to inquire about Data Research's business model and \"express[ ] its desire to work with Plaintiff on promoting plans like the Plaintiff's[ ]\"; 2) the NAR's placement of \"a link from its own website directly to Plaintiff's website[ ]\"; and 3) the NAR's \"invitation to Plaintiff's representative, Ms. Henry, to attend a[n] NAR seminar[.]\" That is the sum and substance of the NAR's \"contacts\" with Indiana so far as the Plaintiff's claims are concerned, and it is not the stuff that specific jurisdiction is made of. Data Research presents no authority to support of its theory that a foreign corporation that has only limited contacts with a forum state can nonetheless be subject to specific personal jurisdiction in that state based only on a plaintiff's conclusory allegation that those limited contacts were part of a broader scheme or plan designed to injure an Indiana-based plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The vast majority of the factual assertions and legal allegations that Data Research presents in opposition to the NAR's motion to dismiss are either irrelevant or conclusory. One prime example is Data Research's statement that \"Ms. Vongphachanh operates under the direction of the Defendants and each of them, including NAR, because she worked in conjunction and possible direction of NAR in efforts to harm the Plaintiff.\" But even Data Research admits that Ms. Vongphachanh \"at all times relevant to the controversy, was and continues to be, an employee of Upstar and Upstar MLS.\" Second Amended Complaint, p. 2, \u00b6 4. Still, Data Research makes the conclusory (and also rather vague) allegation that she was under the \"possible direction of NAR,\" and that this constitutes some sort of nexus between the Association and this state. This is one example of how Data Research uses a legal conclusion (i.e., Vongphachanh was a de facto \"agent\" of NAR) as tape to hold its jurisdiction argument together. Another\n   example is the Plaintiff's assertion that the NAR \"used [its] contacts with [HUD] to provide HUD with false information\" that in turn resulted in \"an investigation of Plaintiff in Indiana, at the behest and prompting of NAR, [the other Defendants] or each of them.\" Even assuming the truth of these factual assertions, the only connection these alleged activities had to Indiana was that they concerned an Indiana company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Data Research's Second Amended Complaint is 20 pages long and packed with factual detail and allegations. But the only facts and allegations that are important now are those that relate directly to the NAR and its contacts with Indiana, and they are not nearly sufficient to subject the NAR to specific personal jurisdiction. While it is true that even limited contacts with a forum state may subject a defendant to specific personal jurisdiction, \"the plaintiff must show that its claims against the defendant arise out of the defendant's\n   <em>\n    constitutionally sufficient contacts\n   </em>\n   with the state.\"\n   <em>\n    uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy Group,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790092\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/421/#p425\">\n    623 F.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (italics added). When a defendant's contacts with a forum state are few, they might still subject that defendant to specific jurisdiction if they are otherwise \"constitutionally sufficient.\" That is, it is not just the quantity of contacts that matters, but the quality. In this case, the NAR's contacts with Indiana, according to Data Research's own allegations, lack\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   quantity and quality and therefore are not \"constitutionally sufficient\" to justify subjecting the Association to personal jurisdiction in Indiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Data Research cites just two cases in its brief to support its argument. The NAR points out, however, that those cases all pre-date\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NExTT\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   , and \"should be disregarded.\" Defendant's Memorandum, p. 7, n. 1; Defendant's Reply, p. 8.
