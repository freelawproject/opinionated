CHAMBERS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court is Defendant Ford Motor Company's Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 1055. In its motion, Ford argues the Court should grant summary judgment in its favor for a number of reasons. Given the complexity of this litigation, the Court limits this Memorandum Opinion and Order to Plaintiffs' warranty and unjust enrichment claims. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in favor of Ford on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, Plaintiffs filed three related putative Class Action Complaints in this\n   Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the three cases involved common issues of fact, the Court consolidated the cases in August 2013 for discovery and pretrial purposes. The lead case became\n   <em>\n    Belville v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , 3:13-6529.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their original Complaints, Plaintiffs assert they purchased or leased certain models of Ford vehicles between the years 2002 and 2010. Plaintiffs claim all their vehicles are equipped with a defectively-designed electronic throttle control (ETC) system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the parties' analysis of the ETC system is highly technical, on a basic level Plaintiffs allege that the ETC's design is unable to identify and mitigate faults (errors) that may cause the throttles in their vehicles to open and provide greater power than demanded by the drivers, resulting in an unintended acceleration (UA). It is undisputed that faults can occur for various reasons and be sent to the system from a variety of sources. Regardless of the precipitating cause of the fault, however, Plaintiffs argue the problem is that the ETC's design is not fault tolerant and it should have included a failsafe system, such as a Brake Over Accelerator (BOA) system. Plaintiffs insist a properly designed system will stop or mitigate the occurrence of an unintended acceleration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Plaintiffs assert a design defect, rather than manufacturing defect, Plaintiffs claim their vehicles were dangerous and defective at the time of purchase and, as a result, they paid more to purchase or lease their vehicles than their actual worth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs do not seek any damages for personal injury, wrongful death, or property damage as a result of any unattended acceleration event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Plaintiffs filed their original Class Action Complaints, Ford filed motions to dismiss all three cases. Following a hearing on the matter, the Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order on March 31, 2014, granting, in part, and denying, in part, Ford's motion.\n   <em>\n    Belville v.

With respect to those who had not experienced an unintended acceleration, Ford argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , they could not pursue breach of warranty and related claims because the alleged defect had not manifested in their own vehicles. Plaintiffs insisted, however, that it was unnecessary for them to have experienced an unintended acceleration because the manifestation is the defective design itself. Although these Plaintiffs never experienced any problems with their actual vehicles, they claimed they did not receive the benefit of their bargain and overpaid for their vehicles because their vehicles are defective.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220336\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/528/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220336\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/528/\">\n    at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon consideration, the Court rejected Plaintiffs' argument with respect to their claims for breach of express and implied\n   warranty and unjust enrichment.

The Court found \"Plaintiffs simply have failed to demonstrate a plausible claim that they paid more for their vehicles than their actual worth when they have used their vehicles without incident for many years.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220336\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/528/\">\n    13 F.Supp.3d at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ford opposed the motion, arguing Plaintiffs were attempting a do-over, which would precipitate a new round of 12(b)(6) motions on many of the same claims the Court already resolved. Additionally, Ford noted the parties had not even completed the briefing over the impact the Court's March 31 Memorandum Opinion and Order had on 89 of the individual claims made in the original three Complaints. Upon consideration, the Court agreed with Ford, and it entered an Order on July 25, 2014, denying Plaintiffs' motion without prejudice so that the Court could resolve the parties' disputes about the original claims and provide the parties additional guidance.\n   <em>\n    Belville v.

Following briefing on the disputed claims, the Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order on November 14, 2014, further\n   delineating what claims survived and what claims were dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Belville v.

As of now, there are nineteen named Plaintiffs (which includes two corporations) from seventeen states. Collectively, Plaintiffs assert a Magnuson-Moss\n   Warranty Act claim and various state law claims, including, but not limited to, breach of warranty, unjust enrichment, fraud, and a variety of consumer protection claims. Of the named Plaintiffs, all but two have alleged they experienced an unintended acceleration in their Ford vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Ford argues in its motion that, for even those Plaintiffs who allege they have experienced an unintended acceleration, they \"have failed to adduce any competent evidence that ... any of the unwanted acceleration events they allegedly experienced resulted from an ETC defect[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , at 1, ECF No. 1056.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Importantly, at this point, the Court has not certified a class, and the Court restricts its focus to whether the individual Plaintiffs have produced competent evidence from which a reasonable juror could find that the alleged defect in the ETC system resulted in their unintended acceleration events. Plaintiffs concede, and their experts agree, that unintended accelerations can occur for reasons unrelated to the ETC system. For instance, an unintended acceleration can occur as the result of driver error, such as the driver stepping on the gas pedal instead of the brake or the driver unintentionally stepping on the gas and brake pedal at the same time, referred to as \"fat footing.\" Other known causes for unintended accelerations that are not associated with the electronics of the ETC include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a floor mat inadvertently covering the gas pedal, the gas pedal being mechanically entrapped by a foreign object placed in the floor well, or build-up of combustion debris in the throttle body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Given there are many potential causes of unintended accelerations, the mere fact Plaintiffs allege they experienced unintended accelerations is not evidence that the alleged defect caused the acceleration. As this Court previously held, in order to establish either a breach of warranty or unjust enrichment claim, there must be a manifestation-an unintended acceleration-\n   <em>\n    caused by\n   </em>\n   the alleged defect. In other words, Plaintiffs must produce evidence of a causal link between their alleged unintended accelerations and the alleged defect in order to avoid summary judgment on their breach of warranty and unjust enrichment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In support of their case, Plaintiffs theorize that the three-track throttle pedal assembly of the class vehicles is defective because it can send faults that are unmitigated by Ford's Gen II ETC system. Dr. Todd Hubing, Plaintiffs' designated expert in the areas of automotive electromagnetic testing and automotive design, identified a number of potential sources for these pedal sensor faults, including: worn or contaminated sensors, water intrusion, tin whiskers, solder balls or metal flakes, chaffing of the wire harness, loose or mal-fitted connectors, corroded connectors, electrical component failures, software bugs, and electromagnetic interference.\n   <em>\n    Expert Report of Dr. Todd H.

Stopschinski,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   inspected and tested the ten vehicles Plaintiffs made available to Ford in which Plaintiffs alleged an unintended acceleration occurred. Mr. Stopschinksi examined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   the powertrain control module (PCM), wiring harnesses and electrical connectors, accelerator pedal assembly, throttle body and throttle valve, brake system, driver's foot well area, imaging of the PCM/RCM data (if available), connecting the Ford IDS/VCM scan tool and documenting DTCs and sensor values, performing breakout box measurements of resistances and voltages of ETC related sensors and circuits, measuring the accelerator pedal sensor output and force/position data, and inspecting the brake components.

Stopschinski\n   </em>\n   , at 14 (Sept. 1, 2017), ECF No. 1076-1, at 15. Mr. Stopschinski found,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , no issues with his \"measurements of resistances and voltages in the accelerator, throttle, and brake switch circuits,\" and he did not find any problems with pedal sensors, electrical connections or wiring for the sensors and the pedals, the mounting of the pedal assembly, or the operation of the accelerator pedals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, ECF No. 1076-1, at 16. Based upon his testing and inspections, Mr. Stopschinski found \"[n]o abnormal conditions existed in the vehicles that would cause a failure of the ETC system to control the throttle consistent with driver command.

Quite simply, Plaintiffs produced no experts who can testify that Plaintiffs' alleged unintended\n   accelerations were proximately caused by the alleged defect rather than some other known cause for such events. Assuming that Plaintiffs did experience an unintended acceleration, \"it [is] not enough that a vehicle accelerated when claimants swore they had done nothing. Instead, ... [there must be] competent expert testimony and objective proof that a defect caused the acceleration.\"\n   <em>\n    Nissan Motor Co. v.
