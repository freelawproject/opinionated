Dkt. 1. He contends that while he was incarcerated at the Gilmer Federal Correction Institution (\"FCI Gilmer\") in West Virginia, another inmate \"assaulted him in the recreation yard.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodruff v.

Sept. 26, 2017). Plaintiff seeks to hold the United States liable for his injuries on the grounds that \"the prison lacked adequate security measures to prevent such attacks and that the correctional officers [in the yard at the time] failed to intervene once the incident was underway.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204286190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His complaint \"asserts a single claim for negligence against the United\n   States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204286190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The government moved to dismiss, Dkt. 13, asserting that it was immune from suit under the discretionary function exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16.

Meanwhile, Plaintiff has moved for leave to amend his complaint, Dkt. 23. Because the proposed amendment would be futile, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court must \"freely\" grant leave to amend \"when justice so requires.\" Fed.

Instead, the Court must consider whether \"any apparent or declared reason-such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party ...[or] futility of amendment\"-counsels against allowing the proposed amendment.\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

Although it is \"far from clear\" that any of the officers have established ties with the District of Columbia, the Court need not reach that question because Plaintiff \"founder[s] at the first step-he has failed to allege, or otherwise to identify, any 'tortious injury' that he sustained in the District of Columbia.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310081,4085399\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1102/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In light of this jurisdictional defect, the Court could not entertain Plaintiff's claims against the individual officers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the proposed amendment would be futile.
