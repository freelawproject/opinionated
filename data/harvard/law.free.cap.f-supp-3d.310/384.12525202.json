PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   GFI Group, Inc. (\"GFI\"), Colin Heffron, and Michael Gooch (collectively, \"Defendants\") move for summary judgment dismissing this securities class action. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to establish triable issues of fact on falsity, scienter, reliance, and loss causation. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Benjamin Gross filed this action on behalf of a class of investors who sold GFI stock between July 30, 2014 and September 9, 2014 (\"Plaintiffs\"). At the time of the events giving rise to this lawsuit, GFI was a publicly traded company with two principal business units: (1) an inter-dealer broker (\"IDB\") business, which provided trading services; and (2) a software unit, which licensed financial software products. (Second Am. Compl. for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws, ECF No. 29 (\"SAC\") \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In early 2013, Jefferies LLC advised GFI Executive Chairman Michael Gooch that GFI might be able to optimize shareholder value by selling itself to another inter-dealer broker. (Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 130 (\"Defs.' Response\") \u00b6\u00b6 115-116; Decl. of Joseph P. Guglielmo in Supp. of Plaintiff's Opp. to Defendants' Mot. for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 124 (\"Guglielmo Decl.\"), Ex. 25 (\"Jefferies Presentation\"), at 3 (\"Optimal approach may be to engage with an IDB ... to sell the entire company ....\").) Gooch was also GFI's largest shareholder, owning approximately 38% of its outstanding shares. (Defs.' Response \u00b6 107.) Jefferies estimated GFI's \"sum-of-the-parts\" value at $5.41/share, a 64% premium over GFI's current\n   trading price. (Jefferies Presentation, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gooch rejected Jefferies's advice, and expressed interest in selling only GFI's software business, while retaining the IDB business for himself. (Guglielmo Decl., Ex. 26 (\"Yavorsky Email\").) In an October 2013 Board meeting, Gooch recommended that GFI explore a potential sale of its software unit to CME Group (\"CME\"). (Guglielmo Decl. Ex. 85 (\"Proxy Statement\"), at 61.) Under the terms of that proposal, CME would acquire GFI, after which a private consortium-including Gooch and Heffron (GFI's Chief Executive Officer)-would purchase back the IDB business from CME at a substantial discount. (Proxy Statement, at 61; Defs.' Response \u00b6\u00b6 122-127.) CME understood that Gooch's repurchase of the IDB business was a prerequisite to any transaction with GFI. (Defs.' Response \u00b6 127.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BGC Partners (\"BGC\"), another inter-dealer broker, had long expressed interest in purchasing GFI. (Guglielmo Decl. Ex. 100 (\"BGC Tender Offer\"), at *9.) Gooch rebuffed BGC's overtures and forged ahead with the proposed CME transaction. In October 2013, GFI and CME entered into a non-disclosure agreement. (Proxy Statement, at 61.) In January 2014, Gooch presented a proposed deal to the GFI Board. (Guglielmo Decl. Ex. 48 (\"Jan. Board Meeting Minutes\"), at 1-3.) Under its terms, CME agreed to purchase all of GFI's outstanding stock for $4.55/share. (Guglielmo Decl. Ex. 61 (\"Press Release\"), at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The GFI Board appointed a special committee to evaluate the terms of the proposed CME transaction and explore potential alternative transactions. (Jan. Board Meeting Minutes, at 3; Ex. A.) The special committee retained Greenhill &amp; Co., LLC (\"Greenhill\") as its financial advisor and directed Greenhill to conduct a \"market check\" for potentially better deals. (Proxy Statement, at 63; Defs.' Response \u00b6 158.) However, in March 2014, Gooch informed the special committee that he would vote against any transaction other than the CME proposal. (Proxy Statement, at 64-65.) Given Gooch's substantial ownership of GFI, the special committee concluded that a \"market check\" would be a futile exercise, and directed Greenhill to stop discussions with other potential purchasers. (Defs.' Response \u00b6\u00b6 166-167; Proxy Statement, at 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 29, 2014, the special committee voted to recommend approval of the CME transaction. (Guglielmo Decl. Ex. 95 (\"July Special Committee Meeting Minutes\"), at 3.) Five minutes after that vote, the GFI Board met to act on the special committee's recommendation. (Guglielmo Decl. Ex. 51 (\"July Board Meeting Minutes\"), at 1-2.) At that meeting, Gooch informed the Board that in an email earlier that day BGC had proposed acquiring GFI. (July Board Meeting Minutes, at 2; Declaration of John F. Lynch, ECF No. 118 (\"Lynch Decl.\") Ex. X (\"BGC Letter\"), at 2.) Reading from that email, Gooch informed the Board that BGC had expressed confidence that it could \"offer a price per share substantially in excess of GFI's current trading price.\" (BGC Letter, at 2.) Gooch made clear that he would not support a transaction with BGC. (July Board Meeting Minutes, at 2; Proxy Statement, at 72.) After Gooch and Heffron recused themselves, the remaining members of the Board unanimously voted to approve the CME transaction. (July Board Meeting Minutes, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 30, 2014, GFI and CME issued a joint press release (the \"Press Release\") announcing the proposed merger. The Press Release explained that CME would acquire GFI's software business and that GFI stockholders would receive $4.55/share. (Press Release, at 1.) It described\n   that following CME's acquisition, a private consortium of GFI management would acquire GFI's IDB business. (Press Release, at 1.) The claims in this case stem from a single sentence on the second page of that Press Release, in which Gooch opined on the proposed CME transaction. Specifically, Gooch stated: \"Optimizing GFI's value for stockholders has been a goal of management since becoming a public company in 2005 and this transaction represents a singular and unique opportunity to return value.\" (Press Release, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Press Release noted that the proposed transaction was subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, and that a registration statement with more information would be forthcoming. (Press Release, at 1.) GFI shareholders were urged to read the registration statement and all proxy materials, as they would contain important information about the proposed transaction. (Press Release, at 6.) The Press Release noted that the transaction would likely not close until early 2015. (Press Release, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 31, 2014, GFI and CME publicly filed the proposed merger agreement. (Lynch Decl. Ex. H (\"Merger Agreement\").) The Merger Agreement stated that the deal would not close without approval of GFI's shareholders. (Merger Agreement \u00a7 3.4.) On that same day, Gross sold 770 shares of GFI stock for $4.52/share. (SAC \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Undeterred, BGC purchased millions of GFI shares in the ensuing weeks as a prelude to making a competing bid. (Lynch Decl. Ex. J (\"BGC Form 13D\"), at 15.) On September 9, 2014, BGC announced that it would make an all-cash tender offer for GFI for $5.25/share. (BGC Tender Offer, at *8.) BGC simultaneously disclosed that it had acquired 13.5% of GFI's common stock. (BGC Tender Offer, at *8.) With the prospect of an all cash tender-offer, GFI's share price skyrocketed from $5.03/share to $6.02/share. (Defs.' Response \u00b6 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, BGC and CME traded escalating bids for GFI. (Defs' Response \u00b6\u00b6 237-255.) In the midst of that bidding war, GFI released its Proxy Statement, which contained a 14-page description of the process and events leading up to the CME proposed transaction. (Proxy Statement, at 59-73.) On January 2015, the bidding culminated with BGC's cash offer of $6.10/share. (Defs.' Response \u00b6 255.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 30, 2015, GFI shareholders rejected the CME deal. (Guglielmo Decl. Ex. 108 (\"WSJ Article\"), at 1.) GFI and CME terminated the proposed merger, and BGC completed its tender offer, obtaining a controlling interest in GFI. (Lynch Decl. Exs. FF (\"Jan. Press Release\"); GG (\"Feb. Press Release\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gross represents a class of GFI investors who sold their stock after the July 30, 2014 Press Release, but before BGC announced its tender offer on September 9, 2014. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 30.) Gross claims that Gooch's statement misleadingly implied that the CME transaction was the best available deal for GFI, meaning that it represented the best opportunity for GFI shareholders to attain value. (Defs.' Response \u00b6 200.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Summary judgment is only appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Defendants contend that\n   Plaintiffs have contorted that sentence into implying the CME deal was the\n   <em>\n    best possible\n   </em>\n   deal for GFI shareholders. But because no other company had made a competing offer for GFI (BGC had not specified how much it would pay), Defendants argue that at the time of Gooch's statement, CME's deal was indeed \"singular\" and \"unique.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Webster's defines singular as being \"of or relating to a separate person or thing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   2124 (1993).) It defines unique as \"being the only one\" or \"being without a like or equal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   2500 (1993).) This Court held in its prior Opinion &amp; Order that \"a reasonable person could [have] conclude[d] [from Gooch's statement] that the proposed transaction would provide them with the best possible share price.\"\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

Defendants fail to establish that Plaintiffs' proffered reading of Gooch's statement-that it implied the CME deal was the best opportunity for GFI shareholders to optimize value-is unreasonable as a matter of law. Plaintiffs could have understood Gooch's statement to imply that the proposed CME transaction was without like or equal, and that therefore no alternative deal would have been better. Indeed, Defendants only posit that the CME \"transaction was singular and unique\n   <em>\n    in at least one sense of those terms\n   </em>\n   .\" (Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 144, at 7:4-6. (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It would not be unreasonable for a jury to find that such a representation was misleading based on what GFI and Gooch knew at that time. The evidence demonstrates that the price of $4.55/share was neither \"singular\" nor \"unique,\" or that, at a minimum, GFI and Gooch could not definitively state that this was so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Jefferies had estimated GFI's \"sum-of-the-parts\" value at $5.41/share, an amount much higher than what CME proposed. (Jefferies Presentation, at 3.) And Gooch shut down the special committee's \"market check\" for better offers, making it unknown what other companies would have paid. (Defs.' Response \u00b6\u00b6 166-167.) Although BGC had not disclosed how much it would be willing to pay, it had reached out to discuss a potential deal. (Proxy Statement, at 72.) Gooch turned down that invitation. (Proxy Statement, at 72.) Further, BGC's acquisition of GFI for $6.10/share, a huge premium over CME's original offer, suggests that Gooch knew or should have known that CME's offer was not \"unique.\" (Defs.' Response \u00b6\u00b6 252, 255.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This evidence presents a quintessential jury question, namely, whether Gooch's statement in the context of the Press Release was misleading. \"Some statements, although literally accurate, can become, through their context and manner of presentation, devices which mislead investors.\"\n   <em>\n    McMahan &amp; Co. v.

That Proxy Statement described the process leading up to GFI's decision to recommend the CME transaction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proxy Statement, at 59-73.)

In other words, when publicly available information contradicts a misleading statement, there is no opportunity for a defendant's scheme to succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The situation here is analogous. The proposed CME transaction could not close\n   without the majority approval of GFI's shareholders, and that vote could not take place until the proxy materials were distributed. The Proxy Statement's 14-page detailed description of the process culminating in the CME merger agreement fully disclosed the machinations behind the proposed transaction. (Proxy Statement, at 59-73.) Importantly, it disclosed that Greenhill had initiated a \"market check\" and \"identified 22 third parties that might be interested in\" a transaction with GFI. (Proxy Statement, at 64.) The Proxy Statement also revealed that in March 2014 Gooch informed the special committee that he would \"vote against any other transaction presented to GFI Stockholders.\" (Proxy Statement, at 64.) Following Gooch's rebuke, the special committee and Greenhill abandoned the \"market check.\" (Proxy Statement, at 64-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Proxy Statement described Gooch's presentation of BGC's email at the July 29, 2014 Board meeting, and his reiteration to the Board that he \"intended to vote against any transaction involving GFI with any party other than CME.\" (Proxy Statement, at 72.) Plaintiffs' expert acknowledges that there was nothing misleading in the Proxy Statement, and that it was in fact \"quite detailed.\" (Lynch Decl. Ex. K (\"Purcell Depo.\"), at 149:18-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Like in\n   <em>\n    GeoPharma\n   </em>\n   , the inevitable release of the Proxy Statement, which publicly provided the pros and cons of the CME transaction, as well as GFI's due diligence (or lack thereof) in approving it, demonstrates that shareholders and analysts had all confounding information to Gooch's statement prior to voting.

Consequently,\n   Plaintiffs contend that BGC's tender offer caused the spike in GFI's share price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The problem with Plaintiffs' theory is that they cannot disaggregate corrective information in BGC's tender offer from the other \"new industry-specific or firm-specific facts\" that it revealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dura Pharm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p346\">\n    544 U.S. at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p346\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The market learned that GFI shares were valued higher than the proposed CME transaction, and that BGC intended to launch a tender offer. Investors also learned that BGC was offering $5.25/share, and that a bidding war might ensue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lynch Decl., Ex. CC (\"Morningstar Report\"), at 26.) In that regard, BGC also disclosed that it had acquired a 13.5% stake in GFI, another factor that investors could expect would propel the bidding. (BGC Tender Offer, at *8; Lynch Decl., Ex. G (\"Coffman Depo.\"), at 207:17-208:25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This mix of new information likely spawned the surge in GFI's share price over the next few days. As in\n   <em>\n    Omnicom\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs have not \"demonstrate[d] that the market reacted [ ] to the disclosures, rather than to other information simultaneously released to the market.\"\n   <em>\n    Omnicom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711612\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/541/546/#p553\">\n    541 F.Supp.2d at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiffs could not disentangle information revealed through news article from \"highly negative commentary about facts already known to the market,\" meaning there was \"no way for a juror to determine whether the alleged fraud caused any portion of [p]laintiffs' loss\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The analysis performed by Plaintiffs' expert, Chad Coffman, does not alter this Court's conclusion. Coffman does not attempt to attribute any portion of the increase in GFI's share price to a corrective disclosure as opposed to other simultaneously released information. Instead, Coffman opines that \"no additional confounding news was revealed on [the day of BGC's offer] that could have been an alternate explanation for the market price movement.\" (Coffman Report, \u00b6 64.) But this ignores the other information embedded in BGC's offer, including the substantial position that BGC had taken in GFI and that it intended to wage a hostile takeover. Such information could not have been disclosed by GFI at the time of the Press Release.
