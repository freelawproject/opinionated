Am. Compl. \u00b6 124. The Plaintiffs further allege that both of the Defendants' refusal to return confidential information, failure to assign the franchise leases, failure to transfer franchise assets, and use of the Plaintiffs' Marks constitute irreparable harm, because such conduct is \"a clear violation of the law and the express terms\" of the franchise agreements.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 125. The Plaintiffs also state that this continuing breach of the terms of the franchise agreements means that the Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and are likely to succeed on the merits.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 127, 129. The Plaintiffs also state that their injury outweighs any that would be sustained by the Defendants, and that injunctive relief would not adversely affect the public interest.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 131-32.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Almost all of Plaintiffs' claims to injunctive relief involve\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    of the Defendants' breach of the franchise agreements.

Nor do the Plaintiffs allege any other basis through which Mr. Williams is bound by the terms of the franchise agreements. Therefore, the Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief\n    from Mr. Williams's continuing breach of the franchise agreements is implausible on its face, because there are no factual allegations that Mr. Williams carries any obligations under the franchise agreements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     JTH Tax, Inc. v.

Further, the Plaintiffs allege that the balance of hardships favors them and the public interest would not be harmed by injunctive relief. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 131-32. As such, the court\n    <strong>\n     FINDS\n    </strong>\n    that the facts alleged by the Plaintiffs, presumed true, are sufficient to survive Mr. Williams's Partial Motion to Dismiss, insofar as the Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief from Mr. Williams's misuse of the Marks.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     VIII.
