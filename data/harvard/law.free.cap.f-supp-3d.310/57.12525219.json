BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs want to know more about President Donald Trump's relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. More specifically, they wonder about Trump's interactions with the agency\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he became President: \"Was he friend or foe? A reliable or unreliable informant? The target of an investigation into serious misconduct? A cooperative or uncooperative witness?\" ECF No. 14 (Pl. MSJ) at 14. Or, perhaps, \"did he never cross paths with the FBI at all?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In search of answers, Plaintiffs submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act to Defendant Department of Justice. The Government, as it is wont to do with law-enforcement records, issued a so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   \" response, meaning that it would neither confirm nor deny whether it maintained any such documents about Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs responded by filing suit in this Court, and both parties have now moved for partial summary judgment. While the Court affirms that the Government may generally refuse to answer Plaintiffs' request, questions remain about whether \"there exists a [narrow] category of responsive documents for which a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response would be unwarranted.\"\n   <em>\n    PETA v.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are Jason Leopold, an investigative reporter for Buzzfeed News; Ryan Shapiro, a PhD candidate at MIT; and Property of the People, a non-profit \"dedicated to governmental transparency,\" including \"for the Administration of Donald J.

[are] prologue to the current tumultuous relationship between the President and the Bureau.\" Pl. MSJ at 1. To that end, they submitted a FOIA request on March 16, 2017, seeking access to eight categories of records, all ostensibly related to Trump.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12-2 (First Declaration of David M. Hardy, Exh. A). First, they requested records referencing several FBI files: Nos. 194-NK-88595, 166-LV-29911, 137-NY-19967, 137-22152, and 92-PH-99239.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They attached documents, released from previous FOIA requests, showing Trump's name associated with each case number.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a catch-all, they also sought \"[a]ny and all records mentioning or referring to the living person Donald John Trump\" from June 14, 1946, to June 15, 2015-the day before he announced his candidacy for president.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That last catch-all category is the only issue currently before the Court.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Generally, FOIA requires an agency to conduct a search and make requested records available unless they fall within one of the statute's nine enumerated exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A), (b)(1)-(9). When an agency does withhold documents, it typically must explain what has been withheld and why.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v.

There is, however, an exception when \"confirming or denying the existence of [certain] records would\"\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   reveal protected information.\n   <em>\n    Nation Magazine v.

Such a reply is called a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response, named after a Cold-War-era CIA project that the agency wished to keep confidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marino v.

In\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   cases, Exemption 7(C) allows agencies to conceal the existence of responsive documents if the presence of such records in the agency's system would \"associate the individual named in the request with criminal activity\" or otherwise compromise the person's privacy.\n   <em>\n    Nation Magazine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415376,3689465\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/885/\">\n    71 F.3d at 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the Government's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response in \"two distinct but related ways.\"\n   <em>\n    Agility Pub.

The public hasn't a clue on that question, and the Bureau is entitled to keep the answer a secret. The Court accordingly holds that the FBI has waived its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response only with respect to those exact records previously released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Exemption 7(C)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that even if not otherwise waived, Defendant has not justified issuing its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response pursuant to Exemption 7(C). \"[J]udicial review of an asserted Exemption 7 privilege requires a two-part inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    FBI v.

If the agency so establishes, it must then demonstrate that a particular subpart of Exemption 7 applies.

First, they contend that their request encompasses non-investigative records, which necessarily fall outside Exemption 7's purview. Second, they argue that even as to investigative records, the agency has not shown that Trump's privacy interests outweigh the public's interest in any such documents. Finally, they say that the FBI's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is invalid at least as to certain\n   <em>\n    categories\n   </em>\n   of investigative records. The Court looks at each, ultimately finding that there are two small subsets of records for which the FBI has not justified its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1.

A. On its face, this request encompasses both law-enforcement material\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   records collected for other purposes, such as administrative and personnel files. This latter category of records, of course, would not have been \"compiled for law enforcement purposes\" and thus could not trigger Exemption 7(C)'s protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson v.

First, it claims that Plaintiffs \"provided no evidence to the FBI that there might be non-law enforcement FBI records on Trump.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. That may be so, but for FOIA purposes, it is irrelevant. To craft a proper FOIA request, a person simply must meet two requirements: 1) \"reasonably describe such records\" and 2) follow \"published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A). Contrary to Defendant's (uncited) assertions, there is no requirement that Plaintiffs provide\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   that such records exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, the Government offers a declaration from David Hardy, the Section Chief of the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section, which takes a different tack. There, Hardy maintains that \"the FBI reasonably interpreted Plaintiffs' request\" to encompass only \"records about a third party related to the performance of the FBI's [law-enforcement] mission.\" Second Hardy Decl., \u00b6 18. Ordinarily, however, the agency is \"bound to read [the request] as drafted, not as ... agency officials ... might wish it was drafted.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"15738,3796319\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/730/773/\">\n    730 F.2d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Rather than construe a request narrowly, \"an agency ... has a duty to construe a FOIA request liberally.\"\n   <em>\n    Nation Magazine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415376,3689465\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/885/\">\n    71 F.3d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, a liberal construction of \"[a]ny and all records\" related to Donald Trump would include both investigative and non-investigative files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Hardy retorts that \"[h]ad the FBI interpreted Plaintiffs' request as seeking each and every document in the FBI's possession bearing the name of Donald Trump,\" such a request would have been \"overly broad/unduly burdensome.\" Second Hardy Decl., \u00b6 16. The Bureau therefore \"interpreted Plaintiffs' request in such a way as to make it possible for the FBI to substantively respond.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. Even assuming that the FBI is entitled to apply such a savings construction, however, it has not proven that one was needed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Hardy asserts, in conclusory fashion, that the agency could only locate administrative or personnel files by asking \"every\n   FBI office and the more than 35,000 employees of the FBI to conduct searches for any non-investigative records bearing the name of Donald John Trump.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16 (emphasis omitted). But it is not clear why this is so. Ordinarily, the FBI conducts searches by querying its Central Record System (CRS), \"a comprehensive system of records consisting of applicant investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI.\" First Hardy Decl., \u00b6 21. Hardy says that \"the vast\n   <em>\n    majority\n   </em>\n   of the FBI records in [its] Central Record System ('CRS') are criminal and national security related.\" Second Hardy Decl., \u00b6 16 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). But by his own admission, the CRS also contains \"personnel\" and \"administrative\" records,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Hardy Decl., \u00b6 21, and the volume of records would seem irrelevant when the agency is querying a search engine. Perhaps the Government can prove otherwise, but it does not appear \"unduly burdensome\" to ask the agency to search for Donald Trump's name within the CRS and see whether any personnel or administrative records surface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Of course, personnel and administrative records may be covered by a different FOIA exception-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exemption 6, which protects \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). The FBI has halfheartedly invoked this exemption in issuing its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response, yet it provided no real justification for doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hardy Decl., Exh. B. And it is not self-evident that Trump retains a privacy interest in at least certain administrative files. For example, in 2013, he noted he \"may\" or \"may not\" bid for the FBI headquarters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 20-21 (citing Johnathan O'Connell,\n   <em>\n    Donald and Daughter Ivanka Trump Will Consider Acquiring FBI Headquarters\n   </em>\n   , Wash. Post (Sept. 11, 2013) ). Perhaps these were mere musings, but to the extent the FBI maintains administrative files related to such publicly reported interactions, Exemption 6 may not be appropriate. For now, though, it suffices to say that the FBI should construe Plaintiff's request as written-for \"any and all\" records related to Donald Trump-or submit an affidavit explaining in greater detail why such a search would be unduly burdensome. In the meantime, the Court finds Defendant's \"\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response [may] be unwarranted\" for non-investigative records, and it thus cannot grant summary judgment in its favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n    745 F.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    2.

While there are exceptions (outlined in detail below), the Court generally finds that the balance tips in Defendant's favor.

It so held because it interpreted the term \"personal privacy\" in that exemption to \"pertain[ ] to the privacy interests of individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5934745,12457261\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/397/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5934745,12457261\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/397/\">\n    at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5934745,12457261\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/397/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Trump, of course, is an individual. While the Trump Organization has no cognizable privacy interest under FOIA, Donald Trump retains one, regardless of whether the records pertain to his personal or business affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The line between corporations and individuals, of course, can be blurry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/#p2768\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2768,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/#p2768\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings.\"). The Court can identify some outer bounds-for instance, imagine that the FBI had investigated Trump (or any other executive) for embezzling funds from corporate coffers. This information, about any crimes taken in his personal capacity, falls squarely within Exemption 7(C), even if it pertains nominally to his \"work life.\" Pl. MSJ at 17. On the other hand, records related to the Trump Organization would receive no protection under FOIA. In addition, Trump would have no privacy interest in his mere\n   <em>\n    affiliation\n   </em>\n   with the Trump Organization,\n   even were the company under scrutiny. After all, Trump's former position is no secret, and \"information connected with professional relationships does not\" trigger any protected privacy interest.\n   <em>\n    Sims v. CIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514617,1197234\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/642/562/\">\n    642 F.2d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (D.C. Cir. 1980). As explained below, Exemption 7(C) would not block a request for records related to the Trump Organization, nor would it require the FBI to redact any mention of Trump's affiliation with that company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is more difficult to discern how to treat any records relating to Trump's actions in his \"official capacity\" as chief executive of a corporation-if, for example the FBI investigated him for committing wire fraud\n   <em>\n    on behalf of\n   </em>\n   his organization. For purposes of this Motion, however, the Court need not dwell on the distinction because the Government concedes Exemption 7(C) would not apply to such records. Ordinarily, such concession might defeat the agency's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. For when \"there exists a category of responsive documents for which a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response would be unwarranted, [the agency's] assertion of a blanket\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response ... cannot be sustained.\"\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n    745 F.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Plaintiffs requested \"[a]ny and all records mentioning or referring to the living person Donald John Trump,\" and the Bureau agrees that there is one category-records mentioning Trump in his official capacity-that falls outside Exemption 7(C). Plaintiffs therefore argue that the agency must acknowledge any such documents and \"be permitted only to issue a partial\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\" Pl. Reply at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In his declaration, however, Hardy suggests that the agency has already done exactly that. Remember, the Government's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response covers only \"the existence of\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   records about Mr. Trump\" \"[o]utside of [its] limited releases\" from an earlier FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hardy Decl., \u00b6 12 (emphasis added). Previously, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request seeking records related to \"Trump Entertainment Resorts, Donald J. Trump Foundation, Trump University, and Trump Organization.\" First Hardy Decl., \u00b6 19 n. 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jason Leopold\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-2182). As just explained, each of those organizations has no protected privacy interest under Exemption 7(C). The FBI was therefore required to search for relevant records and ultimately released a number of responsive documents, including ones in which Trump's name appeared unredacted. It stands to reason that any materials mentioning Trump in his \"official capacity\" as executive of Trump Entertainment Resorts, Donald J. Trump Foundation, Trump University, and Trump Organization would have surfaced in that search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Government, however, never says this expressly, thereby leaving a question of fact as to whether it has processed all such records. It thus has two choices: (1) submit an affidavit averring that it has previously released all documents mentioning Trump \"in the context of his official capacity as chief executive of specific organizations\"; or (2) conduct a search for that subset of records and narrow its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response accordingly. Until then, the Court cannot grant summary judgment upholding the Government's broad\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Washington Post\n   </em>\n   article\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, and as foreshadowed earlier, Plaintiffs say that Trump has lessened his privacy interest by publicly revealing his interactions with law enforcement during an interview with\n   <em>\n    The Washington Post\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 5; Robert O'Harrow Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Trump's Ties to an Informant and FBI Agent Reveal His Mode of Operation\n   </em>\n   , Wash. Post (Sept. 17, 2016). In that article, Trump apparently discussed his relationship with Daniel Sullivan, a business associate\n   and, as it turns out, FBI informant. He revealed how Sullivan once arrived at his office with two FBI agents in tow, one of whom Trump considered \"a very high quality person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   article then goes on to quote extensively from a 1981 FBI report by the same agents, describing conversations in which Trump told them about plans for opening a casino, as well as his concerns about Atlantic City.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting \"TRUMP stated ... that he was willing to fully cooperate with the FBI\" in opening his casino).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court agrees that Trump may have opened the door to records related to these interactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240320,4154922\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1082/\">\n    746 F.3d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because DeLay's public statements confirmed he had been under investigation, the FBI's acknowledgment that it had responsive records would not itself cause harm by confirming that fact.\"). Plaintiffs, however, have jumped the gun in raising such argument now. In their initial FOIA request, they separately attached the very police report mentioned in the\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   article, along with two case numbers referenced in the report. They then requested \"[a]ny and all records that constitute, mention, or refer to\" either file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hardy Decl., Exh. A (Addendum C). The FBI has assigned each request its own case number (1369466-0 and 1359371-0, respectively), and its treatment thereof is not the subject of the Government's instant Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   True, these records may overlap with the request at issue-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , they may include \"documents related to Donald John Trump.\" But \"[s]ince these documents are also responsive to other counts of Plaintiffs' request,\" the FBI has decided to \"process and release non-exempt portions of these records to Plaintiffs at a later date and will provide justification for its withholding in a later submission.\" Second Hardy Decl., \u00b6 10. The Court, too, will thus save for another day any dispute over the FBI's treatment of records related to the 1981 report, including those mentioning Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   All told, the Government comes close to justifying its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response but ultimately claims no cigar. The Court concludes that it has not yet justified its sweeping\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response for two categories of responsive records: (1) non-investigative records related to Donald Trump and (2) records that mention Trump \"in the context of his official capacity as chief executive of specific organizations.\" At the same time, it affirms that Defendant may at least issue a narrow\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response as to most law-enforcement records. Until then, the Court will deny both parties' Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
