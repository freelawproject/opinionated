Plaintiff alleges that the collection letters she received from the defendants violated the FDCPA because they were misleading-specifically, that the letters implied the debts were legally enforceable, when in fact they were not, and that the letters failed to communicate effectively her right to dispute the validity of the debts. In a joint Motion to Dismiss, the defendants dispute that their letters violated the FDCPA, and assert that the debt buyer defendant cannot be liable as a matter of law. The threshold question is whether debt buyers which acquire defaulted (and often time-barred) debt in order to collect upon it qualify as \"debt collectors\" under the Act. I conclude that they do, and further conclude that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that the collection letters violated the Act. Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2016, Plaintiff Darla Norman received two nearly identical letters from Defendant Allied Interstate, LLC, each attempting to collect on an alleged debt. In the letters, Allied stated that it was acting on behalf of Defendant LVNV Funding, LLC, to collect the debts. LVNV had not lent Norman any money-in fact, Defendants admit that the debts were incurred originally to two non-party creditors more than seven years earlier. But at some point after Norman allegedly defaulted on the debts, LVNV purchased them from the creditors (or from another debt buyer) and contracted with Allied to collect on them. By May 2016, when Allied sent the collection letters, the statute of limitations had run, rendering both debts legally unenforceable. The letters each listed the amount owed and the original creditor, and read in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n   Our client [LVNV] is interested in resolving this Account and is willing to consider payment for less than the Amount Owed to satisfy your obligation.

Defs.' Mot. 7-8; Defs.' Reply 6, ECF No. 14.

Focusing on the fact that the \"plain language\" of the \"regularly collects\" definition hinges on whether the debt is \"owed [to] another,\" the\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    Court determined that a debt buyer \"may indeed collect debts for its own account without triggering the ['regularly collects'] statutory definition.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/\">\n     at 1721-22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Since\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    , decided in June 2017, three district courts in this Circuit have recognized its limited scope, and applied its precepts only to the \"regularly collects\" definition of a debt collector.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Beard v.

Reply 7-8. LVNV is correct that Plaintiff's allegations as to this element are few; she alleges that debt collection is the principal purpose of LVNV's business, and that Allied was collecting \"for LVNV\" when it sent the collection letters. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. But she also attaches the letters themselves,\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    which state that Allied was contacting Plaintiff \"on behalf of LVNV\" and that the alleged debts were originated by third parties (creditors HSBC and General Electric). Moreover, undisputed evidence and admissions bolster Plaintiff's allegations. First, LVNV admits in its brief that it is in the business of debt-buying. Defs.' Mot. 6 (describing the business as a \"post-default purchaser of debts\"). Second, I take judicial notice of the fact that LVNV's website-a single, non-interactive page consisting of two paragraphs of text-describes the company as a buyer of consumer debt owned by banks, finance companies, and \"other debt buyers.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    http://lvnvfunding.com (last visited May 25, 2018);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 201(b)(2) (\"The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it ... can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\"). There is no reference to any other form of commercial activity. The site explains that LVNV outsources its \"management\" of the purchased debt to a single debt collector, Resurgent Capital Services LP, and the only interactive content on LVNV's site is a link to Resurgent's site. Resurgent then either collects the debt or outsources collection to yet another debt collector-presumably, Allied is one of those collectors. Simply because LVNV \"outsources\" its debt collection to Resurgent or other subcontractors does not mean that LVNV sheds its essential character as a debt collection business or is somehow converted into something other than a debt collector. Nor does LVNV's assertion that it is a \"creditor\" make it so. Absent evidence that LVNV engages in any lending, or has a principal purpose other than buying old debt in order to collect on it, Plaintiff has adequately plead that LVNV is a debt collector under the FDCPA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Relatedly, LVNV insists that it cannot be liable under the Act because it \"did not send the letter[s] or engage directly in any conduct to collect a debt from Plaintiff,\" and Plaintiff has not and cannot allege a basis for vicarious liability. Defs.' Reply 7-8. LVNV seems to argue that Plaintiff's Complaint has both curable and incurable defects-that Plaintiff has not alleged \"supporting facts\" showing that LVNV is vicariously liable for Allied's actions, and that, regardless, Plaintiff is \"precluded\" from arguing that LVNV is vicariously liable because LVNV is a creditor.

Where an \"actual or apparent\" contradiction exists, the\n    <em>\n     Wilson\n    </em>\n    Court explained, the letter must include a reconciling statement to avoid the confusion that would result if the letter does not explain how the demand for payment \"fit[s] together\" with the consumer's dispute rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Although this is admittedly a closer question than Plaintiff's \u00a7 1692e claim, I am persuaded that the letter, taken as a whole, would leave the least sophisticated consumer uncertain as to her dispute rights under the Act.

Rather, it was Allied's request for payment and warning that checks would be immediately deposited and not returned, without \"explaining that its demand did not override the consumer's rights under section 1692g\" that rendered the validation notice ineffective. Allied's failure to include a \"reconciling statement\" leaves the least sophisticated consumer-and indeed, this Court-uncertain of how Allied's demands \"fit[ ] together\" with her dispute and validation rights.

In a putative class action against LVNV, Resurgent, and a company called Sherman Capital in the Southern District of Indiana, the Court wrote: \"The named Defendants are 'debt collectors' and, according to the Plaintiffs, are alter-egos of one another .... Sherman is alleged to be a limited liability company, primarily engaged in the business of purchasing, and collecting on, data containing information about Indiana consumer accounts. LVNV is alleged to be the holding vehicle of data on behalf of unknown investors. Resurgent is a subsidiary of the other Defendants and is alleged to be the master servicer of the LVNV collateralized debt obligation.\"\n     <em>\n      Cox v.

Ind. Jan. 22, 2016). The nature of the companies' relationship proved a pivotal sticking point in that case. Later, in granting plaintiffs' motion to compel, the court wrote: \"The instant situation is merely the continuation of a pattern of deliberate attempts by Defendants to obfuscate the information and evidence in this matter. That pattern began with the refusal of Defendants' witnesses to identify their roles in the various corporate entities under which Defendants operate. On June 13, 2013, [the] Court ordered Defendants' witnesses to respond to questions regarding Defendants' ownership interests during a round of jurisdictional discovery depositions. The pattern of obfuscation of information continued with Defendants' efforts to seal from public view the identities of legal entities created pursuant to state law that had been joined as parties to this matter.\"\n     <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207975817\">\n      2016 WL 7975817\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , at *1 (Feb. 5, 2016).
