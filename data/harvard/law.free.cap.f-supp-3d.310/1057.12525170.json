BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 13, 2015, Plaintiffs San Diego Unified Port District (the \"Port District\") and City of San Diego (the \"City\") commenced this action by filing the Complaint. (ECF No. 1). On August 3, 2015, the City and the Port District filed separate First Amended Complaints (\"FACs\") against Defendants Monsanto Company, Solutia Inc., and Pharmacia Corporation (collectively, \"Monsanto\"). (ECF Nos. 24, 25). On August 31, 2015, Monsanto filed a Motion to Dismiss the City's FAC (ECF No. 31) and a Motion to Dismiss the Port District's FAC (ECF No. 32). On September 28, 2016, the Court issued an Order granting in part and denying in part Monsanto's Motion to Dismiss the Port District's FAC and granting Monsanto's Motion to Dismiss the City's FAC in its entirety. (ECF No. 81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 22, 2016, the City filed the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") alleging\n   a single cause of action against Monsanto for public nuisance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 24, 2017, Monsanto filed a Motion to Dismiss the SAC. (ECF No. 108). Monsanto argued, in part, that the SAC must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the City must first exhaust administrative remedies before the Commission on State Mandates (\"the Commission\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Monsanto argued that the City was required to exhaust administrative remedies because the tort damages the City seeks in this case are permit compliance costs that qualify as unfunded state mandates under\n   <em>\n    Department of Finance v. Commission on State Mandates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446754\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-5th/1/749/\">\n    1 Cal.5th 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2044\">\n    207 Cal.Rptr.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20P.3d%20356\">\n    378 P.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Monsanto asserted that the City is currently seeking reimbursement for these permit compliance costs through test claims before the Commission. Further Monsanto argued that the Court should exercise its discretion to dismiss or stay this matter pending resolution of the test claims on prudential exhaustion grounds. On April 7, 2017, the City filed a response in opposition and argued that administrative exhaustion is inapplicable to this case because the Commission was not authorized to address the City's public nuisance claim for tort damages or to award tort damages for the costs of PCB removal. Further, the City argued that the Court should not exercise its discretion to require exhaustion because any decision by the Commission would have no impact on this action. (ECF No. 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 11, 2017, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 163). With respect to the parties' arguments on exhaustion, the Court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [I]n this case, the City brings a cause of action in tort for public nuisance against a private entity pursuant to applicable sections of the California Civil Code and the California Code of Civil Procedure. California law does not establish an administrative procedure for a public nuisance claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abelleira\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

While some portion of the damages the City seeks from Monsanto in this public nuisance claim may overlap in part with unfunded state mandate costs at issue in pending test claims before the Commission, the jurisdictional requirement of administrative exhaustion is limited to \"where an administrative remedy is required by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205571\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/17/280/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court concludes that the City is not precluded from bringing its public nuisance claim by any statutory administrative exhaustion requirement. The Court further concludes that prudential exhaustion is not warranted at this stage in proceedings. The Court declines to exercise any discretion to stay or dismiss the City's suit pending resolution of the test claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison-Knudsen Co.\n   </em>\n   , 811 F.2d at 1223.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (ECF No. 163 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 20, 2017, Monsanto filed a Motion for Reconsideration or, in the alternative, Certification for Interlocutory Appeal Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (ECF No. 175). Monsanto requests that the Court reconsider its earlier denial of a\n   stay of this litigation on prudential exhaustion grounds and, in the alternative, requests that \"the Court certify that portion of its November 22nd Order declining to dismiss or stay this case pending exhaustion of administrative remedies for appeal to the Ninth Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(b).\" (ECF No. 175-1 at 7). On January 16, 2018, the City filed a response in opposition. (ECF No. 187). On January 22, 2018, Monsanto filed a reply. (ECF No. 188).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RECONSIDERATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Monsanto requests that the Court reconsider the earlier denial of a stay of this litigation on prudential exhaustion grounds. Monsanto contends that reconsideration is warranted because the Court committed clear error by failing to stay or dismiss the case on prudential exhaustion grounds. Monsanto asserts that the California Court of Appeal decision in\n   <em>\n    Department of Finance v. Commission on State Mandates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514082\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/226/846/\">\n    18 Cal.App.5th 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514082\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/226/846/\">\n    226 Cal.Rptr.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"constitutes new or different circumstances under which the failure to dismiss or stay this case would be clear error.\" (ECF No. 175-1 at 12). Monsanto contends that this decision \"entitles the City to reimbursement from the State for the very same storm water permit compliance costs\" that the City seeks from Monsanto as damages in this public nuisance action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Monsanto contends that prudential exhaustion will reduce the scope of discovery and motion practice and result in a \"more streamlined trial\" because \"the Commission's final determination regarding the amount of the unfunded State mandate that must be reimbursed by the State to the City will moot or substantially narrow the scope of the City's action and it damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Monsanto contends that the collateral source rule is inapplicable to this action and that the law prohibits double recovery by the City of both permit compliance costs reimbursed by the state and damages for tort liability. (ECF No. 188).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The City contends that reconsideration is not warranted and that the recent state appellate decision in\n   <em>\n    Department of Finance v. Commission on State Mandates\n   </em>\n   does not modify the legal principles underlying the Court's prior determination that administrative exhaustion is not required. The City contends that the state appellate court decision \"does not change the fact that the agency cannot, as a matter of law, award the City damages for its tort claims.\" (ECF No. 187 at 5). The City asserts that the \"only overlap\" between damages sought from Monsanto in this case and unfunded state mandate costs at issue in the state appellate court decision is \"in the cost of street-sweeping.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The City contends that \"the reimbursement of the costs of street sweeping does not substantially impact the City's claimed damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the City contends that California has \"long adhered to the collateral source rule\" and that, under the collateral source rule, \"the City's recovery of ... costs from the State does not preclude the City from seeking those same costs from Monsanto[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.

At the time the Court made its ruling, several test claims challenging provisions of various NPDES permits issued to the City by the San Diego Regional Quality Control Board were currently pending before the Commission and a petition for writ of mandate to overturn the Commission's decision that permit requirements in the 2007 NPDES permit constitute an unfunded\n   state mandate was pending before the state court of appeal.

The case was before the state appellate court for a determination as to whether the Commission correctly determined that conditions imposed on the 2007 water permit issued to the County of San Diego and cities located in the county by the Regional Water Quality Control Board are state mandates. The state appellate court determined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   there is no federal law, regulation, or administrative case authority that expressly mandated the San Diego Regional Board to impose any of the challenged requirements discussed above.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   As a general rule, however, we have applied prudential exhaustion requirements in actions against agencies and agency officials, and not typically in actions between two private parties ....

Commission on State Mandates\n   </em>\n   does not constitute changed circumstances justifying reconsideration or any stay or dismissal of this public nuisance action.

(ECF No. 175-1). Monsanto contends that \"whether a municipality is required to exhaust its administrative remedies for state-imposed permit compliance costs with the Commission before concurrently litigating for the same or overlapping costs\" is a controlling question of law presented in the November 22 Order. (ECF No. 175-1 at 21). Monsanto contends that discretionary decisions of district courts, including discretionary decisions not to require prudential exhaustion, \"routinely serve as a proper bas[is] for certification of an interlocutory appeal in the Ninth Circuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Monsanto contends that certification is appropriate because there is a difference of opinion among district courts on whether exhaustion is necessary on this issue and because \"this Court's order is ... at odds with decades of California law requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies in similar circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Monsanto contends that interlocutory appeal will reduce the scope and materially advance the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The City contends that interlocutory appeal is not warranted in this case on this\n   issue. The City contends that Monsanto's asserted \"controlling question of law\" requires factual determinations about \"what remedy is sought, and whether any administrative proceeding can provide that remedy.\" (ECF No. 187 at 14). The City contends that no substantial ground for difference of opinion exists and that this appeal will not reduce the scope of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A district court may certify an otherwise non-appealable order for review by an appellate court when three conditions are met: (1) the order involves a \"controlling question of law\"; (2) there is \"substantial ground for difference of opinion\"; and (3) \"an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).
