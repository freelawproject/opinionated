Compl., ECF No. 1. Plaintiff alleges Defendant interfered with her exercise of her right to take leave under the FMLA, and retaliated against her for doing so by terminating her employment.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  Plaintiff also alleges she was terminated for refusing to be complicit in fraudulent activity, in violation of public policy, and that she was discriminated against based on her disability.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  After eight months of discovery, Defendant moved for summary judgment on February 19, 2018. ECF No. 27.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  Plaintiff responded on March 12, and Defendant replied on March 26.

ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <footnote label=\"2\">\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   On April 20, 2018, Plaintiff moved to file supplemental medical records. ECF No. 33. Defendants oppose the motion. ECF No. 34. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1) states that \"[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" The motion indicates that it was brought to Plaintiff's attention after filing the response brief that some of the records had not been produced by the Heritage Family Physicians despite the fact that Plaintiff had requested them. They were not produced because the treating physician had left the practice and the records were being maintained by a third-party group. This is a sufficient justification for the delay. The majority of these records concern Plaintiff's September 2013 hospital visit, about which Plaintiff testified during her deposition. These records contain little novel information. The remainder of the records do not appear to have any impact on the analysis contained herein, and Plaintiff makes no attempt at explaining the relevance of these records. Thus, the delayed production of these records is harmless, and the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   ALDI hired Plaintiff as a cashier in October of 2011, and she was ultimately promoted to store manager. Edwards Dep. at 184, 189-92. ECF No. 27-2.

Edwards Decl., ECF No. 31-15. Since that accident Plaintiff has suffered from a variety of maladies related to her ears, including \"excruciating discomfort, excess draining, infected ear drums, several perforations of eardrums, lymph node swelling and infections throughout the neck, mastoiditis bilateral, headache.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. Infection of the middle ear can lead to a more serious condition known as mastoiditis, a bacterial infection of the\n   mastoid air cells surrounding the inner and middle ear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was diagnosed with bilateral mastoiditis in September of 2013. Med. Recs., ECF No. 33-1 at PGID 1497-1510.

The mastoiditis did not impact her ability to perform her job as store manager and did not impact her ability to perform daily life activities outside of work. Edwards Dep. at 36-37. She was treated with antibiotics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. After she was discharged on September 16, 2013, her doctor imposed no work restrictions on her and she went back to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November of 2013, Plaintiff's Doctor stated as follows: \"My impression is that this patient has bilateral chronic otitis externa as well as significant temporomandibular joint dysfunction as a cause of her underlying, ongoing complaints of otorrhea and ear fullness and pressure and mild ache. She developed an episode of acute otitis media in September which is now completely resolved.\" Medical Records, ECF No. 31-5 at PGID 1384. On May 19, 2015, Plaintiff reported to the emergency room at St. Mary's, was diagnosed with acute persistent otitis media and otitis externa, was discharged with instructions to follow up with a primary care provider in 2 days, and was instructed to continue antibiotics and eardrops.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PGID 1397. On May 22, 2015, she reported to the emergency room again where she was diagnosed with mastoiditis and transferred to the University of Michigan Hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PGID 1406; Edwards Dep. at 42-43. She was not admitted to the hospital on that occasion. Med. Recs at PGID 1410-17, ECF No. 31-5. The University of Michigan did not confirm the diagnosis of mastoiditis, but diagnosed her with otitis media with spontaneous rupture of eardrum. Discharge Instructions, ECF No. 27-3. She was discharged and prescribed antibiotics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Her condition did not impact her ability to perform he job as store manager. Edwards Dep. at 46. When asked if the condition impacted her ability to perform daily life activities, she responded that she \"pushed through, pain or no pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No doctor ever told her that she had work restrictions due to her ear conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In conjunction with her September, 2013 diagnosis, Plaintiff never submitted any medical records or doctors notes to ALDI explaining that she had been in the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. Plaintiff testified that she did miss work in 2014 for hospital stays though she could not recall when.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66. She did not indicate that she requested FMLA leave in conjunction with her September, 2013, diagnosis or 2014 hospital visits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 10, 2014, Plaintiff reported to the Covenant Healthcare Emergency Department and was diagnosed with otitis media and infective otitis externa, unspecified. She was discharged and prescribed antibiotics and Norco for pain. Med. Recs at PGID 1385-87, ECF No. 31-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff testified regarding a computer printout of the work schedule for the week of May 22, 2015. She testified that the printout is dated June 17, 2015 and bears a handwritten note in Ms. VanNatta's handwriting indicating that Plaintiff was on vacation in Colorado that week. Edwards Dep. at 67. Ms. VanNatta also wrote a status memo \"removing\" Plaintiff's pay for that week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68. Plaintiff could not confirm that she was scheduled to work on May 22, but she testified that she was not on vacation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68. She never submitted anything to ALDI in writing regarding any of her conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72. Her understanding was that the process at ALDI for\n   requesting FMLA leave was to communicate to her direct leader.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was attending a manager's meeting in Webberville around May 26 or May 27, 2015, and had to leave in the middle of the night with ear pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137. Plaintiff called Ms. VanNatta the next day to tell her she had to leave because of her ear problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138. Plaintiff noted that Ms. VanNatta reflected on the calendar (ECF No. 31-10) that Plaintiff attended the store manager meeting and went to the hospital that week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139. When asked if she did in fact go to the hospital after leaving the meeting, as the calendar reflects, Plaintiff responded that she does not recall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139. When asked if she requested time off during her phone call with Ms. VanNatta, Plaintiff responded that she does not recall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff testified that she first contacted Ms. VanNatta regarding FMLA on June 17, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85. She spoke with her on June 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   by phone and via text messages to set up an in person meeting on June 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff testified that Ms. VanNatta informed her via text message that Ms. VanNatta would need to speak to legal advisers concerning her FMLA request prior to meeting with Plaintiff on June 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff testified that she met with Ms. VanNatta on June 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and they discussed her options for taking time off. Plaintiff testified that they agreed she could begin leave on July 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff testified that Ms. VanNatta did not request any FMLA paper work for Plaintiff, and in fact told Plaintiff that she did not need to take any other action with respect to her request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101. Plaintiff testified that she met with Ms. VanNatta again on July 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2015 and had the following discussion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I asked her, well, Skylar, who's going to be running my store while I'm gone, and she just stared at me. Skylar? What's going on? What happened? What's going on? Who's running my store? She just stared at me. I said did you put it in, am I okay for FMLA? And she said no, I didn't, but I'm going to. I'm going to put it in. I said okay. And then she promised. I shed some tears. She shed tears. We discussed several other operational factors that were going on and concerns. She promised me she would be a better leader and a better district manager that day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-08.

Ms. VanNatta denied discussing FMLA with Plaintiff on Jun 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . VanNatta Dep. at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff testified that several Doctors informed her that there was a possibility of needing surgery to correct the condition she had that led to mastoiditis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108. Antibiotics held her infections at bay, but she testified that she felt she needed to continue treatment at University of Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She did not have a continuing course of treatment for a particular diagnosis of mastoiditis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109.

She called her Director of Operations, Trisha Snider, on September 23\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   and asked for FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff continued to work and kept her condition at bay with antibiotics but does not remember scheduling any appointments \"during that time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122.

When asked during her deposition what she was requesting\n   FMLA leave for at that point, she responded: \"I didn't know at that point. I just wanted a leave to get better. I mean, I had no idea at that point.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123. She did not know when the leave would start or how long it would last.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She testified that she needed \"to go to a doctor and have them assess that,\" but she \"wasn't given that opportunity in June when [she] tried to exercise [her] rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124. She informed Ms. Snyder and Ms. VanNatta that she had an ear condition that could lead to mastoiditis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126. She does not recall ever telling Ms. VanNatta that she needed to miss work for a doctor's appointment. She testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...there were appointments I would have had to cancel anyway, which my records will reflect, and when I would go to the hospital it wasn't something that I ever knew was an emergent situation, or just comfort or needing emergent care. There was a period where Skylar was my direct leader where there was no taking a day off, there was no taking an hour off, there was no getting out of there. There was no steps, there wasn't any steps. The schedule will reflect that themselves. They're all in there. I'm the only person at ALDI that doesn't punch in, so therefore you have to take all the hours when there isn't other people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144. Plaintiff received her FMLA Notice of Eligibility and Rights and Responsibilities in the mail on October 8, 2015, the day she was terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 149. The notice was dated October 2, 2018, and indicated that she was eligible for FMLA leave. ECF No. 27-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff contends she was disciplined for absences for work \"at or near May 19 and May 22\" when she was in the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151.

She felt she was disciplined by Ms. VanNatta taking away her pay but could not recall if her pay was taken away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153. She also felt that she was disciplined by Ms. VanNatta falsely indicating on the calendar that Plaintiff was on vacation in Colorado during those days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She could not confirm if a sick day or vacation day was used for either May 19 or May 22 but she believed so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also felt as though she was punished by Ms. VanNatta writing her up in EIDF forms that she never saw until she was fired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153-54. She also alleges that Ms. VanNatta and/or Ms. Snyder went into her personnel file and falsified disciplinary documents for violations that Plaintiff did not do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   She alleges she was also falsely accused of being absent on June 17, the day she first requested FMLA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. She alleges she was wrongfully deducted pay for 15 of 17 pay periods in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 155. She further explained that she was ultimately paid in full after Brian Anderson advocated on her behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She contends that her payroll records reflect that she received partial paychecks reflecting the wrongful pay deductions, and supplemental paychecks after Mr. Anderson advocated to get her money back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff testified that, on October 1st or 2nd, Ms. VanNatta tried to force her \"to produce falsified inventory numbers to ALDI corporate\" and she refused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 171. When asked what law this violated, Plaintiff responded \"I can't tell you specific the name of the law, but I know that it would be a law of lying, fraud, some sort of white collar crime of being dishonest with numbers that are ultimately reported to the IRS from my store...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174. When asked what Ms. VanNatta instructed her do, she explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   She wanted me to enter in damaged and returned product as sellable quantities into our inventory reflecting higher profit and loss and I refused to do it, which\n   made my inventory drag on.

Complete loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-73. Plaintiff testified that she asked an employee, Jennifer Hall, to take pictures of the damaged goods and send them to her phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173. She further explained that damaged items should be retained and reported to ALDI corporate who contacts the manufacturer or supplier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176. After three months, ALDI corporate issues a disposition instructing store management on what to do with the specific damaged products, such as dispose of them or return them to the manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 8, 2015, Plaintiff was terminated for \"cash handling.\" ECF No. 31-22. Ms. Snider made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. Snyder Dep. at 29, 35, ECF No. 27-8. The Employee Incident and Discipline Form (EIDF) notes that during a routine audit Ms. VanNatta discovered that a $100 Gift Certificate was missing. ECF No. 31-22. It was discovered that Plaintiff had used it to pay a repairmen for fixing pot holes in the parking lot. The cash handling policy provides that \"the store management person may pay for any expenses up to $100 out of the management person's drawer\" and further provides that \"all expenses for store supplies must be approved by the store management person and the district manager with his or her signature.\" ECF No. 31-15. Plaintiff did not believe that gift certificates were a valid form of payment for services rendered, had never paid a vendor in gift certificates before, had never seen anyone else at ALDI do so, and only did so because her District Manager approved it. Edwards Dep. at 212. Plaintiff testified that Ms. VanNatta approved the expense and approved the method of payment. Edwards Dep. at 170, 215\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The EIDF indicates that the expense was never discussed with or approved by District Manager VanNatta. ECF No. 31-22.

In short, Plaintiff had no continuous course of treatment with a health care professional requiring her to attend any future appointments. Her Doctors had never opined that she could not work or that she had any work restrictions. She herself did not believe that she could not work or had any work restrictions. When Plaintiff requested leave, she had not scheduled any health care appointments. Plaintiff wanted to take time off in\n   order to develop some sort of action or treatment plan to help manage her condition, but had taken no steps toward doing so when she requested leave. Even under the approach adopted by the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court, Plaintiff did not engage in protected activity when she requested time off to formulate an action plan for her ear condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Furthermore, even if Plaintiff had engaged in protected activity, her retaliation claim still fails because she cannot establish causation. Although the temporal proximity between her leave request and the adverse action that occurred 10 days later is sufficient to establish a prima facie case, she must also address the Defendant's rationale for the termination.\n   <em>\n    Bryson v.

It was discovered that Plaintiff had used it to pay a repairman for fixing pot holes in the parking lot. The cash handling policy provides that \"the store management person may pay for any expenses up to $100 out of the management person's drawer\" and further provides that \"all expenses for store supplies must be approved by the store management person and the district manager with his or her signature.\" ECF No. 31-15. Plaintiff did not believe that gift certificates were a valid form of payment for services rendered, had never paid a vendor in gift certificates before, had never seen anyone else at ALDI do so, and only did so because her District Manager approved it.

Edwards Dep. at 170, 215\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Employee Incident and Discipline Form (EIDF), however, indicates that the transaction was never discussed with or approved by District Manager VanNatta.

Plaintiff does not dispute that she paid for pothole repairs with gift certificates. Rather, she contends that this was insufficient to warrant termination because there is a factual question as to whether\n   she was authorized to complete the transaction. Plaintiff notes that the cash handling policy provides that \"the store management person may pay for any expenses up to $100 out of the management person's drawer\" and further provides that \"all expenses for store supplies must be approved by the store management person and the district manager with his or her signature.\" ECF No. 31-15. The policy does not, however, permit management to pay in gift certificates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff's contention that the transaction was authorized by the policy is belied by her own testimony that 1) she did not believe that gift certificates were a valid form of payment for services rendered, 2) she had never paid a vendor in gift certificates before, 3) she had never seen anyone else at ALDI do so, and 4) she would not have done so absent approval from her District Manager. Edwards Dep. at 212. Thus, based on Plaintiff's own testimony, the sole fact that excused her conduct was the fact that Ms. VanNatta authorized the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiff argues that there is a question of fact as to whether Ms. VanNatta authorized the transaction, and further contends that \"if a factfinder believed Plaintiff's testimony on this point, Defendant would then have terminated Plaintiff for actions that had been approved by Defendant.\" Resp. at 17. Indeed, the facts on this point are disputed, as Ms. VanNatta denies approving the expense. VanNatta Dep. at 61. However, this is not a\n   <em>\n    material dispute\n   </em>\n   , because its resolution would not change the outcome. Ms. VanNatta did not make the termination decision. Rather, Ms. Snider did. Snider Dep. at 29, 35, ECF No. 27-8. Had Plaintiff informed Ms. Snider that Ms. VanNatta authorized the transaction, Ms. Snider would have had no legitimate basis to terminate Plaintiff. However, Ms. Snider testified that she had no knowledge of the transaction being authorized by Ms. VanNatta. Snider Dep. at 34. Plaintiff offers no evidence, testimonial or otherwise, that she informed Ms. Snider that the transaction was authorized by Ms. VanNatta. Under the honest belief rule, the employer is entitled to reasonably rely on a particularized set of facts that were before it when the adverse decision was made.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Plaintiff cannot establish a question of material fact as to pretext by advancing a post hoc rationalization for her conduct. Her rationalization must have been shared with the decision maker in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiff identifies miscellaneous other actions by Ms. VanNatta that allegedly demonstrate pretext. Plaintiff contends that Ms. VanNatta went to great lengths to \"build a file\" against Plaintiff to justify the adverse action. Resp. at 18. Plaintiff asserts that Ms. VanNatta incorrectly indicated on the calendar that she was out on vacation during the week of May 22. Plaintiff does not explain how this constitutes \"building a file\" against Plaintiff to justify adverse action, nor does Plaintiff provide evidence that her time off during the week of May 22 was a motivating factor in the termination decision. Plaintiff also claims that Ms. VanNatta \"solicit[ed] subordinate employees to share complaints about Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057027\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/394/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, Plaintiff does not furnish any evidence that Ms. VanNatta sought complaints for the purpose of building a file against Plaintiff, nor does Plaintiff explain why it is inappropriate for a\n   district manager to obtain feedback from store employees' regarding their manager.

Notably, the July 7, 2015 incident form was signed on July 13. ECF No. 31-12. Thus, there was no evidence that it was prepared after her termination on October 8. Plaintiff notes that the form was edited and a new copy was signed on October 20. ECF No. 31-21. Plaintiff does not, however, explain the significance of those edits or how they demonstrate an intent to build a false file against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Notably, the September 29 and October 8 incident reports were signed on October 20, and 21. ECF Nos. 20, 22. Plaintiff contends that Ms. VanNatta \"made it appear that Plaintiff's transfer\" was a result of the June 17, 2015 employee complaints. Resp. at 12. Specifically, the form provides that \"In July of 2015, Jennifer Edwards was moved from store 53 to store 56 after the staff reached out to the district manager with concerns pertaining to Jennifer.\" ECF No. 31-20. Plaintiff does not, however, dispute the accuracy of that statement or the accuracy of the employee complaints themselves. Plaintiff does not dispute the specific factual information contained in the employee incident reports or explain how these reports demonstrate an intent to create a false file against her. The mere fact that the September 29 and October 8 incident reports were not signed until October 20 and 21 is not sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find that the termination decision was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff contends that Ms. VanNatta \"scoured security footage to try to find Plaintiff engaging in misbehavior,\" and used that security footage to \"spy on Plaintiff and help build a file\" against her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Plaintiff does not explain how a district manager's act of reviewing video footage from one of her stores constitutes spying, nor does she explain how it is probative of retaliatory intent. Most importantly, Plaintiff does not dispute the accuracy of any conclusions Ms. VanNatta reached based on her review of the security footage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because Plaintiff did not engage in protected conduct under either test outline above, and because Plaintiff has furnished no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find that Defendant's legitimate, non-retaliatory reason was pretextual, Defendant will be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Michigan courts have held that some grounds for discharging an employee are so contrary to public policy as to be actionable.\n   <em>\n    Suchodolski v.

Her explanation is, at best, hard to follow. She did not support this explanation by producing any of the evidence that she testified would establish the alleged wrongdoing. Plaintiff did not produce the inventory disposition\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   sent from ALDI Corporate, the inventory reconciliation submitted to ALDI corporate, the pictures Plaintiff took of the damaged goods, the pictures Jennifer Hall took of the damaged goods, any testimony from Jennifer Hall, the duplicate receipt on which Plaintiff wrote her message, the video footage of Plaintiff explaining the illegal activity to the camera, or the \"store-specific profit and loss\" disclosed to the government that Plaintiff refused to sign. This evidence might have painted a clearer picture of what Plaintiff is alleging. Plaintiff indicated during her deposition that much of this evidence has been requested. However, Plaintiff never moved to compel the production of this evidence or otherwise apprised the Court of any difficulty obtaining it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In her response brief, Plaintiff argues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   The Michigan penal code has several provisions prohibiting fraud, including a prohibition on fraudulent disposition of personal property. MCL 750.279 prohibits individuals who have been put in charge of goods or other personal property from fraudulently using those goods or property for purposes other than those intended. Ms. VanNatta fraudulently labeling damaged goods as sellable and as having value. Ms. VanNatta instructed Plaintiff to participate in the fraud. Plaintiff refused to do so. Plaintiff submits that by refusing to participate in the fraud, a genuine issue of material fact exists whether Plaintiff failed and/or refused to violate the law and, therefore, engaged in protected activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Resp. at 20-21. With nothing but Plaintiff's testimony to rely on, there is simply no reasonable inference that can be drawn that Ms. VanNatta violated MCL 750.279 or asked Plaintiff to do so. MCL 750.279 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Fraudulent disposition of personal property-Whenever money, or any goods, wares or merchandise or other personal property, shall be delivered, committed or entrusted to, or put in charge of any person as agent with written instructions, or upon any written agreement signed by the party so instructed as agent, or such written instructions shall be delivered or such written agreement shall be made, at any time after delivery to such agent, of any money or goods, wares, merchandise, or other personal property, which instructions or agreements shall express the appropriation, purpose, or use to which such money shall be applied, or the terms, mode or manner of the application or employment of such money, or which shall express or direct the disposition or use to be made by such agent, of any goods, wares, merchandise or other personal property, so delivered or entrusted to such agent; if the person to whom any such money or goods, wares, merchandise or other personal property shall be so delivered, committed or entrusted, shall purposely and intentionally apply, appropriate, dispose of, or use any such money or goods, wares, merchandise or other personal property in any other way or manner, or for any other purpose, use or intent, than such as shall be expressed in such written instrument or\n   agreement touching the same, the person or persons so doing, shall be guilty of felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Labelling damaged store inventory as sellable would not violate MCL 750.279, as it would not involve applying, appropriating, disposing, or using the personal property of another. Plaintiff offers no legal citation or explanation as to how the alleged conduct would violate MCL 750.279. Indeed, there are very few published cases involving violations of MCL 750.279. In each of those cases the conduct at issue involved misappropriation of money entrusted to an agent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People v.
