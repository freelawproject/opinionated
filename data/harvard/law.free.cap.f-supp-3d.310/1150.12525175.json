Simon, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We are a nation under law, and the rule of law is one of our most cherished values. The right to counsel, which allows a person to receive timely legal advice, is firmly entrenched in the concept of due process and protected by the Fifth Amendment against governmental interference. Further, this right is available to everyone in the United States, not just citizens or others who are here lawfully. In this case, Plaintiffs assert that the government is interfering with the rights of persons being civilly detained under our complex immigration laws from receiving the benefits of the right to counsel. No request is being made to provide legal counsel at taxpayer expense. The only relief sought is to enjoin the government from continuing to interfere with a civil immigrant detainee's right to counsel when there are volunteer attorneys, expert in immigration matters, ready, willing, and able to provide legal assistance without charge. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Innovation Law Law (\"Law Lab\") and Luis Javier Sanchez Gonzalez, by Xochitl Ramos Valencia as next friend (\"Sanchez Gonzalez\") bring this action challenging the policies and practices related to immigrant detainees held at the Federal Detention Center in Sheridan, Oregon (\"FDC Sheridan\"). Defendants are officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\"), and the U.S. Department of Justice. Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") requiring Defendants to, among other things: (1) provide adequate attorney visitation and telephone access for immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan; (2) permit Law Lab to conduct \"know your rights\" (\"KYR\") training for detainees; and (3) bar Defendants from proceeding with detainees' interviews, cases, or deportations until after the detainees have had a full and fair an opportunity meaningfully to consult with an attorney and attend KYR training\n   conducted by Law Lab. On June 25, 2018, the Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs' motion. Plaintiffs' motion for TRO is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In deciding whether to grant a motion for TRO, courts look to substantially the same factors that apply to a court's decision on whether to issue a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stuhlbarg Int'l Sales Co. v.

Under this test, \" 'serious questions going to the merits' and a hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other two elements of the\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   test are also met.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088053\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1127/#p1131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088053\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1127/#p1131\">\n    at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On May 31, 2018, ICE transferred 124 immigrant men to FDC Sheridan for civil detention. ECF 14-1 (Newman Decl.) \u00b6 4. Approximately 121 immigrant detainees remain at that location.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870916\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/873/#p878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The detainees are housed in two units, at least one of which also houses inmates of the federal prison\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. According to Defendants, both social and legal visits currently take place each Monday through Friday from 8:30 until 11:30 a.m. for inmates and from 12:00 until 3:00 p.m. for immigrant detainees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Defendants add that by June 27, 2018, they intend to provide legal visitation for all pretrial/pre-sentence and civil detainees from 8:30 a.m. until 3:00 p.m, Monday through Friday, on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Many of the detainees have come to the United States to request asylum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 3 (Manning Decl.) \u00b6 26; ECF 6 (Garcia Decl.) \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2. Plaintiff Law Lab is a nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of noncitizens in the United States. Law Lab seeks to provide KYR training sessions, which cover the immigration system and detainees' rights, to civil detainees at FDC Sheridan. Law Lab also seeks to provide legal representation without charge (pro bono) to every unrepresented civil detainee at FDC Sheridan who requests legal representation. Law Lab provides representation to noncitizens, in part, through its Oregon-based network of 125 private, pro bono attorneys who have been trained in asylum and removal defense. ECF 3 (Manning Decl.) \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3. Stephen W. Manning (\"Manning\") is the Executive Director of Law Lab. Law Lab, through Manning, designed a pro bono representation project to facilitate access to, and legal representation of, the FDC Sheridan immigrant detainees. Law Lab's pro bono representation project seeks to provide a minimum of three attorney contacts with each detainee who requests legal representation, consisting of: (1) a KYR group orientation that provides an overview of immigration relief; (2) an individualized screening with a trained advocate;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   and (3) an individualized client conference. Law Lab determined that at least three know-your-rights orientations of 60 to 90 minutes duration is needed adequately to orient all interested FDC Sheridan immigrant detainees on their rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   4. On June 8, 2018, Manning established a hotline with a local telephone number to allow anyone detained as a civil immigrant detainee to call Law Lab for free legal assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The hotline number was provided to the immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan by members of the Mexican Consulate who visited Mexican nationals at FDC Sheridan on June 14, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Despite having been provided the toll-free number, detainees have not been able to place free legal phone calls because free phone calls are not allowed by FDC Sheridan's telephone system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   5. Also on June 8, 2018, Manning asked Philip Smith (\"Smith\"), a local immigration attorney, to provide pro bono legal representation for a detainee whose partner had asked Law Lab to represent the detainee. On Saturday, June 9, 2018, Smith called FDC Sheridan to arrange a meeting with his client, the detainee. Smith was told that attorney visits are normally permitted seven days a week and could be arranged through a counselor. Smith was further told that a counselor would be on duty on Sunday, June 10, 2018. Smith also left a telephone message with the person in charge of the unit where immigrant detainees were being held, in which he identified himself and provided his phone number and his client's identifying information. ECF 8 (Smith Decl.) \u00b6 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   6. On Sunday, June 10, 2018, Smith traveled one and one-half hours to FDC Sheridan. Upon arrival at the visitation center, Smith identified himself as an immigration attorney and provided his client's identification information. FDC Sheridan security officers denied Smith entry, telling him that visits needed to be scheduled in advance and were permitted only Monday through Friday. The supervising security officer also said that an appointment for one of the three attorney visitation rooms was required, and that such appointments were available only Monday through Friday. Smith asked if he could meet with his client in the public visitation area and was told that he could not. Smith left without meeting his client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   7. On June 14, 2018, Law Lab received referrals from Lisa Hay, the Federal Public Defender for the District of Oregon, for 13 FDC Sheridan immigrant detainees who had requested an immigration attorney. ECF 3 \u00b6 15-16. An attorney who visited FDC Sheridan as part of the visit of the Mexican Consulate also reported that each detainee with whom he had met had requested asylum relief and legal representation. ECF 6 (Garcia Decl.) \u00b6 5, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   8. Law Lab attorneys have continued to be denied access to civil immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan. Permission that had been granted for a legal visit on Friday, June 15, 2018, was revoked on the morning of June 15 after Law Lab's legal team had already departed for FDC Sheridan. The legal team was told that the visit could occur only at some point later that evening, and that weekend access was also denied. ECF 3 \u00b6 19-20 (Manning Decl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   9. While attempting to make arrangements for a legal visit on the next available non-weekend day, Monday, June 18, 2018, Manning was told that attorney visitation would be limited to a single room for three hours per day, Monday through Friday, that no immigration library materials were available, and that the free direct call platform was not, and had not been, operational.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   10. On Monday, June 18, 2018, Law Lab attorneys again had their permission to visit nine detainees revoked by FDC Sheridan at the last minute, despite earlier assurances that they could visit on that day. The attorneys were told by an ICE official that legal visitations would only occur on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   11. On Wednesday, June 20, 2018, attorney Chelsea Strautman visited FDC Sheridan to meet with immigrant detainees. ECF 9 (Strautman Decl.) \u00b6 5. She identified herself as an attorney who was there to offer legal representation to immigrant detainees who requested access to counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. ICE denied her access.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5-6. On Thursday, June 21, 2018, Strautman and two other attorneys visited FDC Sheridan seeking to provide pro bono legal representation to immigrant detainees who had requested access to counsel through Law Lab's pro bono program. These attorneys identified themselves as attorneys but were denied access. ECF 9 (Strautman Decl.) \u00b6 7-8; ECF 7 (Philbaum Decl.) \u00b6 5; ECF 5 (Baxter-Neal Decl.) \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   12. Shortly after 5:00 p.m. on June 21, 2018, two Law Lab lawyers returned to FDC Sheridan to present KYR training. A Law Lab attorney had confirmed the day before, with Defendant Elizabeth Godfrey, the Acting Field Office Director in the Seattle Field Office of ICE, that Law Lab's pro bono team was authorized to provide KYR training at FDC Sheridan from 4:45 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. ECF 4 (Sinlapasai Decl.) \u00b6 12. BOP officers at FDC Sheridan, however, turned away the attorneys and would not let them conduct their KYR training. ECF 7 (Philbaum Decl.) \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   13. At least 50 detainees have requested legal representation from Law Lab's pro bono project. ECF 3 (Manning Decl.) \u00b6 25-27. Only one attorney associated with the project, however, has been able to meet with his client, and that client has since been transferred by ICE from FDC Sheridan to the North West Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, outside of the District of Oregon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   14. Plaintiff Sanchez Gonzalez is currently detained at FDC Sheridan. He is unable to file a complaint on his own due to lack of access to legal counsel. His domestic partner of ten years, Xochitl Ramos Valencia, has requested pro bono legal representation from Law Lab on his behalf. Law Lab attorneys have twice attempted to meet with Sanchez Gonzalez, including on June 21, 2018, but were denied access both times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   15. \"Credible fear\" interviews for immigrant detainees seeking asylum are scheduled to begin at FDC Sheridan on June 28, 2018. ECF 14-2 (Heaton Decl.) \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   16. Removal proceedings for the 121 immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan have not yet commenced. Further, none of these immigrant detainees have been served with an administrative summons known as a \"Notice to Appear,\" which is how a removal proceeding typically begins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   17. On June 8, 2018, Chief Judge Michael W. Mosman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon authorized the Federal Public Defender of Oregon to consult with the immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan regarding the legality of their detention. ECF 18 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants argue that the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), as amended, removes subject matter jurisdiction from federal district courts and, thus, this Court has no jurisdiction over this action.

Law Lab's stated mission is to advocate on behalf of and provide legal representation to noncitizens in the United States. In furtherance of this mission, they have undertaken considerable effort to provide pro bono legal representation to the FDC Sheridan immigrant detainees. The alleged policies, procedures, and actions at FDC Sheridan, however, have prevented Law Lab from fulfilling its mission of advocating on behalf of noncitizens, and render futile its efforts to coordinate pro bono legal representation. The challenged policies and procedures also have resulted in the diversion of Law Lab resources, as attorneys have repeatedly traveled to FDC Sheridan only to be turned away, and have established a toll-free hotline for detainees that detainees have not been able to access or use. Such facts sufficiently establish that Law Lab has suffered injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs also have demonstrated that Law Lab has a sufficiently close relationship with the detainees to advocate on their behalf. Plaintiffs have submitted affidavits indicating that at least 50 detainees at FDC Sheridan have requested representation from Law Lab. The Federal Public Defender (\"FPD\"), as\n   <em>\n    amica curiae\n   </em>\n   , also states that at least 64 detainees have communicated their requests for immigration representation, which the FPD cannot provide, to FPD staff attorneys. ECF 18. These numerous\n   requests from immigrant civil detainees and FDC Sheridan sufficiently demonstrate that Law Lab has a close relation to the detainees, even if Defendants' policies, practices, and actions have prevented Law Lab attorneys from formalizing their legal relationship with many of those detainees. Finally, and perhaps most obviously, the circumstances of the detainees' confinement-specifically, the lack of access to immigration lawyers that forms the foundation of this case-poses a significant hindrance to the detainees' ability to advocate on their own behalf, as do the foreign language barriers faced by many of the civil detainees. Plaintiffs, thus, have established that they have standing in this case sufficient to request the relief they are seeking on a temporary or preliminary basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The harms likely to arise from the denial of access to legal representation in the context of asylum applications are particularly concrete and irreparable. The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized the complexity of immigration laws and procedures and the difficulty of navigating immigration proceedings without a lawyer.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baltazar-Alcazar v.

The denial of access to legal assistance is likely to lead to the denial of asylum and ultimately to the deportation of detainees with meritorious asylum claims. Early representation is particularly important in asylum claims, given the complexity of treaty-based human rights statutes and the serious harm-including persecution, torture, and death-that may result if asylum is improperly denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Plaintiffs request only that BOP and ICE actually provide the same degree of access to legal assistance that their own regulations purport to guarantee. Defendants, thus, cannot show that the requested TRO will pose an undue burden on their time, resources, or personnel. Moreover, any such burden on Defendants is more than justified by the need to ensure the fulfillment of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights and to prevent the improper denial of meritorious asylum applications. Finally, it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Voluntary Cessation Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants also argue that the relief that Plaintiffs seek is moot because Defendants either have already addressed Plaintiffs' concerns or are taking steps to do so. The Supreme Court, however, has explained the voluntary cessation doctrine as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   It is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice. Such abandonment is an important factor bearing on the question whether a court should exercise its power to enjoin the defendant from renewing the practice, but that is a matter relating to the exercise rather than the existence of judicial power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    City of Mesquite v.

As the Supreme Court further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"The test for mootness in cases such as this is a stringent one. Mere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case; if it did, the courts would be compelled to leave '[t]he defendant ... free to return to his old ways.' A case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur....

Defendants imply that they likely will permit KYR presentations to begin on June 26, 2018. These presentations will take place outside of normal visitation hours to ensure maximum attendance. Defendants also state that they have arranged for two dedicated telephone lines that the immigrant detainees may use to make free legal, consulate, or crisis calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"Credible fear\" interviews for asylum applications, however, are scheduled to begin on June 28, 2018. As recently as June 22, 2018, none of Law Lab's attorneys had yet met with any immigrant detainee who are still located at FDC Sheridan. Defendants' plan for improved attorney access thus provides for exactly six and one-half hours of attorney visitation before some detainees will begin their \"credible fear\" interviews. This is insufficient time to provide attorney access that satisfies the requirements of due process. Thus, a TRO is necessary, despite Defendant's stated efforts to improve their policies and practices, in order to ensure that detainees will not begin their asylum proceedings with constitutionally inadequate access to their attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In addition, the Ninth Circuit has held that \"an executive action that is not governed by any clear or codified procedures cannot moot a claim\" and falls within the voluntary cessation exception.\n   <em>\n    McCormack v.
