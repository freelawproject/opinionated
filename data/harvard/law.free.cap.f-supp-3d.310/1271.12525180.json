The Court held a hearing on September 26, 2016. The primary issues are: (i) whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists regarding Plaintiff Rudy Quiroz' claims for racial discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2, and under the New Mexico Human Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-1-7\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-1-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) (\"NMHRA\"), against Defendant ConocoPhillips Company; and (ii) whether Quiroz performed an act that public policy authorizes or encourages relating to his claim for wrongful termination-retaliatory discharge. The Court concludes that: (i) a genuine dispute of material fact exists regarding Quiroz' racial discrimination claims; and (ii) Quiroz did not perform an act that public policy authorizes or encourages, and, therefore, Quiroz' wrongful termination-retaliatory discharge claim fails. Accordingly, the Court grants the MSJ in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court draws the factual background from the parties' assertions of undisputed material fact in their summary judgment motion papers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ \u00b6\u00b6 1-75, at 2-15; Response of Plaintiff Rudy Quiroz to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \u00b6\u00b6 1-75, at 1-19, filed December 8, 2015 (Doc. 41)(\"Response\"); Defendant's Reply in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment at 1-13, filed December 31, 2015 (Doc. 46)(\"Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Quiroz' Employment with ConocoPhillips\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Quiroz began working for ConocoPhillips in 1986.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ \u00b6 1, at 2 (asserting this fact)(citing Oral Deposition of Rudy Quiroz at 45:10-13 (taken October 12, 2015)(\"Quiroz Depo.\") ); Response \u00b6 1, at 1 (admitting this fact).

Specifically, ConocoPhillips contends that Quiroz cannot establish a prima facie racial discrimination case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 17, because he violated ConocoPhillips' Code of Conduct by failing to properly report the five HSE incidents and instructed his subordinates not to follow proper reporting procedures,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 18. According to ConocoPhillips, \"Quiroz and three other supervisors/employees of different races were terminated for their roles in failing to properly report the five HSE-related incidents.... [A]ccordingly, Quiroz cannot establish ... that he was performing up to ConocoPhillips' expectations and therefore his discrimination claims fail as a matter of law.\" MSJ at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   ConocoPhillips next avers that \"Quiroz cannot establish that others outside his protected classes were treated more favorably than he was.\" MSJ at 19. Specifically, ConocoPhillips argues that its treatments of Maxey, Deen, and Price are not proper comparisons to Quiroz' treatment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 19, because \"Quiroz acknowledged that he has no evidence that Price, Deen, or Maxey were actually implicated during the investigation.\" MSJ at 19-20.

Specifically, ConocoPhillips contends that Quiroz' report to Patterson \"is not related to any conduct that is proscribed by Title VII or the NMHRA and does not constitute a protected activity.\" MSJ at 22. ConocoPhillips continues that Quiroz has no evidence that his report to Patterson was the \"but for\" cause of his termination. MSJ at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   ConocoPhillips next avers that it had legitimate non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory reasons for terminating Quiroz,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 23, and that Quiroz \"has no evidence that Patterson or anyone involved in the decision to terminate him were not acting in good faith or that Patterson did not honestly believe that Quiroz had engaged in the conduct for which he was terminated.\" MSJ at 24. According to ConocoPhillips, \"ConocoPhillips terminated Quiroz' employment because of numerous, egregious violations of its policies,\" which are legitimate non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory reasons for Quiroz' termination. MSJ at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, ConocoPhillips contends that Quiroz' wrongful termination claim also fails as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 25. ConocoPhillips alleges that \"Quiroz cannot demonstrate that he was terminated because he performed any act that New Mexico public policy has authorized or encouraged but rather he engaged in acts that demonstrate the opposite.\" MSJ at 26-27.

ConocoPhillips continues that Quiroz cannot establish \"that others outside of his protected class were treated more favorably than he was.\" Reply at 5. According to ConocoPhillips, it is unfair to compare its treatments of Maxey, Deen, Coy, and Price, none of whom were terminated, to its treatment of Quiroz, because \"the investigation did not reveal that they violated work rules of comparable seriousness and Quiroz does not provide any citations to the record establishing that they engaged in the same conduct as he did.\" Reply at 5.

ConocoPhillips argues that, \"although Quiroz alleges a Title VII retaliation claim in his Complaint, he completely abandons this claim in his Response.\" Reply at 11.

The Court responded that \"doesn't the mere fact that you've got five individuals basically all doing the same [thing] and you mete out different punishments\" suggest an inference of race discrimination, even if ConocoPhillips can later show legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. Tr. at 9:12-14 (Court). ConocoPhillips replied that Quiroz had not made such an argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:18-19 (Oller), but, rather, Quiroz had \"chosen to try an[d] compare himself to people who weren't implicated in the report, and say ... why weren't these people implicated.\" Tr. at 13:10-13 (Oller).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   ConocoPhillips continued that, in any event, it had established legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Quiroz, because Patterson testified that he terminated Quiroz for failing \"to report incidents that he knew had not been properly reported, covered up incidents when he shouldn't have, ordered evidence destroyed, and told other subordinate employees not to report evidence.\" Tr. at 15:18-21 (Oller). ConocoPhillips added that Patterson terminated Quiroz, but not Price, because Price received direction from both Quiroz and Brooks to cover up the HSE incidents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:17-21 (Oller).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Quiroz then took the podium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:3 (Newell). Quiroz began by conceding both his retaliation claim and his national origin discrimination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:5-14 (Newell, Court). Quiroz then argued that Coy and Deen were both similarly situated to Quiroz, but neither was terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:6-25 (Newell);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:1-3 (Newell). Quiroz argued that \"those who didn't receive discipline show or at least provide enough information for us to meet our prima facie burden at the summary judgment stage that there were other reasons, discriminatory reasons, for the punishment that was imposed on Quiroz.\" Tr. at 36:7-12 (Newell).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court asked Quiroz \"if I were to agree with [ConocoPhillips] on the Title VII [race] claim I'm assuming that you would want me to remand all the state-claim issues back to state court,\" Tr. at\n   47:24-25 (Court);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:1-3 (Court), to which Quiroz replied \"yes,\" Tr. at 48:4 (Newell).

Quiroz continued that, if he \"is going to be held accountable for having knowledge of incidents that were not reported, then certainly Mr. Price should, Mr. Deen should, and certainly someone should have looked into what Mr. Maxey knew.\" Tr. at 49:15-20 (Newell).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   ConocoPhillips then responded to some of Quiroz' arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 50:20-23 (Oller). ConocoPhillips contended that Patterson \"felt in his opinion that he would hold managers to a higher stand[ard], that's how he personally handled these issues.\" Tr. at 50:21-23 (Oller). ConocoPhillips continued that, regarding pretext, \"Quiroz has to come forward with evidence that the reasons given for his termination were false, that they were not accurate reasons.... [T]he falsity is not there.\" Tr. at 52:11-15 (Oller). \"Patterson reasonably believed, based on the other witnesses' testimony, that Mr. Quiroz ordered employees to falsify and destroy evidence.\" Tr. at 55:6-9 (Oller).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   ConocoPhillips then emphasized that \"all of the employees who [it] identified as culpable were fired, except for Mr. Price, who was the lowest level employee on the list.\" Tr. at 56:4-6 (Oller). ConocoPhillips continued that Patterson chose not to terminate Price, because both Quiroz and Brooks ordered Price to violate ConocoPhillips' policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 56:6-11 (Oller). ConocoPhillips concluded that \"[t]he evidence in the record just does not support that this investigation was biased towards ... Hispanic employees.\" Tr. at 57:23-25 (Oller).

The Investigation Report further states: \"In every case, the actions of the employees were believed to have been done based on directives given to them by their respective supervisors, cascading upward through the chain of command to the supervisory position held by Tommy Brooks.\" Response \u00b6 48, at 13 (quoting Investigation Report at 9). Stating that an employee knew or should have known something, however, is different from stating that an employee acted with malice. Further, that some employees did not report a problem, because their supervisor told them not to does not controvert the assertion that those employees knew or should have known that their inaction violated company policy. The Court will therefore deem MSJ \u00b6 48, at 11 undisputed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.N.M.L.R.-Civ. 56.1(b)(\"All material facts set forth in the [Motion for Summary Judgment] will be deemed undisputed unless specifically controverted.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
