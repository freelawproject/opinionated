To facilitate the expeditious completion of its project, Columbia seeks partial summary judgment regarding its right to condemn the easements, and a preliminary injunction allowing it to access and possess the property prior to paying just compensation. After carefully considering the record, and the evidence adduced at a hearing on February 16, 2018, for the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Columbia's Motion for an Order of Condemnation and for Preliminary Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     I.

Such companies may build and operate new pipelines only after obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity (\"Certificate\") from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\" or \"the Commission\"). As the Fourth Circuit has summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The procedure for obtaining a certificate from FERC is set forth in the NGA, and its implementing regulations. The process begins with an application from the gas company that includes, among other information, (1) a description of the proposed pipeline project, (2) a statement of the facts showing why the project is required, and (3) the estimated beginning and completion date for the project. Notice of the application is filed in the Federal Register, public comment and protest is allowed, and FERC conducts a public hearing on the application. As part of its evaluation, FERC must also investigate the environmental consequences of the proposed project and issue an environmental impact statement. At the end of the process FERC issues a certificate if it finds that the proposed project \"is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.\" In its order issuing a certificate, FERC specifies a date for the completion of construction and the start of service. The certificate may include any\n   terms and conditions that FERC deems \"required by the public convenience and necessity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    E. Tenn. Nat.

The authority by which natural-gas companies may exercise the right is set forth fully in the Act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   When any holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity cannot acquire by contract, or is unable to agree with the owner of property to the compensation to be paid for, the necessary right-of-way to construct, operate, and maintain a pipe line or pipe lines for the transportation of natural gas, and the necessary land or other property, in addition to right-of-way, for the location of compressor stations, pressure apparatus, or other stations or equipment necessary to the proper operation of such pipe line or pipe lines, it may acquire the same by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the district court of the United States for the district in which such property may be located, or in the State courts. The practice and procedure in any action or proceeding for that purpose in the district court of the United States shall conform as nearly as may be with the practice and procedure in similar action or proceeding in the courts of the State where the property is situated:\n   <em>\n    Provided\n   </em>\n   , That the United States district courts shall only have jurisdiction of cases when the amount claimed by the owner of the property to be condemned exceeds $3,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h). Notably, the \"state procedure requirement has been superseded\" by the implementation of Fed. R. Civ.

The natural-gas company must only establish that \"(a) It is a holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity; (b) It needs to acquire an easement, right-of-way, land or other property necessary to the operation of its pipeline system; and (c) It has been unable to acquire the necessary property interest from the owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Rover Pipeline LLC v.

On January 12, 2018, Columbia sought to exercise that authority over certain property located in the Northern District of West Virginia, which it was unable to acquire by agreement, by filing a complaint pursuant to the NGA and Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1 (Dkt. No. 1). As required by Rule 71.1(c)(2), Columbia included descriptions of the property, as well as the interests to be taken (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 44-68; 1-2). On January 16, 2018, Columbia moved for partial summary judgment on its right to condemn the subject property, as well as a preliminary injunction allowing it to immediately possess the property (Dkt. No. 6). Columbia also moved to expedite a hearing on its motion, given that it must clear vegetation and trees from the subject easements by March 31, 2018 (Dkt.

As discussed, to establish that it has the right to condemn, Columbia must demonstrate only that 1) it holds a FERC Certificate, 2) it needs to acquire the easements, and 3) it has been unable to acquire them by agreement. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h). Columbia has satisfied each of these elements, and is entitled to partial summary judgment regarding its right to condemn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, the parties cannot dispute that FERC issued a Certificate to Columbia on December 29, 2017 (Dkt. No. 1-2). Second, Columbia has established that the easements are \"necessary and consistent with the easement rights that FERC authorized [Columbia] to obtain.\"\n   <em>\n    Rover Pipeline LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17cv18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205589163\">\n    2017 WL 5589163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. The uncontested evidence in this case demonstrates that the easements sought \"are portions of the route approved by the FERC Certificate as necessary for the construction, maintenance, operation, alteration, testing, replacement, and repair of the Project,\" and that \"Columbia cannot construct the Project in accordance with the FERC Certificate without acquiring the [e]asements\" (Dkt. No. 7 at 4). Indeed, Tally testified that the easements sought in this case are the same easements identified in alignment sheets Columbia submitted to FERC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, to the extent it was able to contact the record owners, Columbia has made offers to purchase the interests at issue this case. Those owners either declined Columbia's offers or failed to respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. \"[T]he amounts claimed by the [owners] relative to the outstanding [e]asements exceed $3,000.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The Court thus concludes that Columbia has been unable to acquire the easements by\n   contract or agreement. Therefore, because Columbia has satisfied the three requirements of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h), the Court confirms Columbia's right to condemn the easements described in the complaint and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   its motion for an order of condemnation (Dkt.

A preliminary injunction is proper when the plaintiff can \"[1] establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[A]ll four requirements must be satisfied,\"\n   <em>\n    Real Truth About Obama, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 575 F.3d at 346, and \"[a] preliminary injunction shall be granted only if the moving party clearly establishes entitlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Di Biase v.

Tally testified that, during the course of Columbia's effort to obtain FERC approval, it entered into precedent agreements with various shippers in order to demonstrate the need for the Project. FERC issued the final environmental impact statement (\"EIS\") regarding the Project on July 28, 2017, and granted the Certificate on December 29, 2017 (Dkt.

According to Tally, if Columbia is forced to break from this method of construction, it will be forced to pay its contractors an additional $700,000 each time they are required to \"work around\" a tract. Columbia's construction schedule hinges on the fact that certain tree clearing must be complete by March 31, 2018, in order to comply with regulations of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that protect the habitat of bats and migratory birds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If Columbia does not complete the necessary tree clearing by that time, it will be unable to do so until at least October 15, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Columbia claims that delaying the entire Project until that time will result in the loss of $37.5 million per month in delayed revenue under the precedent agreements, and would deprive its customers-and consequently end users-of additional volume during the crucial winter months. The inability \"to meet its contractual commitments to its customers would irreparably harm Columbia's business reputation and goodwill,\" and may affect Columbia's negotiations with prospective shippers for future projects.

The process by which natural-gas companies obtain approval and construct under the NGA necessitates forethought and a degree of speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   According to Tally, Columbia entered shipping contracts to demonstrate to FERC that there was a market demand for its Project, and it made the business decision to secure and mobilize its contractors in advance of receiving FERC approval. Even an aggressive bidding process for such contractors typically lasts between five and six months, and the contractors must have time to plan and acquire materials prior to receiving FERC approval. Moreover, the market for major pipeline project contractors is small and comprised of specialized laborers that Columbia had to ensure were available to work on its Project. Undoubtedly, Columbia decided to\n   accept the risk that FERC would not approve its Project, but FERC did approve the Project and Columbia is appropriately prepared for construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition, other practical considerations underscore the wisdom of Columbia's decision to prepare for construction. Given the likelihood of trials on just compensation, this litigation may not be complete sufficiently in advance of the FERC deadline. Testimony at the evidentiary hearing established that, although it prefers to do so in 12 months, Columbia can construct the Project in approximately 9 months. Given that the FERC Certificate requires Columbia to complete the Project by December 2020, and assuming there are no other delays, Columbia must commence construction no later than the time the tree-clearing window closes in March 2020. Based on the evidence, the prospect that this litigation could be complete in that time, rendering equitable relief entirely unnecessary, is \"unfounded\" and \"fanciful.\"\n   <em>\n    Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC v. 252.071 Acres More or Less\n   </em>\n   , No. ELH-15-3462,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201248670\">\n    2016 WL 1248670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (D.

As an initial matter, the Court is satisfied that Columbia is capable of providing \"reasonable, certain, and adequate provision\" that the defendants will obtain compensation prior to having their occupancy disturbed.\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n    361 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   824 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cherokee Nation v.

Columbia has repeatedly expressed a willingness to deposit money with the Court and to obtain a bond pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) (Dkt. Nos. 7 at 10-11; 8 at 8).

Evidence at the evidentiary hearing established that TransCanada Corporation, Columbia's parent company, has a yearly net income of approximately $2.5 billion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p818\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Therefore, upon consideration of these facts, with the exception of Columbia Tract No. WV-TY-0008.000,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that Columbia may immediately access and possess the relevant easements after the following conditions have been satisfied:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    1)\n   </strong>\n   Effective upon entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order and satisfaction of the conditions discussed below, Columbia is granted immediate possession of the easements described in its complaint, as consistent with the FERC Certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2)\n   </strong>\n   Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 65(c), 67, and 71.1(j)(1), the right to immediate possession of the easements on these properties is contingent upon Columbia satisfying two requirements as to security. First, pursuant to the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1(j), Columbia must deposit with the Clerk of Court (\"Clerk\") a certified check in an amount of three times the appraised amount for each of the easements sought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3)\n   </strong>\n   Second, Columbia shall obtain and post a surety bond in the total amount of two times the appraised amount for the easements sought. The bond shall be conditioned on Columbia's payment of any and all final compensation damages awarded in excess of the deposited amount, and if such payments are made, then the bond shall be null and void upon full payment having been made as to all of the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    4)\n   </strong>\n   The total value is designed to serve as sufficient security to protect the interests of the landowners in the event any just compensation awarded for one or more of the easements exceeds the appraised amount for such property or properties. The multiplied value, the bond amount, or the two combined, shall not be construed as any indication of the floor or ceiling of the\n   ultimate amount of just compensation, if any, to which any interest-holder is entitled. Instead, the eventual compensation award by this Court, a jury, or a compensation commission may be lower, higher, or the same as the amount Columbia is required to provide as security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    5)\n   </strong>\n   Columbia shall remit the deposit amounts to the Clerk for deposit into the registry of this Court. The Clerk shall deposit the amounts received into the registry of this Court and then, as soon as the business of the Clerk's office allows, the Clerk shall deposit these funds into the interest-bearing Court Registry Investment System administered by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts as Custodian, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    6)\n   </strong>\n   At the time it remits any deposit or deposit(s), Columbia shall also file a chart broken down by easement that identifies: (i) each appraised property for which funds are being deposited; (ii) the corresponding Columbia parcel numbers; (iii) the corresponding paragraph numbers in the amended complaint; (iv) the amount of the deposit for that specific property (which will be three times the appraised amount); (vi) the amount of the bond that relates to that specific property (which will be two times the appraised amount); and (vii) all persons or entities who own an interest in the property and the percentage of each person's interest. The information shall also be emailed to the Court in an Excel spreadsheet format. If any party disputes the accuracy of any information in the chart, he shall file an objection not later than seven (7) days after service of the chart. Additionally, all parties-including Columbia and any defendants who have an interest in any of the deposited funds-have a continuing duty, until the conclusion of all proceedings, to advise the Court if the information in any filed chart changes. This includes, in particular, a duty to advise the Court if there is any change for any parcel in the number of owners or the percentages of their ownership interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    7)\n   </strong>\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1(j)(2), the deposit of any funds for an identified defendant's property shall constitute Collumbia's agreement that the interest-holder can access up to the base amount of the appraisal or one-third of the deposited amount, whichever is greater. Such withdrawal is at the landowner's peril, and all defendants are advised that, if the ultimate compensation award is less than the amount withdrawn, the interest-holder will be liable for the return of the excess with appropriate interest. If multiple defendants claim an interest in any of the easements, each defendant claiming an interest can withdraw only its proportionate share of the funds identified for that easement and attributable to its claimed interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    8)\n   </strong>\n   Each of the defendants shall be entitled to draw from one-third of the funds deposited by Columbia with the Clerk its ownership share of the amount of estimated just compensation deposited by Columbia for the easement which burdens lands in which such defendant owns or claims an interest, subject to the warnings above, and provided that each such defendant satisfies all conditions of this Memorandum Opinion and Order and any other direction of the Court. Furthermore, such defendants shall be entitled to interest calculated pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   from and after the date of entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order on the difference\n   between the principal amount deposited with the Court by Columbia and the amount of just compensation determined by the Court, if any, if such determination of just compensation to be paid exceeds the amount deposited by Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    9)\n   </strong>\n   A defendant who wishes to draw on the deposited funds shall file a motion for disbursement of funds with the Court and shall include a certificate of service evidencing service of the motion on all other persons with a property interest in the same parcel or easement, if any. Any person objecting to the disbursement shall have fourteen (14) days to file a written objection with the court. The Court will then resolve any objections and issue an order on the withdrawal request. If there are no other persons with an interest in the property, disbursement will be permitted only by a separate order of the Court, but the period for objections will not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     VI.
