(Docket No. 34.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   DISH Network and NagraStar's motion to dismiss the defendants' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   DISH Network and NagraStar commenced this action on August 15, 2017, filing suit against Llinas, Rivera and FJ Internet Solution pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. section 1201(a)(2), the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. section 605(a) and (e)(4), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. sections 2511(1)(a) and 2520. (Docket No. 1.) DISH Network is a satellite television provider, offering access to movies, sports and general entertainment programing for a subscription fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. NagraStar provides DISH Network with smart cards and other security technologies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action stems from Llinas, Rivera, and FJ Internet Solution's purported importation and distribution of unauthorized receivers and related devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. DISH Network and NagraStar aver that these devices function only to circumvent DISH Network's security technology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By bypassing satellite signal encryption and other security measures, Llinas, Rivera and FJ Internet Solution allegedly obtained DISH Network programing without authorization. Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Llinas and Rivera answered the complaint, and set forth a counterclaim asserting a single cause of action. (Docket No. 19.) Llinas and Rivera allege that DISH Network and NagraStar abused the legal process by possessing \"an ulterior motive, lacking good faith, [and] for filing this groundless action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17. DISH Network and NagraStar moved to dismiss the abuse of process counterclaim, arguing that Llinas and Rivera's allegations are deficient pursuant to pleading standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), defendants may move to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint or counterclaim must contain sufficient factual matter \"to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). The Court must decide whether the complaint alleges sufficient facts to \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Court is \"obligated to view the facts of the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, and to resolve any ambiguities in their favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Ocasio-Hern\u00e1ndez v. Fortu\u00f1o-Burset\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203517\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1/#p17\">\n    640 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (1st Cir. 2011).

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Puerto Rico Law governs this Court's analysis of the abuse of process claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To prevail on an abuse of process\n   claim, Llinas and Rivera must establish two elements: that DISH Network and NagraStar (1) possessed a bad motive, and (2) employed the legal process for an improper, collateral objective.\n   <em>\n    Gonz\u00e1lez-Rucci v. United States INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3117007\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/66/#p71\">\n    539 F.3d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71 (1st Cir. 2008) (affirming dismissal of abuse of process claim because \"the record does not show the requisite bad motive\"). Abuse of process generally involves the misuse of discovery, subpoenas, attachment, and other procedures.\n   <em>\n    Nogueras-Cartagena v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9461177\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/172/296/#p316\">\n    172 F.Supp.2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316 (D.P.R. 2001) (Dom\u00ednguez, J.) (\"[M]alicious prosecution is used to challenge the whole of a lawsuit while abuse of process covers the allegedly improper use of legal procedures after a suit has been filed properly.\") (internal citation omitted). Ultimately, the proponent of an abuse of process action must prove ulterior motive\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   an abusive act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boschette v. Buck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7781231\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/916/91/#p97\">\n    916 F.Supp. 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (D.P.R. 1996) (\"An act of abuse cannot be inferred from evidence of motive alone.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Llinas and Rivera premise their abuse of process counterclaim on DISH Network and NagraStar's \"filing [of] an action [...] which they knew was meritless.\" (Docket No. 19 at p. 17.) Filing of the complaint is the only allegation tethering DISH Network and NagraStar to the abuse of process cause of action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7781231\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/916/91/#p97\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Llinas and Rivera claim that DISH Network and NagraStar lacked good faith, and \"acted willfully and intentionally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 15-18. The remaining allegations are conclusory and detail the alleged damages arising from the counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The allegations in the counterclaim fail to state a claim for abuse of process. In\n   <em>\n    Simon v. Navon\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit Court of Appeals held that the \"[f]iling of a lawsuit is a regular use of process, and therefore, may not on its own fulfill the requirement of an abusive act, even if the decision to sue was influenced by a wrongful motive, purpose or intent.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412601\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/9/#p16\">\n    71 F.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that \"a showing of bad motive in connection with 'regular' process is not enough\" to sustain an abuse of process claim). Llinas and Rivera fail to identify an abusive act, such as an improper issuance of a subpoena or discovery request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redmond v. Yachting Solutions, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-292,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201075030\">\n    2018 WL 1075030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2031470\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *5 (D. Me. Feb. 27, 2018) (holding that because \"the abuse of process counterclaim is based on Plaintiff's filing of the present lawsuit[, for] this reason, Defendant's [abuse of process claim] is DISMISSED\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other than the filing a civil action, Llinas and Rivera set forth no additional facts suggesting that either DISH Network or NagraStar performed\n   an abusive act. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the abuse of process counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   DISH Network's and NagraStar's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (Docket No. 34.) Consequently, the counterclaim is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Judgment shall be entered accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Subject matter jurisdiction exists in the underlying complaint because DISH Network and NagraStar assert claims pursuant to the following federal statutes: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Federal Communications Act, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
