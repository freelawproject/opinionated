Heavyweight boxing champion Deontay Wilder and DiBella Entertainment, Inc. (\"DBE\") claim that boxer Alexander Povetkin, who tested positive for a banned substance right before the match was to take place, and World of Boxing LLC (\"WOB\"), breached two contracts relating to that match and seek a declaratory judgment that they are owed money pursuant to an escrow agreement covering the prize money for the bout. WOB, Povetkin, and Andrey Ryabinskiy (collectively the \"WOB Parties\") assert that Wilder, DBE, and Lou DiBella (collectively the \"Wilder Parties\") breached these agreements and seek to have the escrowed money returned to them. All parties now move for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth\n   below, both sides' motions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Parties and the Bout\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The World Boxing Council (\"WBC\") is one of four major organizations that sanctions professional boxing matches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition of Deontay Wilder, dated Dec. 7, 2016 (annexed as Ex. 67 to Yalowitz Decl.)

(\"WBC R. &amp; Regs.\"), at \u00a7\u00a7 3.4, 3.7. These rules also provide that \"[a]fter the WBC orders a bout, there shall be a period of thirty (30) days for the parties to negotiate, finalize, execute, and file a contract for the bout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.8.

It is undisputed that Povetkin's urine sample provided to VADA on April 27, 2016 tested positive for Meldonium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Positive Test Result. Nonetheless, neither of these is a breach of the Bout Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We begin by noting that the Bout Agreement contains no language mandating that each fighter refrain from ingesting banned substances. Rather, it provides that \"[t]he WBC [CBP] shall be the exclusive program governing all aspects of anti-doping testing in both out-of-competition random testing and testing immediately after the Bout.\" Bout Agreement \u00a7 7. In turn, the CBP, states that \"[r]esponsibility for strict compliance and adherence to all WBC anti-doping requirements shall be\n   the sole and exclusive responsibility of each Eligible Boxer.\" CBP \u00a7 III. It is this provision that the Wilder Parties allege was breached by Povetkin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilder Mem. at 23 (citing CBP \u00a7 III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Nevertheless, that provision does not require absolute abstinence from the use of banned substances, but by its terms requires that the boxer abide by \"WBC anti-doping requirements.\" In turn, the CBP also provides that \"the WBC shall have complete discretion to rule on culpability .... [And] may in its discretion consider all factors in making a determination regarding responsibility, relative fault, and penalties, if any.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBP \u00a7\u00a7 V.G-H. The parties to the Bout Agreement thus agreed that the WBC's ruling would be conclusive as to whether the \"WBC anti-doping requirements\" were breached. In this case, after issuing several conflicting and indecisive rulings, the WBC finally decided on November 7, 2017 that notwithstanding the jury's verdict in this case, it would adhere to its earlier decision that it was not possible to determine whether Povetkin ingested Meldonium after January 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 7 Ruling at 3. In other words, the WBC exercised its discretion to determine that Povetkin did not violate the CBP. The WBC's exercise of that discretion was specifically agreed to by the parties to the Bout Agreement and they are thus now bound by it. To conclude otherwise would require this Court to determine that Povetkin breached the contract by failing to abide by \"WBC anti-doping requirements\" when the parties specifically agreed that WBC's decision on this question would be conclusive. Bout Agreement \u00a7 7; CBP \u00a7 III, V.G-H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Wilder Parties respond to this reasoning in several ways. First, the Wilder Parties note that the WBC Rules and Regulations state that \"[b]oxers rated or participating in any contest sanctioned by the WBC should not take, ingest, or have administered to him any substance, medicine, or drug ... that may enhance or reduce the boxer's performance in the ring.\" WBC R. &amp; Regs. \u00a7 4.29. The Wilder Parties in their complaint did not allege that Povetkin breached this provision and did not raise the issue until their reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilder Reply at 21. In any event, this provision must be read in concert with Rule 4.40 of the WBC's rules, which states that the WBC does not abide by a \"strict liability\" standard, and vests the WBC with discretion to determine whether a boxer was responsible for violating its anti-doping policy. WBC R. &amp; Regs. \u00a7 4.40. The parties thus left it up to the WBC to determine whether its rules were violated. Moreover, the language used in Rule 4.29-\"should not\" instead of \"shall not\"-would not by itself allow the conclusion that ingestion of a performance-enhancing drug violated the Bout Agreement. As one case has noted \"the use of the word 'should' does not automatically denote either a mandatory or a permissive direction. Rather, the meaning depends on the context in which the words are found.\"\n   <em>\n    Bord v. Rubin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20420777\">\n    1998 WL 420777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 27, 1998) (citing cases). Here, the meaning of the word \"should\" is informed by the remainder of the WBC rules-in particular the WBC's statement that there is no \"strict liability\" standard and its arrogation to itself of the prerogative of deciding how ingestion of performance-enhancing substances will be treated. In these circumstances, the Wilder Parties have not shown that Povetkin's ingestion of or positive test for Meldonium was by itself a breach of the Bout Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Wilder Parties argue that the WBC does not have discretion to decide whether Povetkin violated the Bout Agreement because the Bout Agreement is a dispute between private parties, and the agreement designates the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the forum in which disputes regarding\n   its terms are to be litigated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilder Reply at 2-4. The only cases the Wilder Parties cite in support of this argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, are irrelevant because they deal only with the scope of arbitration clauses, not with the substantive question of how a contract incorporating rules of a private organization should be interpreted. As already discussed, the Bout Agreement makes reference to the CBP and the WBC Rules and Regulations, which vest the WBC with discretion to make certain determinations, including whether a boxer has complied with anti-doping requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBP \u00a7\u00a7 III, V.G-H. Although the forum selection clause here plainly permitted suit to be filed in this Court, it does not address any issue of contract interpretation. In this case, the parties ceded a substantial amount of control over the performance of the Bout Agreement to the WBC. That this Court accepts this aspect of the Bout Agreement does not represent any failure by this Court to exercise jurisdiction. To the contrary, doing so implements the intent of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Wilder Parties argue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Wilder Reply at 4-7, that the Court already decided the issue of whether the WBC retained discretion to determine whether Povetkin violated the anti-doping provisions of the contract, pointing to an exchange at a December 15, 2017 conference in which the Court rejected WOB's argument that submitting the issue of whether Povetkin ingested meldonium to a jury would amount to an \"advisory opinion.\" Transcript, dated Dec. 15, 2016 (Docket # 104), at 72-74. All that the Court determined during that exchange, however, was that the question of Povetkin's ingestion of meldonium was \"an issue in the case\" and that the jury's verdict would be \"binding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72. Povetkin's ingestion of meldonium was an \"issue in the case\" because Wilder asserted that it amounted to a breach of the contract (even if the Court has now rejected this argument following summary judgment briefing) and because it may be a defense to some or all of the allegations of defamation. The ruling at the December 15, 2017 conference did not represent a judicial determination regarding any arguments the WOB Parties could assert regarding the interpretation of the Bout Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, citing no case law, the Wilder Parties argue that Povetkin breached the Bout Agreement because Povetkin's positive test, as determined by VADA, \"proximately caused\" the WBC to call off the Bout.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilder Reply at 11-12. However, this argument begs the question of whether Povetkin's ingestion of meldonium was a breach of the Bout Agreement. As already discussed, it did not constitute a breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Accordingly, the WOB Parties' motion for summary judgment on the Wilder Parties' claim that Povetkin breached the Bout Agreement is granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    WOB\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Wilder Parties argue that WOB breached the Bout Agreement by not promoting the Bout on May 21, 2016 or providing Povetkin's services for it. Wilder Mem. at 21-22. The Bout Agreement provided that \"[WOB] shall stage the WBC World Heavyweight Championship between the Champion and the Challenger at the Palace of Sports 'Megasport' in Moscow, Russia on the date of May 21, 2016 ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bout Agreement \u00a7 1. WOB did not stage the fight on May 21, 2016 (or on any date thereafter). Were we to ignore all other provisions of the Bout Agreement, there would be no question that WOB breached the Bout Agreement by not staging the Bout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In fact, the structure and language of the Bout Agreement make clear that WOB did not breach the agreement. Specifically, the Bout Agreement provides that the WBC \"shall exclusively perform any and all decisions, results, and actions relating to the Bout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3. In other words, the Bout Agreement gives the WBC complete power over the Bout's staging. In a similar vein, the Bout Agreement provides that \"the WBC has and reserves the rights, in its discretion ... to not certify any contest as being for the WBC-recognized World Heavyweight Championship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2. This provision is significant because the Bout Agreement explicitly recognizes that its purpose is to provide for the staging of a \"World Boxing Council .... World Heavyweight Championship bout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. By agreeing to these provisions, the parties ceded control over certain aspects of their obligations under the Bout Agreement to the WBC. Most pertinently, the parties recognized the WBC's authority to cancel or change the date of the Bout, inasmuch as such an action would constitute a \"decision[ ] ... relating to the Bout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3. Additionally, if the WBC did not \"certify\" the bout \"as being for the WBC-recognized World Heavyweight Championship,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3, the entire purpose of the Bout Agreement would be lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   That is precisely what happened here. On May 15, 2016, the WBC declined to allow the fight to go forward on May 21, 2016, after Povetkin's positive test for Meldonium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Postponement Press Release. That decision superseded WOB's obligation to stage the Bout for the WBC World Heavyweight Championship on May 21, 2016. If we were to conclude, as the Wilder Parties seemingly argue, that WOB was required to stage the Bout notwithstanding the WBC's decision, such a staging would conflict with the clause that allowed the WBC to make all \"decisions\" and take any \"actions\" that \"relat[e] to the Bout.\" Bout Agreement \u00a7 3. It would also conflict with the stated purpose of the contract, which was to stage a \"WBC-recognized World Heavyweight Championship bout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Given the power of control vested in the WBC, once the WBC canceled the Bout, the contract could not be read to also impose an obligation on WOB to stage the same Bout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The conclusion that WOB did not breach the Bout Agreement by not staging the Bout on May 21, 2016, fully accords with the principle under New York law that courts \"should construe a contract in a manner that avoids inconsistencies and reasonably harmonizes its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Gessin Elec.

For his part, Povetkin seeks to recover the amount he would have earned had the Bout taken place-that is, expectation damages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   WOB Mem. at 34-35-which is \"the amount necessary to put [plaintiff] in as good a position as [he] would have been if the defendant had abided by the contract,\"\n   <em>\n    Trans World Metals, Inc. v.

Neither WOB nor Povetkin may collect damages, however, because even drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, no reasonable jury could find that the Wilder Parties' purported breaches caused their damages. This is because the damages that WOB and Povetkin seek are attributable in this case to intervening causes-namely, Povetkin's positive test for Meldonium, the WBC's consequent postponement of the Bout, and/or the WBC's subsequent failure to reschedule or resanction the Bout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We begin by noting that even the WOB Parties themselves assert that their damages flow from the fact that the Bout did not take place.

The WBC unequivocally stated that Povetkin's positive drug test was the reason for the WBC postponing the Bout.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Postponement Press Release. The WOB Parties offer no testimony from a representative of the WBC or anyone else that the reason given by the WBC was not the real reason. While the WOB Parties argue that it was Wilder's failure to appear in Moscow, rather than Povetkin's positive test result, that caused the WBC to postpone the Bout,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   WOB Reply at 31, no reasonable jury could indulge in the speculation that would be required to conclude that this was so (and that the WBC falsely stated the reason the fight was being postponed).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scotto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"268755\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/143/105/#p114\">\n    143 F.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The non-moving party may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation\" to show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact.)

WOB Reply at 31-32. However, there is no evidence that would allow a jury to conclude that the WBC's failure to reschedule the Bout was influenced by Wilder's purported breaches. The only evidence in the record even remotely supporting an inference that the WBC would have rescheduled the Bout at all is the WBC's ruling on August 17, 2016, stating that Povetkin was cleared to fight again and would compete against another boxer for the WBC Interim Heavyweight Championship while Wilder recovered from the injuries he suffered in the bout with Arreola.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 17 Ruling Regarding Heavyweight Division. However, the\n   record simply does not support the additional inference that Wilder caused the WBC not to reschedule the Bout during that period. As an initial matter, in a ruling issued that same day, the WBC noted that it had \"called the Bout off and reserved any further ruling until the ongoing investigation, inquiry and evaluation process [of Povetkin] concluded.\" Aug. 17 Ruling Regarding Povetkin at 5. As was true with respect to the initial postponement, there is no admissible evidence to suggest that the WBC was giving a false reason for \"call[ing] the Bout off\" and that one of Wilder's purported breaches was instead a substantial factor in the WBC's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, WOB and Povetkin were not injured by any of the purported breaches; they were injured only because the Bout did not take place.

Accordingly, the WOB Parties argue that the Wilder Parties could not have reasonably believed that WOB was not entitled to the escrowed funds, and thus the Wilder Parties' objection was in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413871\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/1570/#p1575\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   We begin by noting that there were certainly non-frivolous arguments that Povetkin had breached the Bout Agreement when he tested positive for Meldonium-at a minimum based on the potentially ambiguous statement in the WBC's rules that a fighter \"should not\" ingest a performance-enhancing substance. The Wilder Parties thus could reasonably have believed that they had a claim to damages for their expected payment under the Bout Agreement-the very funds that were held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. As for whether the Escrow Agreement could reasonably be interpreted to allow an objection in these circumstances, we note that the Escrow Agreement is silent as to the bases on which the parties could object to the disbursement of the escrowed funds. The Escrow Agreement could have placed conditions or restrictions on objections but it did not do so. Instead, it places no limitations on the exercise of that right other than to penalize an objection that is not made in \"good faith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In light of the almost unfettered authority accorded each side to object to the disbursement of escrowed funds, and because the only purpose of the Escrow Agreement was to ensure payment to Wilder of the money he was due under the Bout Agreement, it was objectively reasonable for the Wilder Parties to conclude that they could make an objection in order to preserve the very monies they would be awarded for a successful claim under the Bout Agreement. In light of the objective reasonableness of this view, a reasonable jury could not conclude that the Wilder Parties \"exercised a right malevolently.\"\n   <em>\n    Richbell Info. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"581435\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/309/288/#p302\">\n    309 A.D.2d at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"581435\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/309/288/#p302\">\n    765 N.Y.S.2d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Moreover, the WOB Parties have pointed to no subjective evidence showing \"malevolent\" intent on the part of the Wilder Parties. Indeed, while it is not necessary to consider it, at least some evidence in the record indicates that the Wilder Parties believed at the time that they were validly exercising their contractual rights. For example, DiBella averred in a declaration that his \"understanding and reading of the plain language of [Section 1.3(d) of the Escrow Agreement] was (and is) that its sole purpose was to give the parties the\n   unfettered right to ensure that the Escrow Property remained secure while they either reached an agreement about its distribution, or were able to litigate competing claims to their final conclusion.\" Declaration of Lou DiBella, dated Nov. 13, 2017 (annexed as Ex. 17 to Schalk Decl.), at \u00b6 11. Both Finkel and Dombroff allege that they recalled this conversation and stated that DiBella's description of it was accurate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dombroff Decl. \u00b6 4; Finkel Decl. \u00b6 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The WOB Parties point to the fact that although this Court \"provided Mr. Wilder with an opportunity to prove that he acted in good faith under the advice of counsel .... Mr. Wilder did not do so\" in that he failed to introduce evidence showing that he acted in reliance on advice of counsel in making the objection. WOB Mem. at 38. This argument, however, ignores the point that, as the Court previously held, \"[a]n argument that Wilder acted in good faith could be made without testimony of counsel if it was reasonable (even if erroneous) to interpret the contract to allow Wilder to make an objection to disbursement based on his claim to payment under the Bout Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilder v. World of Boxing LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271128\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/220/473/\">\n    220 F.Supp.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). Thus, Wilder was not obligated to present an advice of counsel defense to establish his good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The WOB Parties also urge a narrower interpretation of the right to object under Section 1.3(d) on the ground that the agreement sets forth no basis for the payment of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WOB Mem. at 39. The WOB Parties argue that allowing an objection to be lodged \"at will for some reason not mentioned in the Escrow Agreement,\" would have the effect of giving \"one party an unfair and unreasonable advantage over the other, or [ ] would place one party at the mercy of the other,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271128\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/220/473/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), a result that New York law cautions should avoided in construing a contract,\n   <em>\n    Luver Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Mo's Plumbing &amp; Heating\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12148864,12148801\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/144/587/\">\n    144 A.D.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588-89 (1st Dep't 2016). However, to say that Section 1.3(d) permits parties to object \"at will\" is misleading, inasmuch as this provision requires objections to be made in good faith. Further, not awarding interest while parties dispute in good faith a payment under an escrow agreement cannot be construed as an \"unreasonable\" advantage. Had one party objected in bad faith, then a significant penalty was due under the contract. The contract language cannot be reinterpreted simply on the basis that it could not have been the intent of the contracting parties that they would forgo interest for the time period it took to reach an agreement or to obtain a court order as to disbursement of the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In sum, a reasonable jury could not find that the Wilder Parties, simply by objecting to the release of escrowed funds at the time they learned Povetkin had tested positive for Meldonium, did not act in good faith. Accordingly, the Wilder Parties' motion for summary judgment in support of their argument that they are not liable for $2.5 million in liquidated damages is granted, and WOB's motion for summary judgment on its claim that it is entitled to these liquidated damages is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Wilder Parties' motion (Docket# 284) and the WOB Parties' motion (Docket# 296) are each granted in part and denied in part. All claims in the two actions are dismissed with the exception of the defamation claim, which has been stayed.
