The Court dismissed all the claims in the LPA's action except a single cause of action under a federal environmental regulation against the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the second chapter, the Court denied LPA's motion for summary judgment. The LPA argued that the Council had violated a NEPA regulation because the Council completed the federally mandated environmental review after engaging in municipal consent-a state-mandated process of securing prior approval from all county and municipal governments through which a proposed light-rail project will run. The Court concluded that the LPA had not shown that it was entitled to summary judgment on the record at that time, but noted that the Council appeared to have come close to violating federal law by predetermining the route before all alternatives could be properly reviewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now, in the third chapter, the Court considers the second round of summary-judgment motions. The LPA renews its motion after taking discovery and after the Council completed the environmental review. The LPA argues that the Council committed itself to a specific light-rail route before completing the final environmental review and that the Council's actions concerning that decision amounted to an irreversible and irretrievable predetermination of a particular light-rail route in violation of federal law. The Council cross-moves for summary judgment, arguing that it did not irreversibly and irretrievably commit itself to a specific light-rail route as a result of the municipal-consent process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This is a close case. State law, while well intentioned, severely restricts the Council's ability to move light-rail projects forward during the planning and design phases because the state's municipal-consent regime effectively gives veto power to every local government along the project's proposed route. At the same time, and in potential conflict, federal law requires the Council not to limit reasonable alternatives until the final environmental review is complete. For the Council, walking that tightrope is difficult. The Court's task here, however, is not to consider the wisdom of the Council's decisions and deals, but rather, is limited to deciding whether the Council violated federal law. Because the Court will find that the Council did not irreversibly and irretrievably commit itself to a specific light-rail route, despite giving the appearance that it did, the Court will deny the LPA's motion, grant the Council's motion, and enter judgment for the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. OVERVIEW AND LEGAL BACKDROP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Council is leading the effort to build a new light-rail line that connects downtown Minneapolis with the southwestern Twin Cities suburbs (\"SWLRT\").\n   <em>\n    LPA I\n   </em>\n   , 91 F.Supp.3d at 1111. The SWLRT's proposed route goes through the Kenilworth Corridor-a one-and-a-half mile strip of land in Minneapolis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Corridor presently contains a freight-rail line and a biking/running path.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The final proposed route keeps freight traffic in the Corridor at grade, and has the SWLRT travel in a tunnel through the southern half of the Corridor and at grade through the northern half (the \"South Tunnel Plan\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Municipal consent\" is required for light-rail projects by\n   Minnesota Statute \u00a7 473.3994, which states that each city and county in which a light-rail-transit route is proposed to be located must hold a public hearing and vote to approve or disapprove the physical design component of the preliminary design plans for the project.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20473.3994\">\n    Minn.

Because the FTA-a federal agency-will partially fund the SWLRT project, the project is a major governmental action that requires preparation of an EIS pursuant to NEPA.\n   <em>\n    LPA II\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.Supp.3d at 963.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BUILD-UP TO THE SOUTH TUNNEL PLAN\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2009, the Hennepin County Regional Railroad Authority (\"HCRRA\") issued the Scoping Summary Report, the first step in the environmental-review process.\n   <em>\n    LPA I\n   </em>\n   , 91 F.Supp.3d at 1112. That Report did not include any analysis of tunnels in the Corridor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In October 2012, the HCRRA issued the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (\"DEIS\"), the next step in the process. The DEIS also did not include any analysis of tunnels in the Corridor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1112-13. Rather, the DEIS evaluated three strategies for the Corridor: (1) (the preferred strategy) reroute freight rail through St. Louis Park and locate the SWLRT at grade in the Corridor, (2) reroute freight rail through St. Louis Park and locate the SWLRT outside the Corridor, or (3) co-locate freight rail and the SWLRT at grade in the Corridor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DEIS concluded that strategy (3)-co-location at grade-would not adequately preserve the environment in the Corridor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The FTA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, however, determined that the first strategy (relocation) was not technically feasible because the rerouting of freight-rail traffic might, among other things, endanger aquatic resources.\n   <em>\n    LPA II\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.Supp.3d at 965. They suggested that routing the SWLRT through tunnels in the Corridor might alleviate the environmental concerns associated with routing the SWLRT through the Corridor at grade raised in the DEIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, St. Louis Park opposed the prospect of relocated freight-rail traffic through its city.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 964-66. Its city manager stated that St. Louis Park would likely not support freight-rail relocation in the municipal-consent process. (Aff. of Joy R. Anderson (\"Anderson Aff.\") \u00b6 6, Ex. 5 at 2-3, Apr. 28, 2017, Docket No. 135.) In July 2013, the Council and FTA announced that they would issue a Supplemental DEIS (\"SDEIS\"), the scope of which would include \"freight rail alignments\" and which would evaluate the environmental impacts of proposed routes not included in the DEIS.\n   <em>\n    LPA II\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.Supp.3d at 965.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In late 2013, the Council began to advocate for a plan that included locating the SWLRT in the Corridor but in one or more tunnels, and keeping the existing freight rail in the Corridor at grade along with the biking/running path. For example,\n   the Council's then-chair, Susan Haigh, emailed Governor Mark Dayton in August 2013, stating that routing the SWLRT outside of the Corridor had already been \"rejected\" as the local-government alternative, and that routing the SWLRT in the Corridor was the local-government \"consensus.\" (Anderson Aff. \u00b6 9, Ex. 8.) A few days later, Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak wrote a letter to Haigh, stating that Minneapolis \"only agreed to support placing [SWLRT] on the Kenilworth Corridor on condition that [Hennepin] County's promise to not allow co-location with freight would be fulfilled,\" and that Minneapolis \"need[s] a rock solid guarantee\" that co-location at grade \"will not happen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, Ex. 6 at 2.) When freight rail was first located in the Corridor several years ago, it was intended to be a temporary situation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, Ex. 19 at 10-11), so Minneapolis objected when the Council indicated that freight-rail traffic would not be rerouted as part of the SWLRT Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 2, 2013, Council staff recommended routing the SWLRT through two shallow tunnels in the Corridor and keeping freight-rail traffic in the Corridor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, Ex. 10 at 2.) In an email to Haigh on October 6, 2013, Council member Adam Duininck stated, \"From the first briefing I received on SWLRT, it was overwhelmingly clear where the staff recommendation was headed\" with respect to relocating freight-rail traffic, and \"[t]hat sense of it being a foregone conclusion is the primary driver of why Minneapolis believes that the process has not been fair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, Ex. 12 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In late 2013, at Governor Dayton's request, the Council hired TransSystems, a transportation-engineering firm, to independently analyze options for freight-rail relocation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-20, Exs. 15-19.) TransSystems concluded that only two viable options existed for freight-rail traffic: through the Corridor, or through St. Louis Park via tracks that Twin Cities &amp; Western Railroad Company (\"TC&amp;W\") operates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, Ex. 19 at 34.) In March 2014, TC&amp;W notified the Council that rerouting freight-rail traffic through St. Louis Park would present physical and engineering obstacles that would create a risk of train derailment-a risk that TC&amp;W could not mitigate. (Aff. of Charles N. Nauen (\"Nauen Aff.\") \u00b6 7, Ex. 7, May 19, 2017, Docket No. 141.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In April 2014, the Council put the two-tunnel plan up for municipal consent.\n   <em>\n    LPA II\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.Supp.3d at 965-66. While awaiting municipal consent, the Council entered into two Memoranda of Understanding (\"MOU\")-one with Minneapolis and one with St. Louis Park.\n   <em>\n    LPA I\n   </em>\n   , 91 F.Supp.3d at 1113-14. The Minneapolis MOU states, among other things, that freight rail will remain in the Corridor and that the SWLRT route will travel the southern portion of the Corridor in a tunnel and the northern portion at grade-the South Tunnel Plan.\n   <em>\n    LPA II\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.Supp.3d at 965-66. The Council also agreed to add a stop on the SWLRT route at 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Street in the Corridor-a stop that Minneapolis wanted added. (Anderson Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, Exs. 29-30.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The St. Louis Park MOU states that \"no further study of the feasibility of rerouting freight traffic [through] St. Louis Park will be undertaken, except as required for any continuing environmental review.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34, Ex. 33.) In August 2014, the municipalities approved the two-tunnel plan via the municipal-consent process, with Minneapolis voting specifically on the South Tunnel Plan.\n   <em>\n    LPA II\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.Supp.3d at 966.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In May 2015, the Council issued the SDEIS, which addressed alternatives and potential impacts that were not fully evaluated in the DEIS, including the South Tunnel Plan. (Nauen Aff. \u00b6 16, Ex. 16.) The SDEIS concluded that the South Tunnel Plan provided the best balance of costs, benefits, and environmental impacts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later that fall, the Council put a revised plan-which included the South Tunnel Plan along with other cost-saving modifications and changes to the physical design-up for a second round of municipal consent, which it received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Council and FTA issued the Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"FEIS\") in May 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22, Ex. 22.) The alternatives it evaluates are the South Tunnel Plan and a No-Build alternative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FTA issued its Record Of Decision (\"ROD\") in July 2016, concluding that NEPA's requirements had been satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19, Ex. 19.) And in August 2016, the Council determined that the FEIS was adequate-allowing the SWLRT project finally to move forward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21, Ex. 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The LPA brought this action in September 2014, shortly after the Council completed the first round of municipal consent. (Compl., Sept. 8, 2014, Docket No. 1.) The LPA filed a motion for summary judgment shortly thereafter. (Pl.'s First Mot. Summ. J., Nov. 3, 2014, Docket No. 13.) The Council then filed a motion to dismiss. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss, Nov. 17, 2014, Docket No. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In March 2015, the Court denied the Council's motion to dismiss, finding that the LPA has a narrow cause of action against the Council arising under a federal regulation enacted pursuant to NEPA.\n   <em>\n    LPA I\n   </em>\n   , 91 F.Supp.3d at 1120-32. In August 2015, the Court denied the LPA's motion for summary judgment, finding that the factual record at that time did not support summary judgment for the LPA.\n   <em>\n    LPA II\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.Supp.3d at 975-76.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since then, the parties have completed discovery, the Council and FTA have completed the environmental-review process, and the FTA has issued its ROD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The LPA now renews its motion for summary judgment. The LPA argues that the Council's completion of the municipal-consent process was an irreversible and irretrievable commitment to a particular SWLRT route before the FTA issued its ROD. The LPA asks the Court to declare that the Council violated NEPA, declare the entire environmental-review process null and void, and enjoin the Council from any further work on the SWLRT until the Council completes a new environmental-review process that complies with NEPA and its regulations. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Second Mot. Summ. J. at 32, Apr. 28, 2017, Docket No. 134.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Council cross-moves for summary judgment, arguing that it did not make an irreversible and irretrievable commitment to a particular\n   SWLRT route before the completion of the environment review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the Court will conclude that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that the Council did not irreversibly and irretrievably predetermine the SWLRT route, the Court will grant the Council's motion for summary judgment, deny the LPA's motion for summary judgment, and enter judgment for the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In light of those cases, the Court found that several facts were \"critical\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 972. Those critical facts were (1) the nonbinding nature of the municipal-consent process, (2) the nonbinding nature of the MOUs signed with St. Louis Park and Minneapolis, and (3) that the FTA is not bound by the municipal-consent process. Nevertheless, the Court expressed concern \"that a political and bureaucratic drumbeat has begun that will lead inexorably to exactly the choice the Met Council wants,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 974, regardless of the environmental review.

The municipal-consent process was, and remains, nonbinding. Indeed, the Council initiated a second round of municipal consent after making changes to the proposed route.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/#p181\">\n    422 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   202-06 ;\n   <em>\n    Conner v.

The MOUs too remain nonbinding. Although there is some evidence that Minneapolis (at least now) considers its MOU to be binding, this does not change the Court's view that, for purposes of predetermination, the MOU is non-binding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forest Guardians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698784\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/692/#p714\">\n    611 F.3d at 718-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And there is no evidence that suggests that the FTA's ROD-while finding that the FEIS, which evaluated the South Tunnel Plan, complied with NEPA-was legally bound by the municipal-consent process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burkholder v. Peters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Appx.%2094\">\n    58 Fed.Appx. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98-102 (6th Cir. 2003). All told, these facts show that the Council did not engage in predetermination. Rather, the Council focused, albeit rather intently, on its preferred alternative, the South Tunnel Plan, which it is permitted to do.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/#p181\">\n    422 F.3d at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, the evidence shows that the Council did not subordinate all considerations to a particular route such that its decision would constitute predetermination. Rather, the Council acted to secure funding for the SWLRT and to obtain municipal consent-not to predetermine a light-rail route. To be sure, route predetermination would have helped secure funding and obtain municipal consent. But the facts indisputably show that the Council prioritized funding and municipal consent over specific routes or alternatives. When faced with financial pressures and the prospect of not obtaining municipal consent, the Council was willing to change the proposed route to advance their funding and municipal-consent goals. With respect to funding, the Council modified the route, in part, due to budget pressures. And with respect to municipal consent, Minneapolis exerted considerable influence over the Council. Minneapolis, via its MOU, both prevented the Council from foreclosing freight-traffic rerouting and obtained an additional stop at 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Street-two results that Minneapolis wanted in exchange for its consent. These facts now demonstrate to the Court that the Council did not irreversibly and irretrievably commit to a route such that would eliminate reasonable alternatives. Thus, the Council did not violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.1\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1506.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court will deny LPA's motion for summary judgment, grant the Council's motion for summary judgment, and enter judgment for the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ultimately, after careful consideration of the LPA's claims in this case, and a thorough review of the factual record developed by the parties, the Court has determined that the MOUs the Council signed with Minneapolis and St. Louis Park are what the Council says they are: promises that can be broken. If the MOUs were binding and they limited environmental review to a single route, the Court would be compelled to find improper predetermination under NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court understands the Council's difficult task. The state's municipal-consent process enables local governments to attempt to hold light-rail projects hostage if they oppose any part of the project. And such a scheme can significantly interfere with the goals of a proper regional planning process that appropriately considers the environmental impact of development. But the factual development in this case demonstrates that the Council did not irreversibly commit itself to a single alternative. Changes were made, and municipal consent was re-obtained. Federal law governs procedures, not results, and the Court finds that proper procedures were followed in the approval of the South Tunnel Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   1.
