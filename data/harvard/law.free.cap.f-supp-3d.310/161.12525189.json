LEON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   If there ever were an antitrust case where the parties had a dramatically different assessment of the current state of the relevant market and a fundamentally different vision of its future development, this is the one. Small wonder it had to go to trial!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 20, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division brought this suit, on behalf of the United States of America (\"the Government\" or \"the plaintiff\"), to block the merger of AT &amp; T Inc. (\"AT &amp; T\") and Time Warner Inc. (\"Time Warner\") as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government claims, in essence, that permitting AT &amp; T to acquire Time Warner is likely to substantially lessen competition in the video programming and distribution market nationwide by enabling AT &amp; T to use Time Warner's \"must have\" television content to either raise its rivals' video programming costs or, by way of a \"blackout,\" drive those same rivals' customers to its subsidiary, DirecTV. Thus, according to the Government, consumers nationwide will be harmed by increased prices for access to Turner networks, notwithstanding the Government's concession that this vertical merger would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in annual cost savings to AT &amp; T's customers and notwithstanding the fact that (unlike in \"horizontal\" mergers) no competitor will be eliminated by the merger's proposed vertical integration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Not surprisingly, the defendants, AT &amp; T, Time Warner, and DirecTV, strongly disagree. Their vision couldn't be more different. The video programming and distribution market, they point out, has been, and is, in the middle of a revolution where high-speed internet access has facilitated a \"veritable explosion\" of new, innovative video content and advertising offerings over the past five years. Trial Tr. (\"Tr.\") 1397:1-4 (Montemagno (Charter) ). Vertically integrated entities like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon have achieved remarkable success in creating and providing affordable, on-demand video content directly to viewers over the internet. Meanwhile, web giants Facebook and Google have developed new ways to use data to create effective-and lucrative-digital advertisements tailored to the individual consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a result of these \"tectonic changes\" brought on by the proliferation of high-speed internet access, video programmers such as Time Warner and video distributors such as AT &amp; T find themselves facing two stark realities: declining video subscriptions and flatlining television advertising revenues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    at 3079:18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). Indeed, cost-conscious consumers increasingly choose to \"cut\" or \"shave\" the cord, abandoning their traditional cable- or satellite- TV packages for cheaper content alternatives available over the internet. At the same time, Facebook's and Google's dominant digital advertising platforms have surpassed television advertising in revenue. Watching vertically integrated, data-informed entities thrive as television subscriptions and advertising revenues declined, AT &amp; T and Time Warner concluded that each had a problem that the other could solve: Time Warner could provide AT &amp; T with the ability to experiment with and develop innovative video content and advertising offerings for AT &amp; T's many video and wireless customers, and AT &amp; T could afford Time Warner access to customer relationships and valuable data about its programming. Together, AT &amp; T and Time Warner concluded that both companies could stop \"chasing taillights\" and catch up with the competition. 2/16/18 Hr'g Tr. 34:16 [Dkt # 67]. Those were the circumstances that drove AT &amp; T, a distributor of content, and Time Warner, a content creator and programmer, to announce their historic $108 billion merger in October 2016 (the \"proposed merger\" or \"challenged merger\"). Those are the circumstances that cause them to claim today that their merger will increase not only innovation, but competition in this marketplace for years to come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Section 7 of the Clayton Act assigns this Court the \"uncertain task\" of weighing the parties' competing visions of the future of the relevant market and the challenged merger's place within it.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Baker Hughes Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540168,3483296\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/981/\">\n    908 F.2d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Nothing less than a comprehensive inquiry into future competitive conditions in that market is expected. And the Government has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the merger is likely to lessen competition substantially in that uncertain future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since announcing the transaction in late October 2016, defendants have delayed closing on the merger agreement for about 18 months as a result of the Government's investigation and suit. The deal is now set to expire if not consummated on or before June 21, 2018-a turn of events that would require AT &amp; T to pay Time Warner a \"break-up fee\" of $500 million. The parties have engaged in a highly accelerated discovery schedule to prepare themselves to try this case in March and April of this year. The trial itself lasted nearly six weeks. Both sides put on a case-in-chief and the Government put on a rebuttal case as well. At the conclusion of the trial, I advised the parties I would issue a ruling, if not an opinion, no later than June 12, 2018 so that the losing side would have the agreed-upon time remaining to pursue its appellate rights\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the merger or the $500 million break-up fee went into effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following is the Court's Opinion. Initially, I provide context for this suit by reviewing the background of the video programming and distribution industry, the proposed merger, and the procedural history of this case. Thereafter, I discuss the legal standards governing a suit under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, emphasizing in particular the considerations at play in evaluating vertical mergers. With that in place, I next analyze each of the Government's three theories of harm to competition, balancing, as appropriate, the conceded proconsumer benefits of the merger with the consumer harms alleged and the evidence offered to support them. Ultimately, I conclude that the Government has failed to meet its burden to establish that the proposed \"transaction is likely to lessen competition substantially.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540168,3483296\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/981/\">\n    908 F.2d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As such, based on that conclusion, and for all the reasons set forth in greater detail in this Opinion, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Government's request to enjoin the proposed merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    TABLE OF CONTENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   BACKGROUND...166\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

The Video Programming and Distribution Industry\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The structure of the video programming and distribution industry generally resembles\n   the \"three-stage chain of production comprised of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers that typifies the distribution of many, if not most, physical goods in the U.S. economy.\" Christopher S. Yoo,\n   <em>\n    Vertical Integration and Media Regulation in the New Economy\n   </em>\n   , 19 Yale J. Reg. 171, 220 (2002). Here, that three-stage chain of production and distribution involves \"content creation, content aggregation, and content distribution.\" Proposed Findings of Fact of the United States (\"Gov't PFOF\") \u00b6 8 [Dkt. # 128].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Television content begins at the manufacturing level. Although video programming is often created by studios (such as Time Warner's Warner Bros.), some networks or distributors \"produce content for themselves\" or, in the case of live sporting events, license the rights to broadcast the events from the various sports leagues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 80:12-16 (Fenwick (Cox) ). At the second level, programmers (such as Time Warner's Turner or Home Box Office (\"HBO\") ) aggregate content into a network or network group and then license those networks to video distributors, like AT &amp; T's DirecTV.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:4-9; Plaintiff's Exhibit (\"PX\") 456-4 to 10. At the third level, distributors bundle and distribute networks to their subscribers. Tr. 80:4-9 (Fenwick (Cox) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Some subscription-based video programming services are \"vertically integrated,\" meaning, in this context, that those services create or aggregate their content offerings and then distribute those offerings directly to consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3081:18-25 (Bewkes (Time Warner) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact (\"Defs.' PFOF\") \u00b6 12 [Dkt. # 120]. Examples of those services include Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Tr. 3155:22-23 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). Traditional video programmers, such as Turner, generally lack such \"soup to nuts\" integration of content creation and distribution; they are instead reliant upon video distributors to deliver their content offerings to consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3388:6-7 (Stephenson (AT &amp; T) );\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 485:1-486:6, 612:17-20 (Martin (Turner) ). Because the Government's claims center on the proposed combination of Time Warner's video programming with AT &amp; T's video distribution, my background review focuses on those facets of the video programming and distribution industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Video Programing and Distribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Programmers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Traditional programmers, such as Turner, acquire and aggregate video content.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:4-16 (Fenwick (Cox) ). Generally, programmers do not offer their content directly to consumers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 485:1-486:6, 612:1-20 (Martin (Turner) ). Instead, they package video content into networks-in Turner's case, networks such as TNT, TBS, and CNN-and then license the rights to display those networks to\n   video distributors. PX459-18; Tr. 80:6-9 (Fenwick (Cox) ). As such, Turner and its programming competitors may be thought of as content \"wholesaler[s]\" in that they are typically reliant upon third-party video distributors to get their offerings to consumers in the downstream market. Tr. 612:3-4, 17-20 (Martin (Turner) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Most programmers make money in two primary ways, and Turner is no exception.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , programmers receive payments from distributors, known as \"affiliate fees,\" in exchange for granting distributors the rights to display the programmers' content.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 604:21-23, 610:20-23. Affiliate fees are memorialized in affiliate agreements, which specify the \"net effective rate\" a programmer charges for a network on a per-subscriber, per-month basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 987:5-17 (Breland (Turner) ). Rates typically increase year-over-year, pursuant to what are called \"escalator\" clauses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91:6-10 (Fenwick (Cox) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2728:19-23 (Katz). Affiliate fees have been \"going up\" over the past decade industrywide, due at least in part to rising costs of making \"higher quality\" content. Tr. 2562:9-2563:25 (Carlton);\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 1495:12-16 (Sutton (HBO) ) (\"So the cost it takes to make shows, shows like the shows we make, has escalated significantly.\"). Affiliate fees vary, however, based on the size of the distributor; specifically, in order to incentivize and reward wide distribution, programmers typically provide distributors with \"volume discounts\" on affiliate fees, meaning that the more subscribers a distributor has, the more a programmer's net effective rates will decline.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 987:25-988:13 (Breland (Turner) ) (explaining variance in rates between \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\" MVPDs and virtual MVPDs);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2911:21-23 (Holanda (RCN) ) (describing \"volume discounts\" of larger distributors); PX127-2 (showing rate differentials).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , and as any television viewer can attest, programmers sell advertising slots on their networks to advertisers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3179:23-3181:6 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). For decades, television advertising has followed the same playbook.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3086:9-10. During each hour of television, there are roughly eighteen minutes of advertisements.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 609:23-610:4 (Martin (Turner) ). Distributors sell advertisements for only two of those minutes; the programmer sells ads for the remaining sixteen minutes.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Advertising fees vary by the channel and the time of day an ad airs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 625:4-11. As with affiliate fees, the broader a program's audience, the more advertising revenue for Turner: as Chairman and CEO John Martin explained with regard to Turner's advertising strategy, \"our goal is to have our networks in front of as many eyeballs as possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 605:7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The classic model of television advertising is limited in two ways. First, in deciding the placement of commercials to be seen by a wide audience, programmers generally must rely on general demographic data, such as age range, about the typical audience for a given program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 625:4-6. Second, and as a result, programmers have no choice but to saturate all viewers of a program with the same, undifferentiated ads-despite knowing that the selected ad will be of little interest to some number of those viewers.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3087:1-8 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In the past, Turner's total revenues have been split roughly equally between affiliate fee revenues and advertising revenues.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3088:10-12; PX456-8. For present purposes, however, the key point is this: both the affiliate fee and advertising revenue streams depend upon broad distribution of programmers' networks to consumers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 604:17-18 (Martin (Turner) ) (\"I believe that distribution is\n   the most important variable for success for any programmer.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3078:17-20 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ) (\"Q: What are the key drivers of the Turner business? A: Well, the Turner business, first, we need to get it on every distribution platform so that we can have subscriber fees and advertising revenues.\"). For that reason, Turner executives aim to \"achieve wide distribution\" of their networks. Post-Trial Brief of the United States (\"Gov't Post-Tr. Br.\") 6 [Dkt. # 126];\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 3120:3-7 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ); (\"So we try everything to stay on all of our channels, Turner, HBO, everything, to keep them on there.

Like traditional MVPDs, virtual MVPDs distribute linear channels and on-demand content to subscribers for a subscription fee; unlike traditional MVPDs, virtual MVPDs offer their services over the internet, rather than through proprietary infrastructure such as satellite networks or cable lines. Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. Because they offer their services over the internet, virtual MVPDs offer service nationwide, either via the web or mobile apps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX8-18.

The Government's chief economic expert, Professor Carl Shapiro, recognized as much at trial.

If a negotiation is ultimately unsuccessful, the distributor will lose the rights to display the programmer's content to its customers-a situation known in the industry as a programming \"blackout,\" or \"going dark.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 129:4-9 (Fenwick (Cox) ). Blackouts have negative consequences for programmers and distributors alike. On the programming side, a blackout causes a programmer to suffer immediate (and unrecoverable) losses of both advertising and affiliate fee revenue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 1094:21-1096:18 (Breland (Turner) ). On the distributor side, a blackout may lead a distributor to lose subscribers or may prevent the distributor from attracting new subscribers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 119;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 864:12-23 (Rigdon (Comcast) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1348:3-7 (Montemagno (Charter) ) (discussing PX373). Because blackouts are almost always negative events for both programmers and distributors, \"at the end of the day ... [t]here's no benefit for anyone to walk away\" without an affiliate agreement. Tr. 89:23-90:4 (Fenwick (Cox) ). Therefore, bargains between programmers and distributors are almost always struck in order to avoid long-term blackouts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 138:13-15;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1027:4-7 (Breland (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1359:14-15 (Montemagno (Charter) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3124:4-7 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   That is not to say, however, that blackouts are irrelevant to the negotiating dynamic. Rather, in what can best be thought of as an elaborate and stylized Kabuki dance, the evidence shows that \"almost every negotiation\" involves both programmers and distributors threatening blackouts, especially when one side is seen as demanding terms that are out of line with the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1026:17-20 (Breland (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 376:22-377:11 (Schlichting (DISH) ). To better understand how to assign the \"right value\" to a particular deal, programmers and distributors might perform \"drop\" or \"go dark\" analyses to estimate the potential impact of a blackout on the programmer's advertising or affiliate fee revenues or on the distributor's customer base.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1343:11-16 (Montemagno (Charter) );\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 1348:3-10 (discussing PX373);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 862:19-863:3 (Rigdon (Comcast) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1029:10-1030:11 (Breland (Turner) ) (discussing PX144).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Nevertheless, given the negative consequences for both sides from a blackout, \"the reality\" is that \"virtually every\" bargaining impasse between a programmer and distributor \"is resolved after requiring either no blackout or a short-term blackout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2396:1-5 (Shapiro).

Industry Trends\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In recent years, traditional programmers, including Turner, and MVPDs, including DirecTV, have been faced with a number of interrelated industry trends that are particularly relevant to the challenged merger. I will review three of those trends in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Rise and Innovation of Over-the-Top, Vertically Integrated Video Content Services\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Traditional programmers and distributors are experiencing increased competition from innovative, over-the-top content services, including virtual MVPDs and SVODs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   p. 175 n.5. Those web-based companies are harnessing the power of the internet and data to provide lower-cost, better-tailored programming content directly to consumers. The dramatic growth of the leading SVODs in particular, including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, can be traced in part to the value conferred by vertical integration-that is, to having content creation and aggregation as well as content distribution under the same roof.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 3080:8-3085:21 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As relevant to the video programming and distribution market, vertical integration provides two notable advantages to content services. First, vertical integration reduces the \"bargaining friction\" inherent in the arm's-length affiliate negotiations that govern the exchange of rights between traditional programmers and distributors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 3104:18-3107:13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1684:25-1685:13 (York (AT &amp; T) ). As numerous witnesses discussed, bargaining friction refers to the difficulty inherent in assigning value to and negotiating over new, innovative content rights, like \"TV Everywhere,\" download rights, and \"4K\" high resolution.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1685:22-1686:7, 1688:6-13 (York (AT &amp; T) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3104:18-25 (Bewkes (Time Warner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3222:4-3223:2 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) ). AT &amp; T executive Daniel York testified, for example, that DirecTV has attempted, with limited success (and considerable delay), to obtain such rights from programmers through arm's length-negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1685:24-1686:22 (York (AT &amp; T) ). RCN CEO Jim Holanda joined York in discussing the way in which bargaining friction hindered RCN's negotiations over TV Everywhere rights.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2968:25-2971:14 (Holanda (RCN) ). Further, DirecTV Now's affiliate agreements require it to restrict the number of viewers who can stream or access programs simultaneously on its platform.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1687:10-14 (York (AT &amp; T) ). And when DirecTV floated the concept of \"DirecTV mobile\"-a pay-TV subscription exclusively for mobile devices-that was \"dead on arrival.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1687:15-25. By contrast, with control over the creation and use of large amounts of original content, SVODs have driven much of the recent innovation in the video programming and distribution industry.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1685:7-13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 639:1-8 (Martin (Turner) ).

SVODs are able to use that customer data to inform their strategy and improve the customer's experience in a number of ways.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3081:21-25 (Bewkes (Time Warner) );\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 3388:6-3389:8 (Stephenson (AT &amp; T) ). SVODs can use data about viewing habits to determine what programs are popular, and create more of that type of content.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2452:21-2453:3 (Carlton);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3245:16-20 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) ). In addition, data informs marketing decisions, and allows SVODs to recommend content to users based on their revealed preferences,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the shows they have watched in the past.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3080:19-3081:12 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). Even more, data can inform scheduling choices, and enhance efforts at recapturing consumers who disconnect.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3245:16-20 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3081:4-12 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). Finally,\n   and as discussed in more detail below, to the extent SVODs incorporate advertising into their platforms, data allows those ads to be more targeted and thus more lucrative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Declining MVPD Subscriptions Resulting from an Increasingly Competitive Industry Landscape\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   At trial, witness after witness acknowledged that MVPD subscriptions are on the decline.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 633:5-15 (Martin (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 891:18-22 (Rigdon (Comcast) ); 2229:21-22 (Shapiro); 3369:13-16 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3450:15-3451:1 (Stephenson (AT &amp; T) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX63-36.

Although counsel generally were successful in doing so, two notable pre-trial issues were brought to this Court for resolution. The first, which arose in mid-January, concerned the disclosure of third-party data collected in prior Government investigations and still in the Government's possession. The second flash point, which took place closer to trial, involved discovery requests in support of defendants' selective prosecution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In a January 18, 2018 letter and during a status hearing held the next day, defendants raised an issue related to the production of historical video programming pricing data in Government files-data that the Government had apparently obtained via prior merger investigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1/19/18 Hr'g Tr. 6:14-9:23 [Dkt. # 63].

Indeed, I set aside the first two days of the trial to address evidentiary issues. Not surprisingly, each side vacillated between arguing for exclusion of documents as prejudicial or irrelevant, on the one hand, or for admission of documents because such concerns are inapplicable in bench trials, on the other. While keenly aware of the principles governing evidentiary rulings in bench trials, in this case, I did not have the luxury of blanketly admitting a mass of documentary evidence and sorting through it after trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The compressed timeline and novel, complicated nature of the case instead necessitated that I make individualized rulings on relevance and admissibility.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Manual for Complex Litigation \u00a7 12.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   For this reason, I generally instructed the parties to seek admission of documents through sponsoring witnesses, in order to facilitate determinations of relevancy or to establish the foundation necessary for nonhearsay or hearsay exceptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Witnesses would be able to contextualize and explain the technical and lengthy documents at\n   issue, which might otherwise be misunderstood or selectively cited in post-trial briefs. As such, I instructed the parties to introduce documents through sponsoring witnesses, recognizing that doing so would extend, somewhat, the length of the trial. In the end, the parties agreed to abide by that approach.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 3/19/18 Hr'g Tr. 6:17-22 (afternoon session) (Government agrees to \"add[ ] some additional witness and [to] talk[ ] with the defendants about that with regard to sponsorship issues\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Of the fact witnesses, 11 were employees of defendants, and 9 were employees of third parties. The Government's chief economic expert was Professor Carl Shapiro. Professor Shapiro is a Ph.D. industrial economist who currently holds a professorship at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Shapiro has served in various positions in the federal government, including most recently as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economics at the Antitrust Division in 2009 through 2011 and as a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers in 2011 and 2012. He has testified in a number of antitrust matters, including several antitrust trials in our Circuit. The Government also called Professor John Hauser from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to testify about a survey he designed and performed and on which the Government relies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For their part, defendants called three expert and three fact witnesses. Chief among their experts was University of Chicago Professor Dennis Carlton, who provided rebuttal testimony to Professor Shapiro. Professor Carlton has served as an economics professor within the University of Chicago since 1976, teaching in the economics department, business school, and the law school. Like Professor Shapiro, Professor Carlton is a seasoned expert witness who himself has served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economics at the Antitrust Division from 2006 to 2008. Defendants also called Professor Michael Katz from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor Peter Rossi from the UCLA's Anderson School of Management. Defendants called Professor Katz to testify about the effect of arbitration and the FCC's program access rules, and called Professor Rossi to testify about survey methods and to rebut testimony concerning surveys and studies on which the Government relied. As their fact witnesses,\n   defendants called Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of AT &amp; T, to testify regarding their decision to merge. Defendants also called John Stankey, a senior executive at AT &amp; T responsible for planning and integration of the proposed merger. Stankey, who will be running Time Warner should the merger be allowed to occur, testified about the rationale for the merger as well as the synergies and efficiencies that would result from the merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Government's rebuttal case consisted of testimony from three experts. First, the Government called Ronald Quintero, an accounting and financial consultant, to testify as an expert witness on defendants' claims that the challenged merger will result in a number of procompetitive synergies. Next, the Government called Professor Susan Athey, an economics of technology professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, to testify regarding defendants' proffered \"content intelligence\" synergies. Finally, the Government closed out its rebuttal presentation by recalling Professor Shapiro to defend and further explain his case-in-chief testimony in the face of defendants' various criticisms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   To say the trial was well staffed would be an understatement. Thirty-two lawyers entered appearances for the Government, and 14 did so for defendants. Evidentiary disputes were handled on a case-by-case basis as issues arose. In order to accommodate the confidentiality interests of third parties, counsel agreed to craft their questions so as not to elicit sensitive business information, and, on three occasions, I had to close the courtroom to the public following factual proffers by the Government as to the need for doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total,\n   I admitted into evidence over 3,000 pages of documents, broken up into over 120 exhibits. The trial transcript itself exceeds 4,300 pages in length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   On May 3, 2018, a mere one week after the close of evidence, the parties filed their proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, totaling nearly 400 pages in length, as well as briefs that synthesized their arguments. On the last day of trial, I advised the parties that it would issue a ruling by June 12, 2018 in order to avoid running afoul of the defendants' merger deadline of June 21, 2018 and to provide the losing party sufficient time to preserve its appellate rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

I will thus accept the Government's proposed product and geographic markets for purposes of this case, and briefly discuss the basics of those markets-as well as the role of the product market as it relates to my analysis of the Government's claims of harm-below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Product Market.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The Government's\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   product market is the market for multichannel video distribution. Multichannel video distribution, as defined by the Government, involves the distribution of live, or \"linear,\" video programming networks, as well as on-demand content, to subscribing consumers. Gov't PFOF \u00b6 31; Trial Br. of the United States (\"Gov't Pre-Tr. Br.\") 22 [Dkt. # 76]. As relevant here, the sellers in that product market are: 1) MVPDs, including cable television providers, such as Comcast, Cox, and Charter;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   direct broadcast satellite providers, such as DirecTV and DISH, which operate nationally; telecommunications providers, or \"telcos,\" such as Verizon Fios and AT &amp; T's U-verse; and overbuilders, such as RCN; and 2) virtual MVPDs, including Sony's Playstation Vue, Hulu Live, Google's YouTube TV, DirecTV Now, and DISH's Sling. As discussed, virtual MVPDs provide the same live-TV services as do traditional MVPDs, but do so over the internet rather than by way of a dedicated transmission path that they control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 15. Although the majority of U.S. households (approximately 90 million) currently receive linear video programming through traditional MVPDs,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p24\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and a majority are likely to continue to do so, there is no debating that the number of MVPD subscribers is \"declining unequivocally\" as consumers increasingly turn to virtual MVPDs and SVODs for their video content needs. Tr. 3451:22-23 (Stephenson (AT &amp; T) );\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 3449:12-3451:1 (\"DirecTV lost 1.2 million subscribers in 2017.

Importantly, however, accepting the Government's proposed product market does not mean that Turner's position in the upstream programming market is irrelevant to evaluating the Government's theories of harm in this case. Nor does it require this Court to ignore the rising role of SVODs in the broader multichannel video programming and distribution market. That is because the Government's proffered increased-leverage theory, not to mention its other theories of harm, incorporates those factors in at least three different ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , as will become clear in the ensuing discussion, examining the importance of Turner's content to distributors in the upstream programming market is a necessary (but not sufficient) step in evaluating the Government's increased-leverage theory.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 69-102 (proposing findings of fact to support assertion that the \"merger would enable AT &amp; T to harm competition because MVPDs and virtual MPVDs need Turner content to compete effectively\").\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the bargaining model from which the Government's measures of consumer harm are derived itself accounts for the increasing role of SVODs and \"cord cutting\" in the market, as those trends affect the amount of benefits that AT &amp; T could expect to receive under the Government's increased-leverage theory.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 2242:2-18 (Shapiro) (discussing role of \"cord cutting\" in calculating the bargaining model's \"diversion rate\" input);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2504:11-2506:24 (Carlton) (explaining why cord cutting \"matters a lot\" to bargaining model).\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   and finally, the Government\n   has argued that certain documents reflect an intent on the part of defendants to use the proposed merger to act consistently with the Government's increased-leverage theory of harm, among other theories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PCOL \u00b6 51 (stating, in relation to \"[d]efendants' internal documents,\" that \"[e]vidence of anticompetitive intent can also form the basis of a court's prediction of harm\"). To appropriately evaluate the strength of such evidence, however, I must be able to put it in the context of other documents and statements related to the various rationales for the proposed merger including, of most relevance here, defendants' asserted desire to compete with SVODs and other technology companies amid \"the ongoing revolution in video programming and distribution.\" Defs.' PFOF \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3079:18-3080:2 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). Therefore, although the Government is of course correct that the refrain \" 'we are getting killed by new competition in different markets' \" is no \"defense to an illegal merger,\" Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 21, I simply cannot evaluate the Government's theories and predictions of harm, as presented by the Government at trial, without factoring in the dramatic changes that are transforming how consumers view video content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Geographic Markets\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   The Government has identified over 1,100 local multichannel video distribution markets as the relevant geographic markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 41. These local markets, which the Government calls \"Local Footprint Overlap Zones,\" represent each local geographic area in which \"residents have access to video offerings from the same set of MVPD competitors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2187:3-25 (Shapiro). The localized geographic markets reflect the reality that, due to limitations of the physical transmission paths maintained by many of the providers in the multichannel video distribution market, the mix of MVPDs and virtual MVPDs available to a consumer varies based upon where that consumer lives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 40. As such, the Government contends that the asserted \"effects of the proposed merger\" will vary depending \"on the market shares of the various MVPDs and virtual MVPDs in [a] region,\" and that analyzing the local markets is therefore appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government has not relied upon harm in any particular local market as the basis for enjoining the merger, however. Instead, the Government's expert \"aggregated\" all of the alleged harms in the local markets in order to derive a total measure of nationwide economic harm. Gov't PFOF 13 (\"Relevant downstream geographic markets are local, but they can be aggregated for analytical convenience.\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2255:1-2256:15 (Shapiro) (providing aggregate estimates of consumer harm nationwide).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The proposed merger is no exception. Indeed, the Government concedes that this case implicates one \"standard benefit\" associated with vertical mergers: the elimination of double marginalization (\"EDM\"). Tr. 2438:6 (Carlton); Gov't PFOF \u00b6 222.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   As relevant here (and at the risk of oversimplifying things), double marginalization refers to the situation in which two different firms in the same industry, but at different levels in the supply chain, each apply their own markups (reflecting their own margins) in pricing their products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2251:15-25 (Shapiro). Those \"stacked\" margins are both incorporated into the final price that consumers have to pay for the end product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2251:24. By vertically integrating two such firms into one, the merged company is able to \"shrink that total margin so there's one instead of two,\" leading to lower prices for consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2252:1-3. EDM is, therefore, procompetitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   In the context of a Time Warner and AT &amp; T combination, EDM will play out as follows. Prior to the merger, AT &amp; T must pay Time Warner a certain price to display Turner content to its DirecTV customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2251:19-25. The price that AT &amp; T pays includes Time Warner's profit margin, that is, an amount over and above the marginal cost of the programming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the vertical integration of AT &amp; T and Time Warner, however, AT &amp; T will no longer need to pay Turner's profit margin to display Turner content.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2252:1-3;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2438:9-15 (Carlton). In effect, that means that AT &amp; T's marginal cost of licensing Turner content will be lower, which in turn renders distribution of Turner to its DirecTV customers more profitable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2438:13-15 (Carlton). With its profits increased, AT &amp; T would have the \"incentive to get more customers and in particular AT &amp; T's price, the DirecTV price will go down to consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2438:16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   According to the Government's expert, Professor Shapiro, EDM would result in AT &amp; T lowering the price for DirecTV by a \"significant\" amount: $1.20 per-subscriber, per-month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2252:6-7 (Shapiro).

In other words, to understand whether the proposed merger will harm consumers, Professor Shapiro explained, it is necessary to \"balance\" whether the Government's asserted harms outweigh the merger's conceded consumer benefits. Tr. 2180:24, 2181:1-6 (Shapiro);\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2182:11-21 (\"So I'm going to need to trade those off. This is somewhat different than horizontal merger analysis. We're talking about vertical merger analysis here.\"). With that important principle in mind, I will now examine whether the Government has met its burden under Section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Government Has Failed to Meet Its Burden to Show That the Proposed Merger Is Likely to Substantially Lessen Competition by Increasing Turner's Bargaining Leverage in Affiliate Negotiations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The Government's primary theory of harm to competition focuses on the challenged merger's integration of Turner's important video content-content that includes, among other things, the networks CNN, TNT, and TBS-with AT &amp; T's video distributors, U-verse and DirecTV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Government contends that, should the challenged merger proceed, Turner's relationship with AT &amp; T will enable Turner to extract greater prices from AT &amp; T's rival distributors for its \"must-have\" content than it could without the merger.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-38. The Government argues that distributors would then pass on those price increases to their subscribers, resulting in an increase of hundreds of millions of dollars in annual consumer payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39; Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 231-232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   According to the Government, it carried its burden to support its increased-leverage theory of harm to competition by offering what it refers to as \"real-world objective\n   evidence\"-namely, statements contained within defendants' prior regulatory filings and internal business documents as well as testimony from third-party competitor witnesses. Gov't PCOL \u00b6 21. To further corroborate its increased-leverage theory and predict the consumer harm that would be generated, the Government also relied on testimony and economic modeling proffered by Professor Carl Shapiro. Professor Shapiro opined that a post-merger Turner would be able to extract greater affiliate fees from distributors due to increased bargaining leverage Turner would gain on account of its relationship with AT &amp; T. Citing the results of his economic models, Professor Shapiro predicts that such increased leverage would lead to total, annual consumer harms that outweigh the conceded $352 million in annual cost savings that the proposed merger would generate for AT &amp; T's customers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 2253:4-15 (Shapiro).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Not surprisingly, the defendants vigorously disagree with the Government's increased-leverage theory of harm. To start, defendants argue that the Government has failed to put forward any \"meaningful real-world evidence\" to support the premise that a post-merger Turner would benefit from increased bargaining leverage with distributors on account of its relationship with AT &amp; T. Defs.' PFOF \u00b6 81. If anything, defendants argue, analysis of real-world pricing data demonstrates that prior instances of vertical integration in this industry have not produced the increased-leverage effects that the Government predicts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-102. Defendants also challenge Professor Shapiro's testimony, arguing that it lacks sufficient basis in the facts of this industry and reflects results based on a model riddled with improper inputs and faulty assumptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-94, 105, 111-13, 188, 204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   In evaluating these competing contentions, the Court unfortunately does not have the luxury of looking to judicial precedents applying the increased-leverage theory in the context of a Section 7 challenge to a vertical merger. Indeed, the Government has not pointed to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   prior trials in federal district court in which the Antitrust Division has successfully used this increased-leverage theory to block a proposed vertical merger as violative of Section 7.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2390:2-4 (Shapiro) (noting, with respect to proffered economic bargaining model, that \"[w]hat's less common is to use it to evaluate a merger or a vertical merger especially\"); Defs.' PCOL \u00b6 32. Thus, in this matter of first impression, I must determine whether the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient to support the Government's assertion that Turner will likely gain increased bargaining leverage in affiliate negotiations on account of the proposed merger and, if so, whether any increased distributor or consumer costs stemming from the increased bargaining leverage will result in a substantial lessening of competition under Section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Having heard and considered the evidence adduced at trial, I conclude that the Government has failed to clear the first hurdle of showing that the proposed merger is likely to increase Turner's bargaining leverage in affiliate negotiations; I thus need not consider the separate legal question of whether any effects associated with the Government's increased-leverage theory would result in a substantial lessening of competition for purposes of the Clayton Act's prohibitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before explaining that\n   conclusion, I need to briefly review the basics of affiliate negotiations and the Government's increased-leverage theory of harm. With that background established, I will examine the evidence put forward by the Government to support its argument that the challenged merger would likely increase Turner's bargaining leverage with distributors and thereby enable it to secure greater affiliate fees than it could without the merger. Ultimately, as I will explain, the Government's proof at trial falls\n   <em>\n    far\n   </em>\n   short of establishing the validity of its increased-leverage theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background of Increased-Leverage Theory of Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   As previously discussed, the terms under which distributors may license and display programmers' content are set through a \"very tough\" series of affiliate negotiations. Tr. 1023:2 (Breland (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 170-73. As with any type of bargaining, each party to an affiliate negotiation attempts to take advantage of its points of leverage, and \"reaching a deal in the end can come down to a battle of the competing bargaining leverages.\" Tr. 1025:20-22 (Breland (Turner) ); Gov't PFOF \u00b6 154. In the event an affiliate negotiation is unsuccessful, the distributor will lose the rights to display the programmer's content to its customers. Such a situation is known in the industry as a programming \"blackout,\" or \"going dark.\" Tr. 129:4-9 (Fenwick (Cox) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Blackouts have significant, if not \"catastrophic,\" negative consequences for programmers-in the form of lost advertising and affiliate fee revenues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1128:7-12 (Breland (Turner) ); Defs.' PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 76-77. Distributors, for their part, may lose subscribers.\n   <em>\n    See generally, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 2197:4-2198:2 (Shapiro). In \"almost every negotiation,\" therefore, programmers and distributors threaten blackouts in an attempt to gain concessions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1026:17-1027:3 (Breland (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 367:1-22, 376:22-377:11 (Schlichting (DISH) ). Given that blackouts are negative events for both programmers and distributors, however, deals between programmers and distributors are invariably struck in order to avoid long-term blackouts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 138:13-15 (Fenwick (Cox) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1027:4-7 (Breland (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1359:14-15 (Montemagno (Charter) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3124:4-7 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). Indeed, when it comes to Turner, the record shows that there has\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   been a long-term blackout of the Turner networks.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2357:12-14 (Shapiro) (\"Q: But to be sure there's never been a long-term blackout of Turner, right? A: No\n   ....\"); Defs.' PFOF \u00b6 94. That fact is by no means lost on either side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   That background brings us to the Government's increased-leverage theory. Notably, under that theory, the Government does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege that a post-merger Turner would be incentivized to start\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   engaging in long-term blackouts with distributors. That is so, as Professor Shapiro concedes, because withholding Turner content would not be \"profitable\" to the merged entity given the attendant losses in significant advertising and affiliate fee revenues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2293:9-17 (Shapiro). In other words, and in contrast to a prevalent theory of vertical merger antitrust harm, Turner will not \"foreclose\" downstream distributors from accessing Turner content.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2218:15-16 (\"This is not a foreclosure-withholding story.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown Shoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168106\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/294/#p323\">\n    370 U.S. at 323-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168106\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/294/#p323\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[t]he primary vice of a vertical merger or other arrangement tying a customer to a supplier is that, by foreclosing the competitors of either party from a segment of the market otherwise open to them, the arrangement may act as a clog on competition\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Instead, the Government's increased-leverage theory of harm posits that Turner's bargaining position in affiliate negotiations would improve after the merger due to its relationship with AT &amp; T. That is so, the Government argues, because Turner and its distributor counterparties would recognize that, should Turner fail to strike a deal and engage in a long-term blackout with a distributor, Turner would no longer face the mere downside of losing affiliate fees and advertising revenues.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 1-2. Rather, some of those losses would be offset, according to the Government, by new benefits to AT &amp; T's video distribution companies via the following chain of events: 1) some of the rival distributor's customers would depart or fail to join the distributor due to the missing Turner content; 2) some portion of those lost customers would choose to sign up with AT &amp; T's video distributors (which would have Turner); and 3) AT &amp; T would profit from those gained subscribers.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2197:15-2198:12 (Shapiro). As a result, the Government predicts that Turner's downside position in the event of a blackout would improve as a result of the proposed merger. That improved downside position, according to the Government, would in turn enable Turner to demand higher prices for its content in post-merger affiliate fee negotiations with distributors-price increases that would ultimately be passed on to consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   At trial, the Government relied on two primary categories of evidence to support its increased-leverage theory of harm. First, it offered so-called \"real-world objective evidence\"-namely, statements contained within defendants' prior regulatory filings and internal business documents as well as testimony from third-party competitor witnesses. Gov't PCOL 21. Second, the Government called an expert, Professor Carl Shapiro, to testify about its increased-leverage theory, which is based on an economic theory of bargaining known as the Nash bargaining theory, and to estimate the consumer harm associated with the increased-leverage theory. Gov't PFOF \u00b6 201. For the following reasons, neither category of evidence was effective in proving the Government's increased-leverage theory. Accordingly, as to this theory, the Government has failed to meet its burden of proof to show that the merger is likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Government's So-Called \"Real-World Objective Evidence\" Is Insufficient to Support Its Increased-Leverage Theory of Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   To support its increased-leverage theory of harm, the Government first points to various pieces of the so-called \"real-world objective evidence\" it offered at trial. Gov't PCOL 21. That evidence primarily consisted of defendants' ordinary course-of-business documents and excerpts of regulatory filings submitted by defendants in prior administrative proceedings, as well as the testimony of third-party witnesses from AT &amp; T's rival distribution companies. Of particular importance here, the Government's so-called real-world evidence was directed at explaining and establishing two main concepts. First, the Government sought to establish the importance of Turner content to distributors and the resulting leverage Turner enjoys in affiliate fee negotiations. Second, the Government relied on this so-called \"real-world objective evidence\" to substantiate its prediction that Turner's leverage with distributors would\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   as a result of Turner's post-merger relationship with AT &amp; T. Neither, however, provided persuasive support for the Government's increased-leverage theory of harm. How so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Evidence Regarding the Popularity of Turner Content Is of Limited Probative Value in Evaluating the Contention That Turner Will Gain Increased Leverage Due to the Proposed Merger\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   At trial, much time was spent debating the \"must-have\" status of Turner's programming content. According to the Government, distributors literally \" 'must have' \" Turner's content in order \"to compete effectively\" in the video distribution industry. Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (\"Distributors don't just want this specific input to compete effectively, they truly need it.\"); Gov't PFOF 23 (similar). Defendants countered that the term \"must have\" is simply a marketing phrase used to mean \"popular\" and, similarly, that Turner content is not actually necessary to allow distributors to operate their businesses successfully.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' PFOF \u00b6 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Based on the evidence, I agree with defendants that Turner's content is not\n   <em>\n    literally\n   </em>\n   \"must have\" in the sense that distributors cannot effectively compete without it. The evidence showed that distributors have successfully operated, and continue to operate, without the Turner networks or similar programming.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Tr. 351:5-25 (Schlichting (DISH) ) (discussing fact that DISH's virtual MVPD, Sling, offers packages without broadcast stations and CBS); PX144-121 (listing \"[p]ast [n]etwork [d]rops\" by distributors). Indeed, Stefan Bewley. a consultant who generated a slide deck with recommendations for Charter's use in evaluating its relationships with programmers, indicated that \"Charter would be better off and would save a lot of money [by] canceling Turner.\" Tr. 1336:10-12 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) ). Sling President Warren Schlichting acknowledged DISH founder and chairman Charlie Ergen made similar statements to the investment community.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 365:17-366:1 (Schlichting (DISH) ) (conceding that Ergen stated in investor call that a Turner blackout would be \"slightly cash positive for us from a cash-flow perspective\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   I therefore give little credit to blanket statements by third-party competitor witnesses indicating that the entire \"viability of [their] video model\" could depend on whether they offer Turner programming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128:21 (Fenwick (Cox) );\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 697:2-19 (Hinson (Cox) ) (claiming that, without Turner, Cox would lack \"the ability to compete\" and that their customers would \"go somewhere else\"). Such statements were largely unaccompanied by any sort of factual analyses or, worse, contradicted\n   by real-world examples from the witnesses themselves.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 128:22-129:20 (Fenwick (Cox) ) (neither she nor others at Cox had done analysis of potential subscriber losses in Turner blackout);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2947:1-13 (Holanda (RCN) ) (\"Q: And so today, you're not offering this Court any empirical data or any real-world evidence of subscriber losses if RCN didn't have Turner, right?

Indeed, the evidence indicated that the term \"must have\" is a marketing phrase used by virtually every programmer to suggest that its content is popular with viewers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 549:19-20 (Martin (Turner) ) (\" 'Must have' is another way of saying, we have popular programming.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 899:13-16 (Rigdon (Comcast) ) (agreeing that \"must have is just a term of art that means something is popular\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1092:18-24 (Breland (Turner) ) (\"[M]ust have means it's popular .... I don't in a literal sense mean that I must have this content or I can't be successful.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2130:23-2131:6 (Sejen (Cable ONE) ) (agreeing that he would \"expect to hear\" all programmers pitch their content as \"must-have\" and that he would \"kind of take that with a grain of salt\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   That said, I do nonetheless accept the Government's contention that Turner has popular content-especially live sporting events and live news-and, as a result, enjoys bargaining leverage with distributors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 70-102 (summarizing evidence regarding Turner's importance to distributors);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103-177 (summarizing evidence supporting proposition that \"Turner's valuable content gives it leverage in negotiations\" with distributors). Importantly, however, accepting that straightforward proposition-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that popular programmers such as Turner are able to demand more for their content than less popular programmers-does not prove that the challenged\n   <em>\n    merger\n   </em>\n   would harm competition pursuant to the Government's increased-leverage theory of harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   To prove its increased-leverage theory, in other words, it is not sufficient for the Government to put forward evidence that Turner has important content and thus bargaining leverage-that fact is true today, pre-merger. Rather, the Government's increased-leverage theory posits that Turner's pre-merger bargaining leverage would materially increase as a result of its post-merger relationship with AT &amp; T and that, as a result, distributors would cede greater affiliate fees than they would absent the merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   To support that contention at trial, the Government primarily relied on defendants' own statements and documents as well as testimony of third-party competitor witnesses, most (but not all) of whom expressed concern regarding the challenged merger's potential effects on their businesses. Neither category of evidence, however, is persuasive in proving that Turner's post-merger negotiating position would materially increase based on its ownership by AT &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Own Statements and Documents Provide Little Support for the Contention That Turner Will Gain Increased Leverage Due to the Proposed Merger\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   According to the Government, defendants' own prior statements and ordinary course business documents \"recognize that vertical integration poses a threat to competition\" and, thus, provide convincing support for the Government's bargaining leverage claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 47-58. The Government points to statements made by defendants in the context of prior regulatory proceedings, and statements contained in internal documents such as slide decks and emails created by various individuals within the defendant companies. Neither category, however, was of any particular probative value. How so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   As a general matter, the Government is undoubtedly correct that \"ordinary course-of-business documents, including those generated by the defendants,\" can be probative of whether a proposed merger is likely to result in competitive harm. Gov't PCOL \u00b6 49. But as with any other piece of documentary evidence, assessing the probative value of defendants' own documents and statements requires an examination of the context, circumstances, and foundation of the proffered evidence. As such, with few exceptions, the Court denied the Government's requests to admit into evidence and cite in post-trial briefing a number of company documents for which there was no accompanying background or foundation testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 186-87 &amp; nn. 11-13. With the benefit of foundational testimony, I have considered all of the documentary and testimonial evidence from defendants' files and witnesses upon which the Government relied at trial. Having done so, I nonetheless conclude that the proffered statements and documents admitted are of such marginal probative value that they cannot bear the weight the Government seeks to place on them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Government argues that defendants' statements \"made in external filings with governmental authorities\" are evidence of defendants' \"understanding of the anticompetitive effects that result from this transaction.\" Gov't PCOL \u00b6 52. The statements in particular upon which the Government relies were made, either in comments or supporting expert reports filed by AT &amp; T or DirecTV, in the course of the following FCC proceedings: 1) the 2010 review of the Comcast-NBCU merger,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX1 (DirecTV); PX441 (DirecTV); 2) the 2012 proceeding to determine,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , whether to allow one of the FCC's program access rules to sunset,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX2 (AT &amp; T); PX442 (AT &amp; T); PX443 (DirecTV); 3) the 2014 annual video competition proceeding,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX444 (AT &amp; T); and 4) the 2014 review of the AT &amp; T-DirecTV merger,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX467 (AT &amp; T and DirecTV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not surprisingly, the Government contends that these prior statements show that defendants have previously recognized the validity of applying its increased-leverage theory to affiliate fee negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 2. But with that said: so what? Although I agree that a few of the proffered statements might be somewhat probative of the Government's increased-leverage theory, that limited probative value cannot, and does not, overcome the numerous insufficiencies with the Government's case discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   In particular, in examining defendants' prior regulatory filing statements, I am mindful of the considerations discussed in the context of the third-party competitor testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   pp. 210-15. When AT &amp; T and DirecTV made many of the proffered regulatory filings, they acted as competitors to (or customers of) distributors whose competitive positions would be affected by FCC review. For that reason\n   alone, I am hesitant to assign any significant evidentiary value to those prior regulatory filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Finally, with respect to this particular categories of statements, I particularly decline to place much stock in the statements related to the sunsetting of the FCC's ban on exclusive contracting between certain programmers and distributors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX2. PX442. Many of those statements relate to the issue of withholding content-something the Government's own expert concedes would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   occur as a result of the proposed merger.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   PX2-4 (\"[V]ertically integrated programmers continue to have the incentive and ability to use (and indeed have used whenever and wherever they can) that control as a weapon to hinder competition to their down-stream cable affiliates\n   <em>\n    by withholding popular programming from competing MVPDs\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2218:13-17 (Shapiro) (\"I'm not saying that after the merger, Turner will deny its content to the other distributors.\n   <em>\n    This is not a foreclosure-withholding story\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added). Generic statements about \"mushroom[ing]\" bargaining power of all programmers are similarly unhelpful to evaluating the Government's particular claims in this case. PX444-3 to -4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   That brings us to select statements made by DirecTV or AT &amp; T that relate to vertically integrated programmers' ability to raise content prices and the use of the Nash bargaining model to estimate increased affiliate fees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX1-17, -83 (\"[V]ertical integration of programming and distribution can, if left unchecked, give the integrated entity the incentive and ability to gain an unfair advantage over its rivals.\"); PX441-5 (noting \"voluminous economic and other evidence that the proposed transaction would enable Comcast to raise the prices paid by its MVPD rivals for NBCU programming\"); PX443-79 (\"[V]ertically integrated MVPDs have an incentive to charge higher license fees for programming that is particularly effective in gaining MVPD subscribers than do non-vertically integrated MVPDs.\"). According to the Government, those statements show that defendants recognize the validity of applying\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   bargaining model to estimate the impact of AT &amp; T and Time Warner's vertical integration on affiliate fee negotiations. Please !\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Generic statements that vertical integration \"can\" allow the integrated entity to gain an \"unfair advantage over its rivals,\" PX1-17 (emphasis added), do not come close to answering the question before the Court in relation to the Government's increased-leverage theory: whether the Government has carried its Section 7 burden to show, through proof at trial, that Time Warner will gain increased bargaining leverage in affiliate negotiations on account of the proposed merger and, if so, whether that increased bargaining leverage would result in increased distributor or consumer costs that would constitute a substantial lessening of competition under Section 7.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Applications of Comcast Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20FCC%20Rcd%204238\">\n    26 FCC Rcd. 4238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6 24 (2011) (noting differences in FCC's \"public interest\" review and DOJ's burden for \"block[ing] a transaction\" under Section 7 ). Similarly, the arguments that the Comcast-NBCU merger would harm distributors or consumers (as well the projections of harm) were, of course, informed by the state of the market at the time of the proceeding and the particular inputs to the models presented to the FCC.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20FCC%20Rcd%204238\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   app. B (Technical Appendix) (setting out various formulae and inputs used to model potential economic harm). Given all that, defendants' specific predictions regarding the ability of a merged Comcast-NBCU to leverage price increases by threatening to withhold the particular programming at issue is not particularly probative of whether a merged AT &amp; T-Time Warner could do the same with its programming in\n   today's more competitive marketplace.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41 (\"We do not determine at this time whether online video competes with MVPD services.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 14-18 (detailing role of virtual MVPDs in \"distribut[ing] linear channels and on demand content to subscribers over the internet\"). Moreover, as discussed in more detail below, defendants' expert Professor Carlton concluded in an econometric analysis of content pricing following the Comcast-NBCU merger that, contrary to the predictions offered by competitors in the regulatory filings, the merger did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   cause content prices to increase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   pp. 215-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   That said, the Court agrees with the Government that the fact that defendants previously submitted expert reports or commentary sponsoring the use of the Nash bargaining model in the context of affiliate fee negotiations counts as a mark (albeit a faint one) against defendants' attempts to disavow the applicability of the Nash bargaining theory in this case. Unfortunately for the Government, however, my conclusion that the Government has failed to provide sufficient evidentiary support to show the Nash bargaining theory accurately reflects post-merger affiliate negotiations or the proffered bargaining model in this case does not turn on defendants' protestations that the theory is \"preposterous,\" \"ridiculous,\" or \"absurd.\" Gov't PFOF \u00b6 47 (quoting Tr. 50:18 (Defs.' Opening);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3119:19-24 (Bewkes (Time Warner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3430:1-11 (Stephenson (AT &amp; T) ). It rests instead on my evaluation of the shortcomings in the proffered third-party competitor testimony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   pp. 210-15; the testimony about the complex nature of these negotiations and the low likelihood of a long-term Turner blackout,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   pp. 170-73, 222-24 &amp; nn.34-36; and the fact that real-world pricing data and the experiences of individuals who have negotiated on behalf of vertically integrated entities all fail to support the Government's increased-leverage theory,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   pp. 214-15. Therefore, even assigning\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   probative weight to the statements made by defendants in prior regulatory proceedings, those statements do not come close to providing a sufficient evidentiary basis to prove the viability of the Government's increased-leverage theory in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , to prove its increased-leverage theory, the Government relies upon random statements from defendants' \"ordinary course\" business documents, including employees' emails and internal slide decks. Indeed, the Government even featured many such statements (or, more accurately, snippets of such statements) in its Complaint and pre-trial filings. However, as became clear at trial, when live witnesses take the stand a trial by slide deck leaves much to be desired!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Exemplary of this problem is a series of Government exhibits containing emails and drafts of slide decks generated prior to a merger integration meeting in 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX31; PX184; PX189; PX363. The Government has emphasized statements excerpted from those slide decks, contending before, during, and after trial that they highlight AT &amp; T's \"core belief\" that the merger would help it preserve the role of \"[t]raditional Pay-TV\" as a \"cash cow business to AT &amp; T for many years to come\" by ensuring \"stability through the slow, structural decline of the industry.\" PX363-12 to -13;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 3 (\"As AT &amp; T/DirecTV's strategic merger documents state, after the merger, disruption need not occur immediately-the merged firm 'can operate [its] pay-TV business as a 'cash cow' while slowly pivoting to new models.\"); Gov't Pre-Tr. Br. 2-3 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   At trial, however, we learned that those statements were drafted by a lower-level AT &amp; T employee who had nothing to do with the substance of the decision to acquire Time Warner,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1777:16-1778:3 (Manty (AT &amp; T) ), and in any event, were contained in a preliminary draft and were subsequently removed or changed,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 1732:25-1733:25. To be sure, Government counsel endeavored to characterize that subsequent change as a nefarious \"sanitization\" by lawyers; but testimony indicated that the \"whole deck changed\" as a result of the parlor room process and its attendant legal review.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1738:7-13, 1744:8-13.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   PX363 (Apr. 8, 2017),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   PX31 (Apr. 9, 2017),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   PX189 (Apr. 18, 2017). In the final analysis, no upper-level AT &amp; T witness testified to ever having viewed or otherwise relied on the draft statements. To say the least, their probative value was minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   As it turned out, much of the Government's proffered \"ordinary course\" evidence went the way of those draft slide deck statements.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1713:20-23, 1714:3-6 (Gibson (AT &amp; T) ) (confirming that internal AT &amp; T documents stated that \"NBCU could become a more formidable negotiating power\" and that \"[c]ontent costs could increase\" as a result of the expiration of the Comcast-NBCU consent decree) (internal quotation marks omitted),\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   at 1712:14, 25, 1714:1-2, 9-10 (testifying that the document in question represents a \"draft understanding of some pretty complicated merger conditions\" designed to \"brainstorm the what-ifs\" of what Comcast-NBCU \"may be able to do\" that the team \"hadn't finished\"),\n   <em>\n    and id.\n   </em>\n   at 1715:20-21, 1717:17-18 (email chain, PX11, contains \"first very rough understanding of\" Comcast-NBCU merger conditions by \"individual who reported to me regarding merger conditions for the first time\").\n   <em>\n    See also id.\n   </em>\n   at 1770:25-1771:12, 1772:16-25 (Manty (AT &amp; T) ) (showing that PX184, although sent to two AT &amp; T senior vice presidents in July 2016, was generated in 2014 by team of lower-level AT &amp; T employees and consulting firm members). I need not recount all of the examples here. Suffice it to say that I find that the Government frequently \"overemphasized the importance and relevance\" of the excerpts from defendants' documents, given that many of them, the testimony revealed, contained \"informal speculation\" about \"rationales for the merger\" or were generated by individuals \"who had no decision-making role or authority in relation to the merger.\"\n   <em>\n    H &amp; R Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130667\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/36/#p49\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   77 n.30 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Dep't of Justice &amp; Fed.

The Government pointed, for example, to an email that Stephenson sent upon being informed by Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes that \"Time Warner had 'taken a 10% stake in Hulu' and that Hulu was going to launch a virtual MVPD.\" Gov't PFOF \u00b6 51 (alteration omitted) (quoting PX47). In response to Bewkes' statement that he did not think the announcement would impact AT &amp; T's relationship with Time Warner, Stephenson stated that it was \"hard to imagine how it won't impact all of our relationships,\" continuing that AT &amp; T is \"trying to figure out how we navigate a very new world where you folks are going around us while trying to preserve the old revenue streams and business models from us.\" PX47. At trial, Stephenson testified that his email indicated his concern that DirecTV Now, the new virtual MVPD AT &amp; T was \"standing ... up\" at around that same time, would get the \"same access\" as one of its virtual competitors, Hulu. Tr. 3475:21-22, 3477:6-7. In this Court's view, expressing concern about how a rival virtual MVPD's relationship with Time Warner could affect AT &amp; T's nascent DirecTV Now platform does little to prove how AT &amp; T would likely behave in the event of a vertical integration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The Government also relies on notes that Stephenson drafted to himself in preparation for an AT &amp; T Board of Directors Meeting to discuss the merger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 52. In those notes, Stephenson listed the following as a discussion point: \"How can you advantage your own distribution (TV, BB, Wireless) without harming TW position as a wide distributor of content to other SVOD, cable networks, and broadcast networks.\" DX609-8. The Government argues that this bullet point reflects \"exactly the theory of the government's case: use content to advantage distribution.\" Tr. 3980:4-5 (Gov't Closing);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. Not so. At trial, Stephenson testified credibly that the point of that note was to frame a discussion with his Board \"that if there is a thought process that says we're going to use this content to enhance the distribution business, that means you're going to have to limit the distribution\" and that \"is\n   counter is how you create value in one of these businesses.\" Tr. 3407:16-21. That testimony mirrors the contents of a letter sent by Stephenson to all AT &amp; T officers shortly after the announcement of the proposed merger. In that letter, known among those in defendant companies as the \" 'Magna Carta' \" of the merger, Stephenson writes \"[t]o Time Warner employees: We will continue to distribute Time Warner content broadly across the industry. In fact, we want to extend its distribution deeper into mobile so all wireless companies become distribution points for Time Warner content.\" DX625-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3408:16-22 (Stephenson (AT &amp; T) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   To be sure, the Government impugns Stephenson's explanation, calling it \"curious\" and credulity \"strain[ing]\" in light of the testimony given about the other notes on the same page.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 53; Tr. 3980:21, 3981:9 (Gov't Closing). But even should I fail to credit Stephenson's explanation about that particular pre-Board-meeting bullet point, the contents of that bullet point fail to meaningfully advance the Government's case. To start, as we learned at trial, there are a number of ways in which AT &amp; T could \"advantage [its] own distribution\" through use of Time Warner content without acting in accordance with the Government's increased-leverage theory of anticompetitive harm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 3220:21-3221:20 (re-stacking and re-editing personalized sets of CNN news clips for access on mobile devices);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3222:4-22 (shooting, producing, and broadcasting live sporting events in 4K resolution);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3223:13-3224:4 (integration of social media and multi-screen functionality with content).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   In short, despite the Government's efforts to paint a contrary picture, this is not a case containing direct, probative evidence of anticompetitive intent on the part of high-level executives within the merging company.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whole Foods Mkt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573992,3953017\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1028/\">\n    548 F.3d at 1044-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tatel, J., concurring in the judgment) (discussing \"Project Goldmine,\" as well as other merger-related documents, in which Whole Foods CEO stated, among other things, that company to be acquired is the \"only existing ... springboard for another player to get into this space\" and that \"[e]liminating\" the company \"means eliminating this threat forever, or almost forever\"). Stephenson's statements and the Government's other proffered documentary evidence instead suggest, at the very most, that AT &amp; T (or its third-party consultants) recognized that one\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of uniting content and distribution would be to withhold or otherwise limit content from other distributors in an attempt to benefit AT &amp; T's distribution platforms. But evidence indicating defendants' recognition that it could be possible to act in accordance with the Government's theories of harm is a far cry from evidence that the merged company is likely to do so (much less succeed in generating anticompetitive harms as a result).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540168,3483296\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/981/\">\n    908 F.2d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 7 involves\n   <em>\n    probabilities\n   </em>\n   , not certainties or possibilities.\"). That is especially true when the Government's documentary evidence is weighed against the considerable contrary evidence-including other evidence related to the motivation for the challenged merger-that came out at trial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 49-62 (collecting evidence regarding the proposed merger's ability to \"enable the combined company to respond to the challenges posed by the current transformation of the video marketplace and, in so doing, bring better products and better value to consumers\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 181-84. Thus, taking such documentary evidence for all it's worth, that evidence is only marginally probative of the viability of the Government's increased-leverage theory of harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Third-Party Competitor Witness Testimony Provides Little Support for the Contention That Turner Will Gain Increased Leverage Due to the Proposed Merger\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   In further support of its bargaining leverage claim, the Government called a number of third-party witnesses from AT &amp; T's competitor video distribution companies to the stand. Although such companies are \"customers\" that purchase Turner content, Tr. 18:15 (Gov't Opening), all of them are also competitors of AT &amp; T's video distribution services.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 82:7-8 (Fenwick (Cox) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 263:19-24 (Schlichting (DISH) ). Not surprisingly, most of the third-party competitor witnesses testified that they oppose the challenged merger for a number of reasons. According to the Government, that \"direct industry evidence\" supports its bargaining claim by describing \"how the merger would increase Time Warner's leverage over distributors.\" Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 8. I disagree. For the reasons discussed below, the third-party competitor witness testimony fails to provide meaningful, reliable support for the Government's increased-leverage theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   As has been observed in the context of other merger cases, I start by noting the difficulty of determining just how much weight to give the proffered third-party competitors' concerns about the challenged merger. On the one hand, such testimony can provide the Court with insight into the nature of the industry and a proposed transaction's potential effects in the market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PCOL \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. On the other hand-and particularly in the context of a vertical merger case where, as here, upstream customers are downstream competitors-there is a threat that such testimony reflects self-interest rather than genuine concerns about harm to competition.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arch Coal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213297\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/109/#p116\">\n    329 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   145 (citing 2A Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    Antitrust Law\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 538b, at 239 (\" 'subjective' testimony by customers\" is \"often unreliable\") ); Horizontal Merger Guidelines \u00a7 2.2.2 (noting possibility that customers may voice opposition to merger \"for reasons unrelated to the antitrust issues raised by that merger\"); Tr. 2462:14-23 (Carlton) (noting that a \"rival doesn't want to see a transaction that makes it[s] competitor more efficient,\" even though such a result may be \"good for consumer[s]\"). As in any Section 7 case, however, the central issue here is whether the Government has proffered sufficient support for the anticompetitive effects it asserts; it is not about protecting AT &amp; T's rivals from any and all competitive pressures they would experience should the merger go through.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267634\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/240/1/#p18\">\n    240 F.Supp.3d at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Clayton Act protects 'competition,' rather than any particular competitor.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Baker Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540168,3483296\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/981/\">\n    908 F.2d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991 n.12 ). Caution is therefore necessary in evaluating the probative value of the proffered third-party competitor testimony.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Ken Heyer,\n   <em>\n    Predicting the Competitive Effects of Mergers by Listening to Customers\n   </em>\n   , 74 Antitrust L.J. 87, 127 (2007) (\"In evaluating the likely competitive consequences of proposed mergers, competition authorities and courts properly weigh the totality of the evidence, refusing to take the views expressed by customers at face value and insisting that customer testimony be combined with economic evidence providing objective support for those views ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   For starters, I would note that\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   all third-party witnesses provided testimony supportive of the Government's predictions that Turner's post-merger bargaining leverage would increase as a result of its relationship with AT &amp; T. For example, when Comcast lead negotiator Gregory Rigdon was asked whether he believed the merger would increase Turner's bargaining leverage, he answered in the negative, noting that he didn't \"have any\n   reason to believe that it will impact my negotiations with Turner or HBO.\" Tr. 884:5-6 (Rigdon (Comcast) ). Thus, the evidence indicates that AT &amp; T's largest video distribution competitor-and thus a significant source of harm in Professor Shapiro's model,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 2665:3-7 (Katz)-does not anticipate changing its negotiating strategy with respect to a post-merger Turner. Along those same lines, Randy Sejen, a recently-retired negotiator from Cable ONE, testified that when negotiating with a programmer, \"it doesn't matter to us who owns the network.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2102:6-7 (Sejen (Cable ONE) ). In short, the Government's third-party competitor witnesses were not consistently concerned regarding Turner's ability to demand increased affiliate fees post-merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   It is the case, however, that other third-party competitor witnesses expressed \"concern about the increased\" bargaining leverage or other competitive gains on the part of Turner \"that will result from the proposed transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Arch Coal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213297\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/109/#p116\">\n    329 F.Supp.2d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Their testimony, however, suffered from shortcomings that, when viewed in light of my fundamental concerns with crediting the \"subjective views of customers in the market,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213297\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/109/#p116\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , undermine the probative value of their evidence in supporting the Government's predictions of Turner's increased-bargaining leverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Much of the third-party competitor testimony I heard consisted of speculative concerns regarding how the witnesses thought Turner might act in negotiations after the merger. Some witnesses simply accepted key assumptions of the Government's increased-leverage theory without any supporting analysis or data. For example, testimony from the Government's lead-off witness, Cox negotiator Suzanne Fenwick, helps to illustrate both of those problems. When asked on direct examination about her views of the proposed merger, Fenwick stated that she is \"very concerned\" that, post-merger, Cox would be presented by Turner with \"a horribly ugly deal and that when faced with that deal, we have to think about that if we do go dark, they have a benefit in picking up Cox customers\" via DirecTV. Tr. 107:18-21 (Fenwick (Cox) ). Fenwick continued that, as a result of that \"benefit that is created in this merger that isn't there today,\" the negotiating \"leverage changes\" and that AT &amp; T \"has a different incentive now than they had before\"-namely, the incentive to \"pick up customers\" lost by Cox in a Turner blackout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107:12-14, 108:7-9, 148:1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Fenwick's speculation about how Turner might act relies on certain key assumptions for which she had no factual basis. Indeed, the amount of customers that distributors would lose as a result of a Turner blackout (not to mention the resulting \"benefit\" to AT &amp; T), is one of the central disputes in this case. Without offering any supporting analysis, Fenwick simply assumes those figures to be in line with the Government's predictions, a point highlighted by the following exchange during cross-examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   Q: So let's talk about that. How many customers are going to leave [Cox] even with the reduction in your price to your cable subscribers, how many?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   A: We don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   Q: Have you tried to compute it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   A: I have not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   Q: You have no idea?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   A: We believe that it's a large number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-258\">\n   Q: I know you believe that, but do you have any evidence, any information, any hard facts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   A: I don't have a churn analysis for you, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   Q: Do you think you had an obligation in giving testimony to oppose a merger of this importance that you would do some homework and run some numbers?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   A: No, we felt like our job was to point out how the leverage changes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   Q: So you think you could just come in here and give your opinion that the leverage is going to change and you're going to lose all of these customers even though you have no idea how many customers you're going to lose and you've never done a single bit of quantitative analysis; is that true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   A: Sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141:1-142:5;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 147:22-148:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Testimony from other third-party witnesses suffered from similar problems. DISH Sling president Warren Schlichting testified that the merger would \"kind of throw[ ] the card table up in the air\" by placing Turner in a \"win win\" situation where they \"can raise prices and make more money and make us less competitive, or they can raise, they can present onerous terms that we can't accept.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 261:24-25, 262:8-22 (Schlichting (DISH) ). That was so, according to Schlichting, because DISH would lose \"a lot of subs\" in the event of a Turner blackout and most of those lost subscribers \"would accrue to [DirecTV's] benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262:19-21. RCN CEO Jim Holanda testified that he feared his company would lose access to certain Time Warner programming rights, even though he had no \"empirical data or any real-world evidence of subscriber losses if RCN didn't have Turner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2947:10-13 (Holanda (RCN) ). Just as with Fenwick's testimony, Schlichting's and Holanda's contentions about Turner's post-merger position-including the amount of subscribers they would lose and AT &amp; T would gain-assume away many of the disputed issues in this case.\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 404:22-405:3 (Schlichting (DISH) ) (\"Q: You don't have any calculations about how many subs DISH would lose or Sling would lose if there were a blackout let's say today .... A: No.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Some third-party competitor testimony even contradicted the testimony of the Government's lead expert, Professor Carl Shapiro.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staples\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"238765\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/970/1066/#p1073\">\n    970 F.Supp. at 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to \"give ... much weight\" to party's testimony that was \"contradicted by other evidence\" submitted by the party). For example, Schlichting's testimony regarding Turner's increased post-merger leverage\n   <em>\n    assumes\n   </em>\n   that Turner would profit from, or at the very least would be willing to accept, a long-term blackout of DISH.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 263:10-12 (Schlichting (DISH) ) (stating that Turner may be incentivized to blackout DISH because \"it's always, it's more lucrative to take subs than it is to, you know, collect programming, programming fees\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 264:6-8 (\"Q: So you would expect to be more likely to go dark [with Turner] if the merger goes through? A: I would.\"). Tom Montemagno, a lead negotiator for Charter, testified similarly. He noted that his concern with the challenged merger is \"mainly around what's going to happen with excessive price, pricing increases.\" and specifically, whether Charter will \"lose access to critically important content that AT &amp; T make take exclusive away from our customers and make it harder for [Charter] to compete.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1350:12-15, 1352:1-3 (Montemagno (Charter) ). The assumptions reflected by that testimony-namely, that a post-merger Turner could and would go dark with DISH or Charter-run directly contrary to Professor Shapiro's testimony that a post-merger Turner would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be incentivized to blackout or otherwise withhold its content from distributors.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2293:3-4, 14-15 (Shapiro) (Turner will \"continue to license Turner content\" to distributors after the merger);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2218:13-21 (\"I'm not saying\n   that after the merger, Turner will deny its content to the other distributors.\"). Indeed, when asked whether he was \"aware\" of Professor Shapiro's opinion that \"it would not be profitable for the merged company to withhold the Turner Networks from DISH and other distributors,\" Schlichting admitted that he was not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 417:13-17, 418:15-16 (Schlichting (DISH) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Other concerns raised by the third-party competitors were not particularly germane to the Government's Section 7 allegations in this case. Charter's Montemagno, for example, noted his concerns that the merger would harm Charter's competitive position due to the bundling of the Turner networks and the ability of DirecTV to use advertising to appeal to Charter's customers.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1405:13-18 (Montemagno (Charter) ). On cross-examination, however, Montemagno conceded that \"none of those issues are a result of this merger,\" but instead \"all exist in the marketplace today.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1407:12-18;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 1407:19-23 (\"Q: And AT &amp; T, DirecTV, if it wanted to buy ads on Turner or anybody else in order to try to lure your customers away, they could do that today, they could do that yesterday, couldn't they? A: They can buy them yes.\"). Holanda grounded RCN's concerns about the challenged merger in a prior experience with Comcast-NBCU and negotiations over RCN's \"broadcast basic\" package.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2920:6-23, 2921:2-6 (Holanda (RCN) ). But that experience is not especially probative of the Government's increased-leverage theory, given that the Turner networks do not include major broadcast programming and, in any event, that penetration rates exist in the pre-merger market.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2955:9-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Finally-and perhaps unsurprisingly given that a post-merger Turner, like a pre-merger Turner, would stand to suffer large losses in affiliate fee and advertising revenues in the event of a blackout-the record is barren of any contentions by the third-party competitors that they would actually give in to any price increases demanded by Turner as a result of its purported increase in post-merger leverage. Schlichting never testified, for instance, that DISH would in fact pay more to Turner for its content as a result of the merger, noting instead that \"I don't think we've quite figured out what we would do\" during post-merger negotiations with Turner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 264:11-12 (Schlichting (DISH) ). The lack of real-world evidence that Turner would likely be successful in obtaining increased fees from virtually every distributor (as Professor Shapiro's model projects) due to its relationship with AT &amp; T is yet another strike against the Government's increased-leverage theory of competitive harm.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anthem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276807\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/345/#p349\">\n    855 F.3d at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing as \"farfetched\" the assumption that contractual negotiations will lead to the same outcome \"in every instance,\" especially in light of the fact that contracts at issue were \"customized relationship-driven contracts\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   In the final analysis, the bulk of the third-party competitor testimony proffered by the Government was speculative, based on unproven assumptions, or unsupported-or even contradicted-by the Government's own evidence. Especially in view of the fact that the third-party competitor witnesses have an incentive to oppose a merger that would allow AT &amp; T to increase innovation while lowering costs, such testimony falls far short of persuasively \"show[ing] that this merger threatens\" to harm competition by allowing Turner to wield increased bargaining leverage.

Br. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Real-World Evidence Indicating That Prior Vertical Integration of Programmers and Distributors Has Not Affected Affiliate Fee Negotiations Undermines the Government's Increased-Leverage Theory of Harm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court is not convinced that the \"real-world objective evidence\" offered by the Government provides sufficient support for its increased-bargaining leverage claim. That conclusion is further bolstered by evidence relating to three prior instances of vertical integration in the video programming and distribution industry: 1) News Corp., a programmer, acquiring part of DirecTV in 2003 and then spinning it off in 2008; 2) the 2009 split of Time Warner, a programmer, from Time Warner Cable, a MVPD; and 3) the 2011 combination of Comcast, a distributor, and NBCU, a programmer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' PFOF \u00b6 96; Tr. 2440:4-8 (Carlton). According to defendants, the econometric analysis of their chief economic expert, Professor Dennis Carlton, and witness testimony both provide significant, real-world evidence indicating that, contrary to the Government's increased-leverage theory, those prior instances of vertical integration did not affect affiliate fee negotiations or content prices. For the following reasons, the Court agrees with defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <em>\n    a.

In this case, however, neither the Government nor Professor Shapiro presented original analysis of any prior vertical transactions in this industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2337:11-13 (Shapiro) (\"I did not end up doing my own separate analysis\" of transactions analyzed by Professor Carlton.);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2473:22-25 (Carlton) (\"Professor Shapiro did no econometric analysis of any of the data as far as I can tell.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Defendants' lead economic expert, Professor Dennis Carlton, then analyzed that third-party pricing data, among other proprietary and public-source data in his possession, to test whether it is \"true that\n   content prices are higher on a network when it's sold by someone who's vertically integrated.\" Tr. 2470:10-12 (Carlton).

Moreover, Professor Carlton noted that his results are particularly \"compelling\" in light of the fact that the industry, as reaffirmed by numerous witnesses at trial, is \"more competitive\" today than at the time of the prior transactions he analyzed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2476:6-9;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 1398:24-25 (Montemagno (Charter) ) (video distribution business is \"more competitive now than I've ever experienced in my career\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2134:1-3 (Sejen (Cable ONE) ) (\"Q: In your 31 years in the industry, have you ever seen it more competitive at the distribution level?

A: True.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3213:9 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) ) (competition in industry is \"at an all-time high\"). In short, based on his analysis, Professor Carlton stated that there has been \"nothing like\" the price increases predicted by Professor Shapiro following prior instances of vertical integration of programmers and distributors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2470:19-20 (Carlton).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Although the Government and Professor Shapiro sought to undermine the basis for Professor Carlton's conclusions at trial, those efforts were unavailing. Professor Shapiro, for his part, critiqued Professor Carlton for relying on faulty data and attempting to draw conclusions from prior transactions that are not comparable to the challenged merger. Focusing on Professor Carlton's reliance on SNL Kagan data, Professor Shapiro stated that such data is \"pretty poor\" because it relies on \"public sources\" and reports content costs \"to all of the distributors on average.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3831:11-18 (Shapiro). Of course, Professor Carlton testified that he relied not only on SNL Kagan data, but also on data from third parties such as DirecTV, DISH, and Charter-all of which, when analyzed, showed no statistical pricing effects associated with the relevant prior instances of vertical integration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2470:4-12 (Carlton). Taking Professor Shapiro's critiques of the SNL Kagan data on their own terms, however, those critiques miss the mark. For one thing, even Professor Shapiro acknowledged that SNL Kagan data is \"commonly used\" by individuals in the industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3889:3 (Shapiro);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 1073:20-1074:4 (Breland (Turner) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, it was SNL Kagan data that formed the basis of the only study of prior harm cited by the Government and Professor Shapiro.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3889:4-9 (Shapiro) (agreeing that FCC study that he \"relied on\" in his expert report was \"based on Kagan data\"); Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 16 (citing same FCC study); DX893-28 (Gov't answer to interrogatory, citing same FCC study);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2467:21-2468:9 (Carlton). For those reasons, Professor Shapiro's\n   criticisms of defendants' prior transaction data does not, in this Court's view, detract from Professor Carlton's expert opinion that defendants' evidence related to the prior transactions is \"especially probative\" when considering the Government's claims of harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2475:21-22 (Carlton);\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2441:13-20 (\"Ignoring that evidence is a big mistake.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Professor Shapiro and the Government also denounced Professor Carlton's analysis on the basis that the prior vertical transactions are not sufficiently similar to the challenged merger. They pointed out, for example, that two of the prior transactions involved regional cable distributors (Comcast and Time Warner Cable), whereas the challenged merger involves DirecTV, which operates nationally. Regional operation means, Professor Shapiro testified, that one would \"not expect[ ] to see evidence of post-merger price increases beyond the overall industry increases\" because \"most of the MVPDs ... don't compete with Comcast,\" for example.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2338:8-13 (Shapiro);\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 2558:18-2559:15 (Carlton). Professor Carlton explained, however, that the regional versus national distinction is \"irrelevant\" when it comes to his analysis of DirecTV and DISH prices; that is so, Professor Carlton stated, because those two satellite companies compete \"everywhere\" the regional cable companies operate and it is the \"national share\" that matters to Professor Shapiro's bargaining model.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2474:11-17, 2560:5-11 (Carlton). To the extent the Government is now arguing that one would not expect to see\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   increased-leverage harm due to Comcast's status as a regional distributor, I simply note that the Government argued to the contrary prior to this case.\n   <em>\n    See, generally, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174862\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/808/145/\">\n    808 F.Supp.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (No. 11-cv-106 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Finally, the Government and Professor Shapiro note that the prior vertical transactions all were \"remediated\" by regulatory or court-ordered conditions-conditions that will not apply to the challenged merger. Tr. 3830:20 (Shapiro). Professor Carlton agrees that, in theory, his study's conclusions would be affected if the conditions associated with the prior transactions were not \"sufficiently similar\" to those at issue here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2558:12-15 (Carlton). I will thus briefly address Turner's 2017 arbitration offer and its relation to the conditions on the Comcast-NBCU transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   The arbitration proceedings envisioned by Turner's offer are similar in many of \"the fundamental ways\" to those blessed by the FCC, DOJ, and this Court in the Comcast-NBCU merger. Defs.' PFOF \u00b6 214 (citing Tr. 2680:1-9 (Katz) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 225. Most notably, both arbitration arrangements are \"baseball-style\": each party puts forward a final offer before knowing about its counterparty's offer, and the arbitrator chooses between those two. Tr. 2680:1-9 (Katz). In addition, both sets of arbitration arrangements contain \"standstill provisions,\" which prevent the blackout of content while the arbitration is pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They also both set out \"fair market value\" as the standard, and have similar discovery procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2680:1-13. As Professor Katz testified, \"the objective is the same. The overall structure the same. So they are similar overall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2958:12-16 (Holanda (RCN) ). Given all of these similarities, I conclude that Professor Carlton's econometric analysis of the pricing effects of the Comcast-NBCU combination can be afforded probative weight in predicting the potential pricing effects of the challenged merger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   To sum it up, neither the Government nor Professor Shapiro has given this Court an adequate basis to decline to credit Professor Carlton's econometric analysis. And that analysis, according to Professor Carlton, definitively shows that prior instances of vertical integration in the video programming and distribution industry have had no statistically significant effect on content prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   <em>\n    b. Executives from Vertically Integrated Programmers and Distributors Testified That Vertical Integration Does Not Affect Affiliate Fee Negotiations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Professor Carlton's analysis of prior vertical integration is further reinforced, defendants contend, by the consistent testimony of Comcast-NBCU and Time Warner executives that the integration of programming and distribution does not affect affiliate negotiations. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Defendants first point to the testimony from Madison Bond, who has served as a lead negotiator for NBCU during the past seven years when the company has been vertically integrated with Comcast. When questioned by defense counsel about his prior negotiations on behalf of NBCU, Bond testified that he \"never once took into account the interest of Comcast cable in trying to negotiate a carriage agreement.\" Tr. 2014:22-24 (Bond (NBCU) ). Consideration of potential Comcast gains during an NBCU blackout \"doesn't factor at all\" into his negotiations, Bond continued, nor has anyone from Comcast \"ever asked\" him \"to think about that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2015:1, 2015:10-12. Bond's statements were similar to testimony given by Comcast's chief negotiator, Greg Rigdon, who testified that he has never suggested, or seen a Comcast document suggesting, that NBC \"should go dark on one of [Comcast's] competitors because then [Comcast] might pick up some subscribers\" or that NBCU should \"hold out for a little bit more in affiliate fees because that will harm\" Comcast's competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 882:22-24, 883:1-11 (Rigdon (Comcast) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Time Warner executives testified similarly about their time at the company when it was vertically integrated with Time Warner Cable. Recalling that period, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes testified that he was not aware of any Time Warner negotiator \"articulating this theory of added incentive or added ability to leverage a price increase\" because Time Warner was \"vertically integrated with Time Warner Cable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3121:22-3122:8 (Bewkes\n   (Time Warner) ). Turner CEO John Martin, who served as CFO of Time Warner Cable at the time it was vertically integrated with Time Warner, testified along the same lines, as did Turner lead negotiators Coleman Breland and Richard Warren.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 601:10-602:15 (Martin (Turner) ) (\"Q: Did you ever hear anyone say that Turner would have more leverage because Time Warner Cable and Turner were in the same family? A: No, I did not.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1129:6-12 (Breland (Turner) ) (\"I've been in Turner when we were a vertically integrated company and had a sister company called Time Warner Cable. And I can tell you at no time during my tenure there did anyone ask me to consider in my negotiations and how I dealt with other distributors the outcome and impact at Time Warner Cable ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1190:14-15 (Warren (Turner) ) (noting, when asked about Government's increased-leverage theory, that \"[w]e didn't do that when we were part of Time Warner Cable\"). Martin also testified that Time Warner's content prices did not decrease following the spin-off of Time Warner Cable.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 603:24-604:1 (Martin (Turner) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   The Government seems to believe that any \"post-merger\" testimony given by Time Warner executives should be \"discount[ed]\" as potentially biased because it was given by interested employees of a defendant company. Gov't PCOL \u00b6 56. Poppycock ! The testimony at issue does not involve promises or speculations about the employees' future, post-merger behavior. Rather, it is testimony about what these executives previously experienced when working within a vertically integrated company. That testimony regarding executives' prior experiences in the industry is uniform among all testifying witnesses and unrebutted by the Government; moreover, it finds independent support in the analysis performed by Professor Carlton. For those reasons, I decline the Government's request to discount it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   To be sure, neither Professor Carlton's econometric analysis nor the testimony discussed above provides \"perfect evidence\" of what will happen as a result of the challenged merger. Tr. 2475:15-17 (Carlton). But when weighed against the relatively weak documentary and third-party testimonial evidence proffered by the Government in support of its increased-leverage theory, the real-world evidence indicating that vertical integration has not affected content prices or affiliate negotiations further undermines the persuasiveness of the Government's proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Government's Expert Testimony Is Also Insufficient to Support Its Increased-Leverage Theory of Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   In addition to offering the so-called \"real-world objective evidence\" set out above, the Government called noted antitrust economist, Professor Carl Shapiro, to testify in support of its increased-leverage theory. Professor Shapiro first discussed the academic underpinnings of the theory, explaining that it was grounded in an economic concept known as the Nash bargaining theory. Thereafter, Professor Shapiro opined that Turner's post-merger leverage would increase pursuant to those economic principles. In order to predict the increased distributor costs and consumer harms that would result from Turner's increased post-merger leverage, Professor Shapiro constructed economic models. Acknowledging that proper antitrust analysis of a proposed vertical merger requires balancing the merger's proconsumer benefits with its harms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 189-91, Professor Shapiro testified that the challenged merger would result in annual consumer cost increases that would far outweigh the $350 million in annual EDM savings he conceded the merger would generate. He thus concluded, based on his economic modeling, that the merger was likely to\n   cause a substantial lessening of competition by increasing consumer costs as a result of Turner's increased bargaining leverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   At trial, defendants mounted a series of attacks on Professor Shapiro's analysis. They challenged Professor Shapiro's threshold contention that the economic theory of Nash bargaining can accurately predict the dynamics and final fee structure of complex affiliate fee negotiations. They also asserted that the theory, as applied here, rests on improper assumptions-including the notion that Turner could gain increased leverage from threatening a long-term blackout-that negate its usefulness in evaluating the real-world effects of the proposed merger. Finally, defendants, both through their own experts and their examinations of industry witnesses, argue that Professor Shapiro's inputs are faulty, and note further that use of the proper inputs would cause the model to predict that the merger will have a net benefit to consumers rather than a net harm. As will become clear in the section that follows, I largely agree with defendants' various critiques of Professor Shapiro's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   For starters, I couldn't help but notice that the more and more questions were raised during the trial about the reliability of Professor Shapiro's theory and model, the more the Government appeared to be minimizing the importance of his analysis.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Tr. Br. 10 (noting Government's attempt to \"retreat from the model\" in its closing argument). Indeed, during its closing argument, the Government touched on Professor Shapiro's model relatively briefly, arguing that it simply \"confirmed what the industry witnesses had already explained.\" Tr. 4000:5-6 (Gov't Closing). And the Government's post-trial filings, for their part, all but ask the Court to overlook any failings of the model, arguing that \" Section 7 does not require any quantification of harm from a price increase\" and that \"it would be perverse to penalize a plaintiff that does provide a quantification of the potential price increase.\" Gov't PCOL \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 15 (\"[D]efendants' critique of Professor Shapiro's model misses the bigger picture: the model is but one part of Professor Shapiro's opinion, and his opinion is one part of the United States' evidence.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Go figure!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   With that, I will now turn to my own evaluation of Professor Shapiro's expert testimony. First, I will explain why the evidence is insufficient to support Professor Shapiro's conclusion that this Nash bargaining theory will accurately predict an increase of Turner's post-merger bargaining leverage in affiliate fee negotiations with distributors. Second, I will examine Professor Shapiro's economic bargaining model, concluding that the evidence is also insufficient to support the input values upon which he relied to generate his predictions of harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Evidence Is Insufficient to Support Professor Shapiro's Conclusion That the Merger Will Increase Turner's Bargaining Leverage and, in Turn, Affiliate Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Relying on a particular economic bargaining theory, Professor Shapiro opines that, due to its post-merger relationship with AT &amp; T, Turner's leverage in affiliate negotiations will increase due to a reduction in financial exposure in the event of a long-term blackout. Professor Shapiro in turn opines that, as such, a post-merger Turner would be able to secure greater affiliate fees from distributors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   It is beyond dispute that, to be probative in a particular case, expert testimony must incorporate assumptions that are \"reasonable\" in light of the record evidence.

Indeed, this opinion by Professor Shapiro runs contrary to all of the real-world testimony during the trial from those who have actually negotiated on behalf of vertically integrated companies. While I need not repeat their testimony here, I would simply note that the witnesses consistently testified that they had\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   considered the identity of the programmer's owner in the course of affiliate fee negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 2014:22-2015:14 (Bond (NBCU) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 882:22-24, 883:1-11 (Rigdon (Comcast) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3121:22-3122:8 (Bewkes (Time Warner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 601:10-602:15 (Martin (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1129:6-12 (Breland (Turner) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1190:14-15 (Warren (Turner) ).

Indeed, the evidence showed that there has never been, and is likely never going to be, an actual long-term blackout of Turner content.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2218:13-23, 2357:12-14 (Shapiro). Numerous witnesses explained,\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Professor Shapiro acknowledged, that a long-term blackout of Turner content, even post-merger, would cause Turner to lose more in affiliate fee and advertising revenues than the merged entity would gain.\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 2293:2-17. Given that, there is an insufficient evidentiary basis to support Professor Shapiro's contention that a post-merger Turner would, or even could, drive up prices by\n   <em>\n    threatening\n   </em>\n   distributors with long-term blackouts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   It is worth emphasizing again that Professor Shapiro does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contend that Turner's economics are going to somehow flip after the merger-he acknowledged, for example, that Turner would lose over $100 million per month during a post-merger blackout with a large distributor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2314:4-15;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2293:3-15 (agreeing with defense counsel that Turner will \"continue to license Turner content\" to distributors because it would be \"profitable\" to do so). As a result, Professor Shapiro testified that Turner would not be incentivized to\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   engage in a long-term blackout with a distributor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n   I should say-I think we skipped over it. I'm not. saying that after the merger, Turner will deny its content to the other distributors. This is not a foreclosure-withholding story.... I considered whether there would be withholding.

According to Professor Shapiro, those benefits correspond to the increased affiliate fees that AT &amp; T's rival distributors will pay as a result of Turner's increased post-merger bargaining leverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   As Professor Shapiro explained at trial, his model relies on three primary inputs: 1) a figure for long-term subscriber loss, which is the total loss of subscribers a distributor would experience in the event of a long-term blackout of Turner content; 2) the diversion rate, which estimates the percentage of a distributor's lost subscribers that would sign up for AT &amp; T's distribution services; and 3) AT &amp; T margin data, from which Professor Shapiro calculates a measure of profits that AT &amp; T would derive from subscribers it gains or maintains as a result of the hypothesized long-term Turner blackout.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2217:15-24 (Shapiro). After selecting and entering values for those inputs and running his bargaining model, Professor Shapiro predicts that the challenged merger would lead to annual, net consumer harm ranging from $286.5 million to $561 million for the year 2016, with that range increasing in subsequent years.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2255:14-15, 3920:6-10;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2256:16-20 (predicting $436 million in net consumer harm for the year 2017 and $571 million in net consumer harm for the year 2021). The low and high end of the ranges result from using different values-9% and 14%, respectively-for the subscriber loss rate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2239:3-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Of course, both 2016 and 2017 have passed with no merger. Thus, as Professor Shapiro concedes, his bargaining model does not \"literally predict[ ] the price increases that will occur in negotiations in the real world.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2294:18-2295:1. Rather, Professor Shapiro testified that his model is designed to \"evaluate the fundamental incentives and changes in the market created by the merger.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2209:11-12. For that reason, he stated that his model does not account for the existence of Turner's current affiliate agreements\n   with distributors, which will \"expire in time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2209:13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Defendants attack Professor Shapiro's bargaining model from all directions. Noting that models are \"only as good as the inputs,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2315:11, defendants argue that each of Professor Shapiro's three \"very important\" inputs lacks a sufficient basis in the trial evidence,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2315:12. Defendants also argue that Professor Shapiro's model improperly assumes away Turner's current affiliate agreements-agreements that will serve to significantly constrain Turner's post-merger bargaining leverage for years to come.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree with defendants, for the most part, that the inputs and assumptions of Professor Shapiro's model are not sufficiently grounded in the evidence-a fact that \"undermine[s]\" my \"confidence in the reliability and factual credibility\" of his projections.\n   <em>\n    Anthem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276807\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/345/#p349\">\n    855 F.3d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Evidence Is Insufficient to Support Professor Shapiro's Long-Term Subscriber Loss Rate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   In order for AT &amp; T to benefit from a long-term Turner blackout with a rival distributor under the increased-leverage theory, a sufficient number of customers must actually depart or decline to join the rival distributor due to its failure to offer Turner content. Professor Shapiro refers to that measure of lost customers as the \"long-term subscriber loss rate.\" At trial, Professor Shapiro testified that his model incorporates a low-end long-term subscriber loss rate of 9%, a number representing the combined percentage of current and potential subscribers who would either leave or decide not to sign up with a distributor in the event of a hypothetical long-term blackout of Turner content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2239:3-5 (Shapiro). Whether viewed as a measure of Turner's \"market power\" in the programming market or not,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2239:18, that measure of customer loss-deemed the \"long-term subscriber loss\" rate by Professor Shapiro-is critical to Professor Shapiro's bargaining model and the predicted consumer harm it generates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Of course, there has never been a long-term blackout of Turner content; Professor Shapiro thus had no \"real-world\" evidence on which to base his projected subscriber loss rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2394:8-11. Instead, as a basis for his chosen 9% value, Professor Shapiro relied on three principal pieces of evidence: (1) a third-party consultant slide deck commissioned by Charter in late 2016; (2) his own analyses of long-term\n   blackouts of a different programmer, Viacom, with cable distributors Suddenlink and Cable ONE; and (3) the results of an internet survey conducted by another of the Government's testifying experts, Professor John Hauser.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2225:17-2226:7. The evidence indicates, however, that each of Professor Shapiro's sources is significantly flawed. Thus, even taken together, they fail to establish the reliability of Professor Shapiro's long-term subscriber loss rate and the conclusions generated by his model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   <strong>\n    1) Charter's Third-Party Consultant Slide Deck\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   According to Professor Shapiro, a slide deck, commissioned by AT &amp; T's competitor Charter in late 2016 and authored by consultants at a San Francisco-based firm called Altman, Vilandrie &amp; Company (\"Altman Vilandrie\"), was the \"single best document and analysis\" he found in coming up with a measure for the long-term subscriber loss rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2235:11-14. That was so, according to Professor Shapiro, because the slide deck, in contrast to the other available pieces of evidence, addressed \"exactly\" the question of interest to his analysis: the subscriber-loss effects of a long-term Turner blackout with a major distributor, as measured in\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   lost current customers and lost potential customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2235:19-20, 2236:20-2237:3. But although the slide deck may have analyzed the questions in which Professor Shapiro was interested (perhaps not so fortuitously,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   pp. 229-30), the evidence shows that it did so via methodologies that were significantly flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Before explaining further, it is necessary to review the basics of the slide deck's analysis. Altman Vilandrie director Stefan Bewley, who was responsible for supervising the project, explained that the slide deck was designed to examine \"the value of content programming.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1271:23 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) ). The slide deck, entitled \"Content Valuation Project,\" contains charts predicting Charter's subscriber losses in the event of permanent blackouts with various programming networks.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1249:18-21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX79. To generate those loss predictions, Altman Vilandrie used three different methods: (1) an internet survey, (2) set top box data, and (3) the so-called \"hybrid\" method, which made slight adjustments to the set top box analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2792:10-11, 2801:1-5, 2808:6-20 (Rossi);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1271:24-1272:6 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) ). Although Professor Shapiro praised that analysis for its apparent rigor,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2235:18-19 (Shapiro), he later conceded, despite professing that he usually does not accept data without \"look[ing] into it more and figur[ing] out how reliable it is,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3848:10-13, that he did not take steps to evaluate the reliability of the Altman Vilandrie data before he relied on it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3863:21-23 (\"Q. So we can establish that all you did was read the report, right? A. I relied on the report. I didn't dig behind it.\"). Rather, Professor Shapiro simply incorporated the final figure included in the slide deck's table of results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX79-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   Defendants' survey and statistics expert, Professor Peter Rossi, did however examine the methods that Altman Vilandrie used to predict the reported subscriber loss rates. And in testimony that largely went unrebutted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rossi explained his conclusion that \"[a]ll three are invalid.\" Tr. 2792:5 (Rossi). Those conclusions, which I accept, are outlined below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Altman Vilandrie relied on an internet survey. That survey, as Professor Rossi explained, combines three different\n   types of internet surveys-a \"conjoint,\" a \"channel chooser,\" and a \"Max Diff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2792:13-17. In the conjoint survey, respondents view eight to ten screens and are presented with different options and pricing for bundles of video programming, broadband, and telephone services; the survey seeks to infer the respondent's willingness to trade off different service features. The channel chooser survey, for its part, tries to ascertain how much priority respondents give to a particular cable network. And the Max Diff survey allows the respondent to rank the different networks. Based on its internet survey's combination of those approaches, Altman Vilandrie calculated one set of subscriber loss figures for current and prospective video customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX 79-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Professor Rossi testified that the internet survey method was plagued by considerable flaws, both in the way the questions were designed and in the way the answers to those questions were used to project subscriber loss. He noted, for example, that the conjoint survey's presentation of 12 networks included only one network-CNN-owned by Turner. Tr. 2794:7-9 (Rossi). Although Professor Rossi testified to the common-sense proposition that it is \"impossible\" to infer the value of all of the remaining Turner networks just from CNN, apparently that is what Altman Vilandrie did with the results of the conjoint survey.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2793:11-14, 2800:6-11. With respect to the Max Diff survey's process for ranking channels, Professor Rossi testified that such a ranking can give a sense of relative importance, but cannot measure how much more or less important one network is than another; of particular relevance here, moreover, the ranking methodology does not define what \"important\" means to a respondent, and thus says \"[a]bsolutely nothing\" about \"whether a subscriber to Charter would leave if there was a Turner blackout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2795:9-16. Finally, although Altman Vilandrie purported to combine the conjoint and Max Diff methodologies to bolster its analysis, Professor Rossi testified that such methodologies \"fundamentally cannot be combined\" as a matter of statistical practice.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2796:18-2797:4;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2800:16-17 (\"It's literally an impossibility, and there is absolutely no way to combine these two.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   For those reasons, Professor Rossi's \"bottom line conclusion\" about the survey methodology was that it is \"completely invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2800:22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Altman Vilandrie utilized a set top box methodology. Set top box data, as should now be familiar, shows the amount of time a particular cable set top box is tuned to specific channels.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1274:16-18 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2801:5-12 (Rossi). As Bewley acknowledged, set top box data does not necessarily reflect actual viewership or correlate to a particular network's value.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1275:17-22 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) ). Professor Rossi testified similarly, noting that such data, without more, \"cannot possibly answer the question about the effect of removing any channel or group of channels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2802:7-8 (Rossi). In addition, because set top box data is generated by Charter's current customers, it provides no information about \"prospective customers for Charter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2801:19-24. Notwithstanding those limitations, the Altman Vilandrie slide deck purported to derive current and prospective subscriber loss figures from the set top box data by assigning differing \"churn propensity\" values-that is, values\n   reflecting the likelihood that a viewer will leave a distributor-to different levels of viewing concentration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2802:9-2804:14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX79-18, -68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Professor Rossi testified, however, that the churn propensity values, and their correlation with set top box data, are \"not based on data of any kind\" and instead reflect \"purely assumed numbers.\" Tr. 2804:12-13 (Rossi). Although the lack of empirical support is reason enough to disregard the slide deck's analysis of the set top box data, that flaw is compounded by the particular values assigned in the churn propensity schedule. In particular, based on the schedule, Altman Vilandrie predicts that the loss of a network with a specified viewing concentration or greater will\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   cause a distributor's customers to leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2807:13-20; PX79-68; DX0681-73. I agree with Professor Rossi that the upper-threshold assumption, and indeed the entire set-top box methodology, lacks a sufficient basis in evidence and is unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2807:13-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , and most importantly for purposes of Professor Shapiro's analysis, Altman Vilandrie implemented what it refers to as a \"hybrid\" methodology. Ultimately, the April 27, 2017 slide deck upon which Professor Shapiro relied indicates that the hybrid methodology produces a video subscriber loss rate of 9% for current customers and 10% for prospective customers. Tr. 2388:1-11, 3868:1-20 (Shapiro). Professor Shapiro testified that the 9% long-term subscriber loss rate that he incorporated into his model \"reflect[s]\" those results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2237:4-8, 2388:1-11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX79-6, -18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   A key problem with the design of the hybrid methodology, as Professor Rossi testified, is that it blends two methods only in the sense that it alters the set top box method's lower churn propensity threshold \"based to some extent on some of the survey data.\" Tr. 2808:14-18 (Rossi). In other words, the hybrid methodology can be thought of as \"just a revision or alteration, minor alteration to the set-top box method.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2808:19-20. The hybrid methodology is thus plagued by the same problems as is the set top box methodology, including the fact that it \"can't say anything about prospective customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2808:19-22. As a result, the hybrid methodology-and its associated 9% and 10% subscriber loss predictions for current and prospective customers-falters on the same grounds as the set top box methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Moreover, evidence regarding the evolution of Altman Vilandrie's slide deck casts further doubt on the reliably of the figures associated with the hybrid methodology. Specifically, the evidence shows that a \"final read out\" version of the slide deck sent to Charter on April 21, 2017 reported that the hybrid method produced a 5% and 6% subscriber loss rate for current and prospective customers, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1302:4-20 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) ); 3068:1-12 (Shapiro). Almost immediately after a meeting with Charter representatives a few days later, however, Altman Vilandrie. with the \"permission\" of Charter, altered the results of the hybrid methodology for \"just\" Turner and no other programmer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1310:14-1311:15 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) ). Those alterations led to the 9% and 10% current and prospective subscriber loss rates upon which Professor Shapiro's analysis relied.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3868:1-12 (Shapiro);\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   DX681-23,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   PX79-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   That Turner-centric turn of events is enough alone to give me pause before accepting Professor Shapiro's reliance on the slide deck, notwithstanding the Government's presentation of a more benign view of the slide deck's evolution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 1327:16-1332:4 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie) ) (testifying, among other things, that it was Altman Vilandrie that \"proposed\n   making an exception for Turner\" based on the results of the hybrid methodology as compared to the results of other methodologies). In my view, moreover, the most troubling aspect of the testimony regarding the contested changes to the slide deck was that Professor Shapiro was entirely unaware of those changes when he \"first relied on the document\" to perform his analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2365:8-10 (Shapiro);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2366:4-7. At trial, Professor Shapiro admitted that he was not aware of the alterations made to the Altman Vilandrie slide deck until his pre-trial deposition by defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2365:1-3. He nonetheless defended his reliance on the slide deck for the long-term subscriber loss figures, in no small part based on his insistence that although the current subscriber loss figure had been altered, the prospective subscriber loss figure \"was not changed here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2388:1-6;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2366:9-11 (\"If I used the five percent instead, I would get a long-term subscriber loss rate of 8.5 percent instead of nine in my calculations.\"). Given that, Professor Shapiro continued, the altered current subscriber loss figure was \"a lot less significant\" because \"it's just one of the two components that affects the long-term subscriber rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2388:11-15. Based on that assumption, Professor Shapiro testified that, even if one accepted the original 5% existing-customer subscriber loss figure, \"[i]t's not as though my number would go from ... nine to five percent if you made that change. It would go from nine to 8.5\" percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2388:8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   But Professor Shapiro \"made a mistake\" in so testifying, a fact he was later forced to concede on rebuttal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3868:17-20. When confronted on rebuttal with the two versions of the slide deck, Professor Shapiro acknowledged that the prospective subscriber loss figure\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   indeed been changed from an original value of 6% to the 10% value upon which he relied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3868:1-20. He also testified, moreover, that using the original 5% existing customer subscriber loss figure and 6% prospective subscriber loss figure would yield a departure rate of about 5 or 6%, which in turn would \"largely eliminate[ ] the net MVPD cost increase\" he projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3870:22-3871:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   For all of these reasons, I conclude that Professor Shapiro's reliance on the projected long-term subscriber loss rates contained in the Altman Vilandrie slide deck was misplaced. Given Professor Shapiro's testimony that the slide deck was the \"single most important document\" to him in calculating the long-term subscriber loss rate incorporated into the bargaining model,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2360:25-2361:3, that conclusion\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   is all but fatal to Professor Shapiro's analysis. To the extent, however, that Professor Shapiro relied upon two other categories of evidence, such evidence also fails to support his chosen long-term subscriber loss rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   <strong>\n    2) Long-Term Viacom Blackouts with Suddenlink and Cable ONE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   In generating his long-term subscriber loss rate, Professor Shapiro also relied on his own analysis of the effects of long-term blackouts of Viacom programming-which includes networks such as MTV and Nickelodeon-with two MVPDs, Suddenlink and Cable ONE. In particular, Professor Shapiro opined that the Viacom blackout caused Suddenlink to lose 9.4% of its video subscribers and Cable ONE to lose 16% of its video subscribers. Gov't PFOF \u00b6 208. The Court need not spill much ink addressing those figures because even a cursory review of the evidence shows that they are unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   With respect to Professor Shapiro's 9.4% figure for Suddenlink, it is notable that\n   <em>\n    Suddenlink itself\n   </em>\n   represented to the public that it suffered only a 2 to 2.5% subscriber loss as a result of the blackout with Viacom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2480:21-22 (Carlton).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   Given the unusual nature of a long-term blackout, Charter, Comcast, and Wall Street power Citi also studied the event, the latter two concluding that Suddenlink's subscriber loss percentage was in the \"low single digits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2483:1-2; Defs.' PFOF \u00b6 150. Altman Vilandrie's study for Charter produced similar results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX79-6. I heard from defendants' expert Professor Carlton that Professor Shapiro's estimates were inflated when compared to those other reported figures due to his failure to account for the fact that the rate of subscriber loss in the video distribution industry started to increase in 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2483:16-2484:2 (Carlton);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2490:8-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Professor Carlton corrected Professor Shapiro's analysis to control for that trend, he generated a 4.8% subscriber loss rate for the Suddenlink-Viacom blackout, a number much more in line with industry estimates.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2484:3-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   Professor Shapiro's 16% subscriber loss estimate for the Cable ONE long-term blackout of Viacom is even more unreliable. On that score, it is sufficient to note that Randy Sejen, Cable ONE's chief negotiator, testified that \"[t]he losses attributable to Viacom are very, very small ... and were not significant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2123:21-2124:12 (Sejen (Cable ONE) ). Specifically, Sejen noted that the Viacom blackout was \"felt and absorbed\" within four to six months and caused a subscriber loss of just 2%.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2130:1-4, 2123:21-24. Given Sejen's testimony that Cable ONE lost only 2% of subscribers, the Court has no reliable basis to accept Professor Shapiro's calculation of a subscriber loss figure eight times that amount-and therefore rejects it in toto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   To be sure, I heard evidence that, in relative terms, Turner programming is more valuable than Viacom programming. But that fact\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   cannot make up for Professor Shapiro's baseline failure to establish any reliable measure of subscriber losses associated with the long-term Viacom blackouts. Having concluded that Professor Shapiro's Viacom analysis lacks an adequate basis, I will now turn to the last main piece of evidence he cited in support of his long-term subscriber loss figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   <strong>\n    3) Professor Hauser's Internet Survey\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   The last piece of evidence upon which Professor Shapiro based his long-term subscriber loss rate is an internet survey. The internet survey was conducted by another of the Government's testifying experts, Professor John Hauser, who heads the marketing department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tr. 756:9-14 (Hauser). The survey generated a long-term Turner blackout subscriber loss percentage of 12% and a 30-day Turner\n   blackout subscriber loss percentage of a whopping 8.2%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 761:7, 803:24-804:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   Although once at the forefront of the Government's presentation,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov't Pre-Trial Br. 29, Professor Hauser's survey now finds itself in the background, with even Professor Shapiro minimizing his reliance on it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2360:22-24 (Shapiro) (\"[Hauser's] twelve percent is corroborative. If I didn't rely on that, if we decided that was unreliable, it wouldn't change my opinions.\"). Professor Shapiro however had good reason to unhitch his analysis from Professor Hauser's internet survey wagon: cross-examination and real-world evidence alike revealed that the survey was inherently unreliable and produced inflated results!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   Before explaining that conclusion, a brief review of Professor Hauser's survey might be helpful. The survey had roughly 1,600 participants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 765:11 (Hauser). Those participants were drawn from an internet panel and then broken into four groups of approximately 400 participants each: three \"test\" groups and one \"control\" group.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 775:10-14, 761:21-762:5 (Hauser). The test groups were presented with an online survey, in which they were presented with questions about their potential responses to Turner blackouts of varying lengths, including a permanent blackout, a one-month blackout, and a one-week blackout.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 775:22-776:6. The control group was not presented with any information about a blackout.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 776:14-18;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2768:8-11 (Rossi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Defendants' survey expert, Professor Rossi, testified that Professor Hauser's survey is \"unreliable\" for any number of reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2768:15 (Rossi). For purposes of the analysis here, 1 need only discuss two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Professor Rossi testified that the survey was drawn in a biased and misleading way, with the effect of overstating the importance of Turner content. Second, Professor Rossi testified that the survey's centerpiece, the intent-to-switch scale, was confusing and skewed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2768:12-2769:8. After considering the expert testimony as well as other evidence calling into question the results of Professor Hauser's survey, I agree with Professor Rossi's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Professor Rossi faulted Professor Hauser's survey as building in bias at the \"priming\" stage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2786:17. Professor Hauser testified that many television viewers think about video programming in terms of specific shows or genres, not channels.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 817:17-818:5. Professor Hauser therefore began his survey by \"priming\" survey respondents to connect genres of programming to specific channels through the use of network logos.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 817:25-818:17;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 824:15-825:6 (sports);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 821:4-12 (special events). According to Professor Rossi, however, Professor Hauser's use of logos was problematic. In particular, Rossi noted that the internet survey \"tend[ed] to visually overemphasize Turner content\" relative to other content by, for example, enumerating the Turner channels in large font or inaccurately over representing the Turner networks relative to other programming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2783:12, 15-17 (Rossi);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2787:9-2788:25 (discussing DX915B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   At one point, the survey presented\n   respondents in the test group with large Turner logos for six straight slides, despite not showing those slides to the control group.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 838:23-839:3 (Hauser);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2789:25-2790:8, 24-25 (Rossi). As Professor Rossi explained, that priming tended to bias respondents in favor of indicating an intent to switch in the event of a Turner blackout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2790:16-17 (Rossi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Professor Rossi testified that Professor Hauser's survey asked respondents to report their answers using a scale that was confusing and, again, likely to cause respondents to overestimate their likelihood of switching distributors in the event of a Turner blackout. Professor Hauser's survey did not squarely ask respondents whether they would switch providers in the event of a Turner blackout. Instead, the internet survey presented respondents with, as it is known in the industry, a \"Juster scale\" by which they answered the question, \"How likely are you to switch your TV provider, on a scale from 1 to 99?\" DX915-152:\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 788:12-18, 814:1-4 (Hauser). The scale included percentages-10%, 20%, 30%, etc.-and accompanying descriptors such as \"very slight possibility,\" \"slight possibility,\" \"some possibility,\" and \"fair possibility.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 813:15-814:19 (Hauser); DX915-152. The results of the Juster scale were translated directly into a subscriber loss rate. Thus, if each respondent rated his or her likelihood of switching at a \"very slight possibility,\" corresponding to 10% on the Juster scale, Professor Hauser's survey would spin out a subscriber loss rate of 10%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 815:20-816:18 (Hauser).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   Professor Hauser's Juster scale had two critical flaws: first, its text descriptions were \"out of w[h]ack with the numbers,\" Tr. 2778:17-21 (Rossi), and, second, Juster scales are particularly unreliable in quantifying consumer choices of this kind,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2779:1-2782:19. Professor Rossi put it in plain terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-353\">\n   Now if I told you that I thought there was a very slight possibility that I would get into a car accident driving from Washington to Baltimore on the Baltimore Washington Parkway this evening, I don't think you would say that was one out of every ten times I attempted that. You might say one out of every thousand or more. So the text description is out of whack with the numbers. And that's true throughout the scale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2778:12-19. Professor Rossi also testified that the survey's text was bound to present skewed results because it \"minimiz[ed] or neglect[ed] many aspects of switching costs\"-that is, the various costs associated with switching distributors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2783:13-14 (Rossi);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2783:19-2786:16 (detailing different kinds of switching costs, including search costs, transactional costs, bundle-derived costs, and psychological costs, and concluding that Professor Hauser's survey failed to adequately account for those costs). That problem casts further doubt on the reliability of the survey.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    H &amp; R Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130667\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/36/#p49\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at 66-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to rely on \"customer survey[ ]\" results in part because survey \"failed to assign\" adequate \"pricing\" data to some of participants' response options).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   More fundamentally, Professor Rossi explained, Juster scales are notoriously inaccurate when used \"as an exact quantification\" of the likelihood that a customer will engage in some future behavior. Tr. 2779:16-21, 2782:2-13 (Rossi). Academic literature cited by both Professors Rossi and Hauser establishes that the average correlation for predictions of this kind falls\n   between .3 and .6.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2779:16-2780:5. Professor Hauser's scale, nonetheless, purports to assign a correlation value of 1.0, that is, a\n   <em>\n    perfect\n   </em>\n   linear association where intent predicts behavior virtually every time.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   2872:15-2781:2, 2872:1-4. And even that unsupported correlation \"basically disappears\" when respondents are asked to predict their behavior with respect to new products or situations-such as a permanent Turner blackout.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2780:15-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   Given the significant questions raised about the design of Professor Hauser's survey, it should come as no surprise that the survey's results were puzzling to expert and fact witnesses alike. Gregory Rigdon, Comcast's chief negotiator, responded to Professor Hauser's one-month blackout loss estimate of 8% by noting, \"[T]hat seems like a big number in one month.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 897:2-3 (Rigdon (Comcast) ). He gave the same answer when asked about the survey's long-term 12% loss estimate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 898:3-5 (\"Q: But in terms of nay group you've ever seen dropped, have you ever seen anything approaching a 12 percent-A. That seems like a big number.\"). Turner CEO John Martin put things a bit more strongly, calling the survey's 8% one-month blackout subscriber loss prediction \"absurd.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 660:9-11 (Martin (Turner) ). Defendants' expert Professor Carlton, for his part, said that the 8% departure rate for one month \"strikes me as way too high\" and is \"nothing like\" the Cable ONE estimate of 1.1% to 1.2% for the actual temporary Turner drop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2491:4-15 (Carlton). Finally, even Professor Shapiro himself noted that Professor Hauser's one-month subscriber loss estimate of 8% \"seems high.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2360:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Of course, if Professor Hauser's survey generated inflated one-month subscriber loss estimates as compared to real-world evidence, that fact \"cast[s] doubt on what Professor Hauser is doing\" with the survey design generally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2491:4-15 (Carlton). It is therefore small wonder why both the Government and Professor Shapiro have deemphasized the role of the Hauser internet survey. All in all, I can't help but conclude that the internet survey's methods are unreliable and that its results fly in the face of real-world evidence regarding the effect of programming blackouts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   For all of the reasons discussed above, the evidence is not sufficient to support the 9% long-term subscriber loss figure that Professor Shapiro utilized in his model.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Government has the burden of proof as well as the responsibility to demonstrate that its proffered expert testimony has an adequate grounding in evidence, the lack of evidentiary support for Professor Shapiro's input is fatal to the model's probative value in predicting the asserted harm associated with the Government's increased-leverage theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   <em>\n    b. The Evidence Is Insufficient to Support Professor Shapiro's Diversion Rate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   To evaluate the number of customers that AT &amp; T stands to gain from a long-term Turner blackout with a rival distributor, it is necessary to estimate how many of that rivals' customers \"will end up as DirecTV subscribers, either by moving to DirecTV or by staying at DirecTV and not going to\" the rival. Tr. 2240:9-11 (Shapiro). In Professor Shapiro's model, that figure is known as the \"diversion rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2240:13. The diversion rates Professor Shapiro uses differ based on geography. Specifically, Professor Shapiro calculated a diversion rate for each of the local geographic markets based on an assumption that subscribers \"move to the other [distributors], in each local market, to the other distributors proportional[ly] to their marketshare.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2240:23-2241:1-3, 2241:15-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   The parties' main dispute related to diversion rate pertains to \"cord cutting,\" also referred to in this context as the \"outside good.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3871:8-9;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2604:13-17 (Carlton). As is likely familiar by now, an individual \"cuts the cord\" by discontinuing his MVPD subscription and opting instead to receive television programming through an internet-based SVOD like Netflix or Hulu.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 174-75. Professor Shapiro acknowledges that, as a result of cord cutting, \"[d]iversion to AT &amp; T will be reduced to some extent because some current subscribers of a rival MVPD that would leave that MVPD due to a loss of Turner content will cancel their pay-TV service altogether\" rather than \"switch to AT &amp; T or another MVPD that carries Turner.\" Gov't PFOF \u00b6 215;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2241:22-2242:18 (Shapiro). To account for that effect, Professor Shapiro assigns a value to cord cutting of approximately 10%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3871:8-15 (Shapiro).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   According to defendants, Professor Shapiro's 10% figure understates the rate of cord-cutting and, accordingly, results in an inflated diversion rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Plugging that 20% cord-cutting rate into Professor Shapiro's model, defendants' lead expert Professor Carlton testified, would result in a predicted net consumer\n   <em>\n    benefit\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2515:16-20 (Carlton) (if one uses 20% cord-cutting rate in Professor Shapiro's model, then \"Professor Shapiro's 27-cent price increase on average becomes [a] 6-cent benefit, decrease\"). After evaluating the evidence and the parties' arguments on cord cutting, I conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the 10% cord-cutting figure utilized by Professor Shapiro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   The basis for Professor Shapiro's 10% figure was the (by now discredited) Altman Vilandrie slide deck, created for Charter.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2372:8-10 (Shapiro) (\"A: Well, you relied on Altman Vilandrie for what you called the outside good, correct?

Tr. 3871:16-23 (Shapiro). Moreover, Professor Shapiro was unable to explain Altman Vilandrie's choice to reduce the cord-cutting figure, stating only that his \"understanding is Mr. Bewley explained he did that based on evidence that reflected market conditions in Altman Vilandrie, as part of their analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3872:4-8.

With respect to SNL Kagan data, Professor Carlton testified that the data shows that \"[a]round 20 percent\" of \"total TV households\" are \"cord cutters.\" Tr. 2505:12-18 (Carlton).\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   SNL Kagan's 20% figure, defendants state, aligns with other industry evidence about the extent of cord cutting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

That evidence about the\n   <em>\n    increasing\n   </em>\n   presence of cord cutting in the market, in the Court's view, undercuts yet another\n   aspect of Professor Shapiro's measures of cord cutting-namely, that they apparently \"declin[e] over time\" because of a particular \"feature of his model.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2448:7-9 (Carlton).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   In the final analysis, it is the Government's burden to adequately support its proffered model's harm-and, necessarily, the model's inputs-through the testimony of its expert or related evidence. The utter lack of explanation regarding Altman Vilandrie's methodology for generating the cord-cutting projection upon which Professor Shapiro relied, coupled with defendants' real-world evidence regarding the prevalence of cord cutting in the industry, leaves me with little confidence in the accuracy of Professor Shapiro's 10% cord-cutting figure. As with the long-term subscriber loss estimates, I therefore conclude that the Government has also failed to provide adequate support for Professor Shapiro's diversion rate estimate and thus the model's predicted net consumer harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   <em>\n    c.

Tr. 2508:3 (Carlton);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3844:9 (Shapiro). That $821 figure-disclosed by an AT &amp; T witness and Professor Carlton after Professor Shapiro's initial expert report and the close of fact discovery, but before Professor Shapiro's rebuttal report and the start of trial-is approximately 40% lower than the 2016 margin figure used by Professor Shapiro to generate his original estimates of net consumer harm.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2448:17-2449:1 (Carlton). Defendants argue that using the $821 figure from 2017, rather than the $1,324 figure from 2016, significantly reduces the net consumer harm predicted by Professor Shapiro's model.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2507:20-22 (\"[I]f margins go down, Professor Shapiro will predict lower increases in Turner content, even in his own model.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2508:17-21 (using \"the more up-to-date\" profit margin figures \"eliminates a large fraction of all [of Professor Shapiro's predicted] harms\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   At trial, each side spent much time attempting to justify, or impugn, Professor Shapiro's reliance on the 2016 versus 2017 LTV data. The Government, for its part, raised questions about the genesis and legitimacy of the late-breaking 2017 margin data; on that score, it requested, and was granted, the opportunity to depose the AT &amp; T executive responsible for compiling and producing the data. Defendants, on the other hand, questioned Professor Shapiro extensively about his continued reliance on the 2016 LTV data in the face of deposition testimony\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Professor Carlton's report, both of which disclosed updated 2017 LTV figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   While I have no reason to doubt Professor Shapiro's good faith in continuing to rely upon the 2016 LTV data during his direct testimony, for present purposes, the important point is this: the trial evidence indicates that Professor Shapiro's 2016 LTV figures, and thus his measure of AT &amp; T's margins, are outdated and too high. That is true whether they are compared against the \"most current finalized\" June 2017 LTV figure ($821) cited by Professor Carlton,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3844:18, 3849:14-23 (Shapiro), or instead against an average of all three of the 2017 LTVs that had been finalized at the time of trial,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2585:13-22 (Carlton).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   At trial, AT &amp; T witness David Christopher testified about AT &amp; T's method for generating the 2017 LTV data; he also confirmed the values of the finalized LTVs for January, April, and June 2017.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3001:9-17, 3011:11-17 (Christopher (AT &amp; T) ). Although the Government rightly points out that such LTV numbers can (and, in the case of the 2017 LTVs, do) fluctuate from month to month,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 3015:10-24, the overall \"downward trend is the same,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3016:4;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 3003:15-3004:15 (discussing downward pressures on LTVs). The declining state of AT &amp; T's 2017 LTVs, moreover, aligns with the testimony of numerous witnesses regarding the continued decrease of video margins in the distribution industry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 3852:22-25 (Shapiro) (\"Q: And you are aware, sir, of the testimony of pretty much every other competitor witness in this case who has testified that their video margin are going down, right? A: Yes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   Given that evidence, it is perhaps unsurprising that even Professor Shapiro conceded during his rebuttal testimony that he \"think[s] there's some validity to using the 2017 margin instead of the 2016 margins.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3810:10-11;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 3843:17-18 (\"[I]t would be reasonable to use the 2017 margins if one did it in the context of the rest of my analysis.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3849:5-8 (\"Then when I'm given more data later and now we've had the trial, I understand that more; that's why I said this time around, I could see using the 2017 data.\"). Professor Shapiro also confirmed that using an average of all finalized 2017 LTVs would generate a 2016 net increase in MVPD costs of $98 million per year-a number \"significantly lower\" than his original estimate of $235 million in MVPD costs.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3849:24-3851:3. Those lower MVPD costs, in turn, would decrease the predicted harm to consumers from the $.27 per-subscriber-per-month figure Professor Shapiro testified about to a figure of approximately $.13 per-subscriber-per-month.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3851:6-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   In view of the above evidence, I agree with defendants that the 2016 margin data utilized by Professor Shapiro is outdated and inflated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether one substitutes\n   that figure for the June 2017 LTV data or an average of all of the finalized 2017 LTV data in Professor Shapiro's model, the result is a significant decrease in the predicted amount of net consumer harm. Although that decrease, standing alone, does not eliminate all of the harms generated by Professor Shapiro's model (just the bulk of them), it provides yet another reason to reject the predictions offered by Professor Shapiro at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   <em>\n    d. The Model's Failure to Account for the Real-World Effects of Turner's Long-Term Contracts Further Undermines Its Probative Value\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   Turner is currently party to long-term affiliate agreements with nearly all of its distributors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2316:3-18 (Shapiro);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2444:10-23 (Carlton);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX211; PX410; PX422.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those agreements, Professor Shapiro concedes, will \"prevent [Turner] from raising the fees for some number of years\" and thus \"temporarily constraint[ ]\" his predicted effects of the merger in the real-world. Tr. 2209:8-9, 16 (Shapiro). In running his model and rendering his predictions, however, Professor Shapiro curiously chose to ignore Turner's current affiliate agreements.

Indeed, Professor Shapiro conceded that by simply factoring in the presence of one such affiliate agreement with a large distributor (which the Court will not name for confidentiality purposes), the total MVPD price increase predicted by his model decreases by \"about one-third\"-a decrease that \"take[s] away the vast majority the net effect\" on MVPD monthly costs.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2317:25-2318:6, 2319:10-16;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2617:12-2618:13 (Carlton) (factoring in that \"one contract\" reduces MVPD harm projection to \"roughly a 5-cent projected price increase instead of a 27-cent price increase\"). Not surprisingly, Professor Carlton testified that simply by accounting for all current affiliate agreements and making no other changes to Professor Shapiro's model, the model would generate a predicted net\n   <em>\n    benefit\n   </em>\n   to consumers rather than a net harm for the years 2016 and 2017.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2513:1-9 (2017) (discussing DXD116);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2515:25-2516:1 (2016) (discussing DXD116).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   In other words, given Turner's existing contracts, the level of post-merger harms predicted by Professor Shapiro's existing model would not begin to phase in until at least 2021.

As Randall Stephenson put it, the proposed merger is a \"vision deal\" reflecting a belief \"that distribution of [Time Warner] content to wireless will drive the value of the content up\" and that \"the ability to pair our data with [Time Warner's] advertising inventory\" for digital ads delivered over the internet \"will drive value.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3402:24-3403:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Against that evidence, the Government cites a handful of AT &amp; T documents and statements related to virtual MVPDs-documents the Government says show AT &amp; T has the incentive to slow the rise of virtual MVPDs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   PX42; PX228; PX40; PX47; PX48. For multiple reasons, however, I do not consider the fact that AT &amp; T executives may have previously expressed displeasure with Turner's relationships with its competitor virtual MVPDs to be probative of AT &amp; T's post-merger economic incentive to license Turner content to virtual MVPDs. First, these statements shed no light on the post-merger incentive AT &amp; T would have to maximize distribution of Turner content. As the reader now knows, wide distribution is the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of the programming industry, driving both subscription and advertising revenue. Indeed, because of these \"[gains] from trade\" associated with licensing Turner content as broadly as possible, Professor Shapiro himself refused to countenance the Government's unilateral virtual MVPD theory. Tr. 2293:12-17. Second, these statements do not explain why AT &amp; T would discard the profits associated with increased video consumption by its 100 million-plus wireless subscribers accessing virtual MVPD offerings. In short, the Government's\n   evidence on its unilateral withholding theory is fatally anemic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   <em>\n    Second,\n   </em>\n   from the other direction, the Government advances an alternative unilateral claim: that AT &amp; T would have the ability to break the \"skinny bundle\" models of virtual MVPDs by forcing those distributors to take\n   <em>\n    too many\n   </em>\n   Turner networks. Citing the testimony of Sling's President, Warren Schlichting, the Government argues that a post-merger requirement that Sling \"take eight Turner networks instead of four would 'break [Sling's] model' \" and, indeed, would have a snowball effect with other programmers. Gov't PFOF \u00b6 288 (quoting Tr. 265:17-266:8, 268:9-23 (Schlichting (DISH) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   That argument, however, ignores that Turner has less of an imperative to risk a deal with Sling (or other virtual MVPDs) by insisting on carriage of all of its networks. That is so, the evidence indicates, because Turner has a highly \"concentrated portfolio of networks,\" Tr. 558:1 (Martin (Turner) ), with 85 to 90% of Turner's revenues deriving from only four networks,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' PCOL \u00b6 51 n.39;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 75. That fact, as Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes noted-means Turner is \"better placed\" to succeed in the skinny bundle model. Tr. 3126:22. The Government's skinny bundle point also overlooks the fact that Turner-like other programmers-already fights tooth and nail to get all of its networks into all of the packages of every distributor.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 433:18-21 (Schlichting (DISH) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 606:5-11 (Martin (Turner) ).

Indeed, the Court need look no further than the testimony of Professor Shapiro in that regard. When questioned at trial about the Government's coordinated effects theory, Professor Shapiro conceded that he had no \"way of accessing [sic] the probability\" of coordination and thus had not attempted to \"quantif[y] any risk whatsoever\" that the predicted coordination \"could occur.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2291:25-2292:13 (Shapiro).\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   Professor Shapiro confirmed that he was \"not in a position to say\" that coordination is \"more likely to happen than not,\" and indeed was not even prepared to say that there's a \"one percent chance that coordination will happen\" as a result of the challenged merger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2292:6-13.

AT &amp; T's John Stankey, who will be responsible for running Time Warner should the challenged merger proceed, emphatically (and credibly) stated at trial that he could not \"even imagine\" aligning with Comcast given the companies' history of dealings, adding, \"I'm not going to cooperate with somebody I don't like.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3255:2-3256:2 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) ).

Nor can it be questioned that AT &amp; T's strong positioning in the world of mobile content distribution gives it a powerful disincentive to work with Comcast to stifle those mobile providers of video. AT &amp; T has plainly positioned itself to ride industry tailwinds in support of mobile consumption of video. As John Stankey explained, AT &amp; T acquired DirecTV in 2015 not in order to double down on the satellite business, a concededly mature and declining asset, but to \"pick up a lot of new customers that we could work on migrating\" to new products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3207:18-20 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) );\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 3207:21-3208:2. Indeed, as soon as the merger closed, AT &amp; T began renegotiating DirecTV's contracts to allow for a mobile, direct-to-consumer option, DirecTV Now. AT &amp; T knew that it was \"in a foot race to basically start to change the product to be able to catch the next wave, whatever that next wave was going to be.

Nowhere does the Government explain why AT &amp; T would deploy valuable Time Warner content to prop up a rival's business model, while harming its own. Go figure!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   This fundamental problem of incentives and profitability buries the Government's claim. It is beyond dispute that neither the proffered concentration in the MVPD market (which, by the way, will be the same post-merger),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 306, nor the importance of Turner and NBCU content,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 307, nor some transparency in \"key information,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 308-310, nor any other of the Government's evidence on the coordination theory (alone or in combination), can establish a \"risk of coordination\" unless the parties have an incentive or interest to collude in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   Even assuming, contrary to the evidence, that AT &amp; T would want to coordinate with Comcast under the Government's theory, the staggered, lengthy industry contracts would make that coordination strategy extremely risky.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 643:20-644:2 (Martin (Turner) ) (testifying that \"because of the length of these contracts, because they're typically years in length,\" a strategy set \"in 2013\" would \"begin to show up in '15, '16 and '17\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:9-11 (Fenwick (Cox) ) (testifying that affiliate agreements run \"between five and eight years on average\"). Under the Government's coordination theory, one party-AT &amp; T or Comcast-would have to \"jump first,\" giving up valuable programming rights on the hope that the other, in some years' time, would elect to do the same. Indeed, this barrier to coordination is so great as to put to rest the notion not only that AT &amp; T and Comcast would have the\n   <em>\n    incentive\n   </em>\n   to coordinate, but that the post-merger marketplace would afford them the\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to do so. Whether by way of tacit coordination or an illegal agreement, putting such blind faith in one's chief competitor strikes this Court as exceedingly implausible! Indeed, the decision to \"not to renew [a] license or not to license to a new virtual MVPD and wait and see if the other did it,\" as Professor Shapiro proposes, would\n   <em>\n    enhance\n   </em>\n   the other party's position in its next round of negotiations with the virtual MVPD at issue. Tr. 2264:14-2265:13 (Shapiro). As Charter's Tom Montemagno explained, if a distributor goes dark with one network group, that distributor is in \"a vulnerable spot, and I feel like I sort of have to do the deal\" when another network group threatens a blackout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1404:13-15. The result would be forgone revenue for a period of years, with AT &amp; T's chief competitor gaining outsized profits in the next round of negotiations.

The basic idea, the Government tells us, is that rival distributors' use of HBO in promotions will tend to draw potential customers to those MVPDs and away from AT &amp; T, thereby giving AT &amp; T reason to withhold or restrict its consent to use HBO in marketing, discounts, and bundles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6 234.

This is because the Government's promotion-withholding theory conflicts with HBO's business model, which remains \"heavily dependent\" on promotion by distributors. Tr. 3074:5-6 (Bewkes (Time Warner) ). HBO does not run ads, leaving subscription fees as its overwhelming source of revenue.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3070:3-5; PX456-67.

Third-party distributor witnesses testified that, for example, their companies had reduced the use of HBO in promotions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 950:22-951:7 (SEALED);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2135:17-22, 2135:24-2136:1 (Sejen (Cable ONE) ).

This is all consistent with other evidence adduced at trial, which showed that distributors' choice of which premium content provider to use for promotions may vary based on a number of factors.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1526:17-25 (Patel (AT &amp; T) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the evidence at trial further\n   showed that MVPDs are hardly limited to premium content providers like HBO, Showtime, and Netflix in their choice of promotional tools; to the contrary, distributors have been known to bundle services with gift cards, price discounts, higher broadband speeds, additional telephone lines, video on demand films, devices such as iPads, and free installations or equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 717:15-25 (Hinson (Cox) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2972:1-6 (Holanda (RCN) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1497:5-10 (Sutton (HBO) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   Although this promotion-withholding theory made only a very brief appearance at trial, the Government asserts that this theory of harm constitutes an independent basis for blocking the merger. Gov't PCOL \u00b6\u00b6 61-62; Gov't Pre-Trial Br. 40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in support of this theory, the Government has brought to bear little evidence indeed. As with its primary, increased-leverage claim of harm, the Antitrust Division decided to spill most of its ink developing undisputed facts-HBO is popular,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 28, 235-242, valuable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 235, 243-252, and an effective promotional tool for MVPDs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 253-258. The Government also relays the undisputed fact that HBO, as a matter of contract, retains significant control over the way in which its \"trademarks or ... talent\" are used in those promotions. Tr. 1458:10-13 (Sutton (HBO) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't PFOF \u00b6\u00b6 269-270 (discussing approval process for use of HBO in promotions). It did not, however, come to Court with economic evidence of any kind,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2291:4-7 (Shapiro), and proffered only bare conjecture about how there may be \"like a thumb on the scale\" in favor of the Government's promotion-withholding stratagem,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2267:8-21;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2267:3-7. As such, the Government's evidence is too thin a reed for this Court to find that AT &amp; T has, in that well-worn turn-of-phrase, either the \"incentive\" or the \"ability\" to withhold HBO promotional rights in order to \"lessen competition substantially.\" Gov't PCOL \u00b6 61. For these reasons, it is small wonder that Professor Shapiro himself refused to endorse the theory, testifying that, in his view as an economist, such a ploy \"[o]n its own ... would not have such a big impact, that it would substantially lessen competition.\" Tr. 2275:24-2276:13 (Shapiro).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   For these two, independent reasons, the Government has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its final theory in this case. Accordingly, I reject outright the assertion that the combined entity would likely restrict HBO as a promotional tool in order to harm AT &amp; T's distribution\n   rivals and thereby lessen competition in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   The parties have waged an epic battle, under extremely restricted deadlines, to litigate and try this historic vertical merger case. Each side's evidence and theories have been subjected to cross-examination and the rigors of the Rules of Evidence and Civil Procedure. It has been a herculean task for all the parties and the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each side has had its proverbial day in Court. The Court has now spoken and the defendants have won. But, the process is not quite over yet!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   There is a grave and understandable fear on the part of the defendants that the Government will now seek to do\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   what it couldn't accomplish directly by seeking a stay of this Court's order pending an appeal to our Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   The consequences of receiving such a stay would cause irreparable harm to the defendants in general and AT &amp; T in specific. First, it would effectively prevent the consummation of the merger by the June 21, 2018 break-up date for the deal. Second, it would cause AT &amp; T to have to pay the $500 million break-up fee it will owe to Time Warner if the deal is not consummated by that date. Those two consequences, of course, would occur regardless of whether this Court's decision were later upheld following appellate review. In this Court's judgment, a stay pending appeal would be a manifestly unjust outcome in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   The Government has had this merger on hold now since October of 2016 when it launched its investigation. In that 18-plus month period, the companies have twice extended the break-up date to accommodate the Government's litigation of this case. During that same period, the video programming and distribution industry has continued to evolve at a breakneck pace. The cost to the defendants and the Government to investigate, litigate, and try this case has undoubtedly been staggering-easily in the tens of millions of dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   If the Government were to ask me to stay this Court's ruling, I would, under the law, have to weigh whether the Government has a strong likelihood of success on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm should the stay be denied, among other things. Well, suffice it to say-as my 170-plus page opinion makes clear-I do not believe that the Government has a likelihood of success on the merits of an appeal. And in my judgment, given that our Circuit Court has never hesitated to unwind an unblocked merger if the law and facts warrant doing so, there would be no irreparable harm to the Government-only to the defendants-if my ruling were stayed. As such, I could not, and would not, grant such a stay in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   That of course is not to suggest in any way that the Government should not consider seeking appellate review of the merits of this Court's decision. That is, by any standard, fair game. But the temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   The Government here has taken its best shot to block the merger based on the law and facts, and within the time allowed. The defendants did their best to oppose it. The Court has spoken. To use a stay to accomplish\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   what could not be done directly-especially when it would cause certain irreparable harm to the defendants-simply would be unjust. I hope and trust that the Government will have the good judgment, wisdom, and courage to\n   avoid such a manifest injustice. To do otherwise, I fear, would undermine the faith in our system of justice of not only the defendants, but their millions of shareholders and the business community at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   Thus, for all of the foregoing reasons, the Government's request to enjoin the proposed merger is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-423\">\n    For consistency throughout this Opinion, I will use the phrase \"video programming and distribution industry\" to include creation, packaging, and distribution of professionally produced video content.

Gov't PFOF \u00b6 36. I agree with defendants that the Government's arguments (and the corresponding witness testimony) on that score defy reality, as demonstrated by the evidence adduced at trial. The evidence clearly showed that the leading SVODs-as vertically-integrated entities that produce and distribute their own award-winning content-fiercely compete\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    with programmers such as Turner and HBO\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    with traditional MVPDs and virtual MVPDs. Indeed, industry data reflects that large percentages of MVPD customers have chosen to \"cut the cord\" and receive content exclusively from SVODs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    pp. 174-76.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-429\">\n    To be sure, the Government contends that, notwithstanding the increasing prevalence of SVODs, \"[e]ven programmers believe MVPDs are likely to remain highly profitable in the future.\" Gov't PFOF \u00b6 13. That proposition rests on a document from May 2016.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (citing PX78). As the Court learned at trial, however, the industry has undergone significant changes since mid-2016, diminishing the persuasiveness of that statement and others like it. To take just one example, video programming margins are declining, a fact that presents an obvious threat to future MVPD profitability. Tr. 3853:18-19 (Shapiro) (\"I think it is not disputed that the video margins are going down.\"). And while the Court accepts that traditional MVPDs continue to have a substantial subscriber base, and indeed may currently constitute a distinct submarket,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    pp. 195-97, it is inescapable that SVODs have played a large role in causing the demand for and continued purchase of traditional MVPD subscriptions to \"declin[e] at a rapid pace.\" Tr. 3450:7-3451:1 (Stephenson (AT &amp; T) ). To ignore those industry trends-trends that are transforming how consumers view video content and blurring the lines between programming, distribution, and web-based competitors-would be to ignore the Supreme Court's direction to examine this case with an eye toward the \"structure, history, and probable future\" of this fast-changing industry.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

At trial, defendants presented the Court with documentary and testimonial evidence concerning efficiencies likely to flow from the proposed merger. The efficiencies, defendants explain, come both on the \"cost\" side, and on the \"revenue\" side. By defendants' calculations, cost synergies will total $1.5 billion and revenue synergies $1 billion on an annual basis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 3234:17-3235:14 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) ). On the cost side, AT &amp; T's John Stankey testified that the marriage of AT &amp; T and Time Warner will lead to the elimination of redundant positions in each company, achievement of certain economies of scale, and insourcing of services that the acquired entity currently acquires from vendors.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 3235:22-3240:1. And on the revenue side, AT &amp; T and Time Warner expect to see the gains in innovation-particularly by way of a new programmatic advertising platform-that motivated the merger in the first place.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 3229:20-25, 3240:2-3246:9.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-445\">\n    Putting aside the revenue synergies, which, by their nature, are more uncertain, I have a high degree of confidence that defendants will generate most, if not all, of the predicted $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2021.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 3234:13-20. AT &amp; T derives its prediction through the same rigorous analytical process applied in each of its mergers.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 3226:1-3229:3;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    DX658. Most recently, in the acquisition of DirecTV, AT &amp; T exceeded cost synergy predictions, which now total $2 billion annually. Tr. 3229:4-8, 3369:21-3370:4 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) ). Indeed, it is uncontested that AT &amp; T has a strong record of meeting similar cost synergy estimates in past mergers.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 3229:2-3, 3229:9;\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    at 3226:3-5.

Dep't of Justice &amp; Fed. Trade Comm'n, Horizontal Merger Guidelines \u00a7 10 (Aug. 19, 2010). Thus, while not necessary to my final judgment in this case, defendants have presented persuasive, probative evidence that the merger will produce even more efficiencies than those accounted for in this Opinion.

To appropriately apply judicial estoppel against a party, the \"party's later position must be 'clearly inconsistent' with its earlier position\"; courts also consider whether the party has \"succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position\" or would \"derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-458\">\n    Applying those factors, I easily conclude that estoppel is not appropriate here. To start, the cited prior regulatory comments are not \"clearly inconsistent\" with defendants' current positions: predicting that a different vertical transaction, made at an earlier time period and in a less-competitive market, will shift bargaining outcomes is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    inconsistent with arguing that the Government has failed to carry its burden of proof to show at trial that a different transaction, proposed in the context of an even more competitive market, is likely to similarly shift outcomes (much less substantially lessen competition).\n    <em>\n     Maine\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n     532 U.S. at 750\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n     121 S.Ct. 1808\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Jankovic v.

Cir. 2016) (declining to apply estoppel when party's position was not inconsistent). Although that consideration alone is fatal to the Government's estoppel argument, the Court further notes that the equities also weigh against applying estoppel here. The Government investigated the proposed merger for approximately one year before filing its suit. Disputes regarding the applicability of an increased-leverage theory as applied to the transaction have been front and center in the litigation, and were fully aired at trial. Given all that, I am hard pressed to understand how the Government would suffer an \"unfair detriment\" if defendants are not estopped; if anything, it would seem manifestly unfair to defendants to accept the Government's post-trial estoppel argument that much of the trial evidence can be ignored and indeed substituted with decades-old regulatory filings.

In the Court's view, however, it is worth noting that the Government's retreat from Professor Shapiro's model cannot be squared with Professor Shapiro's testimony (seemingly approved by the Government) that to perform a valid \"vertical merger analysis\" under the applicable \"consumer welfare\" standard, it is necessary to \"balance\" or \"tradeoff\" the merger's proconsumer benefits with any predicted consumer harms.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 2180:8-2181:8, 2182:7-21, 2253:4-5 (Shapiro).

Given all that, it is perhaps unsurprising that, for all of the testimony about the \"very intense and aggressive\" nature of affiliate negotiations,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 3251:24-25 (Stankey (AT &amp; T) ), Professor Shapiro testified that Turner has\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    experienced a long-term blackout with a distributor,\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    at 2357:12-14 (Shapiro).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-467\">\n    To understand why, note that Professor Shapiro's opinion incorporates the \"key\" recognition that each side's bargaining leverage \"is based on what would happen if there were no deal.\" Tr. 2193:16-18 (Shapiro). Simply stated, if a party's alternative to striking a deal improves, that party is more willing and able to push harder for a better deal because it faces less downside risk if the deal implodes. Professor Shapiro gave an example of negotiations between a seller and buyer of a used car; he noted that if the seller's next-best offer improves, he will be able to extract a higher price from the original buyer.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 2213:2-10.

The evidence showed that there have been two short-term blackouts of Turner content with distributors: 1) a thirty-day blackout with Cable ONE in October 2013, which resulted in \"fairly insignificant\" subscriber losses in the range of about .6%, Tr. 2116:10-13, 2127:21-2128:2 (Sejen (Cable ONE) ); and 2) a thirty-day blackout with DISH in November 2014, in which some Turner networks-including CNN, but not TBS or TNT-were blacked out, resulting in a loss of less than 1% of DISH subscribers,\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    at 388:10-389:5 (Schlichting (DISH) ). Those subscriber loss figures simply cannot be squared with some of the figures represented in the sources upon which Professor Shapiro relied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"46\">\n   <p id=\"p-481\">\n    Because the evidence does not support use of Professor Shapiro's 9% \"low end\" long-term subscriber loss rate, it stands to reason that the larger 14% long-term subscriber loss rate he used to generate the high end of his predicted harm range is also unsupported. Tr. 3851:21-3852:8 (Shapiro). The same goes for the higher 12% and 16% long-term subscriber loss rates he used, rather curiously and contrary to the Altman Vilandrie slide deck upon which he claimed to rely, to generate the predicted harms for a 2017 and 2021 market configuration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 2493:9-2495:18 (Carlton). Professor Shapiro's appeal to the fact that he predicted a range of harm is therefore unavailing: He is not \"suffering the consequences of being conservative\" in his estimates, Tr. 3852:1-2 (Shapiro), the consequences arise because even his conservative estimate lacks sufficient evidentiary support and reliability. The same can be said for the Government's post-trial submissions regarding the \"conservative[ ]\" nature of Professor Shapiro's analysis. Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"47\">\n   <p id=\"p-482\">\n    To be sure, the Government, through the rebuttal testimony of Professor Shapiro, attempted to rebuff Professor Carlton's 20% cord-cutting rate. Professor Shapiro pointed out that, in the context of examining the consequences of a Turner blackout, it is \"pretty likely\" that a departing customer would \"want to go somewhere else where you can get the Turner content.\" Tr. 3808:11-12 (Shapiro). Thus, Professor Shapiro continued, stating that \"20 percent of American households don't have pay-TV service\" overall is \"beside the point.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3808:5-6, 15. Were it defendants' obligation to provide sufficient support for the departure rate in Professor Shapiro's model, rather than Professor Shapiro's, that rebuff would perhaps be persuasive. But even accepting Professor Shapiro's point about defendants' proposed rate, that point does not prove that the departure rate\n    <em>\n     he\n    </em>\n    proffered had adequate evidentiary support.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"48\">\n   <p id=\"p-483\">\n    Specifically, David Christopher testified to the June 2017 LTV figure during his deposition on February 14, 2018.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 3002:16-25. Although Professor Shapiro's report cites Christopher's deposition, on the stand Professor Shapiro admitted that he did not read that deposition transcript and did not in fact know David Christopher's role in the case.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 2345:17-2346:3 (Shapiro) (\"Q: If 1 told you that you cited to [Christopher's] deposition in your report, does that ring a bell? A: No. Q: Well, did you read his deposition? A: 1 did not.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"49\">\n   <p id=\"p-484\">\n    With his model's original reliance on the 2016 LTVs under attack, Professor Shapiro's rebuttal testimony doubled down on an argument relating to the value of AT &amp; T's existing customers. The argument proceeds as follows. In addition to calculating LTVs for newly acquired video customers, AT &amp; T assigns margin values to its existing video subscribers. Those values, known as active customer values (\"ACVs\"), are generally higher than LTVs because they do not account for \"subscriber acquisition costs.\" Tr. 3854:22-3855:4 (Shapiro). Professor Shapiro's long-term subscriber loss rate includes a measure of the existing customers that AT &amp; T will retain as a result of a long-term Turner blackout on its distribution rivals. The value of those maintained customers, Professor Shapiro opines, is likely \"50 percent higher\" than the margin value for new-customers.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2244:13-21. Professor Shapiro did not, however attempt to generate or otherwise assign a \"measure of the margin on the retained subscribers.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2244:9-10. Instead, his model only incorporates the margin value associated with new subscribers.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2244:22. As a result, Professor Shapiro states that his \"margin figure is definitely understated and substantially understated because I don't have the proper data on the value of the retained customers.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2244:14-17.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-485\">\n    Therein lies the problem. Although opining about the importance of the value of retained customers to AT &amp; T, Professor Shapiro undertook no analysis to incorporate that overall effect into his model. That should come as little surprise, given that this \"larger point\" appeared only in footnote 414 of the ninth appendix to Professor Shapiro's 300-page expert report; nonetheless, it renders his reliance on the existing-versus-new customer distinction unconvincing.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3809:18, 3855:5-3856:5. That footnote, Professor Shapiro testified, indicates that \"the value of existing subscribers [is] between 150 and 225 percent as large as new subscribers.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3813:13-17. Beyond footnote 414's general observation, Professor Shapiro did not attempt to quantify the total dollar value of existing customers' margins versus new customer margins, much less incorporate a figure for existing customer margins into his model.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2244:22-2245:1 (\"But, again, the data I have available, I'm using those gross add margins.\"). On rebuttal, Professor Shapiro nonetheless cited that \"higher number\" as \"what gives me a higher end of my range\" of projected harm.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3819:25-3820:7. That does not appear to be the case: elsewhere, Professor Shapiro testified that the \"higher end\" of the range derives from his use of a higher long-term subscriber loss rate of 14% (as compared to the 9% rate he chose to present to the Court during his direct testimony), rather than any alterations to other inputs, such as the margin data.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2259:4-8 (\"I realize there are ranges here. These are based on, we're starting from the low end, 9 percent subscriber loss rate, and projecting that. So if we started with the 14 percent, we'd have higher numbers.\");\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    at 2239:3-7. Professor Shapiro's belated attempts to link his point regarding the increased margins for existing customers to the high-end projections he reported, or to present those increased margins as if they were quantified and incorporated into his model, are thus unavailing and further undermine the credibility of his presentation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"50\">\n   <p id=\"p-486\">\n    The primary exception is Charter, which has been displaying Turner content pursuant to temporary, short-term extensions of the companies' affiliate agreement, which initially expired in 2016.\n    <em>\n     See Tr.\n    </em>\n    1353:21-1354:3 (Montemagno (Charter) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"51\">\n   <p id=\"p-487\">\n    Although they amount to \"extra icing on a cake already frosted,\" there are even more reasons to be skeptical of the Government's increased-leverage theory of competitive harm.\n    <em>\n     Yates v.

The Government's remaining fact evidence similarly fails to establish any incentive to act, unilaterally or coordination, to stifle virtual MVPDs. To the extent the Government seeks to recycle the slide deck, PX184, PX543, or Schlichting's testimony for its virtual claims, that evidence remains of limited probative value for the reasons stated above.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    pp. 208-09 (PX184, PX543);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    pp. 202-04 (Schlichting testimony).

This statement does not accomplish the work that the Government thinks it does. For starters, as discussed above, the very \"skinny bundle\" concept embraces fewer networks-even fewer popular ones-with the knowledge that some consumers will welcome the trade of fewer networks for a lower subscription fee.
