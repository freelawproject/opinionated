Background\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      According to the operative Complaint, on August 26, 2014, Benjamin North, then a student at Catholic, attended a house party near campus, where he met Jane Doe. First Am. Compl. \u00b6 15. After spending some time with each other throughout the night, Mr. North and Ms. Doe engaged in sexual intercourse in an unoccupied room in the house, after which Mr. North walked Ms. Doe back to her dorm room.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 16-21. The next day, after exchanging several text messages, Mr. North and Ms. Doe saw each other and agreed to remain friends.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Over two months later, on October 29, 2014, a friend informed Mr. North that a rumor was circulating that the sexual encounter between him and Ms. Doe was not consensual.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 25. The next day, after agreeing over text message to Mr. North's request to meet to discuss the rumor, Ms. Doe allegedly represented to Mr. North that their sexual encounter was consensual.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 27. A year after that, on October 30, 2015, Ms. Doe reported to the University's Department of Public Safety Captain and Title IX deputy coordinator that she did\n     not consent to the sexual intercourse.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 28.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      The report prompted an investigation by the University, which, as a recipient of federal funds, is forbidden by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 from discriminating on the basis of sex in its school operations.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. The Department of Education regulations on sexual harassment (\"2001 Guidance\")-promulgated by notice-and-comment rulemaking-afford \"due process to both parties involved\" by providing an \"[a]dequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints, including the opportunity to present witnesses and other evidence\" and giving employees \"adequate training as to what conduct constitutes sexual harassment.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 35-37. In April 2011, the Department of Education issued a guidance document, known as a \"Dear Colleague Letter,\" that detailed compliance with Title IX to include, among other procedures, the \"equal opportunity [by the complainant and the accused student] to present relevant witnesses and other evidence,\" \"similar and timely access [by both parties] to any information that will be used at the hearing,\" to \"maintain documentation of all proceedings,\" and for the \"fact-finder and decision-maker [to] have adequate training or knowledge regarding sexual violence.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 38. A further guidance document issued by the Department of Education in April 2014 further detailed compliance to include an \"adequate, reliable, impartial, and prompt [investigation] and include the opportunity for both parties to present witnesses and other evidence\" and for \"[a]ll persons involved in conducting a school's Title IX investigations [to] must have training or experience in handling complaints of sexual violence and in the school's grievance procedures.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 39.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      Mr. North alleges a multitude of errors throughout the University's investigation, including that its procedures \"have no provisions to (1) allow an accused to appropriately and thoroughly respond to allegations, (2) ensure proper vetting or introduction of evidence, including witness testimony, and (3) train individuals to appropriately conduct investigation[s] and hearings, including the evaluation of relevant evidence.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 100. In support, he alleges,\n      <em>\n       inter alia\n      </em>\n      , that University officials showed favor to Ms. Doe from the inception of the investigation through the Student Disciplinary Hearing (the \"Hearing\") that found Mr. North responsible for sexually assaulting Ms. Doe and imposed a two and a half year suspension.\n      <em>\n       See id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 52-95. He alleges that during initial interviews with Ms. Doe, Kim Gregory, Captain of the University's Department of Public Safety and Title IX deputy coordinator, inappropriately \"help[ed] Jane Doe create a coherent narrative\" and afforded Ms. Doe the opportunity to \"explain away [Mr. North]'s text messages\" while not providing Mr. North the \"basic information pertaining to Jane Doe's allegations against him.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 52. Mr. North claims that he was not permitted to respond to a redacted \"Official Investigative Report\" (the \"Report\") distributed prior to the Hearing, nor was he provided an unredacted copy of the Report,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, and that Ms. Gregory failed to include in the Report other relevant text messages between himself and Ms. Doe that would\n     have supported his side of the story.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      During an \"University Disciplinary Hearing Intake Meeting\" attended by Mr. North, his counsel, Heidi Zeich (the Assistant Dean of Students), and Desmond Daniels (then Director of Student Conduct and Ethical Development), Ms. Zeich \"repeatedly scoffed at [Mr. North]'s procedural questions [about the upcoming hearing] and was openly hostile to both [Mr. North] and his counsel.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 57. Ms. Zeich also reportedly refused to permit Mr. North's counsel to take notes and said it was school policy that Mr. North was not permitted to know the identities of opposing witnesses,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, even though she did eventually provide Mr. North with a list of Ms. Doe's witnesses nine days before the Hearing.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 64. Ms. Zeich also allegedly refused to permit Mr. North to present a witness at the Hearing to challenge Ms. Doe's statements as included in the Report.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 62.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      Mr. North alleges that during the Hearing, the University permitted several students who did not have direct knowledge of the incident to participate as witnesses for Ms. Doe, but that Ms. Zeich and Jonathan Sawyer, Dean of Students, only permitted one of his witnesses to testify even though his proposed witnesses had direct interactions with Ms. Doe on the night of the incident.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 65-68, 73-79. If permitted to testify, Mr. North proffers that his witnesses would have refuted Ms. Doe's story that she was given three shots of vodka by a third party prior to having sex with Mr. North, that she was drunk that night, and that she was distraught on the walk home from the party.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 74-76. Mr. North also quarrels with not being permitted to ask any of his pre-submitted questions, or questions pertaining to the level of Ms. Doe's intoxication.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 69, 87. He also contends that the Hearing panel dismissed his concern that Ms. Doe's witnesses, who were all held in the same room at Mr. Daniels's and Ms. Zeich's direction, were reportedly \"talking to each other and planning their testimonies,\"\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 82-85, and that the University \"took no corrective action\" after one of Ms. Doe's witnesses admitted to discussing witness testimony with other witnesses.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 91. It was also improper, according to Mr. North, for Ms. Doe's counsel to have been permitted approximately five private meetings in the middle of the Hearing with Ms. Zeich, Mr. Sawyer, and the University's General Counsel without Mr. North's counsel's participation.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 88. Mr. North also alleges that the Hearing board's fact-finders were not appropriately trained for their role and that one of the members was flagrantly not paying attention during the Hearing.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6\u00b6 81, 90. Additionally, when Mr. North's counsel asked Ms. Zeich to keep a record of the proceedings for future litigation, she reportedly refused to commit to doing so.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 94. In Mr. North's views, Ms. Zeich's and the other administrators' actions showed \"open hostility to [Mr. North] and demonstrate[ed] [the University's] disregard for federal regulations.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      <strong>\n       II.

The equivalent in this case would be if the University or its administrators sought to initiate a criminal investigation of Mr. North, knowing him to be not responsible for the conduct alleged. But there is no such allegation here. In the absence of a similar claim of an intentional false report to government authorities, and considering the many parallels between\n      <em>\n       Kerrigan\n      </em>\n      and Mr. North's case, the Court finds that Mr. North has not alleged conduct sufficient to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
