Alleging that the BiOp violates several federal statutes, Plaintiffs have brought this suit against the Secretary of Commerce, NMFS, and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Defendants now move to transfer this action to Massachusetts, where the BiOp was prepared. Because the Court finds that convenience and the interests of justice warrant keeping the matter in the District of Columbia, it will deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The North Atlantic right whale is one of the world's most endangered mammals, with only an estimated 458 creatures alive as of 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 18-112 (Center for Biological Diversity,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   ), Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64. In recent years, the primary cause of death and serious injury for the species\n   has been entanglement in fishing gear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 68. When a right whale becomes entangled, it can die immediately by drowning or over an extended time period from injury, infection, or starvation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 69. From 2010-16, entanglements accounted for 85% of right-whale deaths.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 71. If these trends continue, scientists estimate that the leviathan could become functionally extinct in 23 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Right whales do not maintain a circumscribed habitat, but \"migrate annually from their summer feeding grounds off the Northeast Coast of the United States to their winter breeding grounds off the Southeast Coast.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 62. Because of their migratory pattern, the government has designated the right whale's critical habitat to lie in waters stretching from Maine to Florida.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 18-283 (Conservation Law Foundation), Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. In the Northeast, the right whales swim in many areas where the American lobster fishery, an entity authorized and managed by NMFS, operates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBD Compl., \u00b6 88. The fishery's lobster gear creates a significant risk of entanglement for the whale, particularly in the summer and early fall, when both the mammal's feeding and lobster fishing are at their peak in many of the same waters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two statutes-the Endangered Species Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201531\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Marine Mammal Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   -seek to protect species like the right whale in danger of extinction.

The 2014 BiOp at issue here was \"prepared by biologists in GARFO,\" which is located in Gloucester.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pentony Decl., \u00b6 5.

Defendants do not argue that they will be inconvenienced by litigating here. Plaintiffs obviously find this forum preferable since they brought the case here. And, although they claim that they would have to incur some costs if the case were transferred, the Court disagrees since \"it is unlikely [in this administrative-record case] that the parties or the lawyers for either side will have to appear in court often, and the minimal fees for\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   admission are 'not substantial enough' to tip the balance in a transfer case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Oceana, Inc. v.

The Government's argument that \"the District Court for the District of Massachusetts ... ha[s] greater familiarity with the history of the management regimes applicable to the waters off of Massachusetts, the factual and legal history of that fishery, and the factual and legal issues implicated by this case,\" Mot. at 8, gains little traction. The relevant inquiry is not whether a certain court is familiar with the \"factual and legal history\" of a case, but whether it is more familiar with the \"governing\n   <em>\n    laws\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Trout Unlimited\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650429\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/13/#p16\">\n    944 F.Supp. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 17 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs here challenge federal agency action and charge violations of federal statutes. Resolving this case will thus require statutory interpretation, a task any federal court is competent to undertake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greater Yellowstone Coal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9448557\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/180/124/#p129\">\n    180 F.Supp.2d at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the Court finds that this a case of national, rather than local, importance, this factor weighs heavily against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In trying to cast the dispute as a parochial one, Defendants highlight the connection of the lobstering industry to the Bay State, noting that it \"provide[s] employment, recreation, and other opportunities to the people of Massachusetts.\" Mot. at 10. While this may be true, that does not make this case a local controversy. First, those in Massachusetts are far from the only ones affected. While \"[t]he vast majority of American lobster is landed in states adjacent to the Gulf of Maine,\" that description includes Maine and New Hampshire, too.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pentony Decl., \u00b6 11. Other states along the East Coast, from Connecticut to Virginia, also land lobster, and NMFS's decision thus concerns them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277935\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/49/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The facts here, consequently, present a very different scenario from one in which\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the relevant events and actions occurred in the transferee district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Preservation Society\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277935\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/49/#p53\">\n    893 F.Supp.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the challenged action depended on parallel state proceedings and would be \"funded, overseen, and implemented by a ... state agency on state-owned property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277935\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/49/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277935\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/49/#p53\">\n    at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the\n   <em>\n    regional\n   </em>\n   NMFS office (which happens to be in Massachusetts) manages the American lobster fishery, an entity that spans the East Coast from Maine to Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The effect on the lobster industry, moreover, is incidental to the thrust of Plaintiffs' grievances here, which focus on the right whale.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CLF Compl., \u00b6 122. That whale is a migratory mammal, spending the summer months feeding off the coast of Maine and Massachusetts before heading south to Georgia and Florida for the winter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 66.

Even if the lobster industry has significant ties to that state, the controversy is far broader in scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, as this Court has repeatedly noted, the central question is not \"whether the people of Massachusetts have an interest-even a strong one-in the outcome of this case. Instead, the Court must determine whether this is a 'question[ ] of national policy or national significance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Oceana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127027\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/58/2/#p7\">\n    58 F.Supp.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oceana v.

Whale conservation, indeed, has attracted global attention over the last decades.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the end, it is Defendants' burden to show that the totality of circumstances warrants transfer.
