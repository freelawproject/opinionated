Although in this State the Courts of Common Pleas have no official reporter, it appears that the evidence in these cases was taken at the request of the plaintiffs by a qualified reporter, who supplied a transcript to the trial Judge. Plaintiffs contend that the Court below misconstrued a criminal statute in such way as to render it unconstitutional; that plaintiffs were prejudiced thereby; that the present record fails to disclose this error, which can only be discovered through an examination of the evidence. Plaintiffs further point out that the sentence imposed in each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>case was a fine of $5, wherefore they have no right of appeal; they contend that certiorari is the only available remedy, but that this remedy would be meaningless in these cases unless the evidence is sent up.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The short answer to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions is that the Supreme Court of this State has held that the evidence is not part of' the record in certiorari proceedings. <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>593, 600,140 <em>A. </em>697. Clearly, it would be a futile act to compel the transcript of evidence to be sent up when we could not examine it for alleged error after we received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Two cases have been cited as supporting the proposition that the stenographic record of testimony is a part of the record in certiorari. Neither of them so holds. <em>Douglass v. Reynolds, Byrne &amp; Co., </em>7 <em>Pet. </em>113, 32 <em>U. S. </em>113, 8 <em>L. Ed. </em>626 was before the Supreme Court on a writ of error. <em>Mayor, Aldermen and Inhabitants of New Orleans v. U. S., </em>5 <em>Pet. </em>449, 30 <em>U. S. </em>449, 8 <em>L. Ed. </em>187, was an appeal in a chancery case.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Plaintiffs urge strongly that the denial of their request leaves them without remedy in the Courts of this State. Whether this suggestion is correct may be doubtful. A fairly substantial argument could be made to the contrary. See <em>Knight v. Haley, </em>6 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>366, 176 <em>A. </em>461. In any event, irrespective of whether prohibition would he, this Court is bound by the ruling in the <em>Thompson </em>case, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations must be disallowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
