Defendant also admits that unless the nature of the services performed by plaintiff under the contract in question were \u201cpersonal services\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8110, the plea of the Statute of Limitations cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> It is clear to me that \u00a7 8110 was not designed to apply to the instant case. The very language of the section demonstrates that it has reference to the claims of servants, or members of the laboring classes and salaried employees. This is so because the kind of financial compensation or pay referred to is defined as \u201c* * * wages, salary, or overtime * * *.\u201d It takes no citation of authority to conclude that wages, salary and overtime are definitions of the kind of financial compensation paid, not to the independent contractor, but rather to the worker in the master and servant relationship or to salaried employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Defendant has bolstered its argument by the expedient of lifting the words \u201cpersonal services\u201d out of context and citing certain cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which, in the loose sense of the word refer to the work of an independent contractor as services. But the words \u201cpersonal services\u201d as they appear in \u00a7 8110 must be read in connection with the language of the entire section in order to ascertain their true meaning and, when so done, the conclusion must be as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">It is probably true, as plaintiff\u2019s counsel argues, that \u00a7 8110 was designed to provide a Statute of Limitations for actions brought under the <em>Fair Labor Standards Act, </em>29 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>with particular reference to litigation growing out of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 <em>U. S. </em>680, 66 S. <em>Ct. </em>1187, 90 L. <em>Ed. </em>1515, the famous portal-to-portal decision. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ever, it appears too clear to me that \u00a7 8106, not \u00a7 8110, is the applicable Statute to render it necessary to decide this latter proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Motion to strike granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-10\"><em> Gerber v.
