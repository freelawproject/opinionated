According to the uncontroverted testimony of the claimant, he was driving in a 50 mile per hour zone at a speed of \u201cbetter than fifty-five; 55, 65, something like that\u201d. While driving at that speed, the claimant attempted to light a cigarette and, in so doing, the cigarette dropped to the seat or the floor of the truck. The claimant reached down to search for and recover the cigarette, lost control of the vehicle and ran off the road into the pole. At the hearing before the Board, the claimant stated that he was \u201cdriving too fast\u201d and that he \u201clost control\u201d of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">This case has been before this Court upon a prior appeal. See <em>Carey v. Bryan &amp; Rollins, </em>9 <em>Terry </em>395, 105 <em>A. </em>2d 201. The award of the Industrial Accident Board was there reversed and the case was remanded for the purpose, <em>inter alia, </em>of determination by the Board of the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">\u201c1) Did Carey violate the speed statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">\u201c2) Did Carey violate the Statute governing reckless driving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201c3) If he violated either or both of such Statutes, was the violation \u2018wilful\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201c4) If there was a wilful violation, was it the proximate cause of the accident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Upon the remand, the Board heard further evidence upon the intoxication issue involved in this case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the Board permitted no further evidence on the four questions above mentioned. The Board made its determination as to those questions upon the basis of the record of.the original hearing. It was decided by the Board that (1) the claimant violated the speed statute but (2) this violation was not \u201cwilful\u201d and (3) the claimant did not violate the statute prohibiting reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The portion of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statute involved here, being 19 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2353(b) derived from the 1935 <em>Code </em>6106, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201c(b) If any employee be injured as a result of his intoxication, or because of his deliberate and reckless indifference to .danger, or because of his wilful intention to bring about the injury or death of himself, or of another, or because of his wilful failure or refusal to use a reasonable safety appliance provided for him, or to perform a duty required by statute, he shall not be entitled to recover damages in an action at law, or compensation or medical, dental, optometric or hospital service under the compensatory provisions of this chapter. The burden of proof under the provisions of this subsection shall be on the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">This appeal raises two principal questions for decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">1) Was the claimant guilty of \u201cwilful failure to perform a duty required by statute\u201d such as to constitute a forfeiture of compensation rights under 19 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2353(b); or, as it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>be otherwise stated, does the violation of a penal motor vehicle statute, <em>per se, </em>constitute a \u201cwilful failure\u201d and forfeiture under \u00a7 2353(b)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">2) Did the Board err in refusing to permit further evidence on the four questions to be decided on the remand?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In the prior opinion in this case, this Court stated, 150 <em>A. </em>2d 204:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\u201cIn view of the clear prohibition of the Statute, it is held that the claimant is not entitled to compensation if he wilfully violated the Motor Vehicle Law governing speed or reckless driving and if such violation was the proximate cause of the accident. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Carroll, </em>169 <em>Ga. </em>333, 150 S. <em>E. </em>208; <em>cf., King v. Empire Collieries Co., </em>148 <em>Va. </em>585, 139 S. <em>E. </em>478, 58 <em>A. L. R. </em>193; <em>cf., Sloss-Sheffield Steel &amp; Iron Co. v. Nations, </em>236 <em>Ala. </em>571, 183 <em>So. </em>871, 119 <em>A. L. R. </em>1403; 1 <em>Larson on Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 35.10, <em>et seq.; </em>6 <em>Schneider on Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 1598, <em>et seq.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The word \u201cwilful\u201d is the key word in this case. That word, as used in the subsection of the Statute here involved, was considered by this Court in <em>Lobdell Car Wheel Co. v. Subielski, 2 W. W. Harr. </em>462, 125 <em>A. </em>462, 464. The Court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">\u201cThe word \u2018willful\u2019 may be defined with a reasonable degree of satisfaction, although the definitions vary in some respects, depending somewhat upon the meaning intended to be conveyed by its use with other words. In the present statute we believe it was used to define an act done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">There is no evidence in this case that the claimant intentionally and deliberately exceeded the speed limit or drove recklessly, knowingly and purposely, without justifiable excuse. The employer has the burden of proof under the forfeiture provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statute. See 19 <em>Del. C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u00a72353(b). The employer has not been able to point to anything in the evidence which would compel the inference that the actions of the claimant were intentional, deliberate and \u201cwilful\u201d. Most operators of motor vehicles have, at one time or another, found themselves driving at 60 or 65 miles per hour on the open highway carelessly, thoughtlessly and inadvertently, without conscious intention to exceed the speed limit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While an inference of wilfulness might be the only reasonable inference to be drawn from such speed within city or town limits, no such inference is created where, as here, the speed limit was 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Similarly, no inference of deliberation or intention, or conscious indifference to consequences, is compelled by the fact that, while driving along the open highway, the claimant reached down to recover the cigarette he had started to light. It is common knowledge that drivers often do this as a matter of reflex action and impulse, carelessly and thoughtlessly but without conscious intention, to prevent burns to the person, clothing or upholstery. This may be folly and negligence when driving at 60 miles per hour but, as a matter of law, it does not constitute \u201cwilful\u201d reckless driving in the absence of some evidence of deliberation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"> The employer contends that a violation of a penal statute, such as the motor vehicle statute prohibiting speeding and reckless driving, in and of itself constitutes' a \u201cwilful failure to perform a duty required by statute\u201d and a forfeiture of compensation rights under the provisions of \u00a7 2353(b). The employer places principal reliance upon <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Carroll, </em>169 <em>Ga. </em>333, 150 <em>S. E. </em>208, 211. In that case, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that violation of a penal statute, such as the motor vehicle speed law, in and of itself constituted \u201cwillful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>misconduct\u201d and \u201cwillful failure \"\"\" * * to perform a duty required by statute\u201d so as to bar rights under the Georgia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the case is that an employer should not be compelled to compensate an employee for his injury, or his dependents for his death, caused by the employee\u2019s violation of a criminal statute. I find the rule of the Carroll case to be unacceptable for the following reasons: (1) That case deals with the construction of the words \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d which do not appear in the Delaware statute although, in other respects, the pertinent provision of the Georgia statute is almost identical with ours. (2) In Delaware, violation of a penal motor vehicle statute, without more, constitutes negligence <em>per se. </em>It is settled that negligence alone will not defeat recovery of workmen\u2019s compensation. (3) There is such conflict and confusion among the various statutes and decisions relating to this phase of the law of workmen\u2019s compensation, precedents from other jurisdictions are of little value. Compare <em>King v. Empire Collieries Co., </em>148 <em>Va. </em>585, 139 <em>S. E. </em>478, 479, 58 <em>A. L. R. </em>193. The only reasonable course, therefore, is to confine ourselves to the precise language of our Statute and an attempt to determine the intention of our Legislature. (4) I find the rule of the <em>Carroll </em>case to be unacceptably harsh when considered in the light of the humanitarian pusposes of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. It does not seem consonant with the spirit of such legislation to hold that a forfeiture of all rights of compensation may result from an inadvertent and unintentional violation of a traffic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Other cases cited by the employer are found to be of no assistance for one or more of the same reasons. See <em>Gooseby v. Pinson Tire Co., </em>65 <em>Ga. App. </em>837, 16 S. <em>E. </em>2d 767; <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Industrial Accident Commission, </em>171 <em>Cal. </em>728, 154 P. 834, <em>L. R. A. </em>1916D, 903; <em>Hall v. Kendall, </em>81 <em>Ga. App. </em>592, 59 S. <em>E. </em>2d 421; <em>Gregory v. McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc., Fla., </em>54 <em>So. </em>2d 682; <em>Price v. Reed, </em>114 <em>Ind. App. </em>253, 51 <em>N. E. </em>2d 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>It is held that violation of a penal motor vehicle statute does not, <em>per se, </em>constitute a \u201cwilful failure to perform a duty required hy statute\u201d and forfeiture under 19 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2353 (b) and that, in order to invoke the forfeiture provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, the employer has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation of the statute was \u201cwilful\u201d, <em>i. e., </em>intentional and deliberate and not just careless and inadvertent. In the instant case, the employer was unable to make such a showing either by direct or circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">I find no reversible error in the action of the Board denying a second hearing upon the issues of speed and reckless driving. As to these issues, the case was remanded to the Board for the \u201cpurpose of enabling the Board, as the trier of fact, to complete the record by deciding the foregoing questions and by announcing conclusions in accordance with its findings.\u201d See 105 <em>A. </em>2d 204. In compliance with this mandate, the Board was not obliged to grant a trial <em>de novo. </em>It had before it the evidence adduced at the original hearing and, evidently, it considered that it had heard sufficient evidence to enable it to make the required determinations. The employer was in no way limited at the first hearing regarding the issues of speed and reckless driving and it was not entitled to a second trial of those issues. In this connection, it is to be noted that 19 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2348(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201c(d) Whenever a cause shall be remanded to the Board for. a rehearing, all evidence theretofore taken before the Board in a previous hearing or hearings shall become part of the evidence in the hearing upon the remand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">I find no reversible error in the proceedings of the Industrial Accident Board and, therefore, the award to the claimant will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">A certified copy of this opinion will be filed forthwith by the Prothonotary with the Industrial Accident Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-12\"> After obtaining the cross-examination on the intoxication issue made available to it by the prior decision of this Court, 105 <em>A. </em>2d 201, the employer does not press any further assertion of error as to this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\"> A similar statement was made by this Court in 1936 in <em>Gallegher v. Davis, </em>7. <em>W. W. Harr. </em>380, 183 A. 620, 623. The statement is much more cogent when applied to modern motor vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> Nothing herein contained pertains to the essential elements of the criminal offense of reckless driving under 21 <em>Del.
