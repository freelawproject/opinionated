Newblock, </em>56 <em>Okl. </em>320, 155 <em>P. </em>1150; <em>State ex rel. Surgeon v. Jones, </em>106 <em>W. Va. </em>561, 146 S. <em>E. </em>372; <em>Pratt v. Roberts, </em>53 <em>Me. </em>399, and <em>Hunt v. Kennedy Coal Corp., </em>140 <em>Va. </em>17, 124 S. <em>E. </em>189. In each of the jurisdictions above mentioned, Magistrates\u2019 Courts are established by Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\"><em>Pratt v. Roberts, </em>just mentioned, is precise authority for the proposition that a writ of mandamus is the appropriate remedy in a case such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\"> In behalf of the defendant, Magistrate, it is argued that he has inherent power over his own judgments, and, within the limits of sound discretion, the power to reopen or vacate a default judgment such as this. This argument is predicated upon the claim that, in Delaware, Magistrates\u2019 Courts are Constitutional Courts and Courts of general jurisdiction. To the contrary, while Article IV, \u00a7 I of the <em>Del. C. Ann. </em>Constitution of of the State establishes Magistrates\u2019 Courts, yet the powers and jurisdiction of such Courts are wholly statutory. Moreover, I find no authority for the claim that, in this State, Magistrates\u2019 Courts are Courts of general jurisdiction. To the contrary, <em>Townsend v. Harmon, </em>5 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>562, 171 <em>A. </em>178, classifies them as courts of limited jurisdiction, and <em>Farrell v. Maryland Credit Finance Corporation, </em>2 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>569, 127 <em>A. </em>879, and <em>Howell v. Eastburn, 9 W.W. Harr. </em>588, 2 <em>A. </em>2d 899, refer to the jurisdiction of such Courts as entirely statutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">It is my view of the law that in this State, the Magistrates\u2019 Courts, while created by Constitution, nevertheless are restricted in their jurisdiction. Accordingly, a Magistrate has no powers other than those conferred on him by statute and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>power to vacate a default judgment after the expiration of the 15 days period prescribed by 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 9542.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The writ of mandamus will issue as prayed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
