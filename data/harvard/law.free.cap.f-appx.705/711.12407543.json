Phillips Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">Gabriel Joseph purchased a home for $3.4 million through a company that he controlled and then sold it to himself five days later for $7 million. Using the fraudulently inflated value, he received a loan and line of credit from Washington Mutual (\u201cWaMu\u201d) totaling $5,659,357.88. After Joseph defaulted, WaMu purchased the property in foreclosure. With an outstanding principal balance of $5,690,725, the property sold for $1.5 million. So Joseph caused what the Sentencing Guidelines and basic economics call, in technical terms, a \u201closs,\u201d but what Joseph calls a wash. Appellant Opening Br. at 15-16. Based on his own understanding of loss, Joseph challenges the district court\u2019s 18-level loss enhancement. He also argues that the district court erred in applying a gross-receipts enhancement and in dismissing certain charges without prejudice when the government committed a Speedy Trial Act (\u201cSTA\u201d) violation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b737-18\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b737-19\">The facts underlying Joseph\u2019s offenses involve one real-estate deal and two limited-liability companies, Annuit Coeptis, LLC and SCIPC, LLC. Joseph and his wife, Shandi, each owned a 50% interest in Annuit Coeptis and Joseph controlled SCIPC, LLC, an acronym for Shandi\u2019s Cabin In Park City. On October 11, 2006, SCIPC purchased a cabin (referred to as \u201cRed Hawk\u201d) in Park City, Utah for $3.4 million. On October 16, 2006, just five days later, Joseph entered into a real-estate purchase contract to personally buy Red Hawk from SCIPC for $7,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-20\">In February 2007, Joseph requested a mortgage and line of credit from WaMu based on Red Hawk\u2019s $7 million purchase price, concealing from WaMu that he controlled SCIPC, had inflated the property\u2019s value, and was selling it to himself. He also misrepresented facts about his income and assets and about his intention to occupy Red Hawk as his residence. WaMu approved the loan and gave Joseph a $4,959,586.88 mortgage and a $699,771 line of credit. Because SCIPC was the seller, WaMu deposited $1,983,991.02 of the loan proceeds into SCIPC\u2019s account. Joseph then routed about this amount of money through his and Shandi\u2019s joint account, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Annuit Coeptis\u2019s account, and his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Joseph defaulted on the loan. Through a foreclosure sale, WaMu purchased the property. Neither party provided the foreclosure-purchase price. Then, in late 2008, WaMu went into receivership, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d) seized its assets arid liabilities. The FDIC sold the property to JPMorgan Chase, which then sold it for $1.5 million. At the time of this sale, the loan had an outstanding principal balance of $5,690,725.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">II. Charges and Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In April 2011, the government brought a two-count Misdemeanor Information, charging Joseph with two counts of willful failure to file tax returns in the 2004 and 2005 tax years, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. In February 2012, with the misdemeanor case pending, the government also charged Joseph with two felony counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and one felony count of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. Joseph successfully consolidated the 2011 and 2012 cases (the \u201cConsolidated Case\u201d). The government later obtained a Superseding Indictment in the 2012 case, adding three counts of making false statements to a bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In October 2014, three-and-a-half years after the government filed the first charges, Joseph moved to dismiss the Consolidated Case with prejudice for violation of the STA. The government conceded the violation but argued for dismissal without prejudice. In considering whether to dismiss with or without prejudice,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court concluded that Joseph\u2019s offenses were serious, stating that \u201cthe Tenth Circuit has recognized that financial crimes, white collar crimes, may constitute serious offenses,\u201d and that Joseph\u2019s offenses \u201cresulted in a loss of approximately $9,000,000.\u201d App\u00e9llant App. vol. Ill at 775. Ultimately, the district court dismissed the charges in the Consolidated Case (which included both the felony and misdemeanor counts) without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">In February 2015, after the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Consolidated Case, the government re-indicted Joseph for two counts of wire fraud, one count of money laundering, three counts of making false statements to a bank, and one count of willfully failing to file an income tax return. The government later dismissed two of the counts for making false statements to a bank. The government also filed a \u201cNotice of Intention to Seek Criminal Forfeiture\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a). Appellant App. vol. I at 41. A jury convicted Joseph on all five remaining counts, and the district court granted the government\u2019s Motion for Order of Forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">III. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">The probation office prepared a Third Amended Presentence Investigation Report (PSR).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The PSR calc\u00falated a total offense level of 28 and a criminal-history category of I, rendering an advisory guideline range of 78 to 97 months of imprisonment. The PSR grouped the four convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tions for wire fraud, money laundering, and false statements to a bank, and calculated their sentencing impact under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B1.1 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2015) (\u201cUSSG\u201d). For these counts, the PSR set a base offense level of 7, under \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l); added 18 levels for a specific offense characteristic of losses more than $3.5 million, under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J); and added 2 more levels for Joseph\u2019s having derived more than $1 million from financial institutions as part of his offense, under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(16)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Then, for Joseph\u2019s money-laundering conviction, the PSR turned to USSG \u00a7 2S1.1. The base offense level for that crime incorporated the offense level of 27 already calculated from \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l). It then added another offense level because Joseph was convicted for money laundering under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. USSG \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(A). That gave Joseph a total offense level of 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">For the misdemeanor willful-failure-to-file count, the PSR calculated a base-offense level of 16. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2T1.1; USSG \u00a7 2T4.1(F) (providing an offense level of 16 for tax losses of more $100,000 but not more than $250,000). But because this offense level was 12 levels fewer than the money-laundering offense level, the misdemeanor convictions did not increase the total offense level. <em>See </em>USSG 3D1.4(c) (disregarding for potential increases any offense group that is 9 or more levels less serious than the other group).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Joseph objected to the PSR\u2019s loss calculation as well as its application of the 2-level gross-receipts enhancement. After a sentencing hearing, the district court overruled these objections. Applying the total offense level of 28 and criminal-history category I, the district court imposed a 78-month sentence, the low end of the advisory guideline range, to be followed by 60 months of supervised release, and ordered Joseph to make restitution to the IRS. Joseph appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Joseph challenges the district court\u2019s (1) loss calculation; (2) application of the gross-receipts enhancement; and (3) failure to dismiss the misdemeanor counts with prejudice after the government violated the STA. Generally, we review a sentence\u2019s procedural and substantive reasonableness for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>710 F.3d 1124, 1160 (10th Cir. 2013). \u201cA sentence is procedurally unreasonable if,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe district court incorrectly calculates ... the Guidelines sentence ... [or] relies on clearly erroneous facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Haley, </em>529 F.3d 1308, 1311 (10th Cir. 2008)). \u201cReview for substantive reasonableness focuses on \u201cwhether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Friedman, </em>554 F.3d 1301, 1307 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting <em>Alapizco-Valenzuela, </em>546 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2008)). We also ordinarily review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss an indictment for violation of the STA vyith or without prejudice for an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>tion. <em>See United States v. Toombs, </em>713 F.3d 1273, 1280 (10th Cir. 2013). But, as discussed below, Joseph has waived our review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">I. Loss Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">For economic offenses like Joseph\u2019s, the amount of loss heavily influences the total offense level. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). Here, the district court found that Joseph\u2019s relevant conduct resulted in a $4,190,725 loss, producing an 18-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J). The district court reached this figure by calculating the \u201cActual Loss\u201d\u2014defined as \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d \u00a7\u2022 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(A)(i). Pecuniary harm \u201cmeans harm that is monetary\u201d or \u201creadily meas-ureable in money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n.3(A)(iii). The district court then reduced the amount of loss by the value of the collateral\u2014in other words, it applied the \u201cgeneral formula.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>705 F.3d 1268, 1276 (10th Cir. 2013); see <em>also United States v. Crowe, </em>735 F.3d 1229, 1237 (10th Cir. 2013) (illustrating the loss equation as \u201cactual loss (or intended loss) minus credits against loss\u201d). And, as in this case, when a lender has foreclosed on and sold the collateral, the value of the collateral is the sales price. So, to derive $4,190,725 in loss, the district court reduced the total outstanding balance of the loans at the time of foreclosure (approximately $5,690,000) by Red Hawk\u2019s foreclosure-sale price ($1,500,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Joseph raises the following four challenges to the district court\u2019s loss calculation. He argues that the district court improperly (1) applied the general formula to calculate loss because he asserts that the government failed to prove that any loss resulted from the offenses, and (2) misapplied the Guidelines regarding gain. He also argues that the government failed to prove (3) foreseeability and (4) causation. So Joseph\u2019s first two challenges relate to the district court\u2019s calculation methodology while the other two relate to its underlying factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">\u201cWhen a defendant challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence by attacking the district court\u2019s loss calculation, our task is to determine whether the district court\u2019s factual finding of loss caused by the defendant\u2019s fraud is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>710 F.3d at 1161 (internal brackets omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Mullins, </em>613 F.3d 1273, 1292 (10th Cir. 2010)). \u201cIn other words, \u2018we may disturb the district court\u2019s loss determination\u2014and consequent Guidelines enhancement\u2014only if the court\u2019s finding is without factual support in the record or if, after reviewing all the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mullins, </em>613 F.3d at 1292). But we review de novo the district court\u2019s loss-calculation methodology. <em>Id. </em>We hold that the district court did not err in calculating the amount of loss and that the record supports its factual findings. We begin with the district court\u2019s methodology for calculating loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">A. Methodology</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">First, Joseph challenges the district court\u2019s methodology based on its use of the general formula. Because WaMu collapsed before it could repackage and sell Joseph\u2019s loan to downstream lenders, Joseph asserts that it \u201cnever realized a loss or a gain by selling the loan or the underlying property\u201d and that WaMu\u2019s closure resulted in a gain for JPMorgan, Appellant Opening Br. at 24. Based on this faulty premise, Joseph asserts that the district court ignored \u201ceconomic reality\u201d by applying the general formula. <em>Id. </em>at 26 (quoting <em>United States v. Smith, </em>951 F.2d 1164, 1167 (10th Cir. 1991)). But the gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>al formula applies as long as it\u2019s foreseeable to the defendant that the original lender will sell or repackage a loan. <em>See Smith, </em>705 F.3d at 1276. The rationale for continuing to apply the general formula is that any gains or losses sustained by the original lender will be offset by a corresponding loss or gain by the downstream lender, making the \u201cnumber of lenders involved ... <em>mathematically irrelevant\u201d </em>to loss calculations. <em>United States v. James, </em>592 F.3d 1109, 1117 (10th Cir. 2010) (Luce-ro, J,, concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Joseph argues that this underlying rationale doesn\u2019t apply here because WaMu went into receivership before it could realize a gain or loss on Joseph\u2019s loan. But Joseph is wrong. A defunct bank, and certainly its receiver, the FDIC, can suffer a loss. The record shows that Joseph defaulted before WaMu closed and that WaMu purchased the property in foreclosure. Thus, before its closure, WaMu owned an under-secured loan and an over-leveraged property, And, after WaMu closed, the FDIC stepped into its shoes and acquired the loan and property. <em>See O\u2019Melveny &amp; Myers v. FDIC, </em>512 U.S. 79, 86, 114 S.Ct. 2048, 129 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994) (\u201c[T]he FDIC as receiver steps into the shoes of the failed S &amp; L, ... obtaining the rights <em>of </em>the insured depository institution that existed prior to receivership.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). So, when the FDIC sold WaMu\u2019s assets to JPMorgan for \u201cpennies on the dollar,\u201d Appellant Opening Br. at 29, it certainly realized a loss. In fact, in another fraudulent-loan case where the lender had gone out of business, we held that the acquirer of the defunct bank could even receive restitution payments because it was a victim. <em>United States v. Haddock, </em>50 F.3d 835, 841 (10th Cir. 1995) (\u201cCNB can properly receive the restitution payments since it acquired the claims of the defunct Bank....\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by statute, </em>Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(l), <em>as recognized in United States v. Cheal, </em>389 F.3d 35, 53 (1st Cir. 2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the rationale from James-that losses or gains will be offset by corresponding losses or gains to downstream lenders\u2014still applies here. Despite JPMorgan\u2019s likely gain, WaMu and/or the FDIC suffered a loss from Joseph\u2019s fraudulent activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Second, Joseph argues that the district court misapplied the Guidelines by using gain as an alternative measure of loss. The Guidelines allow courts to calculate gain \u201conly if there is a loss but it reasonably cannot be determined.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(B). Thus, to calculate gain, the district court must first find that there was a loss. Here, in response to Joseph\u2019s objection about actual loss, the district court stated, \u201cif we were to take your position and assume that <em>there could be no loss, </em>then I would make an alternative finding that there was gain in an amount that would lead to the same 18-point enhancement.\u201d Appellant App. vol. Ill at 598 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Joseph is correct that the district court mistakenly implied that it could find gain absent loss. But it\u2019s clear that the district court made this statement as an alternative justification for Joseph\u2019s \u00a7 2B1.1 enhancement. <em>See id. </em>(stating <em>\u201cif </em>we were to take your position and assume that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>could be no loss\u201d) (emphasis added). So, unless the district court erred in calculating loss (which it did not) or there was insufficient proof of loss (which there was not), we would not reverse based on a single incorrect statement that didn\u2019t impact Joseph\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Romero, </em>749 F.3d 900, 906 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[W]e are free to affirm a district court decision on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law....\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Nicholson, </em>721 F.3d 1236, 1246 (10th Cir. 2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">B. Factual Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Joseph also argues that the government failed to prove foreseeability and causation. Both-challenges implicate factual findings, so we will not reverse absent clear error. <em>Niemi v. Lasshofer, </em>770 F.3d 1331, 1356 (10th Cir. 2014) (stating that a causation argument \u201cimplicates the factual findings of the district court\u201d); <em>Tinkler v. United States, </em>982 F.2d 1456, 1469 (10th Cir. 1992) (explaining that foreseeability is a question of fact). We address-the two arguments together because they rely on the same mistaken premise. For both arguments, Joseph states that \u201cif Washington Mutual lost- any unpaid principal, that principal was lost when the FDIC seized its assets and sold them to JP Morgan Chase.\u201d Appellant Opening Br. at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Joseph\u2019s argument that WaMu did not lose any unpaid principle until the FDIC\u2019s seizure is disingenuous because Joseph had already defaulted on the Red Hawk loan before WaMu collapsed. Joseph argues that because he still owed the unpaid principal balance when WaMu foreclosed, it had not \u201clost\u201d anything at that time. Appellant Reply Br. at 11. But Joseph didn\u2019t continue making loan payments following the foreclosure. Had he, the loss calculation would necessarily have accounted for such payments. <em>See Smith, </em>705 F.3d at 1276 (using the <em>\u201coutstanding </em>balance on the loan\u201d to calculate loss) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">But regardless of when WaMu foreclosed, the FDIC absorbed all of WaMu\u2019s assets and liabilities, including Joseph\u2019s fraudulently inflated loan. So when the FDIC sold the property to JPMorgan \u201cfor pennies on the dollar,\u201d Appellant Opening Br. at 29, as we said earlier, it certainly suffered from Joseph\u2019s acts. Based on the record, we have no trouble concluding that Joseph could foresee that his acts could harm others and that his acts indeed caused such harm. Joseph fraudulently inflated Red Hawk\u2019s value by $3.6 million and then used the inflated value to procure a higher loan from WaMu. Further, Joseph\u2019s argument that the FDIC\u2019s seizure was an unforeseeable, intervening cause is one that we\u2019ve heard and rejected before. <em>See e.g., Crowe, </em>735 F.3d at 1237 (explaining that the foreseeability at issue is the \u201cpotential pecuniary harm that might result from [the] offenses\u201d). And we see no reason here to stray from our view that \u201cit is irrelevant ... whether or not [the defendant] .,. reasonably anticipated a precipitous decline in the real estate market that might result in the original lender or successor lenders being unable to recoup their losses from the sale of pledged collateral should [ ]he default.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">II. Gross Receipts</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Joseph received a 2-level enhancement for \u201cderiv[ing] more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from one or more financial institutions as a result of the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(16)(A). Joseph challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he derived the funds individually and argues that he used the funds to \u201csatisfy corporate obligations.\u201d Appellant Opening Br. at 40 (quoting <em>United States v. Colton, </em>231 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>F.3d 890, 911 (4th Cir. 2000)). But the record supports the district court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The district court based its finding for the gross-receipts enhancement on trial evidence, specifically the testimony of IRS Special Agent Ronald Marker. Agent Marker examined Joseph\u2019s financial records and tracked the Red Hawk loan proceeds from their initial disbursement and throughout later transfers. A few days after the sale of Red Hawk, SCIPC, as seller, received over $1.9 million from WaMu. An amount close to this then traveled through Annuit Coeptis\u2019s account, Joseph and his wife\u2019s joint account, and Joseph\u2019s individual account. On March 1, 2007, Annuit Coeptis transferred $2,000,020 to Joseph\u2019s personal account, which Joseph transferred back to Annuit Coeptis. Marker testified that none of these transfers were possible without WaMu\u2019s loan because the accounts had insufficient funds in them,</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Joseph admits that the loan proceeds went to his personal account but argues that Marker\u2019s analysis never concluded that the proceeds \u201credounded to Mr. Joseph\u2019s personal benefit, as opposed to satisfying the corporate obligations of Annuit Coeptis.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant Opening Br. at 19. In support, Joseph relies on a Seventh Circuit case, <em>United States v. Castellano, </em>349 F.3d 483 (7th Cir. 2003), and a Fourth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Colton, </em>231 F.3d 890 (4th Cir. 2000). Both cases held that district courts could not disregard corporate formalities when applying the gross-receipts enhancement. <em>Castellano, </em>349 F.3d at 486; <em>Colton, </em>231 F.3d at 911-12. Both cases are easily distinguishable from Joseph\u2019s situation, however, because Joseph individually received a deposit of over $1,000,000 when Annuit Coeptis transferred $2,000,020 to his personal account, whereas the defendants in <em>Castellano </em>and <em>Colton </em>never personally derived over $1,000,000. In <em>Castellano, </em>after a deposit was made to a corporation\u2019s account, \u201c[l]ess than $200,000 reached [Castellano] as salary or reimbursement of his expenses.\u201d 349 F.3d at 486. Similarly, in <em>Colton, </em>a corporation received a deposit of over $1,000,000, but Colton and his cocon-spirator each received only $300,000 individually. 231 F.3d at 894, 911-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Unlike the defendants in <em>Castellano </em>and <em>Colton, </em>Joseph received over $1,000,000 in gross receipts when Annuit Coeptis transferred $2,000,020 to his personal account. Because- of this fact, it\u2019s irrelevant that Joseph: (1) received the money from An-nuit Coeptis rather than from WaMu directly; (2) transferred it back to Annuit Coeptis; and (3) wasn\u2019t the sole owner of either Annuit Coeptis or SCIPC. <em>See United States v. Monus, </em>128 F.3d 376, 397 (6th Cir. 1997) (explaining that the enhancement applies \u201ceven if the defendant receives the million dollars in an indirect manner\u201d); <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>161 F.3d 171, 193 (3d Cir. 1998) (explaining that \u201cit is irrelevant how [the defendant] spent the money after he obtained it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">III. Speedy Trial Act</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Joseph also argues that the district court erred in dismissing without prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the misdemeanor willful-failure-to-file-a-tax-return charges, asserting that the district court should have dismissed these charges <em>with </em>prejudice because they were not serious. Seriousness of the offense is a factor that courts must consider in deciding whether to dismiss a case with or without prejudice. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2). The government asserts that Joseph waived this argument by failing to raise it, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In the district court, Joseph raised an STA violation and moved for the district court to dismiss the charges against him with prejudice. But in asserting that the charges against him were not serious, Joseph never discussed the misdemeanor charges. Rather, the following excerpt is Joseph\u2019s entire argument on the seriousness factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">In this case, Mr. Joseph did not threaten or use violence, was not involved in drug distribution, and has no prior criminal history. While in general, any false statements can arguably be \u201cserious,\u201d many of the false statement charges here do not have a materiality element. <em>See United States v. Wells, </em>519 U.S. 482 [117 S.Ct. 921, 137 L.Ed.2d 107] (1997). That means that any minor statement alleged to be false, could be prosecuted as a false statement to a bank. Moreover, the bank making the loans in this case employed little or no underwriting standards, utilized a primary business model of issuing risky Option Arm loans, and ultimately was closed and seized by federal regulators after making thousands of improvident and risky loans which ultimately failed. Simply put, WaMu was willing to loan any potential homeowner or real estate investor money regardless of the risk, <em>See FDIC v. Killinger </em>[Case No. 2:11CV00459-MJP [2011 WL 4440410] (W.D. Wash. 2011) ], at 29 (noting how the bank\u2019s management was warned of inappropriate Option ARM lending as such loans were made to consumers \u201cwith high LTV\u2019s [loan-to-value], low FICO\u2019s [credit scores], and relaxed debt to income standards (including lack of income verification) ....\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">The factors identified here would suggest a less serious offense occurred here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Appellant App. vol. Ill at 701 (footnote omitted) (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">So before the district court, Joseph mentioned the false-statements charges and deflected blame from himself. Now, for the first time on appeal, he argues that the misdemeanor offenses were not serious. While the argument before us is better than the one before the district court, it comes too late. Generally, we consider an argument that \u201csimply wasn\u2019t raised before the district court ... forfeited\u201d and can review it for plain error. <em>Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc., </em>634 F.3d 1123, 1128 (10th Cir. 2011). But we treat unraised STA arguments differently. <em>See United States v. Loughrin, </em>710 F.3d 1111, 1121 (10th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">We have interpreted the STA statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2), \u201cto mean that we may not conduct any review of [STA] arguments unraised below, not even for plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Seals, </em>450 Fed.Appx. 769, 771 (10th Cir. 2011) (unpublished)). This is because the statute \u201cassigns the role of spotting violations of the [STA] to defendants\u2014for the obvious reason that they have the greatest incentive to perform this task.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Zedner v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 489, 502-03, 126 S.Ct. 1976, 164 L.Ed.2d 749 (2006)). So when a \u201cdefendant trie[s] to raise an entirely different [STA] argument\u201d for the first time on appeal, it is waived. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Joseph argues that \u201conce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>any argument in support of that claim; <em>parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made beloio.\u201d </em>Appellant Reply Br. at 24 (quoting <em>Lebron v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>513 U.S. 374, 379, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995)). Disregarding the specific waiver rules that apply to unraised STA arguments for a moment, even under our ordinary waiver and forfeiture principles, we have rejected this exact line of reasoning as \u201cspurious.\u201d <em>Fish v. Kobach, </em>840 F.3d 710, 730 (10th Cir. 2016) (rejecting the appellant\u2019s argument that when \u201ca federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>821 F.3d 1194, 1199 (10th Cir. 2016))).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM Joseph\u2019s sentence and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Joseph\u2019s charges without prejudice for the STA violation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">. \"[I]n deciding whether to dismiss an indictment with or without prejudice,\u201d the STA requires the district court to balance certain factors. <em>United States v. Koerber, </em>813 F.3d 1262, 1274 (10th Cir. 2016). These include: (1) the seriousness of the offense; (2) any resulting prejudice to the defendant from the delay; (3) the seriousness of the STA violation; and (4) the length of the delay. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-14\">. The PSR applied the 2015 edition of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual. Here, all references to the Guidelines refer to the 2015 edition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. In June 2007, Joseph secured another loan from WaMu for $3,770,000 based on false information and another in August 2007 for $4,095,000. An earlier version of the PSR included these amounts in Joseph\u2019s relevant conduct for loss purposes, yielding a total intended loss of $11,465,000 and actual loss of $7,937,313 (crediting payments Joseph had made toward the loan). But because the district court used actual rather than intended loss and agreed with Joseph that these other transactions should not be included in the total calculation, Joseph's sentence was ultimately calculated using only the Red Hawk loan amounts, saving him 2 offense levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\">. For loss-calculation purposes, we similarly reject any argument that we can\u2019t consider the FDIC a victim in this case because the government and district court identified only WaMu as a victim. For loss calculations, we focus on the \"reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense,\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(A)(i), not \u201cthe <em>ultimate victim or victims </em>of [the] offense,\u201d <em>United States v. Snow, </em>468 Fed.Appx. 830, 840 (10th Cir. 2012) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">. Joseph also argues that Marker never addressed how the initial proceeds were commingled with significant amounts of money in Annuit Coeptis's bank account, such as the $130,086.32 that was in the account on February 26, 2007, when SCIPC initially transferred the loan proceeds to Annuit Coeptis, or another deposit for $200,000. But unless An-nuit Coeptis had over $1,000,020 in its account (which Joseph doesn\u2019t allege) when it transferred $2,000,020 to Joseph\u2019s personal account, it could not have made this transfer without at least $1 million in gross receipts from WaMu. According to Agent Marker, the accounts had insufficient funds to complete the transfers without over $1 million in gross receipts from WaMu.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">. In any event, Joseph\u2019s claim would fail on plain-error review. For plain error, Joseph must show that \"(1) the district court erred, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>812 F.3d 809, 813 (10th Cir. 2016). Assuming prong-1 error, Joseph certainly fails on prong 2. For an error to be \"plain,\u201d it must be \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). An error is clear where \u201c 'the Supreme Court or this court [] [has] addressed the issue\u2019 or where \u2018the district court\u2019s interpretation was clearly erroneous.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Cordery, </em>656 F.3d 1103, 1106 (10th Cir. 2011) (alterations and brackets in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Ruiz-Gea, </em>340 F.3d 1181, 1187 (10th Cir. 2003)). Joseph has failed to present a single case stating that the district court must consider the misdemeanor and felony offenses separately and regard all misdemeanor offenses as not serious.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
