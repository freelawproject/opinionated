Lucero, Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b792-21\" pgmap=\"792(11) 793(34)\">Annelise Bright appeals from a district court order dismissing her complaint based on sovereign immunity and failure to exhaust. We conclude that dismissal was appropriate, but that the dismissal should have been without prejudice. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we vacate and remand.</p> <p id=\"b793-4\" pgmap=\"793\">I</p> <p id=\"b793-5\" pgmap=\"793\">Bright worked as a graduate teaching assistant in the University of Oklahoma\u2019s French Department. In 2015, the department\u2019s coordinator allegedly denied Bright\u2019s request for disability accommodations and sent a libelous memo to various persons. However, the director of the University\u2019s Disabilities Resource Center mandated that Bright receive accommodations. Bright\u2019s work was subsequently restricted, and after Bright complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, she was fired.</p> <p id=\"b793-6\" pgmap=\"793\">In September 2016, Bright sued the University\u2019s Board of Regents in state court for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213, and state libel law. The Board removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss. The district court granted the Board\u2019s motion, concluding that Bright\u2019s ADA claim was barred by sovereign immunity and her libel claim was unexhausted. Bright now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b793-7\" pgmap=\"793\">II</p> <p id=\"b793-8\" pgmap=\"793\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal based on sovereign immunity.\u201d Mojsilovic v. Okla. ex rel. Bd. of Regents, 841 F.3d 1129, 1131 (10th Cir. 2016). Sovereign immunity extends to arms of the state, such as the Board. See Hensel v. Office of Chief Admin. Hearing Officer, 38 F.3d 505, 508 (10th Cir. 1994). It does not apply when Congress, acting under the Fourteenth Amendment, has abrogated states\u2019 immunity or when the state waives its immunity. See Pettigrew v. Okla. ex rel. Okla. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, 722 F.3d 1209, 1212 (10th Cir. 2013). Neither exception governs this case. Congress has not effectively abrogated immunity for ADA employment claims. See Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 360, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001); Elwell v. Okla. ex rel. Bd. of Regents, 693 F.3d 1303, 1309-10 (10th Cir. 2012). And Oklahoma has retained its sovereign immunity. See 51 Okla. Stat. \u00a7 152.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b793-15\" pgmap=\"793\">Bright does not argue otherwise. Instead, she recounts the circumstances leading up to her termination and states that she was coerced to work under unfair conditions. These arguments do not suggest that the district court erred in dismissing Bright\u2019s ADA claim. The district court did not, however, specify whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. \u201c[A] dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds ... must be without prejudice.\u201d Rural Water Sewer &amp; Solid Waste Mgmt. v. Guthrie, 654 F.3d 1058, 1069 n.9 (10th Cir. 2011). We therefore remand this claim to the district court with instructions to dismiss it without prejudice.</p> <p id=\"b793-17\" pgmap=\"793\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b793-18\" pgmap=\"793(12) 794(82)\">Oklahoma\u2019s Governmental Tort Claims Act (\u201cGTCA\u201d), Okla. Stat. tit. 51, \u00a7\u00a7 151-171, \u201cis the exclusive remedy for an injured plaintiff to recover against a governmental entity in tort.\u201d Simington v. Parker, 250 P.3d 351, 358 (Okla. Civ. App. 2011) (quotation omitted). A \u201csuit against a governmental entity under the GTCA must be based upon the claimant presenting written notice of a claim within one year of the date the loss occurs, or the claim is forever barred.\u201d Id. Plaintiffs \u201cmust factually allege compliance with the GTCA\u2019s notice provisions.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b794-4\" pgmap=\"794\">The district court dismissed Bright\u2019s libel claim because she had not alleged compliance with the GTCA\u2019s presentment requirement. We review a district court\u2019s dismissal on exhaustion grounds for abuse of discretion, which encompasses erroneous legal conclusions and clearly erroneous factual findings. Quarles v. U.S. ex rel. Bureau of Indian Affairs, 372 F.3d 1169, 1171 (10th Cir. 2004).</p> <p id=\"b794-5\" pgmap=\"794\">Bright does not dispute that her libel claim was unexhausted at the time she filed suit. Rather, she indicates in her reply brief that she filed the necessary administrative claim after the district court dismissed her complaint. But under Okla. Stat. tit. 51, \u00a7 j57(B), \u201c[n]o action for any cause arising under th[e] [GTCA] shall be maintained unless valid notice has been given and the action is commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days after denial of the claim.\u201d However, we must remand for the district court to clarify that the dismissal is without prejudice. See Gallagher v. Shelton, 587 F.3d 1063, 1068 (10th Cir. 2009) (remanding to allow district court to clarify that its dismissal of claims for failure to exhaust was without prejudice).</p> <p id=\"b794-9\" pgmap=\"794\">IV</p> <p id=\"b794-10\" pgmap=\"794\">We VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for the district court to clarify that the dismissal of Bright\u2019s claims was without prejudice.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b792-5\" pgmap=\"792\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G), The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1,</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b793-10\" pgmap=\"793\">. Because Bright is proceeding pro se, we liberally construe her filings, but we do not act as her advocate. See James v.

A state that removes a case to federal court waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court but not its sovereign immunity from liability. Trant v.

State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 753, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (explaining that \"the Eleventh Amendment does not define the scope of the States\u2019 sovereign immunity; it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity\u201d).</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
