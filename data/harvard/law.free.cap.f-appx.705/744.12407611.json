Ebel Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In this product liability case governed by Utah law, Plaintiff-Appellant Gerry Adams alleged that a mesh sling that she had surgically implanted to treat stress urinary incontinence was defective. The question presented in this appeal is whether Adams\u2019s product liability claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. That statute required Adams to bring her claims within two years after she discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, her \u201charm and its cause.\u201d Utah Code \u00a7 78B-6-706. We conclude that Adams knew, or should have known, by November 2007\u2014when she was told she had to undergo a second operation to remove part of the mesh sling in order to remedy severe pain and bleeding\u2014that she had been harmed by the sling. Because Adams did not assert her product liability claims until five and one-half years later, those claims are now time-barred. Therefore, having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Adams\u2019s claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Adams\u2019s claims, we accept her well-pled factual allegations as true and construe those facts in the light most favorable to her, see Pace v. Swerdlow, 519 F.3d 1067, 1073 (10th Cir. 2008); we also consider the medical records that Adams attached to her amended complaint, see Free Speech v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, 720 F.3d 788, 792 (10th Cir. 2013). Doing so, the record before us indicates the following: Defendants American Medical System, Inc. and Caldera Medical, Inc. \u201cmanufactured, designed, and distributed the Desara Sling System.\u201d (J.A. at 27 \u00b6 15.) In July 2007, doctors surgically implanted a Desara mesh sling into Adams\u2019s pelvic area in order to treat her stress urinary incontinence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Several months after this surgery, Adams complained of severe pain and vaginal bleeding. In November 2007, one of her doctors discovered that a portion of the sling had migrated and was \u201cprotruding into the vaginal canal\u201d and \u201cneedled] to be excised\u201d \u201cas much as possible.\u201d (Id. at 59.) One month later, in December 2007, Adams underwent a second surgery during which her surgeon excised \u201cnearly 2 cm of the\u201d mesh sling. (Id. at 33 \u00b6 57.) After that second surgery, Adams\u2019s stress incontinence was \u201cworse than before\u201d the sling was implanted (id. at 34 \u00b6 58), and \u201c[s]he continued to suffer severe complications from the\u201d sling (id. \u00b6 60), including \u201cvaginal pain, vaginal bleeding, painful intercourse, incontinence and severe infections\u201d occurring \u201cevery couple of months\u201d (id. at 33 \u00b6 54; 72). In February 2013, Adams saw a new doctor, who discovered \u201ctwo pieces of mesh protruding through [Adams\u2019s] vaginal roof\u2019 (id. at 71), and recommended that the sling \u201cbe completely removed, because it continues to migrate from its place of implantation, is harboring infections, and is adversely affecting Ms. Adams\u2019s health and comfort\u201d (id. at 34 \u00b6 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Adams initiated this litigation in June 2013, which was soon after her new doctor\u2019s recommendation that the entire sling be removed, but six years after the mesh sling was surgically implanted and five and one-half years after the second surgery, in December 2007, to excise a portion of the sling. The district court granted Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>dants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, ruling that Adams\u2019s claims were barred by-Utah\u2019s two-year statute of limitations for product liability claims. Adams appeals that decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While this appeal was pending, Adams and Caldera settled her claim against it, and at the request of those two parties, Caldera has now been dismissed from this appeal with prejudice. In light of that, American Medical System remains as the only appellee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We review the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) decision de novo. See Pace, 519 F.3d at 1073. In this diversity case, the parties agree that Utah substantive law governs. \u201cAs a federal court sitting in diversity, [then,] our task is simply to ascertain and apply [Utah] law, attempting to predict what the state\u2019s highest court would do if faced with the specific issues before us on appeal.\u201d Flores v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., 620 F.3d 1248, 1250 (10th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The parties agree that the statute of limitations that applies to Adams\u2019s claims is Utah Code \u00a7 78B-6-706, which provides that \u201c[a] civil action under [Utah\u2019s Product Liability Act] shall be brought within two years from the time the individual who would be the claimant in the action discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, both the harm and its cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See generally Elm Ridge Expl. Co. v. Engle, 721 F.3d 1199, 1210 (10th Cir. 2013) (applying state statute of limitation in diversity action). Because \u00a7 78B-6-706 requires a plaintiff to exercise due diligence in discovering the harm and its cause, \u201call that is required to start the running of the limitation period is information sufficient to put the plaintiff on notice to make further inquiry.\u201d Griffiths-Rast v. Sulzer Spine Tech, 216 Fed.Appx. 790, 795 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (quoting Macris v. Sculptured Software, Inc., 422 Utah Adv. Rep. 6, 24 P.3d 984, 990 (2001), and applying Utah Code \u00a7 78-15-3, the predecessor to \u00a7 78B-6-706); see also Ziots v. Stryker Corp., 655 Fed.Appx. 622, 625 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The assertion that a claim is barred by the relevant statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, which the defendant bears the burden of proving. See Utah R. Civ. P. 8(c), 9(h). See generally Cahill v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 610 F.3d 1235, 1238 (10th Cir. 2010) (applying state burden of proof to issues underlying statute-of-limitations defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">A. Adams discovered that she had been harmed no later than November 2007</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">Section 78B-6-706\u2019s two-year limitations period did not begin'to run until Adams discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, that she had been harmed. The relevant \u201charm is the physical injury or illness suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>duct.\u201d Griffith-Rast v. Sulzer Spine Tech, Inc., No. 2:02CV1267 DAK, 2005 WL 2237635, at *4 (D. Utah Sept. 14, 2005) (unreported), aff'd, 216 Fed.Appx. 790 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished). To establish \u201charm\u201d sufficient to trigger \u00a7 78B-6-706\u2019s limitations period, \u201cthe defendant must show proof that the plaintiff suffered actual damages.\u201d Hansen v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., No. 2:08-cv-985, 2011 WL 6100848, at *4 (D. Utah Dec. 7, 2011) (unreported).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We conclude that Adams knew that she had been harmed no later than November 2007. By that time, her doctor had discovered that the implanted mesh had migrated and was cutting her, causing severe pain and vaginal bleeding, and would require Adams to undergo a second surgery to excise the portion of the mesh protruding into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">B. By no later than November 2007, Adams had also discovered that it was the sling that had caused her harm</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Adams also knew, no later than November 2007, that there was a \u201cpossible causal relation\u201d between the mesh sling and her harm because she knew by that time that the mesh sling had migrated and was cutting into her vagina, requiring a second surgery to remove the portion of the sling protruding into her vagina. Pratt v. Cavagna N. Am., Inc., No 2:13-CV-107, 2013 WL 6146075, at *3 (D. Utah Nov. 21, 2013) (unreported) (stating that \u00a7 78B-6-706\u2019s limitations period begins to run when, among other things, \u201cthe plaintiff discovers, or should have discovered ... that the product had a possible causal relation to her injury\u201d); see also Hansen, 2011 WL 6100848, at *3 (D. Utah) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Adams contends that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until she knew, or in the exercise of due diligence should have known, that her harm was caused by a defect in the product, the mesh sling. But Adams does not cite, and we could not find, any Utah Supreme Court decision holding that \u00a7 78B-6-706\u2019s two-year limitations period does not run until the plaintiff knows, or should have known, that her harm is caused, not just by the product, but by a defect in that product. See generally In re Boston Scientific Corp., No. 2:12-cv-03700, MDL No. 2326, 2015 WL 1466746, at *4 (S.D. W.Va. Mar. 30, 2015) (unreported) (noting that Utah Supreme Court has not yet addressed this question), aff'd, 647 Fed.Appx. 184 (4th Cir. 2016) (unpublished) (per curiam).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Even assuming that the Utah Supreme Court would conclude that the two-year limitations period did not begin to run until Adams knew, or with due diligence should have known, that her harm was caused by a defect in the mesh sling, we conclude that Adams also knew, or should have known, that by no later than November 2007. Adams alleged that the sling was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>defective because, among other reasons, it was not inert, but instead it would migrate from the site of implantation and could protrude into a patient\u2019s vagina. Adams knew, no later than November 2007, that the mesh sling implanted in her had done just that. Cf. Strickland v. Gen. Motors Corp., 852 F.Supp. 956, 959-60 (D. Utah 1994) (applying predecessor statute \u00a7 78-15-3; holding plaintiff alleging seat belt was defective should have known that alleged defect caused her harm at the time she had an accident and the seat belt failed to restrain her), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Misener v. Gen. Motors, 924 F.Supp. 130, 131-32 <em>&amp; </em>132 n.1 (D. Utah 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Our conclusion is not changed .by Adams\u2019s contention that, in November 2007, her doctor recommended removing only the portion of the sling that was protruding into her vagina. Even so, Adams knew by this time that she had been harmed by the sling. And she would have had a cause of action under Utah\u2019s product liability act at that time, even if the second surgery had alleviated her problems caused by the migrating mesh sling. See Cannon v. Minn. Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., No. 2:08-CV-532 CW, 2009 WL 350561, at *6 &amp; n.2 (D. Utah Feb. 11, 2009) (unreported).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Adams further contends that she could not be on notice that her injuries might be caused by a defect in the mesh sling until her doctor told her, in 2013, that the entire sling had to be removed. But under Utah law, \u201cthe knowledge required of a plaintiff is inquiry notice: a plaintiff need not have a \u2018confirmed diagnosis\u2019 about the causal relation to trigger the running of the statute of limitations,\u201d Hansen, 2011 WL 6100848, at *3 (citing McKinnon, 815 F.Supp. at 420); \u201ca definitive confirmation of the cause of a plaintiffs injury is not required,\u201d id. at *5. \u201cAll that is required to trigger the statute of limitations is sufficient information to put plaintiff on notice to make further inquiry if she harbors doubts or questions.\u201d Pratt, 2013 WL 6146075, at *3 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Griffiths-Rast, 216 Fed.Appx. at 796 (applying predecessor Utah Code \u00a7 78-15-3). And Adams had that information by at least November 2007. Her claims, not asserted until June 2013, were thus untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">We, therefore, AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Adams\u2019s product liability claim against American Medical System as time-barred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. We GRANT the parties\u2019 joint motion to seal volume II of the Joint Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\">. Adams's now-settled appeal of the dismissal of her claim against Caldera was stayed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. In light of that, this Court also stayed Adams's appeal of the dismissal of her claim against American Medical System, Adams has now indicated that that portion of her appeal can proceed. In light of that, the Court lifts its stay of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b770-14\">. In 2008, the Utah legislature renumbered the two-year statute of limitations for product liability claims from \u00a7 78-15-3 to the current \u00a7 78B-6-706, but did not substantively change the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">. Although the Utah Supreme Court has not addressed this question, several federal district courts have; their decisions are divided. Compare, e.g., Bridgewaters v. Toro Co., 819 F.Supp. 1002, 1003-04, 1007-10 (D. Utah 1993) (holding two-year limitations period in predecessor statute, Utah Code \u00a7 78-15-3, began to run, not from when the plaintiff knew she was injured by an object thrown by a lawn mower, but instead when the plaintiff discovered that a defect in the lawn mower caused the injury), with, e.g., In re Boston Scientific Corp., 2015 WL 1466746, *4 (S.D. W.Va.) (holding Utah Code \u00a7 78B-6-706\u2019s two-year limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff discovers a \"possible causal relation\u201d between the product and her injuries, relying on other decisions from the District of Utah). We need not decide the question here because, as explained below, even assuming that the Utah Supreme Court would conclude that \u00a7 78B-6-706\u2019s two-year limitations did not begin to run until the plaintiff was on notice that her injuries might be the result of a defect in the product, Adams\u2019s claims at issue here are still untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">. The second surgery, of course, did not alleviate Adams\u2019s problems. She continued to suffer the same symptoms\u2014vaginal pain and bleeding, as well as incontinence and infections\u2014beginning just after the second surgery and for the next five and one-half years before she initiated this litigation. But those ongoing problems do not change our conclusion that Adams knew by no later than November 2007 that she had already been harmed by the sling. See Cannon, 2009 WL 350561, at *6 &amp; n.2 (noting both that \u00a7 78B-6-706 began to run when plaintiff suffered \"some harm\u201d and that the limitations period did not \"re-start\u201d when plaintiff later suffered new, more severe injuries, citing Utah cases applying statute of limitations for medical malpractice cases); McKinnon v. Tambrands, Inc., 815 F.Supp. 415, 418 n.5 (D. Utah 1993) (applying predecessor statute \u00a7 78-15-3; indicating that a plaintiff need not know \"the full extent\u201d of her harm before the limitations period begins to run).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
