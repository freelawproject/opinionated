Murphy Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b801-9\" pgmap=\"801\">Proceeding pro se, Portia Louder seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct her sentence. The matter is before this court on Lo'uder\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing no appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d unless the movant first obtains a COA). Because Louder has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies her request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. Id. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Louder\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris is granted.</p> <p id=\"b801-10\" pgmap=\"801\">Louder was charged by indictment with-making false statements, wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy. She underwent a competency evaluation and the district court found her competent to stand trial. In August 2014, Louder pleaded guilty to the wire fraud and conspiracy counts and was sentenced to eighty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. Louder did not file a direct appeal.</p> <p id=\"b801-11\" pgmap=\"801\">In her pro se \u00a7 2255 motion, Louder asserted her guilty plea was not voluntary because she was not competent when she entered the plea. She also asserted her guilty plea was coerced. The claims raised in Louder\u2019s motion were addressed by the district court in a comprehensive memorandum decision and order. The district court concluded that Louder\u2019s challenges to her convictions are procedurally barred because they were not raised in a direct appeal. See United States v. Allen, 16 F.3d 377, 378 (10th Cir. 1994) (\u201cA defendant who fails to present an issue on direct appeal is barred from raising the issue in a \u00a7 2255 motion, unless he can show cause for his procedural default and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged errors, or can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will occur if his claim is not addressed.\u201d). The court further concluded that, even in the absence of a procedural bar, the claims had no merit.</p> <p id=\"b801-13\" pgmap=\"801\">To be entitled'to a COA, Louder must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, she must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether. Louder has satisfied her burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of her claims. Id. at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Louder need not demonstrate her appeal will succeed to be-entitled to a COA, she must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b801-14\" pgmap=\"801(48) 802(43)\">Having undertaken a review of Louder\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in Miller-El, this court concludes Louder is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of her \u00a7 2255 motion is not reasonably subject to debate and the issues she seeks to raise on appeal are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, this court denies Louder\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
