Moritz, Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b790-22\" pgmap=\"790\">Proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kent Vu Phan appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b790-23\" pgmap=\"790(46) 791(56)\">Phan was injured in a car accident in 2012. He filed an insurance claim for bodily injury with American Family Insurance Company (American Family), but American Family rejected his claim. Phan brought a state-court action against American Family in November 2015, more than three years after the car accident. The state court dismissed Phan\u2019s action with prejudice because Phan failed to bring his claim within Colorado\u2019s three-year statute of limitations. Both the Colorado Court of Appeals and the Colorado Supreme Court dismissed Phan\u2019s appeal; Phan then commenced the instant action against American Family in federal district court.</p> <p id=\"b791-5\" pgmap=\"791\">Here, as he did in the previous state-court action, Phan seeks to recover money damages for the injuries he sustained in the 2012 car accident. He alleges American Family violated state insurance law and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213. The district court dismissed Phan\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. It also denied Phan leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, finding the appeal wouldn\u2019t be taken in good faith. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p> <p id=\"b791-6\" pgmap=\"791\">Phan appeals, arguing that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Our review is de novo. Garman v. Campbell Cty. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 630 F.3d 977, 983 (10th Cir. 2010).</p> <p id=\"b791-7\" pgmap=\"791\">\u201cThe Rooker-Feldman doctrine prevents the lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases brought by \u2018state-court losers\u2019 challenging \u2018state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.\u2019 \u201d Mann v. Boatright, 477 F.3d 1140, 1146 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting Lance v. Dennis, 546 U.S. 459, 460, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006)); see also D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 483 n.16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Tr. Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). It also precludes lower federal courts from assuming jurisdiction over claims that are \u201c \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with a prior state-court judgment.\u201d Mo\u2019s Express, LLC v. Sopkin, 441 F.3d 1229, 1233 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Kenmen Eng\u2019g v. City of Union, 314 F.3d 468, 473 (10th Cir. 2002)). Claims are inextricably intertwined with prior state-court judgments if they \u201cassert injuries based'on the [state-court] judgments and, for [the plaintiff] to prevail, would require the district court to review and reject those judgments.\u201d Mann, 477 F.3d at 1147.</p> <p id=\"b791-10\" pgmap=\"791\">Here, the district court found that Phan\u2019s claims were inextricably intertwined with the prior state-court judgment because awarding Phan \u201cmoney damages against [American Family] for the same injury complained of in the state court action ... would require the [district court] to review and reject the state court\u2019s finding.\u201d R., 154-55. Phan doesn\u2019t dispute that the state- and federal-court lawsuits are inextricably intertwined. But he does argue that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is nevertheless inapplicable because: (1) the district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his claims; and (2) the Erie Doctrine, the Supremacy Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause supersede the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and provide the federal district court with jurisdiction over his state-law insurance claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b792-3\" pgmap=\"792\">Phan\u2019s arguments lack merit. First, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine applies regardless of whether the district court would otherwise have jurisdiction because Phan is essentially asking the district court to review and reverse a final state-court judgment. See Mann, 477 F.3d at 1147. Next, nothing about the Erie Doctrine, the Supremacy Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause authorizes lower federal courts to review and reverse final state-court judgments. The Erie Doctrine instructs \u201ca federal district court sitting in diversity [to apply] federal procedural law and state substantive law.\u201d Jones v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 674 F.3d 1187, 1203 (10th Cir. 2012). The Supremacy Clause provides that \u201cfederal law preempts contrary state enactments.\u201d Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v. Edmondson, 594 F.3d 742, 765 (10th Cir. 2010). And the Equal Protection Clause \u201cseeks to ensure that any classifications the law makes are,made \u2018without respect to persons,\u2019 that like cases are treated alike, that those who \u2018appear similarly situated\u2019 are not treated differently without, at the very least, \u2018a rational reason for the difference.\u2019 \u201d SECSYS, LLC v. Vigil, 666 F.3d 678, 684 (10th Cir. 2012) (quoting Engquist v. Or. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 602, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008)). These principles are inapposite here.</p> <p id=\"b792-4\" pgmap=\"792\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. As a final matter,, we deny Phan\u2019s motion to proceed IFP because he fails to present a non-frivolous argument. See Lister v. Dep\u2019t Of Treasury, 408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir. 2005) (stating that \u201cin order to succeed on a motion to proceed IFP, the movant must show a financial inability to pay the required filing fees, as well as the existence of a reasoned, non-frivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised in the action\u201d).</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b790-7\" pgmap=\"790\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument wouldn't materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G), The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment isn\u2019t binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. See Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"agg-dedup-1\" pgmap=\"790\">. We liberally construe pro se pleadings. But we won't act as Phan's advocate. See James v. Wadas, 724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir. 2013).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b791-8\" pgmap=\"791\">. Phan also argues that the state court dismissed his complaint because of his race. But Phan failed to assert race discrimination in district court. Thus, we consider this argument waived. See Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), 959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir. 1992) (declining to consider arguments raised for first time on appeal), Additionally, he raises several other arguments for the first time in his reply brief. But \"the general rule in this circuit is that a party waives issues and arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d M.D. Mark, Inc. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 565 F.3d 753, 768 n.7 (10th Cir. 2009). Accordingly, we decline to address these arguments.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
