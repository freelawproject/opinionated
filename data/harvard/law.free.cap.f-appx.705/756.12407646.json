The Superseding Indictment alleged two counts against Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez: Count 1, Conspiracy to Distribute More than 500 Grams of Methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 846; and Count 2, Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). On April 24, 2015, Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez pleaded guilty to both counts and signed a Statement in Advance of Plea (i,e., a plea agreement). The district court sentenced Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-23\">After sentencing, Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, challenging his sentence on seven grounds, including that evidence used against him was obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and that his trial counsel was ineffective in negotiating and executing his plea agreement. Notably, Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez argued in his \u00a7 2255 motion that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Title III Wiretap Order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that allowed law enforcement officers to intercept communications from <em>his codefendant\u2019s phone </em>exceeded the jurisdictional limits of the state court that issued the order. As to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he argued that his counsel had failed to present the government with a signed plea agreement and instead permitted him to plead guilty without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The district court denied his motion. First, the court found that Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim was procedurally defaulted because he never raised it during trial or on direct appeal. Furthermore, he did not attempt to show cause and prejudice, as required to obtain review of his defaulted claim. Second, the court found that Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim was meritless. Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez claimed that he pleaded guilty without a plea agreement and received nothing in return for his plea. The district court found, however, that both of these arguments are directly refuted by the record. Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez in fact signed a plea agreement. Moreover, he received a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which he would not have received if he had gone to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We may not adjudicate the merits of Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion unless he is able to secure from us a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>United States v. Warren, </em>660 Fed.Appx. 611, 611-12 (10th Cir. 2016); <em>see also Gonzalez v. Thaler, </em>565 U.S. 134, 142, 132 S.Ct. 641, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (citing the \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 jurisdictional language ... in \u00a7 2253(c)(1)\u201d). In order to obtain a COA, Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>see Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). To make this showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (quoting <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893 &amp; n.4, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">We conclude that reasonable jurists could not debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s resolution of Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion or find that there were issues that are \u201cadequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (quoting <em>Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 893 <em>&amp; </em>n.4, 103 S.Ct. 3383).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez appears to advance before us related, yet distinct, arguments from those he made in the district court. First, he suggests, -without providing any record support, that law enforcement officers illegally \u201ctapped\u201d <em>his phone </em>under the auspices of the Title III Order that authorized them to intercept communications only to and from his <em>codefen-dant\u2019s </em>phone. Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez also argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to adequately investigate the strength of the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>case in advance of Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Because Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez did not raise these arguments in his \u00a7 2255 motion, we decline to consider them here. <em>See Fairchild v. Workman, </em>579 F.3d 1134, 1141 n.2 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cGenerally, the failure to raise an argument in one\u2019s initial filing will cause it to be waived.\u201d); <em>Parker v. Scott, </em>394 F.3d 1302, 1327 (10th Cir. 2005) (\u201cParker raises several other alleged failures of counsel to object at trial, all of which he has waived by failing to assert them in his district court habeas petition.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>997 F.2d 1312, 1316 (10th Cir. 1993) (\u201cIn the present appeal, Defendant raises thirty-one grounds for relief. To the extent that he failed to raise these grounds in his \u00a7 2255 motion to the district court, he has waived them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In sum, we conclude that Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez has failed to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s ruling or find that there are issues of sufficient merit that they should be encouraged to proceed further. Accordingly, we deny his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Finally, Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez is not entitled to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>because he has failed to identify \u201cthe existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Leyba, </em>543 F.3d 624, 627 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812-13 (10th Cir. 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Based on the foregoing, we DENY Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019s request for a COA, DENY his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and DISMISS this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-19\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R, App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-24\">.
