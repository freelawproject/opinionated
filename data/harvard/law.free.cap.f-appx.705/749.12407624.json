Phillips Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In October 2013, Taos Ski Valley, Inc. (TSV) discovered that an oil-and-water separator on its federally leased property had released hydrocarbon contaminants into the soil at the company\u2019s ski resort in New Mexico. To abate the contamination and to protect nearby ground and surface water, TSV spent over a million dollars remediating the site. TSV had a commercial general-liability insurance policy with the Nova Casualty Company (Nova) and sought indemnification for its clean-up expenses. When Nova denied coverage under the insurance policy\u2019s owned-property exclusion (the Owned-Property Exclusion), TSV sued for declaratory relief in federal court in the District of New Mexico. But the district court granted Nova\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and later denied TSVs Motion for Reconsideration. TSV appealed. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">When TSVs environmental contractor first discovered the contamination, he collected a series of soil and water samples for scientific analysis. Tests of the samples revealed that diesel and petroleum levels exceeded permissible levels under New Mexico environmental regulations. Apart from these violations, the contamination posed risks to the nearby Rio Honda, a body of surface water regulated by the federal Clean Water Act, and to the aquifer beneath the contamination. TSV claims that the regulatory violations subjected it to immediate third-party liability to state and federal environmental authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">TSVs ski resort operates on federal land under a special-use permit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The permit requires TSV to pay the \u201cfull cost of any damage\u201d caused by its own \u201cnegligence or activities.\u201d R. vol. 1 at 8. TSV notified the relevant state and federal authorities of the contamination and \u201ccoordinated and implemented necessary corrective measures\u201d to abate the contamination and protect the threatened water resources. Appellant Opening Br. at 9. TSVs remediation program succeeded, and the company even received federal commendation for its diligent clean-up efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Before TSV started its remediation, it notified Nova (through Nova\u2019s designated agent, Safehold Special Risk) of the contamination and the environmental harm. TSV requested that Nova acknowledge its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>responsibility under its insurance policy to indemnify TSV for the cost of the clean-up. The policy at issue (the Policy) was effective from November 1, 2013 to November 1, 2014.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Policy\u2019s insuring clause states that Nova \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d R. vol. 5 at 173. It goes on to state that Nova \u201cwill have no duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for ... \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In October 2014, Nova notified TSV that it was denying TSV insurance coverage for the clean-up costs. As support for its denial, Nova cited the Owned-Property Exclusion located in Section 2(j)(l) of the Policy, which excluded coverage for damage to \u201cProperty you own, rent, or occupy, including any costs or expenses incurred by you, or any other person, organization or entity, for repair, replacement, enhancement, restoration or maintenance of such property for any reason, including prevention of injury to a person or damage to another\u2019s property....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">TSV and Nova then traded several volleys of letters and legal opinions about the Owned-Property Exclusion. TSV alleged that the Owned-Property Exclusion was inapplicable because TSV was seeking indemnification for its costs in abating third-party public and environmental injuries rather than first-party injury to its own property. In March 2015, Nova again denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">In April 2015, TSV sued Nova for declaratory relief in federal court in the District of New Mexico. Nova filed a Motion to Dismiss, relying on the Owned-Property Exclusion. TSV then filed a Motion for Certification of Question of State Law to the New Mexico Supreme Court, arguing that state-court guidance was needed to decide this issue of first impression under New Mexico law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court never ruled on the motion, instead simply deciding the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">In December 2015, the district court granted Nova\u2019s Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court concluded that the broad language in Nova\u2019s Owned-Property Exclusion distinguished it from the narrower language in the owned-property exclusions at issue in TSVs cited cases. The district court concluded that the broader language \u201crender[ed] [TSVs] reading of [the] policy unreasonable.\u201d R. vol. 6 at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">Alternatively, TSV argued that the district court should not enforce the Own\u00e9d-Property Exclusion, asserting that the exclusion violates New Mexico public policy. In TSV\u2019s view, a court\u2019s enforcing the exclusion (if interpreted as the district court did) would lead insureds to delay clean-ups until after environmental contamination damaged neighboring property or water. The district court rejected this argument, based partly on its view that insureds opt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ing for delay would make themselves vulnerable to the policy exclusion for damage \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d R. vol. 5 at 174. TSV moved for reconsideration, which the district court summarily denied. TSV appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">TSV asks us to reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of its complaint against Nova. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Horowitz v. Schneider Nat., Inc., </em>992 F.2d 279, 281 (10th Cir. 1993). A complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). We must accept a complaint\u2019s allegations as true, but that acceptance \u201cis inapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). \u201cThe obligation of the insurer is a question of contract law and will be determined by reference to the terms of the insurance policy,\u201d <em>Knowles v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>113 N.M. 703, 832 P.2d 394, 396 (1992). In construing exclusionary clauses in New Mexico, courts must try to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In urging us to reverse the district court, TSV\u2019s primary argument is that Nova owes it coverage not for first-party damages, but only for third-party liability that it argues the Owned-Property Exclusion does not reach. Pointing to the insuring clause, TSV argues that to read the Exclusion as foreclosing coverage for the prospective third-party claims of New Mexico and the United States would \u201ceviscerate the essence of a third-party liability policy.\u201d Appellant Opening Br. at 35. The New Mexico Supreme Court, TSV notes, construes exclusionary clauses narrowly, <em>Knowles, </em>832 P.2d at 396, enforcing only those not \u201cin irreconcilable conflict with the insuring clause,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 398. Such a conflict exists here, TSV argues, because the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Owned-Property Exclusion cuts strongly against the pro-coverage expectation suggested by the broad language of the Policy\u2019s insuring clause and even by the word \u201cgeneral\u201d in the Policy\u2019s title. Appellant Opening Br. at 36. Thus, TSV posits that the Owned-Property Exclusion excludes coverage for first-party property damage, but not coverage for third-party liability arising from an event on the insured\u2019s property that caused first-party property damage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>TSV\u2019s interpretation runs counter to the Policy\u2019s language.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The 'Policy\u2019s insuring clause first sets out that Nova \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d R. vol. 5 at 173. The Policy later lists multiple exclusions for damages to which the policy does not apply, including the Owned-Property Exclusion. That Exclusion denies coverage for damage to \u201c[property you own, rent, or occupy, including any costs or expenses incurred by you, or any other person, organization or entity, for ... restoration ... of such property <em>for any reason, including prevention </em>of... <em>damage to another\u2019s property.\u201d Id. </em>at 176 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We read the Policy as one \u201ccomplete and harmonious instrument designed to accomplish a reasonable end.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>832 P.2d at 396 (quoting <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., Inc. v. McKenna, </em>90 N.M. 516, 565 P.2d 1033, 1037 (1977)). In doing so, we conclude that this language narrowed the definition of property damage that can give rise to covered third-party liability. To be covered, the liability cannot be for damage to property that the insured party owns, rents, or occupies. Thus, the Exclusion defeats coverage for TSV\u2019s remediation costs incurred because of soil contamination on the resort\u2019s land, no matter that the reason for the costs was third-party liability. And that coverage limitation creates no irreconcilable conflict with the insuring clause; it simply creates an exclusion to it. <em>See United Nuclear Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>285 P.3d 644, 650 (N.M. 2012) (\u201cAn exclusion does not conflict with an insurance policy\u2019s insuring agreement simply because it affords less or different coverage as compared with what the policy would provide without the exclusion; that is the very purpose of an exclusion, to restrict the scope of the policy beyond what would otherwise be covered.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">In addition, we see another problem with TSV\u2019s argument. TSV argues that the policy exclusion applies only to first-party-property-damage claims and not to third-party-liability claims, pointing out that the Exclusion does not contain the word \u201cliability.\u201d <em>See </em>R. vol. 6 at 176. But we must remember that the entire policy concerns \u201cCommercial General Liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173. So, despite TSV\u2019s claim to the contrary, we are not \u201cread[ing] the word \u2018liability\u2019 into the \u2018owned or occupied\u2019 property exclusion,\u201d Appellant Reply Br. at 13\u2014we are simply reading the document as a whole.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">TSV also argues that the district court \u201cleapfrogged\u201d the main issue; Appellant Opening Br. at 33. TSV says that the district court wrongly focused on the Exclusion\u2019s example of \u201cprevention of ... damage to another\u2019s property,\u201d <em>see </em>R, vol. 6 at 176, when the situation at the ski resort involved not only prevention of future damage to a third party\u2019s property, but immediate third-party liability to New Mexico for the environmental violations. But even if immediate liability was a separate reason for the clean-up restoration costs on the insured\u2019s property, the insured\u2019s costs would still occur for a reason (liability to New Mexico and the United States for environmental violations) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>fall within the \u201cany reason\u201d language of the exclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">TSV points to a number of state and federal cases to support its interpretation of the Policy. The cases do indeed interpret various owned-property exclusions in insurance policies as not excluding third-party liability claims arising from damage on the insured\u2019s property. <em>See, e.g., Anderson Dev. Co. v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>49 F.3d 1128, 1134 (6th Cir. 1995) (concluding that the owned-property exclusion did not bar coverage for damages caused by \u201ca government mandate to conduct [an] environmental clean-up\u201d); <em>Patz v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>15 F.3d 699, 705 (7th Cir. 1994) (\u201cThe fact that the clean up occurred on [the insured\u2019s] land is irrelevant.\u201d); <em>Pac. Hide &amp; Fur Depot v. Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>23 F.Supp.3d 1208, 1222-23 (D. Mont. 2014) (finding support for the inapplicability of owned-property exclusions in environmental-remediation situations); <em>Unigard Mut. Ins. Co. v. McCarty\u2019s, Inc., </em>756 F.Supp. 1366, 1369 (D. Idaho 1988) (concluding that the exclusion at issue \u201cdoes not prevent coverage for <em>liability to third parties </em>caused by property damage to the insured\u2019s property\u201d); <em>Upjohn Co. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>178 Mich.App. 706, 444 N.W.2d 813, 819 (1989) (finding an exclusion inapplicable because of public ownership of threatened environmental resources), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by </em>438 Mich. 197, 476 N.W.2d 392 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">But the policies in TSV\u2019s' cases do not involve the broadened owned-property exclusion at issue here\u2014one excluding repairs and restorations of owned property \u201cfor any reason.\u201d R. vol. 5 at 176. We return to this phrase of the Policy again and again, because it decides the case. Many of TSV\u2019s arguments, including those resting on the above-cited cases, simply fall flat when faced with this phrase of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">In contrast, Nova\u2019s cited cases interpret the same policy-exclusion language at issue in this case. Its cases conclude that the broadened language of the Owned-Property Exclusion, as in Nova\u2019s policy, excludes coverage for clean-up costs incurred because of property damage to the insured\u2019s property, no matter whether done to prevent property damage to third parties or for any other reason. <em>See, e.g., Pioneer Expl., L.L.C. v. Steadfast Ins. Co., </em>767 F.3d 503, 518 (5th Cir. 2014); <em>Clarinet, LLC v. Essex Ins. Co., </em>712 F.3d 1246, 1249-50 (8th Cir. 2013); <em>Castle Vill. Owners Corp. v. Greater N.Y. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>64 A.D.3d 44, 52, 878 N.Y.S.2d 311 (2009); <em>Watertown Tire Recyclers, LLC v. Nortman, </em>788 N.W.2d 384, 2010 WL 2403094, at *2-*3 (Wis. Ct. App. 2010) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">In response, TSV argues that not all of Nova\u2019s cited cases dealt with the precise pattern of facts here, where environmental contamination caused immediate third-party liability, as opposed to merely potential liability or first-party property damages masquerading as third-party liability. Regardless, courts have interpreted exclusions with the same broad language at issue here to exclude coverage, as a plain reading compels. And, as discussed above, an analysis of the most relevant factor\u2014 the language of the Policy\u2014shows that the Owned-Property Exclusion does reach the kind of environmental clean-up effort in which TSV engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">In trying to distinguish Nova\u2019s supportive cases, TSV also argues that the \u201conly reason\u201d it performed environmental remediation efforts was the third-party liability it faced. Appellant Reply Br. at 12. To support that argument, TSV briefly notes that the \u201cremediation\u201d it performed during the clean-up is not enumerated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the Owned-Property Exclusion\u2019s list of \u201crepair, replacement, enhancement, restoration or maintenance\u201d for which costs would be excluded. <em>Id.; </em>R. vol. 5 at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">But whatever formal name or label TSV gives it (even if also accurate), \u201crestoration\u201d accurately describes the process TSV initiated to clean up its soil contamination and to prevent its spread. <em>Restoration, </em>Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (\u201cThe action of restoring a thing to a former state or position; the fact of being restored or reinstated.\u201d); <em>see Watertown Tire Recyclers, LLC, </em>2010 WL 2403094, at *3 (\u201cGiving the term \u2018restoration\u2019 its ordinary meaning, it is apparent that returning contaminated property to something much closer to its former non-contaminated state is \u2018restoration\u2019....\u201d). And even if regulatory liability was the \u201conly reason\u201d TSV remediated its soil, Appellant Reply Br. at 12, the Exclusion excludes coverage for the costs of restoring your own property \u201cfor any reason,\u201d after suffering damage, R. vol. 5 at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Nor do we find the Exclusion\u2019s relevant language ambiguous. An insurance-policy's language is ambiguous if it is \u201creasonably and fairly susceptible of different constructions.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>832 P.2d at 396 (quoting <em>Sanchez v. Herrera, </em>109 N.M. 165, 783 P.2d 465, 469 (1989)). Ambiguities in insurance-policy language are construed against the insurance-company drafter. <em>Id. </em>But New Mexico courts \u201cshould not \u2018create ambiguity where none exists, and an ambiguity does not exist merely because the parties hold competing interpretations\u2019 about the meaning of a policy provision.\u201d <em>United Nuclear Corp., </em>285 P.3d at 647-48 (quoting <em>City of Santa Rosa v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>140 N.M. 434, 143 P.3d 196, 198 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq__\">Neither of TSV\u2019s two primary cases interpreting an owned-property exclusion as ambiguous dealt with the version of the owned-property exclusion at issue here. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>28 F.Supp.2d 448, 451 (E.D. Mich. 1998); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Dana Corp., </em>759 N.E.2d 1049, 1055-56 (Ind. 2001). We see nothing ambiguous in Nova\u2019s owned-property exclusion, in particular its exclusion of damage to an insured\u2019s property, including restoration costs \u201cfor any reason, including prevention of ... damage to another\u2019s property.\u201d R. vol. 5 at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Nor does TSV\u2019s appeal to public policy win it coverage. TSV argues that limiting Policy coverage to situations where an insured allows environmental contamination to spread to the property of third parties violates New Mexico public policy. In TSV\u2019s view, that result encourages insureds to let environmental contamination spread beyond their own property to obtain policy coverage. Only then, TSV says, when the insured party is more certain of indemnification, will it engage in costly clean-up efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">We acknowledge that a policy exclusion is void if it \u201cconflict[s] with public policy stated in express statutory language or by indication of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Found. Reserve Ins. Co., </em>107 N.M. 322, 757 P.2d 792, 794 (1988). But our ruling does not create an incentive to allow environmental contamination to spread. First, we note that TSV has never responded to the district court\u2019s finding that an insured\u2019s intentionally delaying clean up would offer the insured no benefit in view of the Policy\u2019s \u201cExpected Or Intended Injury\u201d exclusion. R. vol. 6 at 237; R. vol. 5 at 174. That exclusion denies coverage when liability arises from \u201c\u2018property damage\u2019 expected or intended from the standpoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>of the insured.\u201d R. vol.'5 at 174. In addition, an intentional clean-up delay would likely make a company vulnerable to later governmental-enforcement actions\u2014actions that might harm a company\u2019s pocketbook and reputation more than would cleaning up the original damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">In short, TSV acted commendably in this situation by promptly cleaning up the contamination and preventing damage to valuable public and environmental resources. But that commendable behavior does not give it a free pass to avoid the effects of a plainly worded policy exclusion, which we determine that the New Mexico Supreme Court would find unambiguously excludes the costs of the clean-up from indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of TSV\u2019s complaint. We also deny TSV\u2019s Motion for Certification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\">. Because this case is before us based on diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and because no New Mexico court has addressed the applicability of the Owned-Property Exclusion in similar circumstances as here, we must try to determine what the Supreme Court of New Mexico would decide. <em>See Pehle v. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., Inc., </em>397 F.3d 897, 901-02 (10th Cir. 2005). In doing so, we may consider all available resources, including decisions of the New Mexico courts, other state and federal courts, and the general trend of authority. <em>See Stuart v. Colo. Interstate Gas Co., </em>271 F.3d 1221, 1228 (10th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-13\">. When we use the term \"third-party liability\u201d to discuss TSV\u2019s arguments, we use it in the sense TSV uses it\u2014as referring to the regulatory fines and penalties TSV may have had to pay to government authorities had it not remediated its contaminated soil, and to the clean-up costs it did incur. Because Nova has not contested that such fines and costs are within the insuring clause, we move directly to the Policy\u2019s Owned-Property Exclusion, taking no position on whether the insuring clause would provide cov\u00e9rage for' such fines and costs,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\">. From November 2009 to November 2014, TSV had five substantively identical, one-year policies with Nova.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">. Nova also reserved the right to deny coverage based on the Policy\u2019s limited pollution-liability exclusion, but did not litigate that exclusion's applicability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b775-9\">. TSV now asks us to certify the disputed coverage question to the New Mexico Supreme Court. We decline to do so. <em>See Pino v. United States, </em>507 F.3d 1233, 1236 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"When we see a reasonably clear and principled course, we will seek to follow it ourselves.\u201d); <em>Armijo v. Ex Cam, Inc., </em>843 F.2d 406, 407 (10th Cir. 1988) (\"Certification is not to be routinely invoked whenever a federal court is presented with an unsettled question of state law.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. In support of this narrow construction of the Owned-Property Exclusion, TSV cites to an analysis of the Exclusion by the International Risk Management Institute, Inc. (IRMI), a group that provides insurance-policy analysis to businesses and other professionals. In January 2002, IRMI published an analysis of a number of 2001 changes made to commercial general-liability policies, including the Owned-Property Exclusion now before us. IRMI concluded that the language of the Exclusion, as amended into its present form, plainly stated that the costs of repairs to an insured's own property could not be covered as a third-party liability simply by claiming that the repairs were intended to avoid damage to neighboring property rather than to benefit the insured party\u2019s own interests (in response to recent claims that had done so).
