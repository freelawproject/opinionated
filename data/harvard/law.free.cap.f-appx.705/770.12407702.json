He sued several churches, alleging that as the Son of Man, \u201che is entitled to recognition, support, Honor and complete control of defendants\u2019 Affairs,\u201d yet the defendant churches had failed to \u201cabide by clear and explicit agreements and contracts set forth in the Holy Bible.\u201d R. at 38, 39. The district court dismissed the suit as legally frivolous because Mr. Sayyed had failed to identify any express or implied contract or any meeting of the minds between him and the defendant churches. In the alternative, the district court determined that the allegations were factually frivolous. Mr. Sayyed appeals. '</p> <p id=\"b795-4\" pgmap=\"795\">On appeal, Mr. Sayyed continues to press his contentions that he is \u201cThe Spirit of God/Words of God, the second coming ... of Jesus Christ ... The Holy Spirit,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 18, and that the defendant churches have an obligation, set forth in the Bible, to \u201cwatch and be ready for the coming of the Son of Man\u201d and \u201chonor, and lift up the Son of Man (Appellant),\u201d id. at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). As he did in the district court, he attempts to support his contentions with extensive discussions of numerology. But nothing in Mr. Sayyed\u2019s appeal brief undermines the district court\u2019s conclusion that the lawsuit is both legally and factually frivolous. We therefore affirm the dismissal for substantially the reasons discussed by the district court.</p> <p id=\"b795-5\" pgmap=\"795\">We further determine that this appeal is frivolous. Accordingly, we deny Mr. Sayyed\u2019s motion to proceed without prepayment of costs and fees (IFP), see DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, 937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir. 1991) (requiring an appellant to present \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts\u201d to proceed IFP), and order him to tender the full amount of the filing and docketing fees to the clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Additionally, we assess a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) for this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b795-10\" pgmap=\"795\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b794-6\" pgmap=\"794(58) 795(32)\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
