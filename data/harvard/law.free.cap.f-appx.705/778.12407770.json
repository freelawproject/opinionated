Murphy, Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b802-18\" pgmap=\"802\">After examining Appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this court has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the adjudication of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p> <p id=\"b802-21\" pgmap=\"802\">Proceeding pro se, Tyrone Hurt appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint he filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The complaint was dismissed without prejudice when Hurt failed to comply with the district court\u2019s order to file a legible amended complaint clarifying the claims being asserted. Hurt\u2019s appellate brief, like his complaint, is nearly illegible. It focuses on Hurt\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis and contains no clear argument as to why the district court\u2019s .judgment should be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b802-22\" pgmap=\"802\">Having reviewed the record and Hurt\u2019s appellate filings, this court concludes Hurt\u2019s appeal is \u201cwithout merit in that it lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact.\u201d Thompson v. Gibson, 289 F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir. 2002). We, thus, dismiss the appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). See Lister v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir. 2005) (noting \u00a7 1915 applies to all litigants seeking to proceed in forma pauperis). We also deny Hurt\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis and remind him of his responsibility to make immediate payment of any unpaid balance of the appellate filing fee.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b802-19\" pgmap=\"802\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
