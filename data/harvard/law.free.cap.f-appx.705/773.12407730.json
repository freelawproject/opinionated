O\u2019Brien, Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b798-8\" pgmap=\"798\">Jonathan Sandoval is a federal prisoner who seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1)(B) (requiring a COA to appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion). After he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the district court sentenced him to 15 years in prison under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), see id. \u00a7 924(e)(1), based on at least three prior convictions in New Mexico for residential burglary, see N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 SO-ie^A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sandoval moved to vacate his sentence under \u00a7 2255, arguing residential burglary encompasses more conduct than generic burglary for purposes of applying the ACCA. The district court denied relief and also denied a COA.</p> <p id=\"b798-12\" pgmap=\"798\">To obtain a COA from this court, Sandoval must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He must show \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b798-13\" pgmap=\"798\">Sandoval\u2019s arguments might have been debatable before our decision in United States v. Turrieta, 875 F.3d 1340 (10th Cir. 2017), but they are no longer. Turrieta held a New Mexico conviction for residential burglary qualifies as a generic burglary under the ACCA. Id. at 1346-47. Thus, no reasonable jurist would debate the district court\u2019s decision or debate whether Sandoval\u2019s arguments deserve encouragement to proceed further. They do not. Accordingly, we deny a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b798-9\" pgmap=\"798\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this matter. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b798-10\" pgmap=\"798\">.
