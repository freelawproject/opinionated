Tymkovich Chief Judge</author> <p id=\"b799-18\" pgmap=\"799\">In April 2015 Robby Alan Murphy was indicted for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG), a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced if the \u201cdefendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p> <p id=\"b799-22\" pgmap=\"799\">Murphy was previously convicted of assaulting a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b) and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). A violation of \u00a7 924(c) \u201cis a crime of violence if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l). The parties agree the offense underlying Murphy\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction is HobbS Act Robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951.</p> <p id=\"b799-23\" pgmap=\"799\">The presentence investigation report (PSR) enhanced Murphy\u2019s putative sentence because it concluded both of his pri- or convictions qualified as crimes of violence. Murphy objected to the PSR, claiming neither conviction constituted a crime of violence.</p> <p id=\"b799-24\" pgmap=\"799\">At a status conference, the district court considered Murphy\u2019s objections to the PSR. The district court recognized the crimes-of-violence jurisprudence is an \u201cevolving\u201d area in which the ground was \u201cshifting beneath\u201d them. R., Vol. 3 at 231-24. Nonetheless, the district court held assaulting a federal officer in violation of \u00a7 111(b) and Hobbs Act both qualified as crimes of violence.</p> <p id=\"b799-25\" pgmap=\"799\">The district court\u2019s observation that the ground was shifting beneath them proved prophetic. After the district court\u2019s decision, our circuit determined whether both of these statutes qualify as crimes of violence.</p> <p id=\"b800-3\" pgmap=\"800\">In United States v. Kendall, we held convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b) qualify as crimes of violence. No. 16-6344, 876 F.3d 1264, 2017 WL 6273210 (10th Cir. filed Dec. 11, 2017). There, we explained how \u00a7 111(b) can be violated in two ways\u2014by an assault that causes a bodily injury or an assault with a deadly weapon. Id. We concluded \u00a7 111(b) constitutes a crime of violence because violating the subsection in either manner will always involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Id.</p> <p id=\"b800-4\" pgmap=\"800\">But in United States v. O\u2019Connor, we held that Hobbs Act Robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 does not constitute a crime of violence. 874 F.3d 1147, 1153-59 (10th Cir. 2017). There, we explained how Hobbs Act Robbery \u201ccan be accomplished by threats to property....\u201d Id. at 1158. We thus concluded that Hobbs Act Robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence because every conviction for violating the statute will not involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Id.</p> <p id=\"b800-5\" pgmap=\"800\">The district court therefore correctly concluded Murphy\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b) qualifies as a crime of violence, but erred by concluding his conviction under \u00a7 1951 likewise qualifies as a crime of violence. Because Murphy was previously convicted of one\u2014not two\u2014 crimes of violence, the PSR incorrectly set his base level offense at 24 pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accordingly vacate Murphy\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <footnote label=\"**\"> <p id=\"b799-20\" pgmap=\"799\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b800-15\" pgmap=\"800\">. The government claims Murphy forfeited his argument that Hobbs Act Robbery does not constitute a crime of violence. Before the district court, Murphy's counsel argued Hobbs Act Robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence because it \"can be committed without any violence towards any person.\u201d R., Vol. 3 at 419. Yet in his brief on appeal, counsel argued Hobbs Act Robbery does not constitute a crime of violence because a conviction can be based on force used against property. The government claims the slight difference between these arguments demonstrates Murphy forfeited his property-based argument.</p> <p id=\"b800-16\" pgmap=\"800\">We disagree, When Murphy claimed Hobbs Act Robbery can be committed without violence towards a person, .it is \"hard to understand what else\u201d he could have meant besides the fact that Hobbs Act Robbery can be committed by applying force to something else\u2014 namely, property. Reply Br. at 4.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b800-18\" pgmap=\"800\">. In his opening brief, Murphy argues that if we remand for resentencing, \"the district court should be free to reconsider its earlier sentencing decision on the leader/organizer enhancement,\" Aplt, Br, at 31 n.5. We agree the district court has discretion to \u201cexpand the scope of resentencing beyond the issue that resulted in the reversal and vacation of [the] sentence,\" United States v. Moore, 83 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir. 1996); see United States v. Hicks, 146 F.3d 1198, 1200-03 (10th Cir. 1998).</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
