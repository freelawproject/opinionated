The violations as charged are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-14\"><em>\u201cViolation </em>1 \u2014 On September 6,1970, at or about 12:05 o\u2019clock A. M., EST., your agent James E.. Fall did know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ingly and/or willfully allow in and upon the permit premises, improper conduct, in that your agent James E. Fall, did allow a female to dance in a manner which suggested an indecent act \u2014 in violation of LOe-1-52 a regulation of the Ohio Liquor Control Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\"><em>\u201cViolation </em>2 \u2014 On September 6,1970, at or about 12:05 o\u2019clock A. M., EST., your agent, James E. Fall, did knowingly and/or willfully allow in and upon the permit premises, improper conduct in that your agent James E. Fall did allow a female to have physical conduct with various patrons, to-wit, placing her buttocks on a male patron\u2019s lap and performing in a manner which suggested an indecent act \u2014 in violation of LCc-1-52 a regulation of the Ohio Liquor Control Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The liquor control commission, after a hearing, found the allegations well taken, and ordered plaintiff\u2019s permit suspended for twenty-eight days. Plaintiff appealed to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The Common Pleas Court, in its decision and entry wrote, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cThe evidence is clear that the performance of the Gro-Uo dancer was suggestive of an act of sexual intercourse in both instances. Upon consideration of the entire record, this Court finds that the order of the Ohio Liquor Control Commission is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. The order is, therefore, <em>AFFIRMED </em>at the costs of appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Counsel for plaintiff relies heavily in his brief upon the decision of this court in <em>Fortner </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>No. 8714, decided December 26, 1968 (reversed on other grounds), concerning an indecent act, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u201c* * * In our view, \u2018indecent\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018obscene.\u2019 The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u2018obscenity\u2019 is a meaningful, though very limited, legal concept. <em>The court has provided guidelines as to its meaning and application. </em>See <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 476; <em>Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>378 U. S. 184; <em>Ginsburg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U. S. 463. These cases and those cited therein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>provide the interpretation of the word \u2018indecent\u2019 and the word \u2018obscene\u2019 as used in the regulation. As so defined and interpreted, we find the two words sufficiently definite and therefore reasonable and lawful.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Consequently, applying the <em>Fortner </em>case, it is counsel\u2019s contention that the elements established by the Supreme Court concerning the meaning and application of \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201cindecent\u201d must be proven before a conviction can be sustained. Such elements are cited, along with counsel\u2019s basic argument, at page 3 of his brief as follows: ;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201c1. The dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201c2. The material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201c3. The material is utterly without redeeming social value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201cSee <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra,; Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States, supra; State </em>v. <em>Mazes, </em>7 Ohio State 2nd, 136. All three elements must exist and <em>must be proven </em>at the trial before a ruling can be made that the material is indecent or obscene. Absent such proof or coalescence of the above three elements, the finding of the Liquor Control Commission in the instant case and the finding of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County in the instant case must be reversed. # * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Judge Troop, however, expressed a different viewpoint in <em>Ivan Friedman </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>No. 8938, decided by this court March 5, 1968, in the following quoted passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\u201cCommission regulations, including No. 52, serve the statutory injunction contained in Section 4301.03 (B), Be-vised Code, when they are designed to maintain \u2018public decency, sobriety, and good order.\u2019 The enforcement division of the liquor department should be dedicated to the accomplishment of that very serious purpose. It could well be questioned whether the employment of an almost completely naked woman in a dance routine in a public bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>is an attempt to maintain public decency, but admitting that opposition to such performance is an antiquated and puritanical point of view, let us note the fact pattern in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">\u201cGo-go girls appear to have social approval in the present day. Whatever the title conferred, the girls, it is generally conceded according to counsel in oral argument, appear in a halter and a pair of panties. Thus displayed, \u2018Inez\u2019 danced on a bar within the reach of patrons consuming alcoholic beverages \u2014 males for the most part. One witness said \u2018her strap fell\u2019 during the dance on the bar (R. 39), which was undoubtedly an occupational hazard, but nevertheless could well provoke an incident. <em>To dance essentially tare and within reach of patrons, inetriated and otherwise, cannot te said to te designed to maintain decency and good order.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Furthermore, we note the following significant statement by Judge Zimmerman in <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1965), 4 Ohio St. 2d 31, at page 34:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cIn approaching a decision in this case, it is of importance to consider the nature of the liquor business, particularly as it here relates to the dispensing and sale of intoxicating liquor at retail by the glass. Because of the harmful potentialities incident to the conduct of such business, those engaging therein must obtain a permit from the state and are thereafter subject to strict regulation by statute and by rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to statutory authority by the Department of Liquor Control, the regulating and supervising agency created by the state to oversee and police, as it were, the liquor business. One who applies for and is issued a permit to sell alcoholic beverages thereby assents to the reasonable and lawful conditions imposed by statute and rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Thereafter, whatever the generally accepted mores may be at a particular time and place and in particular circumstances outside permit premises, a permit holder must conduct his business in a manner designed to maintain public decency arid good order. This concept was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>iterated by this court in <em>Crouse </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Comm., </em>No. 7669, decided January 12, 1965, where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">\u201cRegulation No. 52 of the commission is the basis of the violation charged as numbered one. It is admitted that the regulation is stringent and the language used peculiarly that of the agency. As has been pointed out many times, a permit holder enjoys the privilege of doing business in Ohio subject to the regulations imposed by the commission. He may meet the requirements or forfeit his privilege. The language of the regulation may be regarded as strict or exacting, but it must be presumed to have been designed as a measure of control and necessary to be imposed to provide places, where the public may go to purchase alcoholic beverages, which are suitable, decent and properly conducted. <em>We are not concerned with general standards applied to a variety of places of entertainment or amusement involving social mores or community social levels, but the application of a requlatory measure as to the conduct of a permit holder in the operation of his business.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Therefore, the <em>Fortner </em>case is inconsistent with the foregoing standard for permit holders. Further, the <em>Fortner </em>tests are vague and unenforceable in this context. Consequently, we overrule the <em>Fortner </em>case as to the standard of conduct a permit holder must adhere to relative to indecent acts and' improper conduct in the operation of his business..</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Plaintiff further contends that the order is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Note R. C. 119.12. The Administrative Procedure Act does not define the meaning of those terms. Hence, we must look to case law for their definition. The definitions of concern are included in <em>Ohio Real Estate Commission </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(1962), 90 Ohio Law Abs. 137, where paragraph 6 of the headnotes states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201cThe evidence required by Section 119.12, Revised Code, to support an order of an administrative agency on an appeal therefrom to the courts must be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201c1. Reliable, that is, dependable, with reasonable as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>surance of its probability, as not only truthful but also true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Probative relates to the evidentiary value of the testimony and other evidence in an analytical sense, having depth and being more than merely superficial or speculative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">\u201c3. Substantial would mean that the evidence has body or substance of sufficient degree to be of some weight, as well as quality, that gives it standing and credence, as well as dependable and trustworthy. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Note also <em>Liquor Control Comm. </em>v. <em>Bartolas </em>(1963), 10 Ohio Misc. 225; <em>Lakis </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control </em>(1964), 1 Ohio Misc. 109. Moreover, cases before the liquor commission are civil in nature and, consequently, the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>B. P. O. of Elks </em>v. <em>Board of Liquor Control </em>(1957), 105 Ohio App. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The testimony of Mr.. Paul Petty is noteworthy as to whether there was reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record. Mr. Petty testified, in part, upon direct examination, at pages 5-7 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201cQ. State your name and occupation for the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u201cA. Paul Petty, Investigator, Ohio Pepartment of Liquor Control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">\u201cQ. And on September 6, 1970, did you have occasion to be in the premises of the Angola Corporation at 7132 Airport Highway in Holland, Ohio?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">\u201cQ. On that date and time in question, will you relate to the Commission what occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>At approximately 12:05 on September 6, Investigator Rosan and myself were seated at a table in the permit premises, and at this time a go-go girl began dancing to a song on the juke box. At this time, she began her dance and there was a pole fastened to the stage, to the ceiling. At this time, she grabbed ahold of the pole with her hands and placed her buttocks area against the pole and began going up and down on the pole. She did this sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>eral times during the first dance. The second song that came on the juke box, the go-go dancer who we later identified as Beverly Diacou, she again grabbed ahold of the pole and at this time she leaned over the side of the go-go stage to where a male patron was sitting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-3\">\u201cMr. Lumpe: If it please the Commission, at this time I will object and move that any testimony and also that Violation Number 2 be dismissed. The 8-A violation notice was presented to Mr,. Pall on the night in question only stating allowing improper conduct, lewd and lascivious dancing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">\u201cMr. Connor: She was in the process of dancing when she leaned over the stage and put her buttocks on the patron\u2019s lap. I think this is all the same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cChairman Thomas: Overrule it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Connor) Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201cA. At this time, during her dance, she grabbed ahold of the pole with her buttocks to the patron, sat down on his lap still holding onto the pole and began going back and forth on the patron\u2019s lap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u201cQ. Was the music still playing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">\u201cQ. And was her body stil [sic] vibrating to the music?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">\u201cA. Yes,.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">\u201cQ. And she had her buttocks on the patron\u2019s lap; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-14\">.\u201cQ. What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-15\">\u201cA. During this song on the juke box, she did this to another male patron on the opposite side of the go-go stage.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">We find the order of the commission and the judgment of the Common Pleas Court was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence, in accordance with law. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed and this appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-18\">Troop, P.
