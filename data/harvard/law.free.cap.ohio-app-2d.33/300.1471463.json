His contention was that he suffered an acute lumbo-sacral strain on November 27, 1962, in consequence of a slip and unusual effort while closing the door of a boxcar during the course of his employment at the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation. Defendant, on the other hand, contended that the disability occurred while plaintiff was attempting to close the door but without the intervention of any slip or unusual strain. The matter was submitted to a jury which found in favor of the plaintiff. Post-trial motions were overruled and the defendant perfected its appeal to this court alleging four errors, which it asserts justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">Those assignments of errors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">1. The trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, for the reason that there was no medical opinion testimony that a slip or unusual strain directly and proximately caused the acute lumbo-saeral strain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">2. The trial court erred by giving a charge which was hopelessly confusing as the statutory definition of \u201cinjury\u201d as applied to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">3. Where the issue was whether a slip or an unusual strain, rather than the normal effort used in the regular, ordinary work performed by the workman, was the direct and proximate cause of an alleged acute lumbo-sacral sprain, it was error for the trial court to instruct that the question of causation was whether \u201cthe event\u201d proximately caused the injury to the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">4. The trial court erred<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by instructing the jury that a compensable accident occurred even though the employee was intentionally doing his customary work, if the back pain was an unexpected <em>result </em>of the normal work of the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We find none of the assignments well taken. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">In the final analysis the definition of injury in the statute as amended November 2, 1959 [Section 4123.01(C), Ohio Eevised Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] is dispositive of all four assignments of error. In considering these matters we are enjoined by statute to construe the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act \u201cliberally ... in favor of employees and dependents of deceased employees.\u201d Section 4123.95, Ohio Eevised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">This statute represents the current resolution of a long legislative-judicial contrapuntal action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which it is unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>sary to replay. It is enough for the decision in this case ihat in 1959 the Ohio legislature settled on an amendment which included in the definition of injury in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><em>\u201c. </em>. . any injury . . . accidental in character and result, <em>yy</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">That amendment was the second of two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the light of judicial interpretation before and after the two amendments there is no doubt that the legislature intended something besides an exercise in rhetoric in adding the phrase \u201cor accidental in character and result\u201d to the definition. Granting the amendment represents a substantial legislative policy expression, the Supreme Court of Ohio has said that the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d quality of that expression is subject to some doubt, <em>Hearing </em>v. <em>Wylie </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 221, 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">However, the defendant argues, in effect, that this case ought to be decided as though the amendment of November 2, 1959, did not exist at all and only an \u201cexternal accidental means\u201d will support compensability. This issue is still in this case, despite testimony to a slip and unusual strain, because medical testimony was necessary to establish proximate cause and the only medical evidence in the record did not establish that a slip or unusual strain caused the injury.. Thus, defendant argues, there is a failure of proof. And so there is unless the phrase at issue means that compensability for injury under the Act may be grounded on something other than an unusual external incident, see <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(Ham. Cty., 1970), 30 Ohio App. 2d 9. (See Footnote 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We hold that the \u201caccidental character and result\u201d clause, if it is to have any meaning, must mean more than the defendant contends. Otherwise the quoted phrase is susceptible to an interpretation which transforms it into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>mere redundancy echoing the preceding phrase \u2014 \u201ccaused by external accidental means. \u201d We turn to the consideration of that additional meaning, that coverage dimension added by \u201caccidental character and result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><em>In Malone </em>v. <em>Ind. Commission </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 292, decided before the second and latest amendment of the definition of injury [Section 4123.01(C)], it was pointed out that neither the enabling provision of the Ohio Constitution (Article II, Section 35), nor Section 1465-68, Ohio General Code, nor amended Section 1465-68, Ohio General Code, which controlled the compensability of the injury at issue in <em>Malone, </em>contained any language of limitation referable to \u201caccidental or traumatic\u201d origin. That limitation had been added by judicial gloss to a legislative definition containing no restriction at that time beyond the requirement that the injury be one \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of,\u201d the employment, see <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm., supra, </em>at pp. 297-298. The <em>Malone </em>opinion also indicated that the amendment to Section 1465-68, effective July 10, 1937, broadened the definition to include any injury, <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm., id., </em>298. The <em>Malone </em>analysis is significant for its demonstration of legislative intent to broaden the definition. However, the <em>Malone </em>case is even more remarkable for its conclusion that decedent who died while voluntarily at work in a superheated atmosphere met his death under compensable conditions because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201c. . . his death was not the usual and expected result but <em>the unusual and unexpected result of such employment, and was, therefore, accidental.\u201d Malone </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, id., </em>at 301.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Thus, <em>Malone </em>teaches that an injury is compensable if it is shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it was the unusual and not expected <em>result </em>of the employment. For all practical purposes this means the result, <em>i. e., </em>the injury, was not anticipated and would not have occurred but for the fact that the employee was engaged in his employment at the time of occurrence thus satisfying both the necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>that it be \u201caccidental\u201d and received in and arise out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\">In the light of those judicial developments subsequent to the <em>Malone </em>decision which moved toward a more constricted interpretation of \u201cinjury,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> followed ultimately by the amendment in issue here plus the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s reading of the amendment as a legislative return to the <em>Malone </em>rule, <em>Hearing </em>v. <em>Wylie, supra, </em>223, we hold that the plaintiff\u2019s injury in the present ease was not the \u201cusual and expected\u201d but the \u201cunusual and unexpected\u201d and, therefore, <em>accidental </em>result of his employment within the concept of \u201caccidental character and result.\u201d Under this formulation of the meaning of \u2018 \u2018 accidental character and result\u201d the medical testimony at issue meets the causation standards implicit in the statutory definiton of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Assignment of Error No. 1 is not well taken. Assignments Nos. 2, 3, and 4 fare no better.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The latter three assignments must fail because the charge, read in the light of the <em>Malone </em>and <em>Hearing </em>principles, was both clear and accurate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-5\">Jackson, P.
