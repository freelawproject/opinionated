Bradley, appellant herein, purchased a policy of family automobile insurance from the plaintiff insurance company, and subsequently was involved in an accident while driving a mail truck in the course of his employment with the United States Postal Service. The automobile with which the defendant collided was uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendant\u2019s insurance policy contained an uninsured motorist endorsement entitled \u201cFamily Protection Coverage\u201d with the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201cPart IV \u2014 Family Protection Coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201cCoverage J \u2014 -Family Protection (Damages for Bodily Injury)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">\u201cTo pay all sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, hereinafter called \u2018bodily injury\u2019, sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such uninsured automobile; provided, for the purposes of this coverage, determination as to whether the insured or such representative is legally entitled to recover such damages, and if so the amount thereof, shall be made by agreement between the insured or such representative and the company or, if they fail to agree, by arbitration. <em>H </em>* \u2666 #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">\u201cDefinitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">\u201cThe definitions under Part I, except the definition of \u2018insured\u2019, apply to Part IV, and under Part IV:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">\u201c \u2018insured\u2019means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-14\">\u201c (a) the named insured and any relative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-15\">\u201c(b) any other person while occupying an insured automobile; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-16\">\u201c (c) any person, with respect to damages he is entitled to recover because of bodily injury to which this Part applies sustained by an insured under (a) or (b) above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>U# </em># *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\u201c \u2018insured automobile\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u00bf\u00cd* *= #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201c(d) a non-owned automobile while being operated by the named insured; and the term \u2018insured automobile\u2019 includes a trailer while being-used with an automobile described in (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, but shall not include: (1) any automobile or trailer owned by a resident of the same household as the named insured, (2) any automobile while used as a public or livery conveyance, or (3) any automobile while being used without the permission of the owner. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\u201cPart I \u2014 Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\"><em>i i </em># # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">\u201cDefinitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">\u201cUnder Part I: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">\u201c \u2018non-owned automobile\u2019 means an automobile or trailer not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The plaintiff company, denying coverage on the policy, brought a declaratory judgment action for a construction and interpretation of such provisions, alleging in the complaint that the endorsement against injury by an uninsured motor vehicle was not applicable in the instance of the operation by the insured of a nonowned motor vehicle furnished for his regular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">The trial court, in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a summary judgment, held that the defendant was not a person insured under the facts and the policy of insurance under consideration. Also, the court found that no coverage is afforded the defendant while he is operating a government vehicle furnished for his regular use in conjunction with his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">The appellant sets forth two assignments of error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in its summary judgment declaring that defendant was not a person insured within the meaning of plaintiff\u2019s policy (Exhibit A to plaintiff\u2019s complaint) and that no coverage is afforded to defendant while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>operating a government vehicle furnished for his regular use in connection with his employment with the United States Postal Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in not granting to defendant-appellant, the named insured, in a policy of insurance (Exhibit A, plaintiff\u2019s Complaint) issued by plaintiffappellee in the state of Ohio, insuring against bodily injury resulting from the operation of an uninsured motor vehicle, a summary judgment declaring defendant-appellant to be afforded coverage under the uninsured motorist provision of said policy of insurance while operating a United' States Postal Service motor vehicle as an employee he suffers bodily injury caused by the operation of an uninsured motor vehicle; and that he is entitled as the named insured to submit to arbitration his claim for damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">We agree with the defendant\u2019s assignments of error. Under a strict interpretation of such policy, as against the insuring company who wrote its terms, coverage should have been determined in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Ohio, as do many other states, requires, by virtue of R. C. 3937.18, that insurance companies writing automobile liability insurance offer coverage to the insured under such policies for damage or injury occasioned by uninsured motorists.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The rights created by, and the general nature of, such coverage were set forth in the case of <em>Motorists Mutl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tomanski </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 222, wherein the court stated, at page 223: \u201cThe rights of the insured are spelled out by R. C. 3937.18, as being, \u2018for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Quoting from <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Superior Life Ins. Co. </em>(1962), 203 Va. 282, 123 S. E. 2d 401, 404, the court in <em>Tomcmski </em>stated that \u201cIt is not the purpose of the uninsured motorist law to provide coverage for the uninsured vehicle, but its object is to afford the insured additional protection in the event of an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In the next paragraph, the court in <em>Tomcmski </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cUninsured motorists\u2019 insurance is not liability insurance but resembles limited accident insurance. It insures him against losses occasioned by a limited group of tortfeasors. <em>Hein </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutl. Ins. Co. </em>(1965), 106 N. H. 378, 381, 213 A. 2d 197.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The trial court herein, in granting summary judgment for the plaintiff, held that the definition of an \u201cinsured automobile,\u201d as set forth in Part IV (d), includes \u201ca non-owned automobile while being operated by the named insured,\u201d and that such definition would be applicable to this insured defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The trial court then proceeded to point out that a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d was further defined by the definitions under Part I, which definitions, with the exception of \u201cinsured',\u201d were incorporated by reference in Part IV. In such definition section, under Part I, we find that a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d means an automobile or trailer not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile..</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">There are three categories of persons who are covered or insured under Part IV \u2014 the Family Protection Coverage section \u2014 of the insurance policy. The initial reference to the \u201cinsured\u201d under \u201cDefinitions\u201d is \u201cthe named insured and any relative\u201d of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Secondly, such section of the policy sets forth the next category of \u201cinsured\u201d to be \u201cany other person while occupying an insured automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The third category referred to is \u201cany person, with respect to damages he is entitled to recover because of bodily injury to which this Part applies sustained by an insured under (a) or (b) above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">We hold that that definition of \u201cinsured automobile\u201d which encompasses a \u201cnon-owned vehicle\u201d and the further definition excluding nonowned vehicles \u201cfurnished for the regular use of the named insured,\u201d are not applicable to this insured defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">It is our view that the definition of \u201cinsured automobile\u201d may reasonably be interpreted as being applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>to subsection (b) of the definitions of \u201cinsured,\u201d and would then be applicable only in reference to \u201cany other person while occupying an insured automobile,\u201d and not to subsection (a) with reference to \u201cthe named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">Such a holding is in accord with the only other reported Ohio case specifically on the subject \u2014 that of <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bittler </em>(1968), 14 Ohio Misc. 23. In that case, the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County recognized that, under a standard uninsured motorist endorsement, the named insured therein is not excluded from coverage while operating a nonowned vehicle furnished for his regular use. The court held that the named insured under such endorsement was covered at all times and under all circumstances. Judge McMonagle stated, at page 32 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">\u201cThus, the uninsured motorists coverage was applicable if, at the time of sustaining injury, Mr. Bittler, a named insured, was occupying the Ford described in his policy, or was on foot, or on horseback, or while sitting in his rocking chair on his front porch or while occupying a nonowned automobile furnished for his regular use, including the Plymouth occupied by him on November 20, 1961. This so-called uninsured protection is limited personal accident insurance chiefly for the benefit of the named insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">It would appear that the Supreme Court of Ohio also follows such view that the coverage of the \u201cnamed insured\u201d is in a different category from coverage of \u201cany other persons\u201d as used in these types of policies. In the case of <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St. 2d 73, in construing an \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d endorsement of a policy and, more specifically, the definition of an \u201cinsured,\u201d the court stated, at page 78:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cWhile \u2018any other person\u2019 can only meet the qualifications of an \u2018insured\u2019 under the endorsement \u2018while occupying an insured automobile,\u2019 this clearly was not true as to Wright, the \u2018named insured.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The trial court herein also relied upon the \u201cExclusions\u201d section of the policy in holding that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>coverage under the policy. The exclusion cited by the court is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-3\">\u2018 \u2018 This policy does not apply under Part IV:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">\u201c(a) to bodily injury to an insured while occupying an automobile (other than an insured automobile) owned by the named insured or a relative, or through being struck by such an automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The trial court, in support of his denial of coverage pursuant to such exclusion, cited with approval the reasoning as set forth in an Illinois case-that of <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>State Security Ins. Co. </em>(1969), 114 Ill. App. 2d 91, 254 N. E. 2d 650. The Illinois court was, by unusual coincidence, construing a policy containing the same terms as considered herein, and the named insured in the Illinois case was also the driver of a United States postal truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The Illinois court stated in its decision at 93, 254 N. E. 2d at 652, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cParagraph (a) of (Exclusions) excludes coverage while the insured occupies an automobile owned by him or a relative other than an \u2018insured automobile.\u2019 The postal truck in question was not owned by the insured or a relative and, therefore, the language outside the parentheses, as above quoted, is not applicable. However, the language inside the parenthesis provides that he is covered when he is occupying \u2018an insured automobile.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">We feel that such exclusion as found in the policy is written for, and applicable to, other automobiles as owned by the insured or a relative of the insured, which other automobile is not set forth or named in the policy. Such type of clause was undoubtedly inserted in this policy form by the insurance company to avoid coverage on any other vehicle as owned by the insured which is not specifically referred to as covered by the uninsured motorist endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Such inclusion could well have been precipitated by the holding of <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>which held, in effect, that in the absence of such exclusion another vehicle owned by the insured was covered under such uninsured motorist endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>To apply such clause of exclusion to include an automobile or truck not owned by the named insured is, we believe, adding words or phrases that are just not present in such clause or anywhere else in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">At best, the language in the policy, both as it relates to the exclusion clause and the applicability of the definition of \u201cinsured vehicle\u201d as to this insured, is quite confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">If the company, in drafting the policy under consideration, had wished to place the \u201cnamed insured\u201d in the same category as the other people who are referred to as \u201cinsureds,\u201d within Part IV of the policy, such would have been an easy task of draftsmanship. But such was not accomplished, even though it may well have been the intent so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Any doubts as to the meaning and interpretation of such policy must be resolved in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">As stated by Justice Leach in <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. Wright, supra, at page 78: \u201cIt is one of the best-known principles of insurance law that a policy or contract of insurance is to be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly as against the insurer. 30 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 225, Section 215.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The judgment of the trial court is therefore reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-9\">Troop, P. J., and S traits\u00ae atigh, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
