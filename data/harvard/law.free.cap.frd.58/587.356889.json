Plaintiff took the position that disability benefits which*she had been receiving had been suspended pursuant to Section 225. As a result of discovery, plaintiff subsequently learned that her benefits were <em>terminated </em>pursuant to Section 223 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 (1970), rather than <em>suspended </em>pursuant to Section 225. Accordingly, she now moves for leave to amend her complaint, to withdraw her request for a three-judge court, and for preliminary injunctive relief. Defendant also moves to dissolve the three-judge court, and defendant further moves to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s proposed amended complaint attacks the constitutional sufficiency of the procedures followed by defendant in terminating disability benefits pursuant to Section 223 of the Social Security Act. The amended complaint no longer attacks the facial constitutionality of any statute. Hence if the court allowed the amendment a three-judge court would be unnecessary in this case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Under Rule 15, Fed.R.Civ.P., leave to amend a complaint should be freely given in the interests of justice. Defendant has not opposed plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend and the court perceives no substantial prejudice to defendant if the motion were granted. Accordingly, leave to amend will be granted. It follows that both parties\u2019 motions to dissolve the three-judge court convened in this case will also be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">For the foregoing reasons plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to amend her complaint is granted and the amended complaint shall be allowed filed. Plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s motions to dissolve the three-judge court convened in this case are also granted and the case is remanded to Judge Newell Edenfield, the originating judge, for all further proceedings necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
