On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) instructed the jury regarding the principle of general intent; (2) instructed the jury regarding the \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d exception to self-defense; and (3) failed to instruct the jury that, in the context of accessorial liability, self-defense properly may be considered from the perspective of the principal actor. We agree with the defendant\u2019s third claim, which is dispositive of this appeal. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial. We also address the merits of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>first and second claims because they are likely to arise on retrial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts regarding the relevant events and the physical setting in which they occurred. The rectangular property at 37-39 School Street in Hartford is approximately fifty feet wide and 175 feet deep. It abuts School Street to the north, another residential property to the west, a supermarket\u2019s loading dock area to the south, and a large, paved parking lot of a convalescent home to the east (large parking lot).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Near the front of the property, facing School Street, stands a three-story apartment house nearly as wide as the property itself. Behind the apartment house is a paved parking area equally as wide as the property. The parking area is connected to School Street only by a nine foot wide driveway that abuts the apartment house on the west and the property line on the east. With the exception of the side of the property abutting School Street, the property is surrounded by hedges approximately ten feet in height or a chain link fence approximately six feet in height or both. Thus, aside from a well traveled breach in the fence at the extreme back of the property, i.e., the southern property line, the driveway forms the sole means of access to and from the parking area.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The apartment house has a front interior stairwell facing School Street and a back interior stairwell leading into the parking area. Each apartment in the building is accessible through both the front and back stairwells.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>The defendant moved into an apartment at 37-39 School Street<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sometime in the summer of 1995 and, after arriving, intermittently exchanged dirty looks with David Arce, a resident of the neighborhood. Shortly before dusk on the evening of August 14, 1995, Arce encountered the defendant and the defendant\u2019s friend, Jorge Ramos, on the sidewalk in front of 37-39 School Street. The defendant asked Arce why he was \u201cstaring at him wrong.\u201d Arce replied that if the defendant had a problem with him, he should say so. While displaying a pistol tucked in his waistband, Ramos urged Arce to fight with the defendant. Arce declined to fight but left the area indicating that he would return with his brother, Angel Arce.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">David Arce, who had been drinking beer before encountering the defendant and Ramos, returned to School Street a few minutes later with his older brother, Angel Arce, who also had been drinking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Arces\u2019 friends, Robert Brown and Randy Medina, joined them in the large parking lot adjacent to 37-39 School Street. The defendant and Ramos then confronted the Arces and their friends as they were standing in the large parking lot. Ramos quickly removed his gun from his waistband and pointed it at Angel Arce. Angel Arce told Ramos to \u201cput the gun down\u201d and invited Ramos to \u201cfight man-to-man . . . .\u201d Angel Arce also told Ramos, \u201cif you\u2019re gonna pull the trigger . . . pull it, [I\u2019m not] afraid to die.\u201d Ramos pulled the trigger, but his gun \u201cclick[ed],\u201d and he then struck Angel Arce with his free hand. Brown accused Ramos of brandishing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>unloaded gun. The defendant and Ramos slowly walked backward along the School Street sidewalk toward 37-39 School Street as the Arces\u2019 group followed them at a distance of one or two yards.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">During the confrontation in the large parking lot, word had spread throughout the neighborhood that the Arces were being threatened at gunpoint. By the time that the defendant and Ramos reached the foot of the driveway at 37-39 School Street, the arrival of additional friends had swelled the size of the Arces\u2019 group to at least eight. The defendant and Ramos backed slowly down the driveway, Ramos on the side of the driveway nearest the fence and the defendant nearest the apartment house. As they did so, most of the Arces\u2019 group continued to follow them. Angel Arce led the group, walking toward the defendant and Ramos with his hands extended away from his body while maintaining a separation of one or two yards. Brown walked slightly behind and to the side of Angel Arce. Medina and David Arce followed behind Brown and Angel Arce, and other members of the group followed at various intervals along the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Angel Arce was shirtless throughout the encounter. This fact, combined with his conciliatory hand gestures, gave him the appearance of being unarmed. The other members of the Arces\u2019 group, however, did nothing to indicate to Ramos and the defendant that they were unarmed. As Angel Arce walked down the driveway of 37-39 School Street with the others in his group, he continued to instruct Ramos to put the gun down while Ramos repeatedly told the assembled group to \u201cback up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">When the defendant and Ramos reached the back of the apartment house, the defendant ducked into the house\u2019s back stairwell. This motion went unnoticed by the members of the Arces\u2019 group, who continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>advance toward Ramos into the parking area behind the apartment house. Approximately hallway between the back of the apartment house and the fence at the rear of the property, Ramos abruptly stopped walking backward. Brown began to move around Ramos\u2019 side while Angel Arce stood in front of Ramos. David Arce, perhaps sensing that the situation had arrived at a dangerous impasse, suggested to Angel Arce that they should \u201cget out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">At that moment, the defendant reemerged from the back of the apartment house with a handgun and, from his position behind the Arces\u2019 group, opened fire in the direction of the group. Ramos also opened fire, first hitting Brown in the right leg and chest. Ramos then turned to Angel Arce and shot him once in the chest. Medina, David Arce and the other members of the Arces\u2019 group turned and ran up the driveway when the shooting began, retracing their steps toward School Street.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When they finished shooting, Ramos and the defendant fled, presumably through the breach in the fence at the rear of the property. Brown and Angel Arce both died at the scene from their gunshot wounds. Subsequent forensic testing revealed that Ramos had inflicted Brown\u2019s and Angel Arce\u2019s fatal wounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The jury returned a guilty verdict against the defendant on all three counts with which he was charged, and the court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, sentencing him to a total effective sentence of fifty-six years incarceration. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The defendant now challenges the trial court\u2019s jury charge on three grounds, each of which implicates a constitutional right. When a challenged jury instruction implicates a constitutional right, \u201cthe applicable standard of review is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 619, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002). As we previously have stated, a jury charge is \u201cconsidered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts,\u201d even when the appellant challenges only an individual component of the charge. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>260 Conn. 466, 473, 797 A.2d 1101 (2002). We analyze a challenged jury charge for its fair presentation of the case to the jury \u201cin such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. If the charge is \u201ccorrect in law, adapted to the issues, and sufficient for the guidance of the jury,\u201d we will not deem it improper. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding both specific intent and general intent because the crimes with which the defendant was charged required only an instruction on specific intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>(assault in first degree by means of discharge of firearm requires proof of \u201cintent to cause physical injury to another person\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bzdyra, </em>165 Conn. 400, 403, 334 A.2d 917 (1973) (manslaughter in first degree requires proof of specific intent \u201cto cause serious physical injury to another person\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction on general intent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cmisled the jury into believing that [the] defendant could be guilty of [the crimes with which he was charged] if he had the intent to engage in the conduct of using a firearm without determining if [the] defendant meant to cause physical injury to the victims.\u201d The state replies that there was no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled because, the general intent instruction notwithstanding, \u201cthe [trial] court\u2019s instructions . . . clearly set out the specific intent element for each of the crimes charged, and [the court] reiterated [the] specific intent [element] throughout its instructions.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The defendant failed to preserve this claim at trial<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and now seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). <em>Golding </em>permits a defendant to \u201cprevail on [an unpreserved] claim of constitutional error . . . only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 239-40. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\u201c[T]he first two [prongs of Golding] involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The state does not dispute that the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>have been satisfied with respect to this claim. The record is adequate for review, and, when intent is an element of a crime, a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury properly with respect to intent implicates the due process rights of the accused. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 472-73. We accordingly review the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim under the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">We have encountered a comparable factual situation in a number of our previous cases. In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 466, <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 710 A.2d 732 (1998), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 664 A.2d 743 (1995), the trial courts instructed the juries using the entire statutory definition of intent when only an instruction on specific intent was warranted. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 471-72 and n.6; <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>supra, 232-33 and n.8; <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 321-22. In each case, we found that the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions that specific intent is an element of the crime \u201celiminated any possibility of juror confusion with respect to the element of intent,\u201d notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s use of the unabridged statutory intent instruction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 476; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>supra, 236 (\u201cany possible risk of jury confusion over the element of intent was eliminated by the trial court\u2019s numerous proper instructions on the elements of murder\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>supra, 322 (upholding jury charge when \u201cthe [trial] court repeatedly instructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, it first had to find that he had intended to cause the death of the victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The trial court in the present case repeatedly<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> instructed the jury that, to find the defendant guilty of either manslaughter count, \u201cthe state must prove . . . beyond a reasonable doubt . . . that the defendant . . . intended to cause serious physical injury to another person.\u201d The trial court also instructed the jury that, to find the defendant guilty of assault, \u201cthe state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt . . . [the defendant\u2019s] intent to cause physical injury to another person.\u201d Like the trial courts in <em>DeJesus, Austin </em>and <em>Prioleau, </em>the trial court in the present case unmistakably described the defendant\u2019s specific intent as an element of the crimes with which he was charged. The precedents of <em>DeJesus, Austin </em>and <em>Prioleau </em>accordingly control this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The defendant nonetheless attempts to overcome these precedents by invoking <em>State </em>v. <em>DeBarros, </em>58 Conn. App. 673, 755 A.2d 303, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 931, 761 A.2d 756 (2000), a case involving comparable facts but distinguishing <em>Austin </em>and <em>Prioleau </em>on two grounds.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First, the court in <em>DeBarros </em>concluded that the trial court\u2019s ten references to the principle of general intent were \u201ctoo numerous to be rectified by the court\u2019s proper instructions.\u201d Id., 683. Second, the court in <em>DeBarros </em>noted that, unlike the jury charges at issue in <em>Austin </em>and <em>Prioleau, </em>the trial court\u2019s charge in <em>DeBarros </em>indicated that general intent was an element of the crime rather than merely \u201cpart of [the] general definition of intent.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>DeBarros, </em>however, is misplaced. The latter ground on which <em>DeBarros </em>departed from <em>Austin </em>and <em>Prioleau </em>is inapplicable to the present case. As we noted previously in this opinion, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s specific intent was an element of the crimes with which he was charged. The present case is indistinguishable from <em>DeJesus, Austin </em>and <em>Prioleau </em>on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The former ground on which <em>DeBarros </em>departed from <em>Austin </em>and <em>Prioleau </em>is inherently problematic. As we noted previously in this opinion, a challenged jury charge is to be \u201cread as a whole . . . and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 473; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 284 (\u201cindividual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). A quantitative \u201clitmus test\u201d measuring how frequently a trial court gives an irrelevant instruction is therefore insufficient to establish an instruction\u2019s tendency to mislead the jury. The tendency of an irrelevant instruction to mislead the jury instead must be considered in the context of the whole charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Although the trial court in the present case gave the general intent instruction or referred to the principle of general intent a total of eleven times, the trial court also frequently instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s specific intent was an element of the crimes with which the defendant was charged. Indeed, the trial court did so with such repetition, unequivocation and crystalline clarity that \u201c[i]t strains reason to believe that the jury could have [interpreted] the challenged instruction as not requiring that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant [possessed the relevant specific intent].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 322. We therefore cannot conclude that there was a reasonable possibility that the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding general intent misled the jury or otherwise did an injustice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d exception to self-defense because such an instruction was unwarranted in light of the evidence presented.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state argues that the evidence was sufficient to support a \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d jury instruction. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (c), which embraces the \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d exception to self-defense, provides in relevant part that \u201ca person is not justified in using physical force when ... (3) the physical force involved was the product of a combat by agreement not specifically authorized by law.\u201d A juiy instruction regarding the \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d exception to self-defense is warranted when the evidence is \u201csufficient to support a reasonable inference\u201d that such a mutual combat occurred. <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 471, 503 A.2d 599 (1986). A \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d instruction may be given in the absence of direct evidence of an agreement to engage in mutual combat, and, accordingly, \u201c[t]he agreement required by [the \u2018combat by agreement\u2019 exception] need not be formal or express.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Although the present case lacks direct evidence of an agreement to fight, the juiy nonetheless could have inferred an implicit agreement to fight from the evidence. After Ramos urged David Arce to fight with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>defendant, David Arce returned with Angel Arce, who offered to fight Ramos \u201cman-to-man . . . .\u201d This evidence is itself sufficient to warrant a \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 471 (upholding \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d instruction when group confronted individual, individual left to gather friends, returned to confront group and brawl ensued). Alternatively, the jury simply could have disbelieved the testimony of those witnesses who claimed that Ramos or Angel Arce or both disclaimed an interest in fighting as they descended the driveway of 37-39 School Street. See id. (upholding \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d instruction even though participants in brawl denied having agreement to fight); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>260 Conn. 372, 381, 796 A.2d 1191 (2002) (\u201cit is within the province of the jury to believe all or only part of a witness\u2019 testimony\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Because the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that the participants implicitly agreed to a mutual combat, the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the \u201ccombat by agreement\u201d exception to self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The defendant finally claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that, in an accessorial liability situation, self-defense<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> properly may be considered from the perspective of the principal actor. The defendant argues that, when \u201c[a] defendant is charged as an accessory and it is [a] principal offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>who shoots and kills (or assaults) the victims, the defenses of self-defense and defense of another must be considered from the perspective of the principal. Logically, that is the only scenario that makes sense.\u201d The state responds by arguing that the defendant\u2019s contention \u201cis in conflict with the plain language of the self-defense statute and the law on accessorial liability . . . .\u201d Although our analysis differs somewhat from that of the defendant, we nonetheless agree that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The defendant failed to preserve this claim at trial<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and now seeks to prevail under <em>Golding. </em>See part I of this opinion. The state does not dispute that the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>have been satisfied with respect to this claim. The record is adequate for review, and it is well established that \u201c[a]n improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 493, 651 A.2d 247 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986) (\u201cA fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. . . . Whe[n] the legislature has created a legally recognized defense . . . this fundamental constitutional right includes a properjury instruction on the elements of the defense ... so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of disproving it beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Therefore, we address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim under the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We preliminarily must determine whether the defendant established a sufficient evidentiary foundation to support his sought after instruction regarding Ramos\u2019 use of self-defense. \u201cBefore the jury is given an instruction on self-defense . . . there must be some evidentiary foundation for it. A jury instruction on self-defense is not available to a defendant merely for the asking. The defendant [is] only . . . entitled to a jury instruction on his theory of self-defense if he . . . presents] applicable evidence no matter how weak or incredible .... However low the evidentiary standard may be, it is nonetheless a threshold the defendant must cross. The defendant may not ask the court to boost him over the sill upon speculation and conjecture.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>77 Conn. App. 80, 89, 822 A.2d 940, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 913, 833 A.2d 466 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In the present case, the defendant presented evidence sufficient to entitle him to an instruction regarding Ramos\u2019 use of self-defense. The state\u2019s witnesses testified that Ramos was new to the School Street neighborhood and did not know any of the members of the group that accompanied the Arces to 37-39 School Street. The state\u2019s witnesses also testified that Ramos was outnumbered eight to two as he backed down the driveway and eight to one after the defendant ducked into the back stairwell of the apartment house. The state\u2019s witnesses further testified that Ramos could not have known whether any members of the Arces\u2019 group facing him, other than Angel Arce,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> were armed, and that Ramos could not have known whether the group would have permitted him to flee without resistance. Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the state\u2019s witnesses testified that the Arces and their group marched toward Ramos down the driveway of 37-39 School Street even as Ramos was pointing a pistol at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">This evidence was sufficient to entitle the defendant to an instruction regarding Ramos\u2019 use of self-defense. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 275, 576 A.2d 139 (1990) (rejecting request for jury instruction on theory of defense when \u201cno testimony was presented from which the jury could have [reached a conclusion on that theory] . . . without resorting to speculation\u201d).

Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses (1984) \u00a7 24 (a), p. 83. For example, in the case of self-defense, \u201c[society\u2019s interest in the right to bodily integrity, when combined with the physical harm threatened [by an aggressor], outweighs the normal prohibition against the physical injury needed to deter such an aggressor.\u201d Id., p. 84. All justification defenses share a similar internal structure: special \u201ctriggering circumstances permit a necessary and proportional response . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 24 (b), p. 86. In Connecticut, self-defense is a justification for engaging in otherwise criminal conduct. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19; see also P. Robinson, \u201cCriminal Law Defenses: A Systematic Analysis,\u201d 82 Colum. L.

Robinson, supra, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 245. Thus, conduct that is found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>be justified is, under the circumstances, not criminal.

Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England [(1883) p. 231], In felony cases, parties to a crime were divided into four distinct categories: (1) principals in the first degree who actually perpetrated the offense; (2) principals in the second degree who were actually or constructively present at the scene of the crime and aided or abetted its commission; (3) accessories before the fact who aided or abetted the crime, but were not present at its commission; and (4) accessories after the fact who rendered assistance after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the crime was complete. See W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law [(1972) \u00a7 63, pp. 495-96; R. Perkins, \u2018Parties to Crime,\u2019 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 581-82 (1941)]. By contrast, misdemeanor cases \u2018[did] not admit of [accessories] either before or after the fact,\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hartwell, </em>26 F. Cas. 196, 199 [(C.C. Mass. 1869) (No. 15,318)]; instead, all parties to a misdemeanor, whatever their roles, were principals. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dotterweich, </em>320 U.S. 277, 281 [64 S. Ct. 134, 88 L. Ed. 48] (1943); 1 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law [(14th Ed. 1978) \u00a7 33, pp. 169-70],</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\u201cBecause at early common law all parties to a felony received the death penalty, certain procedural rules developed tending to shield accessories from punishment. See [W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 63, p. 499]. Among them was one of special relevance . . . [namely] the rule that an accessory could not be convicted without the prior conviction of the principal offender. See 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown [(1678) pp. 623-24]. Under this rule, the principal\u2019s flight, death, or acquittal barred prosecution of the accessory. And if the principal were pardoned or his conviction reversed on appeal, the accessory\u2019s conviction could not stand. In every way, \u2018an accessory [followed], like a shadow, his principal.\u2019 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law [(8th Ed. 1892) \u00a7 666],</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\u201cThis procedural bar applied only to the prosecution of accessories in felony cases. In misdemeanor cases, [in which] all participants were deemed principals, a prior acquittal of the actual perpetrator did not prevent the subsequent conviction of a person who rendered assistance. [E.g., <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Humphreys &amp; Turner, </em>3 All E.R. 689, 692 (1965)] .... And in felony cases a principal in the second degree could be convicted notwithstanding the prior acquittal of the first-degree principal. <em>[Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>28 Ga. 199, 217 (1859); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitt, </em>113 N.C. 716, 719, 18 S.E. 715 (1893); <em>King </em>v. <em>Taylor &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>Shaw, </em>168 Eng. Rep. 283 (1785); <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>91 Eng. Rep. 294, 294-95 (K.B. 1703)]. Not surprisingly, considerable effort was expended in defining the categories\u2014in determining, for instance, when a person was \u2018constructively present\u2019 so as to be a second-degree principal. ... In the process, justice all too frequently was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">\u201cTo overcome these judge-made rules, statutes were enacted in England and in the United States. In 1848 the Parliament enacted a statute providing that an accessory before the fact could be \u2018indicted, tried, convicted, and punished in all respects <em>like the </em>Principal.\u2019 ... As interpreted, the statute permitted an accessory to be convicted \u2018although the principal be acquitted.\u2019 <em>[Queen </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>169 Eng. Rep. 1245, 1248 (1860)]. Several state legislatures followed suit.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 15-16, 100 S. Ct. 1999, 64 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Connecticut\u2019s abolition of the distinction between accessories and principals predated Parliament\u2019s by at least twenty-seven years. General Statutes (1821 Rev.) tit. 22, \u00a7 90<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cabandoned] completely the old common law terminology\u201d and \u201cadopted the rule that there is no practical significance in being labeled an \u2018accessory\u2019 or a \u2018principal\u2019 for the purpose of determining criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>198 Conn. 158, 164, 502 A.2d 880 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>47 Conn. 95, 118-19 (1879). This rule continues in force today. Under the modern accessory statute, \u201c[t]here is no such crime as <em>being an accessory </em>.... The accessory statute merely provides alternate means by which a substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>crime may be committed.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The current accessory statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a), provides that \u201c[a] person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who . . . intentionally aids another person to engage in <em>conduct which constitutes an offense </em>shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As this language indicates, another person\u2019s commission of an offense is a condition precedent to the imposition of accessorial liability.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Paredes, </em>35 Conn.

App. 730, 733, 560 A.2d 479 (1989) (\u201cthe state was required to prove the substantive offense in order to establish accessorial liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>203 Conn. 420, 422-23, 524 A.2d 1148 (1987), the defendant, James Y. Hope, was charged with, inter alia, capital felony on the theory that he had aided and abetted John J. McGann\u2019s murder of Donald C. Burke for pecuniary gain. See id., 422-23. Hope and McGann were tried separately. See id., 423-24. The trial court dismissed the charge against Hope, and the state appealed to this court. Id., 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">During the pendency of the state\u2019s appeal, we decided in McGann\u2019s parallel appeal that, due to the absence of a hiring relationship between McGann and his alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>hirer,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cthe circumstances of [McCann\u2019s] involvement in the murder of . . . Burke [did] not bring him within the category of hired assassin that the legislature sought to punish for the offense of capital felony . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 423. We consequently dismissed Hope\u2019s appeal as moot; id., 425; reasoning that Hope could not \u201cbe held liable as an accessoiy [to capital felony] in the absence of evidence that anyone else committed a capital felony . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id., 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The proposition that another person\u2019s commission of an offense is a condition precedent to the imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>of accessorial liability is consistent with federal law. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruffin, </em>613 F.2d 408, 412 (2d Cir. 1979) (\u201ca defendant charged with aiding and abetting the commission of a crime by another cannot be convicted in the absence of proof that the crime was actually committed\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cades, </em>495 F.2d 1166, 1167 (3d Cir. 1974) (\u201c[i]n order to convict a defendant of aiding and abetting the commission of a crime, it is first essential that the [g]ovemment demonstrate that the substantive crime has been committed\u201d); <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>238 F.2d 535, 542 (4th Cir. 1956) (proof that \u201cthe act constituting the offense was in fact committed by someone\u201d is prerequisite to aiding and abetting conviction); <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>14 F.2d 518, 519 (8th Cir. 1926) (\u201cit is an essential thing [to an aiding and abetting conviction] that a crime was actually committed\u201d). Like Connecticut law, federal law does not distinguish between principals and accessories. See, e.g., <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 447 U.S. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The proposition that another person\u2019s commission of an offense is a condition precedent to the imposition of accessorial liability also is consistent with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-9. That statute provides in relevant part that, \u201c[i]n any prosecution for an offense in which the criminal liability of the defendant is based upon the conduct of another person under section 53a-8 it shall not be a defense that: (1) Such other person is not guilty of the offense in question because of lack of criminal responsibility or legal capacity or awareness of the criminal nature of the conduct in question or of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose or because of other factors precluding the mental state required for the commission of the offense in question . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-9 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The purpose of \u00a7 53a-9 was clearly articulated <em>in State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>179 Conn. 1, 425 A.2d 924 (1979). In that case, the defendant, Robert J. McCarthy, enlisted Jean Siretz to murder a man whom McCarthy suspected of vandalizing his automobile. Id., 3. McCarthy provided Siretz with a loaded gun, instructed her regarding how to shoot the intended victim and where to hide the gun, and drove her to the home of the intended victim. Id., 4. McCarthy then went to the emergency room of a local hospital, apparently attempting to establish an alibi. See id. Siretz shot both the intended victim and the intended victim\u2019s wife, killing only the wife. Id. The trial testimony indicated that Siretz may have been intoxicated by cocaine or LSD or both at the time of the murder; id., 3; but McCarthy nonetheless was prosecuted and convicted of murder as an accessory. Id., 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">On appeal to this court, McCarthy claimed that the trial court improperly had instructed the jury to disregard Siretz\u2019 intent in shooting the two victims. Id., 12. We rejected McCarthy\u2019s contention, determining that \u201c\u00a7 53a-9 governed the situation.\u201d Id., 15. We explained that \u201c[t]he purpose behind \u00a7 53a-9 is to prevent the specific type of evil presented by this precise fact[ual] situation: A Mansonesque figure using a mentally incompetent individual to commit a crime and going free because the actual perpetrator is incapable of the requisite intent. A crime may be performed though the actual perpetrator lacked the requisite mental capacity.\u201d Id., 16. The clear implication of the latter statement is that the commission of a crime is a condition precedent to the imposition of accessorial liability. Section 53a-9, as it has been inteipreted <em>by McCarthy, </em>therefore supports our conclusion that another person\u2019s commission of an offense is a condition precedent to the imposition of accessorial liability.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Inteiplay of Justification Defenses and Accessorial Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Having established that justified conduct is not criminal and that the commission of a crime is a condition precedent to the imposition of accessorial liability for that crime, we now turn to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The defendant alleges that the principal actor, that is, Ramos, shot the victims in self-defense and that the trial court therefore should have instructed the jury regarding Ramos\u2019 use of self-defense. If Ramos shot the victims in self-defense, then his conduct was justified and no criminal acts occurred for which the defendant could be held hable as an accessory. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>662 F. Sup. 1083, 1087 (N.D. Cal. 1987) (\u201c[a] justified action is not wrongful; therefore, the prerequisite to imposing liability on [an accused accessory] as an aider and abettor win not be satisfied\u201d), aff'd, 885 F.2d 1428 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1032, 110 S. Ct. 748, 107 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1990). This circumstance would doom the accessory charges against the defendant because \u201c [a] third party has the right to assist an actor in a justified act.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Id., 1086; see also G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law (1978) \u00a7 10.1.1, pp. 761-62 (\u201cThat the doing is objectively right (or at least not wrongful) means that anyone is licensed to do it. The only requirement is that the act be performed for the justificatory purpose . . . .\u201d); K. Greenawalt, \u201cThe Perplexing Borders of Justification and Excuse,\u201d 84 Colum. L. Rev. 1897, 1900 (1984) (\u201c[j]ustified action . . . may be assisted by those in a position to render aid\u201d); P. Robinson, supra, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 279 (\u201c[assisting . . . another to engage in justified conduct should be similarly justified\u201d). A jury instruction regarding Ramos\u2019 use of self-defense in shooting the victims therefore was warranted.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Very few modem authorities have encountered a comparable situation. Neither the state nor our own independent research has identified a single jurisdiction that has declined to consider the principal\u2019s use of self-defense in such a situation. Two decisions addressing comparable situations, however, have reached conclusions that are consistent with the conclusion that we reach in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 662 F. Sup. 1084, the defendant Ronald McIntosh escaped from federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>custody and, one week later, flew a helicopter into the recreation yard of his former prison and absconded with another inmate, the defendant Samantha D. Lopez. Following their apprehension, Lopez was charged with escaping from federal custody, and McIntosh was charged with, inter alia, aiding and abetting her escape. Id. Both McIntosh and Lopez asserted a defense of \u201cnecessity/duress,\u201d which the court interpreted as a necessity defense.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Id., 1086. The government, however, filed a motion seeking to preclude McIntosh and Lopez from presenting evidence to the jury regarding their necessity defense. Id., 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In denying the government\u2019s motion, the court concluded that, \u201cif the jury finds Lopez not guilty of escape by reason of her necessity defense, her criminal act will be justified,\u201d and McIntosh therefore could not be guilty of aiding and abetting her escape. Id., 1087. The court accordingly concluded that McIntosh was entitled to an instruction that, \u201c[i]f [the jury] find[s] . . . Lopez not guilty of escape because she acted under necessity/ duress, then [the jury] must also find . . . McIntosh not guilty of aiding and abetting her alleged escape.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Winsett, </em>58 Del. 111, 205 A.2d 510 (Super. 1964), the defendant Thomas H. Winsett was charged with the murder of Robert A. Paris, a Delaware state trooper. Id., 117, 135. The defendants Wilbert A. Weekley and Edward J. Mayerhofer, who were helping Winsett steal televisions from a motel at the time of the killing, were charged with aiding and abetting Winsett\u2019s murder of Paris. Id. At the joint trial of the three codefendants, Winsett maintained that he shot Paris in self-defense, claiming that he did not realize that Paris was a peace officer when he shot him. See id., 123-24. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>trial court accordingly instructed the juiy on the subject of Winsett\u2019s self-defense. Id., 123-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">More significantly, however, the trial court in <em>Winsett </em>also instructed the jury regarding the effect that Winsett\u2019s claim of self-defense would have on the prosecutions of Weekley and Mayerhofer. Id., 128. The court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cIf you find that self-defense is available to the defendant Winsett, and if for that reason you determine that he is not guilty . . . [of murder], then you must also find the defendants Weekley and Mayerhofer not guilty [of aiding and abetting the murder] .... In short, [Weekley and Mayerhofer] cannot be held criminally responsible for aiding and abetting a homicide which is found to have been committed in self-defense.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In the present case, the defendant was entitled to an instruction regarding Ramos\u2019 use of self-defense. The trial court improperly failed to give such an instruction. We therefore proceed to consider the fourth prong of <em>Golding, </em>namely, whether the trial court\u2019s error was sufficiently harmful to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">\u201cIf an improper jury instruction is of constitutional magnitude, the burden is on the state to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. ... An alleged defect in a jury charge which raises a constitutional question is reversible error if it is reasonably possible that, considering the charge as a whole, the jury was misled.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 Conn. 138, 166, 869 A.2d 192 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>234 Conn. 301, 308, 662 A.2d 732 (1995) (when \u201calleged error [in a jury instruction] relates to the elements of the crime charged, reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction and a new trial are mandated if, in the context of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>as a whole, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">There can be no doubt that the impropriety in the trial court\u2019s jury instruction was of constitutional magnitude. The state has not briefed the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury to consider self-defense from the perspective of the principal was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, the state has failed to demonstrate the harmlessness of the trial court\u2019s error. Moreover, it is at least reasonably possible that the trial court\u2019s charge misled the jury by precluding it from finding that the defendant was charged with accessorial liability for a noncriminal act.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\"> The defendant also claims that the trial court: (1) improperly instructed the jury regarding proximate cause; (2) incorrectly instructed the jury when the use of deadly force in self-defense is justified; and (3) improperly instructed the jury regarding the \u201cincapacitation\u201d exception to self-defense. We decline to address these claims because we cannot conclude that they are likely to arise on retrial.

After McGann reported to Burke\u2019s wife that he had found a person named George Rooney who agreed to murder Burke for $4000, Burke\u2019s wife gave McGann $3500 with the understanding that McGann would cover the remaining balance of $500. Id., 171. Unbeknownst to Burke\u2019s wife, Rooney previously had agreed with McGann to commit the murder for <em>$3000. Id. </em>McGann therefore paid Rooney $3000 and retained the remaining $500. Id. After Rooney declined to commit the murder and to return the $3000 that McGann had given him, McGann killed Burke with Hope\u2019s assistance. Id., 172-73. In concluding that a hiring relationship did not exist between McGann and Burke\u2019s wife, the court reasoned that Burke\u2019s wife was unaware that McGann had retained the $500 and \u201cmust have assumed that [McGann] was carrying out tire murder because of his friendship with her and his embarrassment over the financial loss she had sustained as a result of his recommendation of Rooney.

Conversely, the prosecution of an accused accessoiy may proceed when the evidence is <em>factually </em>insufficient to establish who committed the crime, but the accessory makes \u201cno claim that [the crime] was not committed . . . .\u201d Id., 481; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Solek, </em>242 Conn. 409, 427, 699 A.2d 931 (1997) (state\u2019s lack of probable cause to charge accused principal with crime does not mean that, \u201cas a matter of law, [the accused principal] did not commit the offense\u201d and, therefore, does not preclude prosecution of accused accessory).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The subsequent limita! ion of <em>Hope, </em>however, has no effect on the present case because the defendant\u2019s successful showing of Ramos\u2019 use of self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>defense would establish, as a matter of law, that no criminal acts occurred.

Even under the Model Penal Code, the latter issue must be resolved affirmatively to permit the conviction of an accessory. As the official commentary to the Model Penal Code provides, \u00a7 2.06 (7) \u201cdoes not, of course, dispense with the necessity of proving the commission of the crime as an element of liability of the accomplice.\u201d 1 American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1985) \u00a7 2.06, p. 327. The state is simply incorrect in arguing that \u00a7 2.06 (7) contradicts our conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\"> The fact that a person cannot be convicted as an accessory to justified conduct, however, does not preclude the conviction of that person, solely on the basis of his own culpability, of a substantive or inchoate offense arising out of the same incident. See, e.g., P. Robinson, supra, 82 Colum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>L.

Section 53a-8 requires an accused accessory to have \u201cboth the intent to help the principal and the intent to commit the crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Vincent, 194 Conn. 198, 207, 479 A.2d 237 (1984). \u201cThe mental state required by \u00a7 53a-8 exempts from liability those whose innocent acts in fact aid one who commits a crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McCalpine, </em>190 Conn. 822, 832, 463 A.2d 545 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Even if a principal does not act in self-defense, an accused accessory still may defend against an accessory charge by demonstrating that his act of soliciting, requesting, commanding, importuning or intentionally aiding the principal itself was committed in self-defense as defined by \u00a7 53a-19. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 662 F.

Because one of the state\u2019s theories was that the defendant could have been guilty of assault in the first degree as an accessory, the defendant was entitled to an instruction regarding Ramos\u2019 use of self-defense in the context of the assault. Furthermore, it cannot be determined from the record whether the jury based its verdict with respect to the assault charge on a theory of principal liability or accessorial liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
