The plaintiffs, most of whom represent the estates of deceased former employees of the Pratt and Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation (Pratt and Whitney),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> jointly brought this wrongful death action,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging that the defendants intentionally had exposed the decedents to toxic chemicals or radiation or both by polluting the air, soil, surface water and groundwater surrounding var ious Pratt and Whitney facilities in the state. The plaintiffs also alleged that these pollutants subsequently entered the air and water of the decedents\u2019 workplace. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants\u2019 conduct caused the decedents to inhale, ingest or absorb through their skin various toxic agents present in the workplace, and that such exposure continued outside the workplace when the decedents inadvertently carried the hazardous substances into their homes and automobiles on their clothing and persons. The plaintiffs claimed that, as a direct result of this exposure, the decedents suffered variously from systemic chemical poisoning, cancer and malig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>nant brain tumors, and that those conditions eventually had caused the decedents\u2019 deaths. In addition to compensatory damages, the plaintiffs sought punitive damages predicated on the defendants\u2019 alleged \u201c[wilful] disregard of federal and state safety and environmental laws and regulations and extremely reckless disregard of the [decedents\u2019 lives], health and safety . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the ground that the action was time barred under \u00a7 52-555. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The defendants claimed that the action was untimely because it was brought on behalf of decedents who either had died more than two years before the action was filed or had ceased to remain employed with Pratt and Whitney more than five years before the action was filed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response, the plaintiffs claimed that the applicable statute of limitations is not \u00a7 52-555 but, rather, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provides in relevant part that an action to recover damages for personal injury \u201ccaused by exposure to a hazardous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>chemical substance or mixture or hazardous pollutant released into the environment\u201d must be brought within two years of the date on which the injury was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs further maintained that they were entitled to establish, as a factual matter, that their actions had been initiated within the limitation period prescribed by \u00a7 52-577c (b). Alternatively, the plaintiffs claimed that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a provision of the federal Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>prehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq., preempted the statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 52-555. Section 9658 provides for a \u201cfederally required commencement date\u201d for certain actions brought under state law for injuries caused by exposure to any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant that was \u201creleased into the environment from a facility . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1) (2000). Under CERCLA, the \u201cfederally required commencement date\u201d is defined as the date that the injured party knew or reasonably should have known that his or her injury had been caused by the hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (b) (4) (A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Thereafter, the trial court granted in part the defendants\u2019 motion to strike,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were time barred under \u00a7 52-555.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that \u00a7 52-577c (b) is the applicable statute of limitations because the plaintiffs expressly alleged in their complaint that they brought their action pursuant to \u00a7 52-555 and did not mention or refer to \u00a7 52-577c, in accordance with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 10-3.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 preempted \u00a7 52-555. Specifically, the trial court concluded that, to the extent that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were predicated on the release of contaminants within the workplace, those claims fell outside the scope of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 because CERCLA expressly excludes from its purview \u201cany release [of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants] which results in exposure to persons solely within a workplace, with respect to a claim which such persons may assert against the employer of such persons . . . ,\u201d* <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (22) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>(2000).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court also concluded that, to the extent that the plaintiffs\u2019 CERCLA preemption claim was based on the alleged release of toxins from the person and clothing of the decedents into their homes and motor vehicles following their departure from the site of the original workplace contamination, that release did not constitute an actionable release \u201cinto the environment from a facility\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1), first, because motor vehicles and homes do not fall within the definition of \u201cenvironment\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (8)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and, second, because the decedents\u2019 clothing is not a \u201cfacility\u201d as that term is defined by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (9).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court granted in part the defendants\u2019 motion to strike and, thereafter, rendered partial judgment thereon for the defendants.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiffs renew the claims that they raised in the trial court. We reject each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Before addressing the merits of those claims, we first set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cA motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading . . . and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court\u2019s ruling is plenary. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. . . . [I]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. . . . Thus, we assume the truth of both the specific factual allegations and any facts fairly provable thereunder. In doing so, moreover, we read the allegations broadly . . . rather than narrowly.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>262 Conn. 312, 321, 813 A.2d 1003 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Furthermore, each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims raises an issue of statutory construction. \u201cIt is well settled that in construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . [W]e seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Pond Co., LLC v. New London, </em>273 Conn. 786, 800, 873 A.2d 965 (2005). Finally, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s construction of the relevant statutory provisions. See, e.g., <em>Semerzakis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>274 Conn. 1, 11-12, 873 A.2d 911 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the applicable statute of limitations is \u00a7 52-555 rather than \u00a7 52-577c (b). They contend that, although wrongful death claims ordinarily are governed by \u00a7 52-555, their action is governed by \u00a7 52-577c (b) inasmuch as the allegations of the complaint fall squarely within the language of \u00a7 52-577c (b). We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">As the plaintiffs acknowledge, \u00a7 52-555 is the statute of limitations generally applicable to wrongful death claims. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 action is one for wrongful death, \u00a7 52-555 presumptively governs the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The plaintiffs contend, nevertheless, that \u00a7 52-577c (b) is the governing statute of limitations because it applies to actions for damages \u201ccaused by exposure to a hazardous chemical substance or mixture or hazardous pollutant released into the environment\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b); and the plaintiffs have alleged such damages. By its express terms, however, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b) is limited in scope to damages for \u201cpersonal injury or property damage . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 action does not involve a claim for personal injury or property damage but, rather, for wrongful death, which, as we have explained, is governed by the statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 52-555.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b) provides that it is the applicable limitation period \u201c[n]otwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>standing the provisions of [General Statutes \u00a7] 52-577,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the statute of limitations that pertains to tort actions generally, \u201cand [General Statutes \u00a7] 52-577a,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the statute of limitations that pertains to product liability claims. Thus, to the extent that \u00a7 52-577c (b) otherwise may be applicable under the present factual circumstances, that statutory provision expressly preempts \u00a7\u00a7 52-577 and 52-577a but, notably, does not purport to preempt \u00a7 52-555. If the legislature had intended for \u00a7 52-577c (b) to preempt \u00a7 52-555, it easily could have done so by enumerating \u00a7 52-555, along with \u00a7\u00a7 52-577 and 52-577a, as one of the statutes of limitation preempted by \u00a7 52-577c (b). See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 119, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003). The fact that it did not do so is strong evidence that the legislature did not intend for \u00a7 52-577c (b) to preempt \u00a7 52-555.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Our conclusion finds support in the nature and history of the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555. As we explained in <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>205 Conn. 219, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987), \u201cno action for wrongful death existed at common law or exists today in Connecticut except as otherwise provided by the legislature.\u201d Id., 231. We noted that, because \u201c\u00a7 52-555 creates a liability where none formerly existed, the statute must be strictly construed and we are not at liberty to extend, modify or enlarge its scope through the mechanics of construction.\u201d Id., 233. We further concluded that \u201cthe [time] limitation contained within \u00a7 52-555 is a jurisdictional prerequisite which cannot be waived and which must be met in order to maintain an action under \u00a7 52-555.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Id. Thus, \u00a7 52-555 is \u201cnot to be treated as an ordinary statute of limitation[s] . . . .\u201d Id., 232. Rather, it \u201cis a limitation on the liability itself, and not of the remedy alone.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the right to bring a wrongful death claim pursuant to \u00a7 52-555 exists only during the statutorily prescribed time period, and expires thereafter. See id., 232-33. Because the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555 is jurisdictional in nature, the plaintiffs shoulder a heavy burden of establishing that \u00a7 52-555 is preempted by another statute of limitations. As we have explained, the evidence of legislative intent clearly is to the contrary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The plaintiffs nevertheless argue that it is \u201ceminently reasonable\u201d to infer that the legislature intended for the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to include wrongful death. Although the legislature reasonably <em>could </em>have equated personal injury and wrongful death for statute of limitations purposes, the language of the relevant statutory provisions belies the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. See, e.g., <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>225 Conn. 432, 441-42, 623 A.2d 1007 (1993) (\u201cCourts may not by construction supply omissions ... or add exceptions merely because it appears that good reasons exist for adding them. . . . The intent of the legislature ... is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. ... It is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the legislature.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Moreover, as we have explained, statutory wrongful death actions and common-law personal injury actions historically have been treated as separate and distinct actions. See, e.g., <em>Ladd </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>v. <em>Douglas Trucking Co., </em>203 Conn. 187, 191, 523 A.2d 1301 (1987). Finally, our review of other statutory provisions indicates that when the legislature wishes to treat personal injury and wrongful death actions in the same manner, the legislature has done so expressly. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-114 (\u201c[i]n any action to recover damages for negligently causing the <em>death </em>of a person, or for negligently causing <em>personal injury or property damage, </em>it shall be presumed that such person . . . was ... in the exercise of reasonable care\u201d unless contributory negligence is affirmatively pleaded [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (a) (\u201c[i]n any civil action to recover damages resulting from <em>personal injury </em>or <em>wrongful death </em>... in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider . . . the claimant shall have the burden of proving . . . a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 52-225d (\u201c[p]ayment of damages in lump sum and periodic installments in <em>personal injury, wrongful death </em>and <em>property damage </em>actions\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 52-251c (a) (restricting attorney contingency fees in <em>\u201cpersonal injury, wrongful death and . . . property [damage]\u201d </em>actions [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 52-584a (a) (no action against an architect, professional engineer or land surveyor \u201c[1] to recover damages [A] for any deficiency in the design, planning, contract administration, supervision, observation of construction or construction of, or land surveying in connection with, an improvement to real property; [B] for injury to <em>property . . . </em>[or] [C] for injuiy to the <em>person </em>or for <em>wrongful death </em>arising out of any such deficiency . . . shall be brought . . . more than seven years after substantial completion of such improvement\u201d [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The plaintiffs also claim that our conclusion yields an absurd result because the decedents did not exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>any symptoms of their alleged exposure to hazardous chemicals and pollutants until after the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555 already had expired. The plaintiffs further contend that the legislature could not have intended for \u00a7 52-555 to serve as a bar to a wrongful death claim in circumstances in which, as in the present case, an injured victim could not have known that he or she had a claim against the alleged tortfeasor until after the limitation period had expired. Although we acknowledge that applying the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555 to the present case leads to what reasonably may be characterized as a harsh, and even unfair, result,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we disagree with the plaintiffs that the result in this case requires a different construction of the relevant statutory provisions. As we have explained, \u201c[statutes limiting the time within which an action may be brought are the result of a legitimate legislative determination which balances the rights and duties of competing groups. ... A statute of limitation or of repose is designed to (1) prevent the unexpected enforcement of stale and fraudulent claims by allowing persons after the lapse of a reasonable time, to plan their affairs with a reasonable degree of certainty, free from the disruptive burden of protracted and unknown potential liability, and (2) to aid in the search for truth that may be impaired by the loss of evidence, whether by death or disappearance of witnesses, fading memories, disappearance of documents or otherwise. . . . Repose periods that have made a distinction between wrongful death actions and personal injury actions have also been held to be rationally related to the additional state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>interest of promoting the prompt settlement of the economic and legal affairs of the deceased. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u201cStatutes of limitation find their justification in necessity and convenience rather than logic. . . . There is no reason, constitutional or otherwise, which prevents the legislature from establishing a . . . time period that runs from the date of the act or omission complained of . . . even though at that date no person had sustained damage and therefore no cause of action had come into existence. ... It is not the function of the court to alter a legislative policy merely because it produces unfair results. . . . Individual rights and remedies must at times and of necessity give way to the interests and needs of society.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 239-41; see also <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 582, 512 A.2d 893 (1986) (legislature is free to enact, for reasons of policy, statute of repose that, as applied to particular factual scenario, will bar cause of action even before that action has accrued). Thus, the fact that the decedents could not have known that they had been injured prior to the expiration of the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555 does not warrant a result that is contrary to the expressed intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Having concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 action is governed by the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555 and, therefore, is time barred under state law, we next must determine whether the trial court properly concluded that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 does not preempt \u00a7 52-555 for purposes of this case. We agree with the determination of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We begin our analysis of this issue with a review of the pertinent statutory provisions. Title 42 of the United States Code, \u00a7 9658 (a) (1), provides: \u201cIn the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>any action brought under State law for personal injury, or property damages, which are caused or contributed to by exposure to any hazardous substance, or pollutant or contaminant, released into the environment from a facility, if the applicable limitations period for such action (as specified in the State statute of limitations or under common law) provides a commencement date which is earlier than the federally required commencement date, such period shall commence at the federally required commencement date in lieu of the date specified in such State statute.\u201d The term \u201cfederally required commencement date\u201d is defined as \u201cthe date the plaintiff knew (or reasonably should have known) that the personal injury or property damages . . . were caused or contributed to by the hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant concerned.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (b) (4) (A) (2000). The term \u201crelease\u201d is defined as \u201cany spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment\u201d; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (22) (2000); but expressly excludes, inter alia, \u201cany release which results in exposure to persons solely within a workplace, with respect to a claim which such persons may assert against the employer of such persons . . '. .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (22) (2000). The term \u201cenvironment\u201d means, inter alia, any \u201csurface water, ground water, drinking water supply, land surface or subsurface strata, or ambient air within the United States or under the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (8) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has stated, \u201c[t]he language of [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 9658 (a) (1), specifying that the applicable state limitations period shall commence at the federally required commencement date in lieu of an earlier date provided by state law, makes it indisputably clear that Congress intended, in the cases to which [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 9658 applies, that the [federally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>required commencement date] preempt state law accrual rules if, under those rules, accrual would occur earlier than the date on which the cause of the personal injury was, or reasonably should have been, known to be the hazardous substance.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Freier </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>303 F.3d 176, 196 (2d Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 998, 123 S. Ct. 1899, 155 L. Ed. 2d 824 (2003). Thus, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 \u201ccreates neither a separate federal cause of action based on toxic torts within its terms nor a uniform statute of limitations related to such torts, but rather provides a uniform accrual date from which the applicable state period of limitations governing such tort actions is measured . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ruffing </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>193 Misc. 2d 350, 359, 746 N.Y.S.2d 798 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">CERCLA\u2019s \u201cfederally required commencement date\u201d applies only to state actions for personal injury or prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>erty damage caused by exposure to hazardous substances \u201creleased into the environment from a facility . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1) (2000). The definition of the term \u201crelease,\u201d for puiposes of CERCLA, expressly excludes \u201cany release which results in exposure to persons <em>solely within a workplace, </em>with respect to a claim which such persons may assert against the employer of such persons . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (22) (2000). Thus, to the extent that the plaintiffs\u2019 action is predicated on the decedents\u2019 alleged exposure to toxic agents within the workplace, it does not fall within the purview of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658. See <em>Ruffing </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>supra, 193 Misc. 2d 362 (\u201c[certainly, if an employee seeks to sue his employer for injuries sustained as a result of exposures to hazardous materials solely within the confines of his workplace, resort to the [federally required commencement date] may not be had, because there would be no release into the environment under [42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 9658 [a] [1]\u201d); see also <em>Becton </em>v. <em>Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., </em>706 So. 2d 1134, 1141 (Ala. 1997) (\u201cthe federally mandated discovery rule of [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 9658 has no application to exposure solely within the interior of the workplace\u201d). Indeed, the plaintiffs do not dispute that a release that occurs solely within the confines of the workplace does not fall within the purview of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The plaintiffs maintain nonetheless that the allegedly continuing or ongoing contamination <em>outside </em>the workplace constitutes a \u201crelease\u201d into the \u201cenvironment\u201d from a \u201cfacility\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9658 (a) (1) and 9601 (8), (9) and (22). Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that they have satisfied each of those three elements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1) by virtue of their allegation that the contaminants, to which the decedents initially had been exposed <em>inside </em>the workplace, lingered on the decedents\u2019 skin and clothing, and, consequently, resulted in ongoing contamination in the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>dents\u2019 motor vehicles and homes <em>outside </em>the workplace. A strong argument can be made, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fall within the aforementioned workplace exclusion because the plaintiffs have failed to allege that the decedents had been exposed to any <em>additional </em>contaminants outside the workplace. Rather, the plaintiffs simply have alleged that the decedents continued to experience contamination from their initial workplace exposure. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 ongoing contamination allegations are entirely derivative of their allegations regarding the decedents\u2019 initial workplace exposure. Accordingly, we are dubious as to whether these allegations fall outside the workplace exclusion of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (22).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Nevertheless, we conclude that the plaintiffs cannot prevail because they have failed to allege a release of contaminants into the \u201cenvironment\u201d within the meaning of CERCLA.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Even though \u201cthe term \u2018environment\u2019 includes \u2018ambient air within the United States,\u2019 numerous courts considering [42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 9658 (a) (1) have determined that \u2018the \u201cenvironment\u201d referred to in the statute \u201cincludes the atmosphere <em>external to the build</em>ing,\u201d but <em>not the air within a building.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Ruffing </em>v. <em>Union Carbide </em>Corp., supra, 193 Misc. 2d 362, quoting <em>3550 Stevens Creek Associates </em>v. <em>Barclays Bank of California, </em>915 F.2d 1355, 1360 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 917, 111 S.

Thus, \u201cit is clear that enclosed areas, even those which are not work sites where hazardous substances are used, are not considered to be part of the environment for the purposes of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 9658 (a) (1).\u201d <em>Ruffing </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>supra, 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">As the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals observed in <em>Covalt </em>v. <em>Carey Canada, Inc., </em>860 F.2d 1434 (7th Cir. 1988), \u201c[i]t is lexically possible to treat the \u2018environment\u2019 as everything pertaining to the planet Earth, so that the instant a container of asbestos is opened it is released \u2018into [the local portion of] the environment\u2019.

Sup. 104 (W.D.N.Y. 1994), a case that arguably supports the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. In <em>Kowalski, </em>the plaintiffs, Dorothy Kowalski and her husband, Louis Kowalski, brought negligence, strict liability and loss of consortium claims against the defendant, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear), alleging, inter alia, that Goodyear had failed to prevent the release of a hazardous chemical from its facility and that, as a result, Dorothy Kowalski contracted bladder cancer. Id., 105-106. The release allegedly occurred when Louis Kowalski, a longtime employee of Goodyear, transported the hazardous chemical into his home on his hair, skin, and clothes, thereby exposing his wife to those chemicals. Id., 105. The District Court concluded that the complaint alleged a release into the environment within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 because \u201cthe remedial purposes of [CERCLA] and the language concerning the release of chemicals into the environment can be read to include hazardous chemicals carried out of the workplace on [an employee\u2019s] person and clothing which have the <em>potential of causing injuries to those who come in contact with such employees.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 108. Thus, the District Court predicated its conclusion on the fact that a third party was exposed to the hazardous substances. In the present case, by contrast, the plaintiffs have not alleged exposure to any third parties. Nevertheless, to the extent that the reasoning of the District Court in <em>Kowalski </em>logically may be extended to employees who are exposed to the kind of continuing contamination outside of the workplace that is alleged by the plaintiffs in the present case, we decline to extend that reasoning to the facts of the present case because the District Court \u201c \u2018did not . . . even begin to explain how either the purposes of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1)] or its language could be read to convert a house into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the \u201cenvironment\u201d, especially as that term has been defined in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruffing </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>supra, 193 Misc. 2d 372; see also V.

We also disagree with this contention. We acknowledge that CERCLA is a remedial statutory scheme and, therefore, that its provisions must be construed liberally to effectuate its purpose. See, e.g., <em>Commander Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Barlo Equipment Corp., </em>215 F.3d 321, 327 (2d Cir.) (\u201c[b]ecause it is a remedial statute, CERCLA must be construed liberally to effectuate its two primary goals: [1] enabling the [Environmental Protection Agency] to respond efficiently and expeditiously to toxic spills, and [2] holding those parties [potentially] responsible for the releases liable for the costs of the cleanup\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 979, 121 S.

App. 4th 236. As is apparent from its plain language, \u201c[42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 9658 was never meant to extend to all state court lawsuits for personal injury and property damage arising from exposure to toxic substances.\u201d Id. Indeed, as the court in <em>Covalt </em>v. <em>Carey Canada, Inc., </em>supra, 860 F.2d 1434, stated after examining the language, purpose and legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1), \u201c[g]iving [that provision] its broadest possible meaning not only preempts wide sweeps of state law\u2014something we do not lightly attribute to Congress\u2014but also thrusts CERCLA into the domain of other federal rules expressly dealing with employees\u2019 safety, another thing we do not lightly attribute to Congress.\u201d Id., 1439; see <em>also Becton v.

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of contamination outside the workplace do not meet the requirement of a release into the \u201cenvironment\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> The plaintiffs are Kathleen E.

An exception to this general rule exists, however, when \u201ca statute gives a right of action which did not exist at common law, and fixes the time within which the right must be enforced, the time fixed is a limitation or condition attached to the right\u2014it is a limitation of the liability itself as created, and not of the remedy alone.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 289^40. Because \u201c\u00a7 52-555 creates liability where none formerly existed [at common law]\u201d; <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>205 Conn. 219, 233, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987); it is undisputed that the defendants properly raised the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555 in a motion to strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 provides <em>in </em>relevant part: \u201c(a) When any claim made in a complaint, cross complaint, special defense, or other pleading is grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> In support of its conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 action is barred by virtue of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (22), the court also noted that the defendants\u2019 alleged release of contaminants in the decedents\u2019 workplace is at \u201cthe heart of [the plaintiffs\u2019] wrongful death claim,\u201d and that workers\u2019 compensation claims had been filed against <em>the </em>defendants predicated on the decedents\u2019 workplace exposure.

In <em>Ecker, </em>we addressed the issue of whether the trial court had jurisdiction over a wrongful death action brought by the plaintiff, Patricia 0. Ecker, administrator of the estate of her deceased husband, after the expiration of the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555. Id., 220, 226. In concluding that Ecker\u2019s action was time barred, we rejected her contention that \u00a7 52-555 was unconstitutional because it created a more restrictive class of wrongful death actions when compared to other statutes providing longer limitation periods for other types of death actions. Id., 241-45. In reaching that conclusion, we reviewed a number of statutes of limitation, including \u00a7 52-577c, that Ecker had identified as containing longer limitation periods for wrongful death actions than that of \u00a7 52-555. Id. We engaged in no analysis, however, as to whether \u00a7 52-577c applies to wrongful death actions; in essence, we accepted, arguendo, Ecker\u2019s representation regarding the alleged applicability of \u00a7 52-577c to wrongful death actions and, thereafter, rejected Ecker\u2019s constitutional claim. Consequently, <em>Ecker </em>does not stand for the proposition that \u00a7 52-577c applies to wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 230 Conn. 12, also is misplaced. In <em>Sharp, </em>the decedents allegedly died from asphyxiation after descending into a storage vault containing petroleum products. Id., 13. The plaintiffs, representatives of the decedents\u2019 estates, brought a product liability action against the named defendant, Wyatt, Inc. (Wyatt), a wholesaler of petroleum products, among others, alleging, inter alia, that Wyatt had failed to warn of the hazards associated with the storage of the petroleum products. Id., 13-14. The trial court granted Wyatt\u2019s motion for summary judgment and rendered judgment thereon, from which the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court. Id., 14. One of the issues raised on appeal to the Appellate Court was whether \u00a7 52-577a, the statute of limitations applicable to product liability claims, or \u00a7 52-577c (b), the statute of limitations applicable to personal injury actions predicated on exposure to hazardous chemicals or pollutants, governed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 824, 852, 627 A.2d 1347 (1993). The Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 52-577c (b) is applicable only when there has been an exposure within the meaning of the statute; see id., 854; and that a factual question existed with respect to whether the decedents had been exposed to petroleum. Id., 854-55. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case to that court for, inter alia, a resolution of that factual issue and, in a per curiam opinion, we affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Court. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 16. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, <em>Sharp </em>does not control the outcome of the present case. The plaintiffs in <em>Sharp </em>did not bring an action for wrongful death pursuant to \u00a7 52-555 but, rather, a product liability action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-572q. As we have explained, \u00a7 52-577c (b) expressly preempts \u00a7 52-577a, the statute of limitations applicable to product liability actions. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b) (\u201c \u2018[pjroduct liability claim\u2019 includes all claims or actions brought for personal injury, <em>death </em>or property damage\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>[emphasis added]). Perhaps more importantly, however, the sole issue relating to the statute of limitations that we considered in <em>Sharp </em>was the fact-based question of whether the deaths of the decedents had been caused by exposure to petroleum products. Consequently, the court had no occasion to address the issue raised by the present case, namely, whether \u00a7 52-577c (b) applies to wrongful death claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\"> See <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West </em>Hartford, supra, 205 Conn. 240 (observing that repose period of \u00a7 52-555 is \u201cunfair at times\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\"> By its terms, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1) applies only to state law actions for personal injury or property damage.

We decline to review this claim, however, because the defendants have failed to brief it adequately. See <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>270 Conn. 815, 823 n.8, 856 A.2d 358 (2004) (\u201cWe consistently have held that [a]nalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . [Assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court. . . . Where the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\"> The plaintiffs assert that the workplace where the contamination originated is the \u201cfacility\u201d from which the toxic agents were released. In view of our determination that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that there was a release of those agents into the \u201cenvironment,\u201d we need not decide whether the decedents\u2019 workplace constitutes a \u201cfacility\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\"> The plaintiffs maintain that, when the complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency, the complaint reasonably may be construed to contain an allegation that \u201ca worker who continues to inhale and absorb chemicals going from the plant to his car and from his car to his home is exposed to releases in the ambient air.\u201d The plaintiffs apparently seek to have us construe the complaint as alleging a release of contaminants into the outside air as the decedents moved from workplace to car and from car to home. We need not decide whether such an allegation would fall within the purview of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1) because the plaintiffs allege in their complaint only that each decedent had been exposed to toxic agents \u201cin his [or her] home and car . . . .\u201d We cannot read allegations into the complaint that are not there. See, e.g., <em>Alarm Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>179 Conn. 541, 549-50, 427 A.2d 822 (1980) (motion to strike is tested by allegations of complaint, which cannot be enlarged by assumption of any fact not alleged therein).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b384-5\"> The plaintiffs also maintain that <em>Vermont </em>v. <em>Staco, Inc., </em>684 F.

LEXIS 17341 (April 20,1989), supports their contention that their complaint alleges a \u201crelease into the environment from a facility\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9658 (a) (1). We disagree. In <em>Staco, Inc., </em>the plaintiffs, the state of Vermont and the village of Poultney, Vermont, brought an action against the defendant, Staco, Inc., a manufacturer of mercury thermometers, among others, under CERCLA and state environmental statutes. Id., 825. The plaintiffs sought to recover response costs for the cleanup and removal of mercury from a local water treatment facility, certain sewer lines and septic systems. Id. In support of their motion for partial summary judgment, the plaintiffs presented documentation establishing that \u201cmercury was released from the Staco plant on the bodies and clothing of the workers\u201d; id., 833; and that that mercury had found its way into workers\u2019 septic systems and into the public sewer system. Id. In light of this proof, the District Court concluded that the plaintiffs had established that mercury had been released into the environment. Id., 834. In contrast to the evidence of extensive environmental contamination adduced by the plaintiffs in <em>Staco, Inc., </em>the plaintiffs in the present case have alleged only that toxic agents were released into their homes and motor vehicles. As we have explained, such a release is not a release into the environment within the meaning of CERCLA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
