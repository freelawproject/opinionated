The issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiff, John Aselton, administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, can state a claim for a violation of substantive due process under the state and federal constitutions against employees of the East Hartford police department who allegedly were responsible for dispatching the decedent to the scene with inadequate and misleading infoimation. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants, East Hartford police chief James Shay and East Hartford police dispatch employees Patricia Learned, William Madore and Deborah Rataic.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The record reflects the following facts, as read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party for summary judgment. On January 23, 1999, at approximately 9:13 p.m., Learned, an intake dispatcher with the East Hartford police department, had been engaged in a forty-five minute personal telephone call when a 911 telephone call came in from a complainant, Mark Myers. Learned put her personal call on hold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>answered Myers\u2019 call and engaged in the following exchange with Myers, who seemed nervous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201c[Learned]: East Hartford Emergency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201c[Myers]: Yes, madam, 454 Main Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201c[Learned]: Uh hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201c[Myers]: Apartments\u2014I just heard some loud noise, some groaning and yelling, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\u2014some loud noise from outside\u2014maybe somebody fell down the stairs\u2014there\u2019s somebody yelling and groaning\u2014I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201c[Learned]: What apartment are you in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">\u201c[Myers]: I\u2019m sorry\u2014above Car Quest Auto Parts Store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">\u201c[Learned]: What apartment are you in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">\u201c[Myers]: I\u2019m in [five]\u2014nothing wrong here\u2014but I heard some noise outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">\u201c[Learned]: Like where outside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">\u201c[Myers]: It seems like in the apartment across\u2014 maybe some loud noise, somebody yelling, someone groaning\u2014I have no idea what\u2019s going on here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-15\">\u201c [Learned]: So you\u2019re not sure exactly what happened and you haven\u2019t gone out to check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-16\">\u201c[Myers]: No I didn\u2019t look. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-17\">\u201c[Learned]: OK, well, we\u2019ll send somebody out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-18\">\u201c[Myers]: OK.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-19\">\u201c[Learned]: Bye.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-20\">While taking the call, which lasted approximately forty-five seconds, Learned typed the following information into the dispatch screen for transfer to radio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>dispatch: \u201cSays that he just heard a loud noise, someone yelling, doesn\u2019t really have any idea what it was and will not go look. It was outside.\u201d Learned thought that someone might have been injured, but did not include any such reference on the dispatch screen, and instead classified the call as a routine \u201ccheck welfare\u201d complaint, but coded the priority of the call as \u201cH,\u201d meaning highest priority. Learned then returned to the personal call that she had put on hold. At approximately 9:14 p.m., Rataic, who was working as a dispatch trainee under the supervision of Madore, received the dispatch entry and issued a communication to the decedent and a second police officer, essentially restating the information that Learned had typed into the dispatch intake screen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moments later, because she had omitted any reference to the location of the noise, Rataic issued a second communication, pursuant to instructions by Madore, stating: \u201cBe advised that was outside of Car Quest Auto Parts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">At approximately 9:16 p.m., the decedent and fellow police officer Mike Weglarz independently arrived on the scene, checked outside 454 Main Street in East Hartford near Car Quest Auto Parts and found no disturbance. The decedent then contacted the dispatcher, asking whether Myers wished to be seen. Rataic asked out loud whether Myers wanted to be seen, but Learned, who still was engaged in a personal call, did not answer. Madore then instructed Rataic that a complainant prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ably could provide the responding officers with better information if the police officers saw him. Rataic also assumed, absent a contrary indication, that the inclusion of Myers\u2019 name and address on the display screen indicated that he wanted to be seen by the police. She therefore provided the decedent with Myers\u2019 location and stated, \u201che said he\u2019ll be seen.\u201d The decedent then entered the apartment building at 454 Main Street and walked up to the second floor hallway, where he encountered the defendant Alex Sostre, who with three other persons was in the process of committing, inter alia, a robbery and assault in apartment two. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Sostre then fatally shot the decedent in the head.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At approximately 9:22 p.m., police officers in the immediate area were informed that dispatch had received a telephone call from an individual reporting that a police officer was down in the hallway of the building. The responding officers entered the building and found the decedent lying in the hallway, with his weapon still secured in its holster. In apartment two, in close proximity to the decedent\u2019s body, the officers found Gregorio Velez bound, gagged and bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Thereafter, internal and independent investigations were conducted into the circumstances leading to the decedent\u2019s death. Shay attempted to pressure an internal affairs investigator into issuing a report that mirrored a preliminary internal report concluding that the 911 call had not been mishandled; however, a report based on a subsequent independent investigation into the incident concluded that, \u201cit is highly likely that the response of the officers that evening would have been different had they had the same pertinent information received by . . . Learned,\u201d meaning that the decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>would not have entered the building without having another officer present. The report further concluded that \u201c[a] lack of supervision, policies and procedures . . . and [a] lack of ongoing training has significantly affected the performance of the communications division.\u201d Shay had notice of these problems by virtue of a complaint from a supervisor in the dispatch department, five years before the incident at issue, that conditions in the communications division were so bad that Shay was \u201cgoing to lose a guy.\u201d Moreover, prior to January 23, 1999, another dispatcher had complained to a department supervisor that Learned was being distracted from her work by personal telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The plaintiff subsequently commenced this action against the defendants; see footnote 1 of this opinion; seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The complaint alleged: common-law claims of negligent, reckless and wilful misconduct; violations under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 14 of the Connecticut constitution; and violations under the first, fourth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The defendants thereafter moved for summary judgment on all the claims, and the trial court granted the motion. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court first noted that the plaintiff had conceded, apparently at oral argument, that the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a), barred the defendants\u2019 liability for the common-law negligence and recklessness counts. With respect to the claims for wilful misconduct, the court concluded that there was no evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that any of the defendants had acted with the intent to expose the decedent to deadly force. The trial court also rejected the plaintiffs claims for common-law damages directly under the Connecticut constitution, concluding that such claims were barred by virtue of the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Compensation Act in that the legislature intended that the act provide the exclusive remedy for a work-related death.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Finally, the court turned to the plaintiffs federal constitutional claims, first noting that the plaintiff had abandoned all such claims except those alleging a violation of substantive due process. It then determined that the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court for establishing such a violation is whether the defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cshock[s] the conscience.\u201d In concluding that the plaintiff could not meet this standard, the court reasoned: \u201c[T]here is no genuine factual dispute that the [defendants] never harbored an intent that [the decedent] be injured when he was dispatched to respond to the emergency call. Neither does unwittingly dispatching an officer to a place where he unexpectedly encounters an armed burglar, willing to kill him, shock the conscience. Negligence, recklessness, and even callous indifference by police personnel who dispatched [the decedent] that night are insufficient to create a substantive due process violation . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rendered summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the judgment, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had failed to consider: (1) the theory of \u201cstate created danger\u201d as a basis for liability for a substantive due process violation under the federal constitution, because the defendants\u2019 conduct had increased the risk of harm to the decedent; and (2) his claim against Shay on the basis of supervisory liability. The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s judgment only with respect to the substantive due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>cess claims under both the federal and state constitutions. With respect to the claims under the federal constitution, the plaintiff contends that the trial court failed to recognize state created danger as a basis for liability. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that, as a result of its failure to consider this theory, the trial court improperly required him to establish an intent to harm, rather than the lesser state of mind of deliberate indifference to harm. The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment on the claim against Shay for supervisory liability because the court altogether failed to address that claim, which was supported sufficiently by the evidence. With respect to the claims under the Connecticut constitution, the plaintiff contends that summary judgment was improper because article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution affords even greater protection than its federal counterpart, and the workers\u2019 compensation scheme does not preclude relief because that scheme was not intended to compensate workers for a deprivation of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The defendants respond that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment on the federal due process claims because: (1) it is questionable whether the theory of state created danger remains viable after recent United States Supreme Court decisions requiring conscience shocking conduct, but to the extent that it survives, it does not apply in the law enforcement context; (2) intentional conscience shocking conduct is the proper standard for establishing a violation under the facts of this case; and (3) the trial court did not need to address the supervisory liability claim against Shay because the plaintiff had failed to establish the necessary predicate of an underlying constitutional violation. With regard to the due process claims under the Connecticut constitution, the defendants contend that we need not consider these claims because the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>has failed to demonstrate that our constitution provides more expansive protection than the federal constitution, under which the plaintiffs claims fail. Alternatively, the defendants contend that both our case law and the workers\u2019 compensation scheme counsel against recognizing a more expansive view of substantive due process under the Connecticut constitution. Finally, with respect to all of the claims, the defendants contend that, should we conclude that summary judgment improperly was rendered, they still would be entitled to prevail on the ground of qualified immunity. We conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because, although we conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to proceed under the theory of state created danger, the defendants\u2019 conduct did not rise to the level required to establish a due process violation in this case as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Guiding our inquiry as to all of the claims is our well established standard of review of atrial court\u2019s decision granting a motion for summary judgment. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial </em>Corp., 276 Conn. 1, 6-7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005). \u201cFinally, the scope of our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the [defendants\u2019] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ace </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Equipment Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Buccino, </em>273 Conn. 217, 227, 869 A.2d 626 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We begin with the plaintiffs substantive due process claims under the federal constitution. These claims give rise to three issues. We first must consider whether the theory of state created danger is a viable basis upon which to state such a claim. If so, we must determine whether the requisite culpability for establishing liability is deliberate indifference or intent to harm. If the former, we must consider whether the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff can establish such culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The plaintiffs federal constitutional claims rest on the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe most familiar office of that Clause is to provide a guarantee of fair procedure in connection with any deprivation of life, liberty, or property by a State. [The plaintiff], however, does not advance a procedural due process claim in this case. Instead, [he] relies on the substantive component of the Clause that protects individual liberty against certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1992). The parameters applicable to the plaintiffs substantive due process claims largely have been established by three United States Supreme Court decisions. Accordingly, we begin with a discussion of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The state created danger theory on which the plaintiff relies has its genesis in <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>489 U.S. 189, 109 S. Ct. 998, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1989) <em>(DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County). </em>In that case, a father had beaten his four year old son, Joshua DeShaney, causing such severe brain damage that he was expected to spend the rest of his life confined to an institution for the profoundly retarded. Id., 193. The petitioners, Joshua and his mother, brought a \u00a7 1983 action against the social workers and other local officials who, despite having received credible complaints over a two year period of Joshua\u2019s abuse by his father, nonetheless failed to remove Joshua from his father\u2019s custody. Id., 191-93. The petitioners alleged that the respondents\u2019 failure to protect Joshua from a risk of violence by his father that they knew or should have known about violated Joshua\u2019s right to substantive due process. Id., 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The <em>DeShaney </em>court acknowledged the \u201cundeniably tragic\u201d facts of the case; id., 191; but rejected the petitioners\u2019 contention that the respondents\u2019 failure to discharge their duty to protect Joshua was an abuse of governmental power that so \u201cshocks the conscience,\u201d a standard first articulated by the court in <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S. Ct. 205, 96 L. Ed. 183 (1952), as to violate substantive due process. <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 197-98. The court reasoned that \u201cnothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors. The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State\u2019s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security. It forbids the State itself to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without \u2018due process of law,\u2019 but its language cannot fairly be extended to impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>those interests do not come to harm through other means.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The court rejected the petitioners\u2019 position that the case fell within a limited class of \u201cspecial relationship\u201d cases wherein the court had recognized an affirmative duty to protect. Id., 197-98. It noted that the duty arose in those cases because the person requiring aid was in the custody of the government, such as a prison inmate or an institutionalized person. Id., 199-200. Of particular relevance to this case, the court then went on to explain: \u201c[The] [petitioners concede that the harms Joshua suffered occurred not while he was in the State\u2019s custody, but while he was in the custody of his natural father, who was in no sense a state actor. While the State may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them. That the State once took temporary custody of Joshua does not alter the analysis, for when it returned him to his father\u2019s custody, it placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all; the State does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual\u2019s safety by having once offered him shelter. Under these circumstances, the State had no constitutional duty to protect Joshua.\u201d Id., 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Thereafter, almost every federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the Second Circuit, interpreted <em>DeShaney </em>and the cases cited therein as recognizing two \u201cexceptions\u201d to the general rule precluding liability for the government\u2019s failure to protect against harm from a private actor: The first is a special relationship wherein the victim typically is in the care or custody of the government;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the second is a \u201cstate created danger\u201d wherein the state affirmatively creates or increases the victim\u2019s risk of danger at the hands of a private actor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Two United States Supreme Court deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>sions subsequent to <em>DeShaney, </em>however, inform our inquiry as to whether the plaintiff may establish the defendants\u2019 liability under the theory of state created danger and, if so, under which standard of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>supra, 503 U.S. 117, the plaintiff, the widow of an employee of the city\u2019s sanitation department who had been asphyxiated after entering a manhole to unstop a sewer line, brought suit against the city alleging that it had a custom and policy of deliberate indifference toward the safety of its employees. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the city had a custom and policy of failing to train its employees about the dangers of such work and to provide safety equipment and safety warnings, and that this conduct reflected its intentional and systematic disregard of such requirements under state law. Id., 117-18. The plaintiff further alleged that an accident similar to the one that caused her husband\u2019s death had put the city on notice of the risks to which he had been exposed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to allege a constitutional violation. Id., 117-18, 125. In doing so, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>first noted the cautionary approach it would undertake in considering such a claim: \u201cAs a general matter, the Court has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended. . . . The doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The court then noted that \u201c[a] fair reading of [the plaintiffs] complaint does not charge the city with a wilful violation of [her decedent husband\u2019s] rights. [The plaintiff] does not claim that the city or any of its agents deliberately harmed her husband. In fact, she does not even allege that his supervisor instructed him to go into the sewer when the supervisor knew or should have known that there was a significant risk that he would be injured. Instead, she makes the more general allegation that the city deprived him of life and liberty by failing to provide a reasonably safe work environment. Fairly analyzed, her claim advances two theories: that the Federal Constitution imposes a duty on the city to provide its employees with minimal levels of safety and security in the workplace, or that the city\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to [her husband\u2019s] safety was arbitrary government action that must \u2018shock the conscience\u2019 of federal judges.\u201d Id., 125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The court rejected both theories. With respect to the first theory, the court noted that, \u201c[n] either the text nor the history of the Due Process Clause supports [the plaintiffs] claim that the governmental employer\u2019s duty to provide its employees with a safe working environment is a substantive component of the Due Process Clause.\u201d Id., 126. The court reiterated its admonition in <em>DeShaney </em>that the government cannot be held hable for failing to take affirmative action to protect individuals from harm from other sources. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>With respect to the plaintiffs second theory of liability, the court concluded that it was \u201cnot persuaded that the city\u2019s alleged failure to train its employees, or to warn them about known risks of harm, was an omission that can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense. [The plaintiffs] claim is analogous to a fairly typical state-law tort claim: The city breached its duty of care to her husband by failing to provide a safe work environment. Because the Due Process Clause does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living together in society . . . we have previously rejected claims that the Due Process Clause should be interpreted to impose federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law, see, e.g., <em>[Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-33, 106 S. Ct. 662, 88 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1986)]; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 146 [99 S. Ct. 2689, 61 L. Ed. 2d 433] (1979); <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701 [96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405] (1976). The reasoning in those cases applies with special force to claims asserted against public employers because state law, rather than the Federal Constitution, generally governs the substance of the employment relationship.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>supra, 503 U.S. 128. The court refused to characterize the defendant city\u2019s conduct as conscience shocking because the city\u2019s actions necessarily were predicated on policy choices as to personnel and allocation of resources, which the court presumed had been made rationally. Id., 128-29. It also noted, however, that the fact that the claim arose in the context of a public employment relationship in and of itself would not be of controlling significance when other facts demonstrated a constitutional violation. Id., 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Six years after its decision in <em>Collins, </em>the Supreme Court had an opportunity to expound on the state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>mind necessary to establish conduct that, in a constitutional sense, shocks the conscience. See <em>Sacramento </em>v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998). In <em>Lewis, </em>the issue before the court was \u201cwhether a police officer violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of substantive due process by causing death through deliberate or reckless indifference to life in a high-speed automobile chase aimed at apprehending a suspected offender.\u201d Id., 836. The court concluded that this conduct did not violate due process and that \u201cin such circumstances only a purpose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest will satisfy the element of arbitrary conduct shocking to the conscience, necessary for a due process violation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In reaching that conclusion, the court first underscored that its prior decisions on this issue \u201crepeatedly [had] emphasized that only the most egregious conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense . . . .\u201d Id., 846. Accordingly, conduct intending to injure without legitimate justification would be the type of arbitrary governmental action that would most clearly meet the \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard. Id., 849. The court posited, however, that, \u201c[w]hether the point of the conscience shocking is reached when injuries are produced with culpability falling within the middle range, following from something more than negligence but less than intentional conduct, such as recklessness or gross negligence ... is a matter for closer calls.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court noted that it previously had determined that a cognizable claim could be stated under the standard of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d in the context of a denial of medical needs when a person is under the care and custody of the government and thereby deprived of the opportunity to provide for his or her own needs. Id., 849-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Therefore, the court cautioned that the degree of culpability required to demonstrate conscience shocking conduct depended on the facts of the case. Id., 850-51. When the facts demonstrate that there is no opportunity for reflection and deliberation, such as decision-making by police officers in responding to a prison riot or a high speed pursuit, a standard of deliberate indifference cannot be applied sensibly. Id., 851-52. In such settings, \u201ca deliberate indifference standard does not adequately capture the importance of . . . competing obligations, or convey the appropriate hesitancy to critique in hindsight decisions necessarily made in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 852. Accordingly, the court concluded that in such circumstances, liability should turn on whether the police acted with the intent to cause harm. Id., 853. With the parameters set by <em>DeShaney, Collins </em>and <em>Lewis </em>in mind, we now address the plaintiffs substantive due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Each party asserts a different view of the impact of <em>Collins </em>and <em>Lewis </em>on the plaintiffs claims. The plaintiff asserts that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s decision, the defendants may be held liable under the state created danger theory, and that, under the reasoning of <em>Lewis, </em>deliberate indifference, and not intent to harm, is the requisite state of mind to be applied in this case. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that, because the evidence reflects that the defendants had time to deliberate before the decedent entered the building where he confronted Sostre, according to <em>Lewis, </em>a standard of deliberate indifference sensibly can be applied. The plaintiff points to the fact that approximately nine minutes lapsed between the time Myers called and the police were notified that an officer was down in the building, and he asserts that Learned had plenty of time to probe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Myers for details and clarification as to the location and nature of the incident, or thereafter to provide additional information to the decedent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff distinguishes his claim from <em>Collins </em>and characterizes that case as standing only for the proposition that a claim asserting a general right to a safe workplace is not constitutionally cognizable, specifically when the claim implicates political decisions about personnel and the allocation of resources. He asserts that <em>Collins </em>is relevant only to the extent that it underscores the point that whether the injury arose in the course of a public employment relationship is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In response, the defendants first contend that the plaintiff cannot proceed under the theory of state created danger because courts either have rejected the theory altogether as superseded by <em>Collins </em>and <em>Lewis </em>or have expressed reluctance to apply the theory to law enforcement officials. The defendants next assert that, even if the theory is viable, <em>Collins </em>and <em>Lewis </em>require that the plaintiff prove intent to harm, not deliberate indifference, and, accordingly, his claims must fail. They claim that this case squarely fits within the facts of <em>Collins, </em>wherein the court rejected similar claims of culpability. They also claim that, under Lewis, intent to harm is the requisite state of mind by virtue of the nature of emergency dispatch work, which, by necessity, precludes true deliberation. They point to the one minute and forty-five second period between Myers\u2019 call and the dispatch to the police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that the state created danger theory controls this case and that the proper state of mind is deliberate indifference. We nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>agree with the defendants that the plaintiff cannot prevail under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">As an initial matter, we disagree with the plaintiffs characterization of the trial court\u2019s decision in one significant respect. We disagree that the trial court failed to consider the state created danger theory. It is axiomatic that the due process clause is a limitation on <em>government </em>action, designed to prevent it \u201cfrom abusing [its] power, or employing it as an instrument of oppression . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 196. As our discussion of <em>DeShaney </em>and its progeny illustrates, because Sostre, a private actor, inflicted the decedent\u2019s fatal wound, the plaintiff would be able to prevail <em>only </em>if he could attribute that harm to the government, by showing either that the state had a special relationship to the decedent and thereby assumed an obligation to protect him from harm, or that the state created or increased the decedent\u2019s risk of harm at the hands of Sostre. Without meeting that threshold requirement, the plaintiff could not prevail irrespective of the defendants\u2019 state of mind or degree of culpability. Therefore, by virtue of the fact that the trial court analyzed whether the defendants\u2019 level of culpability met the <em>Lewis </em>conscience shocking standard, we presume that it implicitly must have determined, or at least assumed for purposes of its analysis, that the plaintiff could attribute the harm to the government defendants by virtue of the state created danger theory. Thus, properly framed, the plaintiffs claim on appeal is that he is entitled to prevail under that theory by establishing a less culpable state of mind than intent to harm, namely, deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The defendants, however, contend that the state created danger theory cannot be applied, and, therefore, we begin by considering whether the plaintiff can meet the threshold requirement of attributing the harm to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the government under that theory. Following <em>Collins </em>and <em>Lewis, </em>many Circuit Courts of Appeal have reconsidered the state created danger theory. Most of those courts have continued to recognize the theory as a basis for liability, but have engrafted the \u201cconscience shocking\u201d standard as a further limitation to recovery when the facts otherwise demonstrate wilful or deliberate indifference to a risk of harm. See <em>Velez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Vega-Irizarry, </em>421 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 2005) (\u201c[m]ost of the circuit courts have now acknowledged that the existence of a constitutional violation is possible, on particular facts, under a \u2018state created danger\u2019 theory of liability\u201d); see also, e.g., <em>Christiansen </em>v. <em>Tulsa, </em>332 F.3d 1270, 1281 (10th Cir. 2003) (\u201c[t]o make out aproper danger creation claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that [1] the charged state entity and the charged individual actors created the danger or increased [the] plaintiffs vulnerability to the danger in some way; [2] [the] plaintiff was a member of a limited and specifically definable group; [3] [the] defendants\u2019 conduct put [the] plaintiff at substantial risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm; [4] the risk was obvious or known; [5] [the] defendants acted recklessly in conscience disregard of that risk; and [6] such conduct, when viewed in total, is conscience shocking\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Schieber </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>320 F.3d 409, 417 (3d Cir. 2003) (adding requirement of showing conscience shocking conduct to existing test requiring: \u201c[1] the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct; [2] the state actor acted in willful disregard for the safety of the plaintiff; [3] there existed some relationship between the state and the plaintiff; [and] [4] the state actors used their authority to create an opportunity that otherwise would not have existed for the third party\u2019s crime to occur\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we adopt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>majority view that the state created danger theory still is viable, but requires conduct that rises to the level of conscience shocking and evidences the requisite degree of culpability, either deliberate indifference to harm or intent to harm.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The defendants suggest, however, that the state created danger theory is inapplicable to the specific context of the present case, namely, where a law enforcement official was injured in the course of his employment. It appears that only a few courts have considered claims of state created danger theory as applied to law enforcement officers, and in all of those cases, the courts have rejected the claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Walls </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>v. <em>Detroit, </em>United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 92-1846, 1993 WL 158498, *5 (6th Cir. May 14, 1993); <em>Pahler </em>v. <em>Wilkes-Barre, </em>207 F. Sup. 2d 341, 351 (M.D. Pa. 2001), aff'd, 31 Fed. Appx. 69, 71, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 4124 (3d Cir. March 12, 2002); <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>Newport News, </em>919 F. Sup. 885 (E.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 96-1535, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 3502 (4th Cir. February 27, 1997) (per curiam); <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Bachert, </em>880 F. Sup. 342 (E.D. Pa. 1995); see also <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>Oxnard, </em>145 F.3d 1078, 1084 (9th Cir. 1998) (distinguishing preceding cases from claim wherein law enforcement officer was shot fatally by fellow officer during raid on ground that claim alleged excessive force under fourth amendment rather than due process clause and concluding \u201cthe difference is quite significant\u201d). These courts have viewed the conscience shocking standard mindful that law enforcement duties necessarily entail exposure to dangerous, and even deadly, situations. They further have reasoned that the government cannot be held liable merely for exposing a law enforcement official to a danger that the officer knowingly and voluntarily assumed as part of his or her duties. See, e.g., <em>Walls </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>supra, **5-6 (The court rejected a claim by the executor of the estate of a police officer who was fatally shot after being ordered to enter a building and arrest a barricaded gunman, reasoning: \u201c[The] [plaintiffs artful attempt to recast his complaint in terms distinguishable from <em>[Collins] </em>is unavailing, because it misunderstands one of the central tenets of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in that case: the Constitution does not guarantee police officers and other municipal employees a workplace free of unreasonable risks of harm. . . . Nowhere does [the] plaintiffs complaint allege that [the decedent] did not understand or appreciate the risk involved in his job. . . . Without more, the Constitution is not implicated when the [city\u2019s] . . . [c]hief of [p]olice orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>officers to go in and arrest a barricaded gunman. Such a command decision does not rise to the level of conscience-shocking.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>Pahler </em>v. <em>Wilkes-Barre, </em>supra, 351 (\u201c[The plaintiff police officer] entered into [his] job voluntarily and fully aware of the substantial risks of harm faced on a daily basis. City policemen, unlike private citizens, are constantly faced with dangerous situations in which they risk possible injury.\u201d); <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Bachert, </em>supra, 351 (\u201c[The decedent] entered into his duties as a [d]eputy [s]heriff voluntarily and with knowledge of the possible dangers faced by law enforcement personnel. More than the sanitation worker in <em>Collins, </em>[the] decedent\u2019s job involved routine exposure to danger, and he was aware of the substantial risk of harm faced daily. . . . [T]he state did not force [the] appellant to become a [deputy sheriff], and the state has no constitutional obligation to protect him from the hazards inherent in that occupation.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We decline herein to adopt the limitation suggested by the defendants for several reasons. First, we hesitate to deny a discrete class of individuals the right to assert a constitutional claim irrespective of the degree of egregiousness of the government\u2019s conduct. Under such an approach, a law enforcement official would be denied relief even if it could be proved that the government acted with actual intent to harm. Second, to the extent that the cases rejecting due process claims under the theory of state created danger in the context of law enforcement suggest a legitimate concern, namely, that the very nature of the work itself\u2014sending police officers to respond to dangerous situations\u2014could give rise to liability, such a concern can be addressed in determining whether the conduct shocks the conscience. See <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 523 U.S. 849 (\u201cconduct intended to injure in some way <em>unjustifiable by any government interest </em>is the sort of official action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level\u201d [emphasis added]). Finally, we decline to embrace a standard that at best tolerates and at worst encourages wanton and reckless behavior toward the safety of our law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In light of our conclusion that the plaintiff may proceed under the theory of state created danger, we turn to the question of the requisite level of culpability. The few courts to have considered substantive due process claims involving 911 calls have applied the deliberate indifference standard, rather than intent to harm. See <em>Beltran </em>v. <em>El Paso, </em>367 F.3d 299, 307 (5th Cir. 2004) (applying deliberate indifference standard to claim against 911 operator); <em>Schieber v. Philadelphia, </em>supra, 320 F.3d 417-19 (applying deliberate indifference standard to claim against officers responding to 911 call). Applying that standard is consistent with <em>Collins </em>in that the case clearly left open the possibility that deliberate indifference could establish liability in a claim arising in the workplace. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>supra, 503 U.S. 125 (The court noted that \u201c[the plaintiffs] complaint does not charge the city with a willful violation of [her decedent husband\u2019s] rights. [The plaintiff] does not claim that the city or any of its agents deliberately harmed her husband. <em>In fact, she does not even allege that his supervisor . . . knew or should have known that there was a significant risk that he would be </em>injured.\u201d [Emphasis added.]).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although <em>Lewis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>counsels that the requisite state of mind must consider the defendants\u2019 ability to deliberate before acting, and the present facts fall closer on the scale to the police pursuit (intent to harm) cases than the prison medical needs (deliberate indifference) cases, we are not convinced, especially in light of the evidence submitted by the plaintiff; see footnote 9 of this opinion; that the circumstances rose to the instinctive, reflexive conduct requiring a showing of intent to harm as discussed in <em>Lewis. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendants\u2019 conduct rose to the level of deliberate indifference. See <em>Pahler </em>v. <em>Wilkes-Barre, </em>supra, 31 Fed. Appx. 71 (recognizing potential liability under state created danger theory in law enforcement context and applying deliberate indifference, rather than intent to harm, standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The meaning of deliberate indifference, in the context of state created danger, post <em>Collins </em>and <em>Lewis, </em>sets forth a stringent standard. It has been described as \u201cequivalent to the concept of recklessness utilized in the criminal [context] . . . [requiring] that the [actor] have an actual, subjective appreciation of an excessive risk of serious harm to [the victim\u2019s] health or safety and that [the actor] \u2018consciously disregard[ed]\u2019 that risk.\u201d [Citation omitted.] <em>Schieber </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>supra, 320 F.3d 421; accord <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Ridgefield, </em>411 F.3d 1134, 1143 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[deliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his actions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Beltran </em>v. <em>El Paso, </em>supra, 367 F.3d 307 (\u201c[deliberate indifference requires that the state actor both knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to the victim\u2019s health and safety\u201d); <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Kapnolas, </em>308 F.3d 180, 185-86 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Cir. 2002) (same); <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Utah State School for the Deaf &amp; Blind, </em>173 F.3d 1226, 1238 (10th Cir. 1999) (\u201c[The] plaintiff-appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim must rest on a showing of reckless conduct on the part of [the defendant]. We have said that an \u2018act is reckless when it reflects a wanton or obdurate disregard or complete indifference to risk,\u2019 and that reckless intent is established if the state \u2018actor was aware of a known or obvious risk that was so great that it was highly probable that serious harm would follow and he or she proceeded in conscious and unreasonable disregard Of the consequences.\u2019 \u201d). Thus, the defendants cannot be held liable for merely appreciating a possibility of a risk of harm; they must have consciously disregarded that risk. <em>Schieber </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>supra, 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Viewing the evidence in the present case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as we must; <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>supra, 276 Conn. 6; we begin with the claim as to Learned. The evidence suggests that Learned was distracted with a personal telephone call on hold and, as a result, she failed to ask or to appreciate the need to ask Myers a fundamental and obvious question, namely, clarification as to the location from which the noise came that Myers heard when he stated \u201coutside,\u201d \u201cdown the stairs\u201d and \u201cin the apartment across the . . . .\u201d The latter statement referred, as Myers later explained to investigators, outside his apartment, either across or down the hallway. Learned then compounded her error by deciding to omit from her dispatch entry any reference to the possibility: (1) that the noise came from inside the building; and (2) that someone might be injured, based on Myers\u2019 comments that he heard yelling and groaning and thought that perhaps someone had fallen down the stairs. Moreover, Learned inaccurately conveyed the information that Myers actually had given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>in that she indicated that he <em>would </em>not look outside, instead of that he <em>had </em>not looked outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Although we can surmise from these facts that Learned recognized the <em>possibility </em>that someone may have been injured, she neither knew that someone in fact had been injured, nor did she know the source of that injury. Accordingly, we cannot impute to her the knowledge and, therefore, the conscious disregard of facts that we have learned in hindsight: that someone was in fact injured; that the injury was caused by violent criminals, rather than by accident; that the armed criminals still were present at that location; and that, by dispatching police officers to that site without sufficient information or misinformation as to the facts, those officers were more likely to come in contact with one of those armed criminals. Cf. <em>Beltran </em>v. <em>El Paso, </em>supra, 367 F.3d 308 (no deliberate indifference by 911 operator when operator had no reason to know that caller\u2019s life was in imminent danger); <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Trumbull County Sheriffs\u2019 Dept., </em>63 F. Sup. 2d 851, 854 (N.D. Ohio 1999) (no substantive due process claim regarding response to 911 call when victim did not indicate in her call that she was facing immediate risk of harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Similarly, the actions of Madore and Rataic do not indicate that they appreciated and disregarded a serious risk to the decedent\u2019s safety that night. Madore and Rataic merely relayed the facts that Learned had input into the dispatch screen, but never questioned Learned\u2019s coding of the call as high priority. To the extent that they erroneously informed the decedent that Myers wished to be seen, they were not aware of sufficient facts from which we can impute to them the knowledge that by doing so they would be directing the decedent toward a dangerous situation. Compare <em>Monfils </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>165 F.3d 511, 514-17 (7th Cir. 1998) (recognizing viable state created danger claim when police ignored decedent\u2019s request not to release tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>of his anonymous tip regarding coworker\u2019s criminal activity despite decedent\u2019s expressed fear of violent retaliation); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Ostrander, </em>879 F.2d 583, 588 (9th Cir. 1989) (recognizing claim for state created danger under deliberate indifference standard when police officer stranded female passenger of drunk driver in known high crime area by arresting driver and taking car keys and passenger thereafter was raped).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Finally, turning to the supervisory liability claim against Shay, \u201ca supervisor may be found liable for his deliberate indifference to the rights of others by his failure to act on information indicating unconstitutional acts were occurring or for his gross negligence in failing to supervise his subordinates who commit such wrongful acts, provided that the plaintiff can show an affirmative causal link between the supervisor\u2019s inaction and [the] injury.\u201d <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>282 F.3d 123, 140 (2d Cir. 2002); accord <em>Hayut </em>v. <em>State University of New York, </em>352 F.3d 733, 753 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting that claim requires supervisor\u2019s personal involvement in challenged conduct by direct participation or \u201cofficial\u2019s [1] failure to take corrective action after learning of a subordinate\u2019s unlawful conduct, [2] creation of a policy or custom fostering the unlawful conduct, [3] gross negligence in supervising subordinates who commit unlawful acts, or [4] deliberate indifference to the rights of others by failing to act on information regarding the unlawful conduct of subordinates\u201d). Although there is a question of fact as to whether there is a causal link between Shay\u2019s failure to institute certain policies and procedures in the dispatch department and the misinformation conveyed to the decedent, our conclusion that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment as to the claims against Shay\u2019s subordinates, and thus that no constitutional violation occurred, precludes a claim of supervisory liability against Shay. Moreover, although <em>Collins </em>is not directly relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>because it specifically addressed municipal liability, we note that the facts that the <em>Collins </em>court concluded were not sufficiently egregious evidenced a greater level of culpability than was present here. In <em>Collins, </em>the defendant city was on notice of the precise risk of harm by a strikingly similar prior accident involving the decedent\u2019s supervisor. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>supra, 503 U.S. 118 n.1. Here, there is no evidence or allegations of prior injuries arising from the mishandling of 911 calls or even of prior incidents in which an actual risk had been created from the mishandling of calls and, therefore, no basis from which to conclude that Shay was deliberately indifferent to wrongful or unconstitutional conduct. See <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>supra, 140, and cases cited therein. To the extent that Shay improperly may have attempted to influence the outcome of investigations into the events leading to the decedent\u2019s death, which would suggest that he thought that the police department had not handled the situation properly, Shay\u2019s post hoc recognition of his department\u2019s shortcomings also do not meet the requisite level of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We are mindful that the defendants\u2019 failure to provide the decedent with complete and accurate information impeded his ability to assess the incident effectively and to avoid the ambush awaiting him. The defendants\u2019 acts and omissions, however, do not meet the stringent standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court. Indeed, the nature of 911 dispatch work strongly counsels against imposing liability except where the conduct is extraordinarily egregious because the job routinely requires dispatching officers into dangerous and even potentially deadly situations. We do not intend to suggest that negligence, whether gross or minimal, should be tolerated when life and limb are at risk. Our law enforcement officials face great enough potential for harm at the hands of violent criminals without saddling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>them with the additional risk that their coworkers\u2019 actions may impair the officers\u2019 ability to protect themselves from harm. Nonetheless, we must be mindful of <em>Lewis\u2019 </em>admonition that \u201conly the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 523 U.S. 846. The defendants\u2019 conduct cannot be deemed sufficient. Therefore, the trial court properly rendered summary judgment for the defendants on the substantive due process claims under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We next turn to the plaintiffs claims seeking common-law damages for substantive due process violations under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that the state constitution provides greater due process rights than its federal counterpart. In support of this contention, the plaintiff invokes arguments as to federalism and this court\u2019s inherent authority to construe the state constitution as providing more expansive rights than federal law. The defendants contend that we should not review this claim because the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate how the protections under the Connecticut constitution would be more expansive than under federal law. They further contend that, should we review the claim, the plaintiff nevertheless cannot prevail under our case law in which this court previously has declined to recognize a direct cause of action under article first, \u00a7 8. We conclude that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the analytical framework necessary to establish independent rights under the state constitution. Accordingly, his claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>As we previously have stated, the plaintiff \u201csuggests that article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution provides even greater protection than its federal counterpart, but he fails to provide an adequate legal analysis of the basis of this claim. We decline to reach the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim . . . because it was inadequately briefed pursuant to the standard this court enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).

Notably, although we did not refer expressly to the <em>Geisler </em>test in those decisions, our analysis in the two earlier cases cited by the plaintiff reflects extensive discussions beyond this court\u2019s case law to federal precedent, jurisprudence of our sister states and the historical approach to such claims. See <em>Binette </em>v. <em>Sabo, </em>244 Conn. 23, 35-48, 710 A.2d 688 (1998); <em>Kelley Property Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>226 Conn. 314, 330-42, 627 A.2d 909 (1993). In the most recent case, <em>ATC Partnership </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>251 Conn. 597, 741 A.2d 305 (1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1214, 120 S. Ct. 2217, 147 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2000), we did not analyze the <em>Geisler </em>factors because we concluded that the plaintiffs claim was \u201cindistinguishable from that which we found insufficient to warrant constitutional protection in <em>Kelley Property Development, Inc.\u201d </em>and thus there was no need to engage in such analysis. <em>ATC Partnership </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>supra, 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Moreover, to the extent that the plaintiff has analyzed the issue, he has provided us with nothing more than a case that stands for the general proposition that we may recognize broader protections under the state constitution, cases in which we specifically declined to recognize more expansive due process rights under our constitution and arguments as to why the workers\u2019 compensation scheme would not <em>preclude </em>our recognition of such rights. Therefore, even if we were inclined to consider his claim, he has offered us no case law or other authoritative support weighing in favor of his proposition that we should recognize more expansive state constitutional rights than those afforded under the federal constitution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>254 Conn. 578, 599, 758 A.2d 327 (2000) (rejecting for similar reasons plaintiffs equal protection claim). Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim that the state constitution affords <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>greater substantive due process than the federal constitution is inadequately briefed to warrant further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\"> Also named as defendants were the town of East Hartford (town), John Doe No. 1, Alex Sostre, Nancy Forty, Erika Vilchel and Jose Gonzalez.

That ruling is not at issue in this appeal, and Sostre, Forty, Vilchel and Gonzalez are not parties to this appeal. Although the motion for summary judgment was granted as to the defendant John Doe 1 also, absent any identification as to this individual, references in this opinion to the defendants are to Shay, Learned, Madore and Rataic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\"> Rataic issued the following communication: \u201cOn a check welfare at 454 Main Street, Apartment 5\u2014454 Main Street, Apartment 5, complainant Mark Ryers reports he heard a loud noise and someone yelling.

Although it is not entirely clear from the record what the \u201ccheck welfare\u201d classification specifically indicates, police officers interviewed as part of an investigation into the circumstances leading to the decedent\u2019s death inferred from the substance of the dispatch that it was a noise complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\"> Our opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 115-18, 802 A.2d 754 (2002), sets forth in some detail the events underlying this action and the criminal charges filed by the state against Sostre.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we thereafter transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\"> The federal due process clause provides in relevant part: \u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d U.S. Const., amend.

Ct. 553, 62 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980). In <em>Martinez, </em>the court held that the murder of a fifteen year old girl by a parolee five months after his release from prison did not subject the state parole board to liability under \u00a7 1983. Id., 280-81, 285. The court concluded that the actions of the state did not deprive the victim of a constitutionally protected right. Id., 285. The court reasoned that the parolee was not an agent of the state, the parole board did not know that the decedent, as distinguished from the public at large, faced any special danger, and the death was too remote a consequence of the parole board\u2019s action to hold them responsible under the federal civil rights law. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b156-5\"> Most courts have construed the special relationship exception narrowly to require that the government actually have taken custody of, or imposed restraint on, the victim. See, e.g., <em>Sargi </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>70 F.3d 907, <em>910-11 </em>(6th Cir. 1995) (\u201c[a] special relationship can only arise when the state restrains an individual\u201d); <em>Pinder </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>54 F.3d 1169, 1175 (4th Cir.)

Ct. 530, 133 L. Ed. 2d 436 (1995). A few cases have suggested that, under certain facts, a more expansive view of the exception may apply. See, e.g., <em>James </em>v. <em>Meow Media, Inc., </em>300 F.3d 683, 694 (6th Cir. 2002) (\u201cThis duty to protect can be triggered by placing the putative plaintiff in custody or by taking other affirmative steps that disable the plaintiff from protecting himself against third-party intentional criminal acts. Of course, a special relationship can be created by a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant\u201d), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1159, 123 S. Ct. 967, 154 L. Ed. 2d 893 (2003); see also <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 201 n.9 (raising issue but expressing no view on whether government\u2019s placement of child in foster home would present \u201ca situation sufficiently analogous to incarceration or institutionalization to give rise to an affirmative duty to protect\u201d). In the present case, the plaintiff does not allege that the decedent was dependent to such a degree on the information he received from the dispatchers that these circumstances gave rise to a special relationship imposing a duty to protect him, and we, therefore, express no view as to the merits of such a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> In the following cases, the circuit courts indicated that they had recognized both the special relationship and state created danger theories following De<em>Shaney: Velez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Vega-Irizarry, </em>421 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 2005); <em>Schroder </em>v. <em>Fort Thomas, </em>412 F.3d 724, 727 (6th Cir. 2005); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>381 F.3d 771, 773 (8th Cir. 2004); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Emergency Medical Services Training Institute, </em>318 F.3d 473, 478-79 (3d Cir. 2003); <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Castle Rock, </em>307 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir. 2002), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 545 U.S. 748, 125 S.

The Fifth and Fourth Circuits have recognized the special relationship exception, but generally have not recognized the state created danger exception. See <em>Beltran </em>v. <em>El Paso, </em>367 F.3d 299, 307 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting that \u201c[t]his court has consistently refused to recognize a \u2018state-created danger\u2019 theory of \u00a7 1983 liability\u201d); <em>Pinder v.

Compare, e.g., <em>Schroder </em>v. <em>Fort Thomas, </em>412 F.3d 724, 728 (6th Cir. 2005); <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Ridgefield, </em>411 F.3d 1134, 1142 (9th Cir. 2005); <em>Christiansen </em>v. <em>Tulsa, </em>supra, 332 F.3d 1281; <em>Schieber </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>supra, 320 F.3d 416-17.

March 12, 2002); relying on the reasoning of the other district court decisions as support for such a conclusion. Id. Notably, on appeal, the Third Circuit declined to decide whether this conclusion was correct, affirming on an alternative ground, and thus clearly left open the question of whether that circuit would preclude such claims as a matter of law. See <em>Pahler </em>v. <em>Wilkes-Barre, </em>supra, 31 Fed. Appx. 71 (\u201cwe need not decide whether the \u2018state created danger\u2019 theory applies to a police officer\u201d).

May 14, 1993), wherein the court rejected a claim by a law enforcement officer asserting a claim for state created danger, that court, subsequently permitted a claim on the basis of an increased danger to the officer, but did so under circumstances that did not implicate the assumed dangers rationale discussed in <em>Walls. </em>See <em>Kallstrom </em>v. <em>Columbus, </em>136 F.3d 1055, 1064 (6th Cir. 1998) (addressing whether undercover police officers could state constitutional claim for disclosure of personal information in their personnel files).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> We, therefore, reject the defendants\u2019 contention that claims by public employees are barred absent a showing of an intent to harm.
