Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the department is not statutorily authorized to consider: (1) the individual test score components, rather than the combined, full scale score; (2) intelligence tests previously taken by the plaintiff; and (3) whether the plaintiffs psychiatric disorders may have affected his test scores. We conclude that the defendant did not exceed his statutory authority and that the decision denying the plaintiffs application was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In 2002, the plaintiff was fifteen years old and attending public high school, where he was receiving special education services. In January, 2002, a school psychologist administered to the plaintiff several tests, including a Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2014III Edition (WISC-III test).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That test yielded the following intelligence quotient (IQ) scores: a verbal IQ of eighty, a performance IQ of fifty-seven and a combined, full scale IQ of sixty-six. A general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>IQ below seventy is considered indicative of mental retardation. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 1-lg (b) (defining mental retardation in part to require \u201can intelligence quotient more than two standard deviations below the mean for the test\u201d); see also American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed. 1994) pp. 39-40. On the basis of that test and other evidence indicating that the plaintiffs adaptive behavior was deficient, James R. applied to the defendant for services for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Thereafter, pursuant to the department\u2019s regulations; see Regs,, Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-212-2; two of the department\u2019s psychologists reviewed the plaintiffs file to make an initial determination of eligibility. One of those psychologists, H. Steven Zuckerman, thereafter notified James R. that the department had determined that the plaintiff did not meet the statutory definition of mentally retarded and, therefore, was not eligible for services. Zuckerman noted that this determination was based on the disparity between the plaintiffs verbal and performance scores on the 2002 WISC-III test and on other tests on which the plaintiff previously had scored within a normal or average range, beginning at age eight. To contest that determination, the plaintiff thereafter invoked his right, under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-210 (d), to a hearing. At the hearing, James R. argued that the plaintiffs IQ scores and adaptive behavior scores supported a diagnosis consistent with the department\u2019s eligibility criteria. He testified regarding the plaintiffs lack of self-direction and offered evidence regarding the plaintiffs day-to-day dependence on family and school professionals. Zuckerman, who testified for the department, agreed that the plaintiff had numerous support needs, but contended that there was formal documentation that the plaintiffs verbal cognitive abilities had been in the low normal to normal range since age eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>After considering the testimony and the considerable documentary evidence, including prior intelligence tests and psychological, medical and social evaluations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the department\u2019s hearing officer issued a proposed decision concluding that the plaintiff was ineligible for services. Specifically, with respect to the adaptive behavior criterion for eligibility, the hearing officer found that the plaintiffs behavior consistently had been in the requisite deficit range. The hearing officer further found, however, that this adaptive behavior deficit was not accompanied by the required statutory subaverage general intellectual ability. In support of the latter conclusion, the hearing officer found that: (1) only one intelligence test out of several such tests that the plaintiff had taken\u2014the 2002 WISC-III test\u2014 resulted in an IQ score in the range of mental retardation; (2) although the 2002 test reflected full scale and performance scores in the mental retardation range, it was more likely that the verbal score was a more accurate reflection of the plaintiffs intellectual level; and (3) there was an absence of any formal diagnostic reference to mental retardation by any of the medical, psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>chological or educational professionals who had evaluated the plaintiff, but who instead vaxyingly had diagnosed the plaintiff as having a learning disability, obsessive compulsive disorder and pervasive developmental disorder.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among the evidence cited in support of these findings, the hearing officer noted that the school psychologist who had administered the plaintiffs January, 2002 triennial evaluation; see footnote 4 of this opinion; had opined that certain of the plaintiffs low test scores were consistent with persons having these disorders. The hearing officer recognized that the evidence also indicated that the plaintiff has numerous difficulties and complex needs, but concluded that mental retardation was not the cause of those problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the proposed decision to the defendant, requesting that the defendant either reverse that decision or schedule another hearing so that the plaintiff could present additional evidence. After reviewing the record, the defendant issued a final decision notifying the plaintiff that he concurred with the hearing officer\u2019s decision denying eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff appealed from the defendant\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, which sustained the appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>examined the statutory scheme, specifically, the definition of mental retardation under \u00a7 1-lg and the legislature\u2019s grant of authority to the defendant under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-212<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to promulgate regulations establishing eligibility criteria for the department\u2019s services. The court concluded that the authority vested in the defendant did not allow it to restrict the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the definition of mental retardation. In the trial court\u2019s view, \u00a7 1-lg required the defendant to find an applicant eligible lor services if: (1) that applicant had submitted a <em>single, </em>properly administered IQ test with a full scale score below seventy; (2) his intellectual deficiency existed concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior; and (3) these deficiencies manifested before the applicant reached age eighteen. The court reasoned that, within these requirements, the defendant has discretion in assessing whether a particular type of test would provide an acceptable measure of general intelligence and in assessing an applicant\u2019s adaptive behavior. The court noted that these elements were not in dispute in the present case. The court further reasoned that, when a general intelligence test score complies with the statutory requirements, the defendant does not have discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>tion to consider any other evidence. Thus, it concluded that the department\u2019s \u201cpreference of the verbal IQ to the general IQ, exclusion of [the plaintiff] from the system because of coexisting mental disorders and reliance on the fact that [the plaintiff] had not previously been determined to be mentally retarded all exceeded the legal authority of [the department] . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that he had exceeded his statutory authority. Relying specifically on \u00a7 17a-212 and generally on \u00a7 1-lg, he contends that the legislature vested in him discretion to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility. The defendant further contends that, \u201cjudgment and interpretation are . . . required in the application of the definition [of mental retardation] when, as in this case, there are both mixed results on standardized intellectual testing, and the presence of confounding variables, diagnoses, and other factors [that] may artificially depress IQ scores.\u201d The defendant thus claims both that he did not abuse his discretion by considering the other intelligence test scores, the partial components of the tests and the effect that the plaintiffs mental disorders may have had on his test scores and that, in light of this evidence, his decision denying eligibility was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In response, the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 1-lg requires that the defendant deem an applicant eligible for services upon the submission of a single, appropriately administered general intelligence test with a full scale score below seventy. Therefore, according to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tiff, the trial court properly concluded that the defendant improperly had considered other tests and collateral matters. For substantially the same reasons stated by the defendant, we conclude that the trial court improperly sustained the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">According to our well established standards, \u201c[r]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. ... It is well settled [however] that we do not defer to the board\u2019s construction of a statute\u2014a question of law\u2014when, as in the present case, the [provisions] at issue previously ha[ve] not been subjected to judicial scrutiny or when the board\u2019s interpretation has not been time tested.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>JSF Promotions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>265 Conn. 413, 417-18, 828 A.2d 609 (2003). In such a case, our review of those provisions is plenary. Id., 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">As an initial matter, we note that, in framing his claim, the defendant relies principally on \u00a7 17a-212 as a broad source of discretion, allowing him to consider whatever evidence he deems relevant and to exercise his judgment accordingly in determining eligibility. We view the issue before us through a slightly different lens, however, in light of the nature of and relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 17a-212 and 1-lg. We therefore begin by briefly explaining that relationship as it bears on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The legislature first set forth the broad definition of \u201cmental retardation\u201d currently found in subsection (a) of \u00a7 1-lg in 1978. Public Acts 1978, No. 78-148, \u00a7 1. In 1982, the legislature amended the statute essentially to reflect its current form, adding subsection (b), which further defines terms used in the broad definition under subsection (a). Public Acts 1982, No. 82-51, \u00a7 1. At that time, the legislature also limited the application of the definition set forth therein to specified provisions in the General Statutes. The only such enumerated provisions that apply to the department address voluntary and involuntary admissions to facilities for persons with mental retardation. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 1-lg (a) (providing that definition of mental retardation set forth therein applies to, inter alia, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-274 and 17a-281). Thus, by its own terms, \u00a7 1-1 does not apply to the department\u2019s decisions regarding eligibility for services. Nonetheless, it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>from the record that the department informally applied the three part definition of mental retardation under \u00a7 1-lg\u2014considering intellectual functioning, adaptive behavior and age\u2014to its eligibility decisions as of at least January, 1990. See Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, January, 1990 Management Audit: Department of Mental Retardation, pp. 8-9 (1990 Management Audit).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">In 1990, the legislature enacted \u00a7 17a-212. See Public Acts 1990, No. 90-164, \u00a7 2. It therein directed the defendant to promulgate regulations setting forth specific criteria for, inter alia, determining eligibility for the department\u2019s services.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id. No other provision in the General Statutes addresses eligibility for such services. In response to that directive, in 1991, the defendant promulgated a regulation generally requiring that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>applicant for services be a resident of the state and a person with mental retardation; see Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-212-2 (b); defining that term to mean \u201cmental retardation as defined in [\u00a7] 1-lg . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., \u00a7 17a-212-l (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Thus, although the defendant was not mandated statutorily to determine eligibility in accordance with \u00a7 1-lg, the defendant necessarily assumed such an obligation by adopting a regulation that incorporated the statutory definition of mental retardation. We, therefore, do not view the issue as whether the defendant is authorized under \u00a7 17a-212 to consider any evidence that could be relevant in assessing general intellectual functioning. Rather, we view the threshold issue before us as whether, consistent with \u00a7 1-lg, the defendant may consider more than one general intelligence test to determine whether an applicant is mentally retarded and, therefore, is eligible for the department\u2019s services. If so, we then consider whether the defendant exceeded his authority by considering evidence other than the general intelligence test full scale scores when confronted with conflicting results.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, we must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>sider whether, in light of the evidence properly before the department, there is substantial evidence to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Turning to the threshold question, therefore, we consider whether \u00a7 1-lg authorizes the defendant to consider more than one intelligence test. \u201cWe approach this question according to well established principles of statutoiy construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, [and] to the legislative policy it was designed to implement . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>257 Conn. 258, 270, 777 A.2d 645 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Section 1-lg defines mental retardation as \u201csignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 1-lg (a). That section further defines \u201c \u2018general intellectual functioning\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe results obtained by assessment with <em>one or more of the individually administered general intelligence </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>tests </em>developed for that propose and standardized on a significantly adequate population and administered by a person or persons formally trained in test administration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 1-lg (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In determining the meaning of \u00a7 1-lg, we are guided by certain fundamental rules of statutory construction. \u201c[Statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Semerzakis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>274 Conn. 1, 18, 873 A.2d 911 (2005). By construing the phrase \u201cone or more\u201d to mean that <em>more than one </em>general intelligence test should be considered, if available, we give effect to each word in the statute. By contrast, in order to adopt a construction under which an applicant must be deemed mentally retarded upon submitting one test with a full scale score below seventy, irrespective of other test scores\u2014-we would have to read words \u201cor more\u201d out of the statute. Indeed, we essentially would have to read the phrase as if it stated \u201cat least one\u201d general intelligence test, instead of \u201cone or more\u201d intelligence tests. This court, however, will not substitute language for that chosen by the legislature. See <em>Echavarria </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>275 Conn. 408, 416-17, 880 A.2d 882 (2005) (\u201c[t]he court . . . cannot read something into a statute . . . nor can it substitute its judgment of what would constitute a wiser provision for the clearly expressed intent of the legislature\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Laliberte </em>v. <em>United Security, Inc., </em>261 Conn. 181, 186, 801 A.2d 783 (2002) (\u201c[w]e are bound to interpret legislative intent by referring to what the legislative text contains, not by what it might have contained\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Moreover, \u201c[i]n construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>and rational result was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>268 Conn. 541, 550, 848 A.2d 352 (2004). Consider, therefore, a hypothetical situation in which an applicant has taken four general intelligence tests over a period of several years, with the three most recent tests reflecting full scale scores of ninety, and the earliest test reflecting a full scale score of sixty-nine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It would be illogical to require that the department deem an applicant eligible for services, as the plaintiff contends, simply because of one anomalous test score.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Although there is no legislative history that directly bears on this issue, it is noteworthy that comments during the debate on the 1982 bill adding subsection (b) to \u00a7 1-lg indicate that the legislature intended to clarify and narrow the definition of mental retardation to ensure that persons with borderline normal intelligence were not classified as mentally retarded, to prevent inappropriate commitment of such persons to mental retardation facilities and to ensure that limited administrative resources were devoted to those most in need. See 25 H. Proc., Pt. 2, 1982 Sess., pp. 408-10, 413-14. Interpreting \u00a7 1-lg to allow consideration of all intelligence tests that meet the statutory criteria best furthers those purposes. Moreover, mindful that this definition applies to other statutes; see footnote 2 of this opinion; we are persuaded that this interpretation reasonably may be applied in those contexts as well. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant did not exceed his authority when considering all available general intelligence tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We note that the record is not entirely clear as to which of the several tests in the record the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>deemed, in accordance with \u00a7 1-lg, \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d tests, namely, a test developed for the purpose of assessing general intelligence that has been standardized on a significantly adequate population. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 1-lg (b). \u201cAttachment A\u201d to the defendant\u2019s eligibility criteria,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> however, explains that \u201c[t]ypical IQ tests that can be considered include the Stanford-Binet Test of Intelligence, and the [WISC-III] . . . .\u2019\u2019Of those two types of tests, the record includes two WISC-III tests administered to the plaintiff, one administered in 2002 and one administered in 1997. As we have noted previously, the 2002 test resulted in a full scale score of sixty-six, a verbal score of eighty and a performance scale of fifty-seven. The 1997 test resulted in a full scale score of seventy-three, a verbal score of eighty-two and a performance score of sixty-nine. Although the full scale scores on the two tests differed by a mere seven points, under \u00a7 1-lg that difference has enormous significance in terms of qualifying for the department\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Thus, the defendant was confronted with conflicting tests results\u2014one test with a full scale score below seventy, indicating significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning consistent with mental retardation under \u00a7 1-lg, and another test with a full scale score higher than seventy, indicating functioning above that level.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant does not take the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>that all of an applicant\u2019s general intelligence tests must meet the statutory criteria to be eligible for services. See footnote 13 of this opinion. We, therefore, consider whether, when faced with conflicting indications of the plaintiffs general intellectual functioning, the defendant exceeded his authority by considering other evidence. We conclude that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Faced with such conflicting scores, the defendant necessarily was required to make a determination as to whether the plaintiffs general intellectual functioning was in fact significantly subaverage. Nothing in the statutes or regulations limits the defendant\u2019s discretion in this regard, and the defendant is especially qualified to make such a deteimination. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-210 (prescribing defendant\u2019s qualifications and duties); General Statutes \u00a7 17a-212 (conferring on defendant authority to determine criteria for eligibility). Indeed, we generally defer to an agency with expertise in matters requiring such a technical, case-by-case determination. See <em>MacDermid, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>257 Conn. 128, 139, 778 A.2d 7 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">As we have noted previously, such a factual determination must be sustained if it is reasonably supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole. <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>255 Conn. 651, 658-59, 774 A.2d 957 (2001). \u201cThis so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied in judicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . The reviewing court must take into account [that there is] contradictory evidence in the record . . . but the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation &amp; Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>269 Conn. 57, 70, 848 A.2d 395 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Turning to that evidence, we note that Virginia Wohlstrom, the school psychologist who administered the 2002 WISC-III test highlighted several issues regarding the test results that reasonably were interpreted by the defendant to indicate that the 2002 full scale score understated the plaintiffs general intelligence. Wohlstrom concluded that the plaintiffs low performance score was reflective more of the fact that it took the plaintiff an excessive amount of time to complete his work, than that he actually was performing in the intellectually deficient range. She also noted that the plaintiffs verbal score was skewed downward because of a significantly weak score in a subtest measuring comprehension. Wohlstrom opined that the plaintiffs pervasive developmental disorder affected that score, and concluded that \u201c[the plaintiffs] verbal functioning in non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>social situations, such as the classroom, is in the [average range.\u201d Wohlstrom also noted that the plaintiff was functioning at the upper level of his classes, typically getting B grades.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Additionally, Wohlstrom\u2019s assessment\u2014that the plaintiffs ability to function at a general intellectual level was higher than his full scale score of sixty-six\u2014 was consistent with other, earlier intelligence tests. A 1994 Kaufman test; see footnote 4 of this opinion; which is scored differently than the WISC-III test, was correlated to the more traditional intelligence tests to result in a \u201cglobal intelligence\u201d score of ninety-four, a verbal intelligence score of eighty-nine and a nonverbal intelligence score of ninety-three. See footnote 17 of this opinion. The Yale Child Study Center, which had administered the Kaufman test, classified the results as reflecting an overall intelligence score within the average range. In a 1998 social and cultural assessment, the plaintiff achieved a score of 103 on a Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-2, which is within the average range.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In his initial determination of ineligibility, Zuckerman, the department\u2019s psychologist, pointed to the plaintiffs 1994 Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, on which the plaintiff scored in the normal range. According to Zuckerman, that test has greater than a 0.8 correlation to the WISC-III test. Zuckerman also found the plaintiffs average score on his 1998 Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-2 to be significant because, when that score was coupled with the plaintiffs verbal score of eighty on the 2002 WISC-III test and certain subtests within that verbal score that were within the low normal to normal range, \u201cit is clear that [the plaintiffs] overall cognitive abilities are above what would be considered the mental retardation level.\u201d The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>presented no evidence to rebut Zuckerman\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The defendant\u2019s decision to examine separately the verbal and performance scores, as well as subtests within those scores, is supported by an authoritative reference book on mental disorders submitted by the plaintiff. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, supra, p. 40, provides: \u201cWhen there is significant scatter in the subtest scores, the profile of strengths and weaknesses, rather than the mathematically derived full-scale IQ, will more accurately reflect the person\u2019s learning abilities. When there is a marked discrepancy across verbal and performance scores, averaging to obtain a full-scale IQ score can be misleading.\u201d Consistent with that assessment, Michael Westerveld, the clinical neuropsychologist at the Yale University School of Medicine who had administered the plaintiffs 1997 WISC-III test, found the broad disparity between the plaintiffs verbal and performance scores to be clinically significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The record also reflected several psychological, social and medical evaluations over the years that varyingly had diagnosed the plaintiff as learning disabled, having pervasive developmental disorder and having obsessive compulsive disorder. In addition to Wohlstrom\u2019s 2002 assessment that one of these disorders may have impacted the plaintiffs test scores, Westerveld\u2019s 1997 assessment opined that the plaintiffs pervasive developmental disorder and his difficult social situation likely were factors in his decline in scores from prior evaluations. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court recognized that the record reflected that these disorders might have affected adversely the plaintiffs performance IQ, but concluded that the defendant lacked authority to consider such evidence. For the reasons previously set forth, it is clear that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>dant in fact properly could have relied on such evidence under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Moreover, although clearly not dispositive evidence in and of itself, the defendant was entitled to consider the absence of any reference to mental retardation in these numerous and wide-ranging evaluations. Notably, Zuckerman testified that he found this absence significant. The defendant was free therefore to infer, by their lack of reference to mental retardation, that none of the professionals conducting those evaluations had concluded that mental retardation was causative of the plaintiffs deficiencies. Although the plaintiff contends that such an inference was not reasonable given that the tests were not performed specifically to diagnose mental retardation, he did not submit evidence to demonstrate that the method by which the diagnoses were obtained necessarily would not have considered mental retardation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Similarly, the plaintiff objects to this inference because \u201csome schools may prefer the label \u2018learning disabled\u2019 to \u2018mental retardation\u2019 believing \u2018learning disabled\u2019 is less stigmatizing.\u201d That assertion may well be true, but the plaintiff did not submit evidence to the defendant indicating that the evaluators who actually performed the assessments used the terms learning dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>abled or language delayed as a proxy for mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We recognize that the defendant\u2019s regulations may not have put the plaintiff on notice that the department might draw such adverse inferences, but the plaintiff did not avail himself of remedies to supplement the record in that regard. See footnote 6 of this opinion. We further note that the evidence that the plaintiff has submitted to this court in support of his broader proposition that the stigmatizing effect of the label \u201cmentally retarded\u201d may prompt some professionals to avoid that term does not compel a contrary inference. Indeed, it must be emphasized that the plaintiff had the burden of establishing that he met the requirements of eligibility for the department\u2019s services. See <em>Matarazzo </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>225 Conn. 314, 323, 623 A.2d 470 (1993) (stating general rule that party seeking benefit ordinarily bears burden of establishing eligibility for such benefits), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>237 Conn. 550, 571, 680 A.2d 113 (1996); <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>North Haven, </em>206 Conn. 1, 2-3, 535 A.2d 1303 (1988) (same). Finally, we note that we do not question that the plaintiff has needs that could be served by the department and that even his 1997 WTSC-HI test indicates borderline intelligence. The legislature, however, delegated to the defendant a gatekeeping function through his authority to determine eligibility. In close cases like the present one, the defendant and the department\u2019s expert staff are better qualified than a court to evaluate conflicting evidence to determine whether that threshold has been met. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> The plaintiff filed a motion to seal the record submitted to this court in light of his privacy interest in psychological and medical evaluations contained therein.

The only evidence the defendant has submitted to this court that could support his contention, however, are two Superior Court cases that reflect that the department considered in those cases the same kind of evidence it considered in the present case\u2014 multiple test scores, test score components and collateral evaluations. Two isolated cases do not indicate a time tested interpretation. Cf. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Municipal Employees Assn., </em>259 Conn. 251, 268, 788 A.2d 60 (2002) (deferring to board of labor relations\u2019 interpretation to resolve possible ambiguity when board had presented evidence of consistent interpretation of statute for more than twenty-five years). Moreover, we do not consider these two cases cited by the defendant to constitute the kind of judicial scrutiny that similarly could require deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation. In neither case did the court employ the full panoply of tools of statutory construction, a threshold requirement to warrant such deference. Furthermore, we question whether it would be appropriate in any event to defer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>to the department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1-lg because the reach of that statute extends beyond the department to other agencies and to civil and criminal statutes.

See <em>Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>273 Conn. 240, 250-51 n.13, 869 A.2d 611 (2005). Neither party points to any statutory language that plainly and unambiguously addresses the issue in this appeal. Indeed, the meaning of the language on which we do rely in \u00a7 1-lg\u2014 addressing \u201cone or more\u201d tests\u2014only becomes evident after applying our rules of statutory construction and considering the legislative history. Therefore, we are free to turn to extratextual sources when examining the meaning of \u00a7 1-lg as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> Apparently, it is not uncommon for persons seeking the department\u2019s services to have taken several intelligence tests. See, e.g., <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>O\u2019Meara, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV00499604 (April 30, 2001) (discussing four intelligence tests taken by that plaintiff).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> Attachment A appears from the record to be one of several documents that the department provides to applicants seeking to be deemed eligible for services, in which the department sets forth information as to the approval process. The defendant has described this document as merely explanatory, and we do not ascribe the legal significance to this document that would be given to a duly promulgated regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> The record also includes another test that possibly could have been considered by the department to be an appropriate general intelligence test\u2014the 1994 Kaufman test. See footnote 4 of this opinion. The results of that test reflect that, although it is scored differently than the WISC-III test, the Kaufman test resulted in a \u201cglobal\u201d intelligence score, a verbal intelligence score and a nonverbal intelligence score. The Yale Child Study Center, which had administered the 1994 Kaufman test, indicated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>test results had yielded a general mental processing score equivalent to an IQ score and classified the results as reflecting an overall intelligence score within the average range. Because, however, there is no finding indicating that the Kaufman test was considered by the defendant a general intelligence test in accordance with \u00a7 1-lg, and the defendant does not list that test in the examples of such acceptable tests in attachment A to its eligibility criteria, we do not ascribe that level of significance to this test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\"> Because the trial court concluded that the defendant had exceeded his authority under \u00a7 1-lg, it did not reach the issue of whether there was substantial evidence to support the defendant\u2019s finding that the plaintiff did not have significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. Nonetheless, we decide this issue because it presents a question of law and the record on appeal before us is the same as the one before the trial court. See <em>Dark-Eyes </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>276 Conn. 559, 569 n.10, 887 A.2d 848 (2006) (\u201c[u]nder circumstances where the record presents the entire proceedings before the trial court, the question is essentially one of law, and we are in no different position than we would be in had the trial court answered it\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> Wohlstrom\u2019s evaluation indicates that two of the plaintiffs classes were special education classes, but that the rest were mainstream classes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b637-5\"> The brief of the amici, Connecticut Legal Services, Inc., the Connecticut Chapter of the American Association on Mental Retardation, Inc., and Arc/ Connecticut, filed in support of the plaintiff, asserts that pervasive developmental disorder commonly is an associated disorder with mental retardation and cites to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as support for that proposition. That manual provides that \u201c [pervasive developmental] disorders . . . are often associated with some degree of [m]ental [r]etardation . . . .\u201d Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, supra, p. 65. Although that evidence could support a conclusion that mental retardation, rather than or as well as pervasive developmental disorder, affected the plaintiffs test scores, it also could support the conclusion that a professional rendering a diagnosis of that disorder also would be likely to note the presence of mental retardation. In the absence of expert testimony, we cannot say that the defendant improperly reached the latter conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
