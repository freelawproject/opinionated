We reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In January, 2000, the New Britain police department initiated an undercover investigation into possible criminal violations of state child pornography laws over the Internet. In particular, on January 4, 2000, Detective James Wardwell assumed the persona of a thirteen year old girl and, using the screen name \u201cDanuta333,\u201d entered an America Online (AOL) chat room entitled, \u201cI Love Much Older Men.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The AOL profile that Wardwell had created identified Danuta333 as a thirteen year old female from Connecticut. After staying in the chat room for less than one minute, Wardwell exited the chat room without initiating contact with any other AOL user. Less than one minute after exiting the chat room, however, Wardwell received an instant message* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> from an individual, subsequently identified as the defendant, using the screen name \u201cJoeSkotr.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201cJoeSkotr: Hello</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ9\">\u201cDanuta333: hi there</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlV\">\u201cJoeSkotr: From CT?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">\u201cDanuta333: yeah, u?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\u201cJoeSkotr: 42 male from Mass</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArZ\">\u201cDanuta333: that\u2019s close to me, kind of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALa\">\u201cJoeSkotr: My age an issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201cDanuta333: is mine??????????</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">\u201cJoeSkotr: No\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Thereafter, the defendant asked Danuta333 if she had ever \u201c[b]een with someone [his] age,\u201d and whether she had a photograph that she could send him. The defendant also asked, \u201c[h]ow old are you again?\u201d Danuta333 replied, \u201c13.\u201d The defendant then inquired extensively about Danuta333\u2019s prior sexual experience. When Danuta333 asked \u201cwhy all the questions???\u201d the defendant replied, \u201cI wanted to see if you had the experience I want . . . .\u201d During this first interaction, the defendant and Danuta333 covered a range of sexually explicit topics, including a discussion of Danuta333\u2019s experience with cunnilingus and fellatio and the defendant\u2019s preferences regarding the same, as well as Danuta333\u2019s breast size. Approximately midway through the conversation,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the defendant asked Danuta333 if she wanted to meet him, and the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">\u201cJoeSkotr: How about next week . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">\u201cDanuta333: maybe that will work, how?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201cJoeSkotr: E-mail me with the day that is best. I can do it during the day if that helps ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cDanuta333: ok, but i am 13, i don\u2019t drive\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">A discussion of potential meeting places followed, during which Danuta333 noted that she had \u201cschool and stuff and no car ride . . . .\u201d Danuta333 ended the conversation after the defendant had instructed her to e-mail him with the name of a hotel where they could meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">From approximately January 4, 2000, until March 13, 2000, the defendant and Danuta333 engaged in between twenty and thirty online conversations, the majority of which were sexually explicit in nature. During this period, the defendant e-mailed Danuta333 several still images depicting females of a variety of ages, some of whom were engaged in sexual acts, as well as a video clip depicting an adult female holding ejaculate in her mouth and then swallowing it on command. The defendant represented to Danuta333 that two of the still images depicted a thirteen year old female. On several occasions, the defendant requested that Danuta333 send him a photograph of herself. Using law enforcement software, Wardwell created an image purporting to be a middle school yearbook photograph of Danuta333 and sent the image to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The defendant and Danuta333 eventually agreed to meet on March 8, 2000, at a donut shop in New Britain. During an online conversation on March 7, 2000, the defendant explained exactly what Danuta333 was to do for him sexually when she entered his van.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>8, 2000, the defendant traveled to Connecticut but went to the wrong donut shop. On March 9, 2000, the defendant and Danuta333 arranged a second meeting for March 14, 2000, at a shopping plaza in New Britain. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>that date, the defendant arrived at the shopping plaza as planned and, upon exiting his vehicle, was arrested by officers of the New Britain police department. After being advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rights, the defendant gave an oral statement to the police in which he admitted that, for several months, he had communicated over the Internet with \u201cDontra,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> whom he had met in a chat room. The defendant acknowledged that he had come to New Britain to meet her but stated that he had intended to tell her that he was just \u201cgoofing,\u201d and to thank her for speaking with him online.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The police obtained a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s vehicle. Upon executing the warrant, they found a Massachusetts Turnpike receipt dated March 14,2000, maps of New Britain, and a cellular- telephone with a number that corresponded to a number that the defendant had given Danuta333 in their online conversation the previous day. The vehicle also was equipped with a videocassette recorder containing a video entitled \u201c24 Hour Lip Service\u201d that was cued to a scene depicting an adult female performing fellatio on an adult male.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Later that day, the police also obtained and executed a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s home in Massachusetts. Police seized the defendant\u2019s computer, a search of which revealed evidence of electronic communications between JoeSkotr and Danuta333, the defendant\u2019s receipt of Wardwell\u2019s composite images of Danuta333 and the images that the defendant had sent to Danuta333. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s contention that attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) and 53a-49 (a) (2), and attempt to commit risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 and 53a-49 (a) (1) are not cognizable crimes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> With respect to the former offense, the defendant maintains that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) is a strict liability crime and, therefore, cannot be the subject of an attempt. With respect to the latter offense, the defendant contends that, because neither \u00a7 53-21 (1) nor \u00a7 53-21 (2) is a specific intent offense, they, too, cannot be the subject of an attempt. We reject the defendant\u2019s claims, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">To demonstrate a violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), sometimes referred to as statutory rape; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 553, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999); the state must establish that the accused engaged in sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>intercourse with a person who, at that time, was at least thirteen years of age but under sixteen years of age, and that the accused was more than two years older than the other person. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). \u201c[T]he only intent required for a violation of \u00a7 53a-71 is a general intent to perform the acts that constitute the offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 216, 514 A.2d 724 (1986); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Plude, </em>30 Conn. App. 527, 534-35, 621 A.2d 1342, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 923, 625 A.2d 824 (1993). In other words, \u201c[s]exual assault in the second degree is a general intent crime that requires only that the actor possess a general intent to perform the acts that constitute the elements of the offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>84 Conn. App. 749, 759 n.6, 854 A.2d 1133, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 935, 861 A.2d 511 (2004). Thus, under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), the state is not required to establish that the accused knew that the person with whom he had sexual intercourse was under the age of sixteen; the state must prove only that the accused knowingly engaged in sexual intercourse with a person who, in fact, had not attained the age of sixteen. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Plude, </em>supra, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2), \u201c[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . . intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d \u201cProof of an attempt to commit a specific offense requires proof that the actor intended to bring about the elements of the completed offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 316, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). Moreover, \u201cto be guilty of attempt, a defendant\u2019s conscious objective must be to cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>result which would constitute the substantive crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 528, 522 A.2d 277 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree is not a cognizable offense rests on his assertion that sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) \u201clooks and feels like a strict liability crime,\u201d that is, a crime for which no intent is necessary. Relying on his characterization of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) as a strict liability crime, the defendant argues, in essence, that an attempt to commit such a strict liability crime cannot be reconciled with the fact that, to prove attempt under \u00a7 53a-49, the state must establish that the defendant acted \u201cwith the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a); see 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law (2d Ed. 2003) \u00a7 11.3, p. 211 (\u201c[u]nder the prevailing view, an attempt . . . cannot be committed by recklessness or negligence or on a strict liability basis, even if the underlying crime can be so committed\u201d); see also 2 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 11.3 (c), p. 217 (expressing view that no sound policy reason exists for extending concept of strict liability to law of attempt).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument fails, however, because, as we have explained, the offense of sexual assault in the second degree is not a strict liability crime; rather, it is a general intent crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 216; <em>State </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 759 n.6; <em>State </em>v. <em>Plude, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 534-35. The fact that the state is not required to establish that the accused knew that his victim was under sixteen years of age does not transform the offense into a strict liability offense because the state still must establish that the accused had the general intent to have sexual intercourse with the victim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, we agree with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>courts that have addressed the issue that the crime of attempt to commit statutory rape is a recognized offense. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sines, </em>158 N.C. App. 79, 84, 579 S.E.2d 895, cert. denied, 357 N.C. 468, 587 S.E.2d 69 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chhom, </em>128 Wash. 2d 739, 744, 911 P.2d 1014 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brienzo, </em>267 Wis. 2d 349, 363-64, 671 N.W.2d 700 (2003). We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the crime of attempt to commit sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>assault in the second degree is not a cognizable offense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The defendant also contends that the offense of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child under either subdivision (1) or (2) of \u00a7 53-21 is not a cognizable crime because neither offense imposes a specific intent requirement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to the offense of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 (1) and 53a-49 (a) (1), the former of which prohibits, inter alia, a person from wilfully placing a child under the age of sixteen in such a situation that the child\u2019s health is likely to be injured or the child\u2019s morals are likely to be impaired. As this court previously has observed, that offense is a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>intent crime. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 240, 541 A.2d 96 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>85 Conn. App. 802, 809-10, 858 A.2d 892, cert. denied, 272 Conn. 908, 863 A.2d 702 (2004). Thus, \u201c[i]t is not necessary, to support a conviction under \u00a7 53-21, that the [accused] be aware that his conduct is likely to impact a child younger than the age of sixteen years. Specific intent is not a necessary requirement of the statute. Rather, the intent to do some act coupled with a reckless disregard of the consequences ... of that act is sufficient to [establish] a violation of the statute.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davila, </em>75 Conn. App. 432, 438, 816 A.2d 673, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 909, 826 A.2d 180 (2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 897, 125 S. Ct. 92, 160 L. Ed. 2d 166 (2004). For the same reasons that we have rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that sexual assault in the second degree, which also is a general intent crime, cannot be the subject of an attempt; see part I A of this opinion; we also reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (1) cannot be the subject of an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The defendant nevertheless maintains that, because \u00a7 53-21 (1) \u201ccovers the situation where there need be only a <em>risk </em>of injury [or impairment of morals] for the defendant to be convicted\u201d; (emphasis in original) <em>State </em>v. <em>Branham, </em>56 Conn. App. 395, 402, 743 A.2d 635, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 937, 747 A.2d 3 (2000); this court \u201cshould conclude that criminalizing an attempt to create a \u2018risk\u2019 or a threat, or \u2018endangerment,\u2019 comes perilously close to prohibiting an attempted attempt,\u201d which, of course, is not a crime. See, e.g., 4 F. Wharton, Criminal Law (15th Ed. Torcia 1996) \u00a7 693, p. 584 (\u201c[t]here can be no attempt to commit a crime which is itself an attempt, i.e., there can be no attempt to commit an attempt\u201d). We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s contention because, as he himself acknowledges, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>attempt to commit risk of injury to a child is not a prohibited \u201cattempted attempt.\u201d Moreover, we do not share the defendant\u2019s view that the offense of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child is so close to an attempted attempt that we are obliged to conclude that the offense is not legally cognizable, irrespective of the particular facts alleged.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The defendant also claims that it is not a cognizable crime to attempt to commit risk of injury to a child under \u00a7 53-21 (2), which prohibits, inter alia, a person from having contact with the intimate parts of a child under sixteen years of age in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the morals of that child. The defendant raises no new argument in support of this claim, relying, instead, on the argument that he raised to support his contention that attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree is not a cognizable offense. In light of our conclusion that the state is free to charge an attempt to commit a general intent crime such as \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), we also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that attempt to commit risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 (2) and 53a-49 (a) (1) is not a cognizable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The defendant next claims that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that he was guilty of the offenses of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree, attempt to commit risk of injury to a child, importing child pornography <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>and attempt to entice a minor.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We reject the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of these claims. At trial, the state adduced the testimony of Wardwell, who, acting as Danuta333, communicated online with the defendant for more than two months. Wardwell testified about the sexually explicit content of his online conversations with the defendant. Printouts of the conversations that the state introduced into evidence revealed that Danuta333 affirmatively stated her age at least ten times,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and that, on numerous other occasions, she raised subjects of interest to a child of her young age, such as school, school vacation, sleepovers, not being able to drive, being called to dinner by her mother and being grounded. The defendant also expressly acknowledged that Danuta333 was a child, commented that Danuta333 was young enough to be his daughter,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> told her that</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>thirteen is \u201cyoung\u201d and questioned her about whether she was comfortable with their age difference.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In one conversation, the defendant commented on the jail time he likely would receive if his relationship with Danuta333 were to be made \u201cpublic.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because this court has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u201c[A]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. . . . Furthermore, [i]n [our] process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Padua, 273 Conn. 138, 146-47, 869 A.2d 192 (2005). With these principles in mind, we turn to each of the defendant\u2019s evidentiary insufficiency claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendant contends that the evidence adduced by the state was inadequate to prove that he had committed the offense of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) and 53a-49 (a) (2). Specifically, the defendant asserts that the state failed to prove that he had: (1) had the intent to engage in sexual intercourse with Danuta333; (2) believed that Danuta333 was less than sixteen years old;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and (3) taken a substantial step in furtherance of the commission of a crime as \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) requires. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had intended to engage in sexual intercourse with Danuta333, the jury learned that the defendant had initiated contact with Danuta333, an AOL member with a published profile indicating that she was thirteen, immediately after she entered and quickly exited a chat room entitled \u201cI Love Much Older Men.\u201d After contacting Danuta333, the defendant asked if she had ever been with anyone his age and questioned her extensively about her prior sexual experiences to determine whether she \u201chad the experience [he] want[ed] . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>During this first conversation with Danuta333, the defendant inquired as to whether she wanted to meet in person, and, thereafter, they discussed specific times and locations for a meeting. The defendant continued to engage Danuta333 in online conversations of a sexually graphic nature, arranged to meet Danuta333 in person, described the sex acts that he expected Danuta333 to perform upon entering his van, and drove from Massachusetts to Connecticut on March 8, 2000, to execute his plan. Upon failing to find the prearranged meeting place, the defendant returned to Massachusetts, set up a second meeting for March 14, 2000, and told Danuta333 that she was to perform the same sex acts that he had planned for their unsuccessful first encounter. The defendant also stated that he would bring a videotape for her to watch while she performed. The defendant then drove to Connecticut a second time to meet Danuta333, and brought with him a videocassette player containing a videotape that was cued to a scene depicting an adult female performing fellatio. This evidence clearly was sufficient to establish that the defendant intended to have sexual intercourse with Danuta333 upon meeting her in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The defendant also asserts that the state failed to prove that he believed that he was communicating with a person less than sixteen years old. This argument also fails. On appeal, \u201c[w]e first construe the evidence presented at trial in a manner favorable to sustaining the verdict, and then determine whether the jury could reasonably have found, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 243, 627 A.2d 877 (1993). \u201c[T]he jury may draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 534, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995). In the present case, the evidence established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>convincingly that the defendant believed that Danuta333 was thirteen years old and, with that knowledge, intended to engage in sexual intercourse with her. As we have indicated, both Danuta333 and the defendant expressly and repeatedly referred to and discussed Danuta333\u2019s purported age. This evidence was more than sufficient to permit the jury to find that the defendant believed that Danuta333 was under the age of sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The defendant further asserts that the state failed to prove that he had taken a substantial step in furtherance of the commission of the crime of sexual assault in the second degree. Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (b), \u201c[c]onduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step . . . unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d Legally sufficient examples of strongly corroborative conduct include \u201centicing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (b) (2); and the \u201cpossession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, which are specially designed for such unlawful use or which can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (b) (5). \u201cWhat constitutes a \u2018substantial step\u2019 in any given case is a question of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>194 Conn. 258, 277, 480 A.2d 526 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 964, 83 L. Ed. 2d 969 (1985). In general terms, however, \u201c[a] substantial step must be something more than mere preparation, yet may be less than the last act necessary before the actual commission of the substantive crime, and thus the finder of fact may give weight to that which has already been done as well as that which remains to be accomplished before commission of the substantive crime. . . . In order for behavior to be punishable as an attempt, it need not be incompatible with innocence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>yet it must be necessary to the consummation of the crime and be of such a nature that a reasonable observer, viewing it in context could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it was undertaken in accordance with a design to violate the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>632 F.2d 978, 987-88 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 1112, 101 S. Ct. 922, 66 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The defendant claims that driving to meet Danuta333 at the parking lot was insufficient to constitute a substantial step for purposes of \u00a7 53a-49 (b) because that meeting place was not necessarily intended to be \u201cthe place contemplated\u201d for the commission of the crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (b) (2). Specifically, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>dant relies on several conversations in which he and Danuta333 had discussed the possibility of meeting at a hotel or first meeting at a parking lot and then driving to a nearby wooded area to have sexual intercourse. The defendant contends that those conversations suggest that he did not intend to engage in any sexual activity with Danuta333 in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">As the defendant correctly notes, our case law concerning attempts to commit sexual assault generally has involved a defendant who is in the presence of the victim.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, we never have considered the applicability of \u00a7 53a-49 (b) (2) to the precise scenario presented by this case. A decided majority of the courts that have considered the issue, however, have concluded that the conduct of a suspect who, for the purpose ultimately of having sex with a person whom the suspect believes to be a child, travels to a prearranged location to meet that child, is sufficient to constitute a substantial step in furtherance of the planned sex crime. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Meek, </em>366 F.3d 705, 720 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Root, </em>296 F.3d 1222, 1228 (11th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1176, 123 S.

Ed. 2d 921 (2003); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Farner, </em>251 F.3d 510, 511, 513 (5th Cir. 2001); <em>Kirwan </em>v. <em>State, </em>351 Ark. 603, 615, 96 S.W.3d 724 (2003); <em>Dennard </em>v. <em>State, </em>243 Ga.

LEXIS 839 (October 27, 2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>139 Idaho 815, 820, 87 P.3d 302 (2003); <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>318 Ill.

App. 2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brienzo, </em>supra, 267 Wis. 2d 366. The defendant urges us to adopt the minority position, embraced by two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>states,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> that such acts are not sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s attempt to commit the sex crime. We decline to do so because we conclude that such conduct falls well within the term \u201csubstantial step.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In the present case, the defendant engaged in a series of sexually explicit conversations with Danuta333 detailing exactly what sexual acts he expected her to perform upon entering his van. Moreover, in at least three of these conversations, the defendant specifically referred to his vehicle as the place where the sexual acts would occur.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The defendant twice arranged to meet Danuta333 and twice drove from Massachusetts to Connecticut to execute that plan, arriving in Connecticut the second time with a pornographic videotape in his vehicle cued to a woman performing fellatio. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the defendant had taken a substantial step in furtherance of the commission of the crime of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The defendant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child. The defendant raises the same claims that he has raised in support of his challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency of his conviction of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>namely, that the state failed to prove that he had: (1) intended to have sexual intercourse with the victim; (2) believed that the victim was less than sixteen years old; and (3) taken a substantial step in furtherance of the commission of the substantive crime. In support of his claim, the defendant relies on the same alleged evidentiary insufficiencies that he has relied on to support his claim that the state failed to prove that he had attempted to commit sexual assault in the second degree. For the same reasons that we rejected the defendant\u2019s evidentiary sufficiency claim with respect to his conviction of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree, we also reject his identical claim with respect to his conviction of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The defendant also maintains that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of importing child pornography, which was predicated on the defendant\u2019s transmission of certain photographs of a young female to Danuta333 via electronic mail. The defendant argues that the state failed to prove that: (1) the person depicted in the photographs was real and under sixteen years of age; (2) the images depicted \u201ca live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of a live performance which depicts a minor in a prohibited sexual act\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-193 (13);<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and (3) the defendant imported or caused to be imported child pornography into the state. We reject each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">To establish the charge of importing child pornography, the state relied on two photographs that the defendant had sent to Danuta333 over the Internet depicting a young female wearing only panties. With respect to those two images, the defendant told Danuta333 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>he had a photograph \u201cof a 13 year old that [he did] know.\u201d The defendant further informed Danuta333 that the girl in the photograph lived in the \u201cHartford area . . . [n]ot too far from\u201d Danuta333. Although the defendant indicated that he had not taken the photographs, he stated that he knew that the girl depicted in the photographs was thirteen because \u201c[s]he said so.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-196c (a) provides that \u201c [a] person is guilty of importing child pornography when, with intent to promote child pornography, he knowingly imports or causes to be imported into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the state any child pornography of known content and character.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-193 (13) defines \u201cchild pornography\u201d as \u201cany material involving a live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of alive performance which depicts a minor in a prohibited sexual act.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-193 (11) defines \u201cperformance\u201d as \u201cany play, motion picture, dance or other exhibition performed before an audience.\u201d Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-193 (3) defines \u201cprohibited sexual act\u201d as, inter alia, \u201cnude performance,\u201d which includes \u201cthe showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any portion thereof below the top of the nipple . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-193 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claims that the evidence failed to establish that the photographs were not real and that the person depicted in the images was under the age of sixteen, the defendant personally verified both the authenticity of the photographs and the age of the female appearing in those photographs. The jury also viewed the images, each of which depicts the same young girl.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The images are clear and readily discemable. That viewing, coupled with the defendant\u2019s representations, was sufficient to permit a jury to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>that the photographs depicted a real, thirteen year old girl, naked from the waist up.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The defendant also claims that the state should have been required to adduce expert testimony to prove that the images depicted a real person under sixteen years of age. In support of his claim, the defendant underscores the fact that \u201cnew technology . . . makes it possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist.\u201d <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 240, 122 S. Ct. 1389, 152 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We agree that, at least in some cases, it may be difficult for a lay obseiver to distinguish between real and virtual images. As the defendant acknowledges, however, the vast majority of courts have rejected the claim that, in light of technological advances, the prosecution, in every case, must present expert testimony to establish that a particular image depicts a real child. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Slanina, </em>359 F.3d 356, 357 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 845, 125 S. Ct. 288, 160 L. Ed. 2d 73 (2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kimler, </em>335 F.3d 1132, 1142 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1083, 124 S. Ct, 945, 157 L. Ed. 2d 759 (2003); <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>215 Ill. 2d 554, 571-75, 831 N.E.2d 574 (2005); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Deaton, </em>328 F.3d 454, 455 (8th Cir. 2003); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>312 F.3d 1250, 1260 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 954, 123 S. Ct. 1646, 155 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2003). Indeed, he cites to no contrary authority. In the absence of any persuasive support for the view advocated by the defendant,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we see no compelling reason to adopt a special rule of evidence for cases such as the present case, which involves images transmitted over the Internet. Although we cannot conclude, in light of evolving technology, that such a rule never will be necessary, we believe that \u201c[j]uries are still capable of distinguishing between real and virtual images; and admissibility remains within the province of the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kimler, </em>supra, 1142; accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Slanina, </em>supra, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The defendant further maintains that the state failed to present evidence either of a \u201clive performance\u201d or of aperformance \u201cbefore an audience\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-193 (11) and (13). This claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>252 Conn. 579, 750 A.2d 1079 (2000). In <em>Ehlers, </em>we explained that a live performance held before an audience \u201cmeans that there must be some recording or viewing of, or listening to, a live perfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>manee, or a reproduction of a live performance, by a person or persons other than the person or persons simultaneously engaged in the performance. The number of such persons recording, viewing or listening to the performance and whether they actually are present at the live performance or depicted in reproductions of it are irrelevant for purposes of determining whether an audience exists. Thus, an audience . . . could consist of a single photographer of the live performance, whether or not he or she actually was present at the performance or ever viewed the photographs, or a single person viewing photographs of the performance, whether or not any spectator was present at the live performance or depicted in the photographs.\u201d Id., 595-96. We also stated that, \u201cif a person engaged in the performance himself records the performance, or views or listens to material depicting a reproduction of a performance in which he participated, he will constitute an audience . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 595 n.18. We concluded that \u201c[t]his commonsense interpretation of the statute advances the legislative purpose of protecting children by targeting the market for child pornography.\u201d Id., 596. Because the images that the state introduced into evidence in the present case fall within the relevant statutory definitions as construed by this court in <em>Ehlers, </em>the defendant\u2019s claim is unavailing.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The defendant also contends that the state failed to prove that the defendant imported or caused to be imported child pornography into the state. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the defendant maintains that the state\u2019s evidence established only that he sent the images to AOL in Virginia and that Waxdwell actually imported those images into the state by opening the images on his computer in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">It is true, of course, that those images were routed through and stored in AOL\u2019s server in Virginia until Wardwell retrieved the defendant\u2019s electronic mail and downloaded the images onto his computer in this state. That fact, however, does not negate the equally obvious fact that the defendant caused those images to be delivered to Danuta333\u2019s electronic mailbox in Connecticut by sending them to that mailbox over the Internet. The evidence also established that the defendant did so fully intending and knowing that Danuta333 would receive the images by accessing her electronic mailbox in this state. In such circumstances, it would be entirely illogical to conclude that the person responsible for sending the electronic mail transmission containing the offending images is not a person engaged in the proscribed activity of \u201cimporting\u201d those images into this state within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-196c (a). We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The defendant next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of attempt to entice a minor because the state failed to prove that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>believed that he was communicating with a person under the age of sixteen. We reject this claim for the same reasons that we already have rejected the identical claim in connection with the defendant\u2019s challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency of his conviction of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree. See part II A of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The defendant contends that the statutes defining the crimes of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree and attempt to commit risk of injury to a child are void for vagueness as applied to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims is governed by well established principles. \u201cA statute is not void for vagueness unless it clearly and unequivocally is unconstitutional, making every presumption in favor of its validity. ... To demonstrate that [a statute] is unconstitutionally vague as applied . . . the [defendant] . . . must . . . demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] had inadequate notice of what was prohibited or that [he was] the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. . . . [T]he void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute . . . and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. ... If the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness since [m]any statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning. .. .</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u201cThe general rule is that the constitutionality of a statutory provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue. ... To do otherwise, absent the appearance that the statute in question intrudes upon fundamental guarantees, particularly first amendment freedoms, would be to put courts in the undesirable position of considering every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of [the statute]. . . . Thus, outside the context of the first amendment, in order to challenge successfully the facial validity of a statute, a party is required to demonstrate as a threshold matter that the statute may not be applied constitutionally to the facts of [the] case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>273 Conn. 509, 514-15, 871 A.2d 986 (2005). Furthermore, \u201c[a] statute is not unconstitutional merely because a person must inquire further as to the precise reach of its prohibitions . . . .\u201d <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 101, 717 A.2d 117 (1998). \u201c[N]or is it necessary that a statute list the exact conduct prohibited.\u201d Id. In light of these principles, \u201cour fundamental inquiry is whether a person of ordinary intelligence would comprehend that the defendant\u2019s acts were prohibited under [the pertinent provisions of our Penal Code].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We turn now to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, which implicates both of the precepts that underlie the prohibition against unduly vague criminal statutes. First, the defendant maintains that a person of ordinary intelligence would not have understood that traveling to a public place to meet the person the defendant believed was Danuta333 would have constituted a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>stantial step in furtherance of the crimes of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree and attempt to commit risk of injuiy to a child. Second, the defendant contends that both of those crimes allow for discriminatory and arbitrary law enforcement in the circumstances that gave rise to this case, namely, an Internet sting operation devised to investigate the sexual exploitation of children. Neither of the defendant\u2019s arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s first contention, we previously have explained that a significant majority of courts have concluded that a suspect who arranges to meet a child for the purpose of having sex with that child and who travels to a prearranged location to meet that child reasonably may be found to have undertaken a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of attempt to commit statutory rape. See part II A of this opinion. The fact that those courts have taken that position\u2014a position with which we agree\u2014alone provides a sufficient basis for rejecting the defendant\u2019s constitutional vagueness challenge because the defendant must be deemed to be on notice of that body of case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Furthermore, it was neither unforeseeable nor unreasonable that the juiy would conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted \u201ca substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime [s]\u201d of sexual assault in the second degree and lisk of injury to a child. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2). After numerous conversations in which the defendant repeatedly and graphically expressed his desire <em>and his intent </em>to have sex with Danuta333 upon meeting her, the defendant twice traveled to Connecticut from Massachusetts for that purpose. Indeed, the defendant was well aware of the impropriety of his conduct, which culminated in his travel to Connecticut. It strains credulity to maintain that a person of reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>able intelligence would not believe that traveling to meet a child under those circumstances represented a substantial step toward the culmination of his ultimate goal of having sexual relations with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The defendant further maintains that the statutes defining the challenged offenses are unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because they vest \u201cthe police with unprecedented power to control and shape criminal prosecutions.\u201d Specifically, the defendant contends that if Wardwell had identified Danuta333 as being twelve years, eleven months and twenty-nine days old, rather than thirteen years old, the defendant could have been charged with attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree. We do not quarrel with the defendant\u2019s contention that, if Wardwell had posed as a twelve year old girl, and if the defendant had conducted himself as he did in pursuing a sexual relationship with Danuta333, he would have been subject to prosecution for the greater offense of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree. We do not agree, however, that the possibility of such a scenario supports the defendant\u2019s vagueness claim. It is undisputed that the police are authorized to conduct sting operations of the kind that was conducted in the present case. Although the police may not entrap an otherwise innocent person; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-15;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> they may ensnare a person already inclined to violate the law.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The latter scenario best characterizes what occurred in the present case. The police provided the defendant with an opportunity that he had been looking for, and he took it. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>that the state then prosecuted the defendant for the crimes that he had attempted to commit does not render the statutes defining those crimes unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury with respect to the crimes of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree, attempt to commit of risk of injury to a child, importing child pornography, and obscenity. We reject the defendant\u2019s claims, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Before considering the merits of those claims, however, we set forth the standard of review applicable to such claims. \u201cIn determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 128, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). \u201cAs long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>274 Conn. 605, 656, 877 A.2d 787, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1049, 126 S. Ct. 775, 163 L. Ed. 2d 601 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s instructions on the crime of attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>commit sexual assault in the second degree. The defendant\u2019s sole contention is that those instructions permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty of that offense on the basis of \u201cknowing\u201d conduct rather than \u201cintentional\u201d conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to instructing the jury on each specific count of the information, the court instructed the jury on intent as follows: \u201cI want to instruct you on the subject of criminal intent, which is a fact which you must determine and which the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt as to each crime charged. Intent relates to a condition of the mind of the person who commits the act, his purpose in doing it. As defined by our statute, a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct. Intentional conduct is purposeful conduct rather than conduct that is accidental or inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cIntent\u2019s a mental process, and what a person\u2019s purpose, intention or knowledge has been is usually a matter to determine\u2014to be determined by inference. No person is able to testify that she or he looked into another\u2019s mind and saw there a certain purpose or intention. The only way in which a jury can ordinarily determine what a person\u2019s purpose, intent or knowledge was, at any given time, is by determining what that person\u2019s conduct was, and what the circumstances were surrounding that conduct, and from that, infer what his purpose, intention or knowledge was. This inference is not a necessary one. That is to say, you\u2019re not required to infer intent from an accused\u2019s conduct, but it is an inference that you may draw if you find it is a reasonable and logical one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The court proceeded to read \u00a7 53a-71 (a) and then instructed the jury on the elements of that offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Thereafter, the court read the relevant portion of the attempt statute. The court continued: \u201cInsofar as [attempt] applies to this charge, the statute sets up two elements, both of which must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in order to justify a verdict of guilty. First, the defendant must have acted with the kind of intent required for commission of the crime which he was attempting, namely sexual assault in the second degree; and second, acting with that intent, he did something, or he omitted to do something, which, under the circumstances as he believed them to be, was an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to end in his commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201cI\u2019m going to go through each of these two elements with you now in detail. The first element is intent. An attempt is an act or omission done with the intent to commit some other crime, in this case, sexual assault in the second degree. Thus, the defendant . . . must have acted with the intent to commit the crime of sexual assault in the second degree. It\u2019s not enough to show that he acted intending to do some unspecified criminal act. He must have acted with the same intent, the same state of mind, required for that particular crime, which I have just explained to you a few moments ago. I refer you to my earlier charge, general charge on intent, that is what it means, how it may be proven, and what the intent is that is required for the crime of sexual assault in the second degree. And I instruct you to apply that charge here.\u201d The court further noted that the sexual assault claim was based on the state\u2019s allegations that the defendant had \u201ctraveled to New Britain for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse with a person he believed to be a thirteen year old female.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s use of the word \u201cknowledge\u201d in its explanation of intent suggested that \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cintent\u201d are synonymous. The defendant further contends that, because those terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>have different meanings,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and because the state bore the burden of establishing that the defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional, and not merely knowing, the court\u2019s instruction on intent was constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s claim because there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s charge on intent. Although there is a difference between knowledge and intent, the court read the statutory definition of intent, not the statutory definition of knowledge. See footnote 44 of this opinion. Moreover, the court used the term \u201cknowledge\u201d only in connection \u2022with its explanation that a person\u2019s state of mind generally can be inferred from conduct. Thus, although the instruction did indicate correctly that intent, knowledge and purpose are all states of mind, the court never suggested, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, that knowledge and intent are synonymous. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The defendant next challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s charge on attempt to commit risk of injury to a child. The crux of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the trial court failed to convey adequately to the jury the intentionaiity element of that offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim requires that we set forth the relevant portions of the trial court\u2019s instructions on the crime of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child under both subdivision (1) and subdivision (2) of \u00a7 53-21 and under \u00a7 53a-49. See footnotes 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>through 4 of this opinion. The court first instructed the jury on risk of injury to a child under subdivision (2), which the court characterized for the jury as risk of injury to a child by sexual contact. The court commenced its instructions on that offense by reading the relevant portion of \u00a7 53-21 (2). The court thereafter explained the elements of the offense in relevant part: \u201cFirst, the state must prove [that] the child was under the age of sixteen at the time of the alleged incident. . . . Second, the state must prove that the defendant had contact with the intimate parts of the victim or subjected the victim to contact with his intimate parts. \u2018Intimate parts\u2019 means the genital area, groin, anus, the inner thighs, the buttocks or the breasts. \u2018Contact\u2019 means the touching of intimate parts. The state must prove either that the defendant had contact with the child\u2019s genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts, or that the defendant caused the child to make contact with the defendant\u2019s intimate parts. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u201cNow third, the state must prove that the contact with the intimate parts took place in a sexual and indecent manner, which was likely to impair the health or morals of the child. That\u2019s as opposed to an innocent touching or an accidental or inadvertent or reflexive touching. \u2018Sexual\u2019 means having to do with sex, and \u2018indecent\u2019 means offensive to good taste or public morals. The state must also show that the contact, which was sexual and indecent in nature, was likely to injure or weaken the health or morals of the child. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u201cThe state does not have to prove that the defendant actually did impair the health or morals of the child; rather, the state must show that the defendant\u2019s behavior was likely to impair the child\u2019s health or morals. \u2018Likely\u2019 means in all probability or probably. There is no requirement that the state prove actual harm to a child\u2019s health or morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cLikewise, the defendant need not have the specific intent to impair the health or morals of the child, only the general intent to perform the sexual and indecent act. General intent is the intent to do that which the law prohibits. It\u2019s not necessary for the state to prove that the defendant intended the precise harm or the precise result which eventuated. In other words, general intent is at least an intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act that the crime requires. Therefore, where the definition of a crime requires some forbidden act by the defendant, in this case, an act likely to impair the health or morals of a child, the defendant\u2019s bodily movement, to qualify as an act, must be voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The court next explained that the elements of attempt were the same that it just previously had explained for the crime of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree and instructed the jury \u201cto apply the same principles ... in determining whether the state has proven the [defendant] guilt[y] of this separate charge . . . .\u201d The court finally stated that charges were predicated on the state\u2019s allegation that the defendant \u201ctraveled to New Britain for the purpose of having contact with the intimate parts of a person he believed to be a thirteen year old female.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">With respect to the charge of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 (1) and 53a-49 (a) (1), the court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201c[Section 53-21 (1)] provides that \u2018[a]ny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that the health of such child is likely to be injured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired,\u2019 shall be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u201cTo prove a defendant guilty of wilfully or unlawfully causing or permitting any child under sixteen years to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>be placed in such a situation that the health of such child is likely to be injured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: First . . . at the time of the incident, the alleged victim was under the age of sixteen years .... [Second] . . . the defendant wilfully or unlawfully caused or permitted the victim to be placed in situations that were likely to injure her health or impair her morals. The conduct to be punished must involve a child under the age of sixteen. The statute also requires wilfulness or unlawfulness in causing or permitting the child to be placed in a situation that her health is likely to be injured or her morals are likely to be impaired. This is the conduct of a person that is deliberately indifferent to or acquiesces in, or creates a situation which is inimical or harmful to the [child\u2019s] moral or physical welfare. Furthermore, the term \u2018health\u2019 also applies to the victim\u2019s mental health or psychological well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201c \u2018Wilfully, \u2019 as used in this statute, means intentionally or deliberately. \u2018Unlawfully,\u2019 as it\u2019s used in this statute, means without a legal right or justification. Causing or permitting a situation to arise within the meaning of this statute requires conduct [on] the part of the defendant that brings about or permits that situation to arise when he had such control or a right of control over the child, then he might have reasonably prevented it. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cWith regard to the mental state or intent required to commit this offense, the state must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the general intent to perform the act. General intent is the intent to do that which the law prohibits. It is not necessary for the state to prove [that] the defendant intended the precise harm or the precise result which eventuated. In other words, general intent is at least an intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires. Therefore, where the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>nition of a crime requires some forbidden act by the defendant, in this case, an act likely to impair the health or morals of the child, the defendant\u2019s bodily movement, to qualify as an act, must be voluntary. . . . [I]n this case, the state does not claim that the defendant actually committed the crime of risk of injury to a [child]; rather, it claims that the defendant attempted to commit that crime. . . . [The applicable] attempt statute provides that \u2018[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u201cThe first element [that] the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant had the kind of mental state required for the commission of the crime of risk of injury to a [child]. So, there must be the intent. The intent for that crime is the general intent to do that which the law prohibits, that is, the intent to cause or permit a situation to arise that is likely to injure her health or impair her morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u201cNext, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally engaged in conduct that would have constituted the crime of risk of injury to a [child] if the attendant circumstances were as he believed them to be. In other words, the state must prove both intent and conduct beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction of attempt to commit risk of injury to a [child] under this attempt statute. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u201cThe state claims that this crime, too, was committed on or about March 8, 2000 [and on or about March 14, 2000] when [the state] alleges that [the defendant] . . . traveled to New Britain for the purpose of placing a person he believed to be a thirteen year old female in a situation that was likely to injure her health or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>impair her morals.\u201d With these instructions in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claims of instructional impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The defendant maintains that the trial court, in instructing the jury concerning the crime of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child under \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 (2) and 53a-49 (a) (1), inadequately explained the state\u2019s burden of proving that he had intended to have contact with the victim\u2019s intimate parts. On the contrary, the court informed the jury that the state had the burden of proving that the attempted contact was of a \u201csexual and indecent\u201d nature as distinguished from \u201can innocent touching or an accidental or inadvertent or reflexive touching.\u201d The court further instructed the jury that, although the state was not required to prove that the defendant had attempted to engage in such touching with the specific intent to harm the child\u2014i.e., the state was not required to prove that the defendant himself believed that such sexual or indecent touching would be harmful to the victim\u2014the state <em>was </em>required to demonstrate that the touching would cause such harm <em>and </em>that the touching itself was intentional. Finally, the court explained that the charge was predicated on the state\u2019s allegation that the defendant had traveled to New Britain <em>\u201cfor the purpose </em>of having contact with the intimate parts of a person he believed to be a thirteen year old female.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court\u2019s instructions on attempt reinforced the point that the state was required to establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the challenged instructions were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s similar claim regarding the impropriety of the court\u2019s instructions on the crime of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child under \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 (1) and 53a-49 (a) (1). The court instructed the jury that, to prove a violation of \u00a7 53-21 (1), the state was required to establish that the defendant <em>wilfully </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>had caused the victim to be placed in a situation inimical to her health and well-being. The court defined \u201cwilfully\u201d as \u201cintentionally or deliberately.\u201d The court also underscored the fact that the state bore the burden of establishing that the \u201cforbidden act\u201d was voluntary. In addition, the court reiterated that the charges were predicated on the state\u2019s allegation that the defendant had traveled to New Britain <em>\u201cfor the purpose </em>of placing a person he believed to be a thirteen year old female in a situation that was likely to injure her health or to impair her morals.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Finally, the court properly instructed the jury on attempt, once again noting the intentionality element of \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (1). In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions concerning the crime of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child under \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 (1) and 53a-49 \u201cwere correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. West, supra, 274 Conn. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the crime of importing child pornography. In particular, the defendant takes issue with that portion of the charge in which the court explained the operation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-196c (b), which provides that \u201c[ijmportation of two or more copies of any publication containing child pornography shall be prima facie evidence that such publications were imported with intent to promote child pornography.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>court\u2019s instruction was improper because the term \u201ccopy,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 53a-196c (b), means two reproductions of the same image, not reproductions of two different images, and because the state adduced no evidence to support the court\u2019s charge under that interpretation of \u00a7 53a-196c (b).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s contention. Neither the language of \u00a7 53a-196c nor its purpose of prohibiting the importation of child pornography into this state supports the defendant\u2019s claim that the two copies must be of the same image before the state may obtain the benefit of \u00a7 53a-196c (b).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, construing \u00a7 53a-196c (b) in the narrow manner advocated by the defendant would yield a bizarre result. The provision would apply to the case of an accused charged with importing two copies of the same pornographic image but not to the case of an accused charged with importing thousands of different pornographic images. We see no reason why the legislature would have intended to create such a seemingly irrational distinction. It is apparent, rather, that \u00a7 53a-196c (b) was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>enacted by the legislature because of the legislature\u2019s special concern with persons who cause multiple images of child pornography to be imported into this state. The trial court\u2019s instruction, therefore, was proper in law and warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of instructional impropriety involves the trial court\u2019s charge on the crime of obscenity. The defendant maintains that the trial court improperly denied his request for an instruction that the jury could not return a verdict of guilty on that charge unless it unanimously agreed that a particular image or group of images was obscene. The defendant further maintains that the court\u2019s general instructions on unanimity were inadequate to guide the jury in its deliberations on the obscenity charge and that the court effectively sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict on that charge by declining to give the requested instruction.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">As a general matter, in reviewing a claim that the trial court improperly failed to give a specific unanimity instruction, \u201cwe first review the instruction that was given to determine whether the trial court has sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict. If such an instruction has not been given, that ends the matter. Even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>instructions at trial can be read to have sanctioned such a nonunanimous verdict, however, we will remand for a new trial only if (1) there is a conceptual distinction between the alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged, and (2) the state has presented evidence to support each alternative act with which the defendant has been charged.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 619-20, 595 A.2d 306 (1991); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 419, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). In the present case, the trial court did not give an instruction expressly sanctioning a nonunanimous verdict on the charge of obscenity. The defendant claims that the court nevertheless sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict on the obscenity charge because it instructed the jury to consider all of the images and conversations that had been introduced into evidence by the state; see footnote 48 of this opinion; without also directing the jury that it must agree unanimously on the obscene nature of any particular item.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s general instructions on unanimity were adequate. Although the state charged the defendant with only one count of obscenity, the evidence on which the state relied to prove that count consisted of a variety of different materials. In other words, the state sought to establish that those materials, considered collectively, were sufficient to establish a violation of \u00a7 53a-194. In the absence of anything in the record to indicate that the defendant challenged the manner in which the state sought to prove the obscenity charge, we see no reason to second guess either the manner in which the state proceeded in proving the obscenity charge or the manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the court instructed the jury with respect to that offense. In particular, the defendant did not challenge the obscenity count on grounds of duplicity; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>84 Conn. App. 351, 380-81, 854 A.2d 13 (\u201c[d]uplicity occurs when two or more offenses are charged in a single count of the accusatory instrument\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004); even though the state expressly alleged, with respect to that count, that the defendant had \u201cdisseminate [d] obscene material\u201d <em>\u201con or about divers [e] dates </em>between January and February, 2000, in the city of New Britain . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In such circumstances, the state was entitled to have the jury consider the evidence as a whole in connection with its deliberations on the obscenity charge. In light of the trial court\u2019s unanimity instruction, it is clear that each and every juror found, at the very least, that the materials introduced into evidence, considered together, were obscene. The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, must fail.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The defendant next claims that \u00a7 53a-196c does not apply to images of child pornography transmitted by personal computer and that the legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to prohibit only the commercial importation of child pornography. We disagree with both of the defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is not consistent either with the language or the purpose of \u00a7 53a-196c. By its terms, \u00a7 53a-196c applies to anyone who, with intent to promote child pornography, knowingly imports or causes to be imported into this state three or more visual depictions of child pornography of known content and character. The term \u201cchild pornography\u201d means <em>\u201cany material </em>involving a live performance or <em>photographic or other visual reproduction </em>of a live performance which depicts a minor in a prohibited sexual act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-193 (13).<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Similarly, the term \u201cpromote\u201d is expansively defined to mean \u201cmanufacture, issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, advertise, produce, direct or participate in.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-193 (12). The legislature\u2019s use of such language connotes an intent to prohibit broadly the dissemination of child pornography in this state consistent with the abhorrent nature of such material.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">As we indicated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 579, our child pornography laws were designed to \u201cprotect the victims of child pornography and [to] destroy the market for child pornography.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 593. In light of those two overarch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ing goals, it would be contrary to the purpose of those laws to restrict their reach in the manner urged by the defendant. Although it may be true that the legislature did not fully envision all of the ways in which child pornography might be introduced into this state when it enacted the antichild pornography legislation in 1985; see Public Acts 1985, No. 85-496, \u00a7 5; the language of the legislation that it crafted is sufficiently broad to address the dissemination of such pornography in ways not necessarily contemplated by the legislature at that time, including via the Internet. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 614, 620 A.2d 133 (1993) (\u201c[w]e do not believe that the legislative intent behind the wiretap act was to leave such unknowing third parties unprotected simply because the telephonic technology in such widespread use today was not available in 1971\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">For similar reasons, we also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the legislature intended to prohibit only the importation of child pornography that is produced commercially. Again, the defendant\u2019s claim founders on both the language and the purpose of the relevant statutory provisions. Although the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-196c is replete with references to the intended impact that that legislation would have on the pornography industry,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> those references reflect but one reason for the legislation; there is nothing in the legislative record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to suggest that that reason was intended to be exclusive of all others. In contrast to the construction urged by the defendant, an interpretation of \u00a7 53a-196c that does not limit its application to the business of child pornography advances the broader legislative purpose of protecting children by targeting the market for child pornography; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 596; whatever form that market may take under the circumstances. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to present expert testimony about the psychological and behavioral characteristics of a certain category of sex offenders. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly: (1) permitted that testimony without first conducting a hearing in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998); and (2) concluded that the testimony was more probative than prejudicial. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of the present claim. Prior to trial, the state notified the defendant of its intent to present the expert testimony of Kenneth Lanning, a private consultant and former special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) whose work had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>focused on the victimization of children.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In particular, the state sought to elicit testimony from Lanning about the characteristics of a category of sex offenders known as \u201cpreferential offenders . . . .\u201d The defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude the testimony, claiming that the state had failed to demonstrate its admissibility under <em>Porter </em>and that the proffered evidence was unduly prejudicial. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that \u201cthe proposed testimony . . . does not qualify as \u2018scientific evidence\u2019 and, therefore, does not require a <em>Porter </em>hearing before being presented to the jury.\u201d The court, however, expressly limited the scope of Lanning\u2019s testimony to \u201cthe \u2018customs and habits\u2019 of \u2018preferential [sex] offenders\u2019 in general\u201d and prohibited the state from \u201cattempting] in any way to have . . . Lanning express opinions on the mental state of [the defendant] or whether he fits the characteristics of a \u2018preferential offender\u2019 or how his conduct compares with that of a \u2018preferential offender.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The defendant subsequently renewed his motion immediately before Lanning testified. The trial court reaffirmed its earlier ruling, noting that the testimony was admissible under \u00a7 7-2 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. With respect to the relevance of the proffered evidence, the court concluded that Lanning\u2019s testimony was relevant to \u201cthe defendant\u2019s intent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>engaging in the behavior ... his belief as to the age of Danuta333 and whether his conduct was corroborative of his purpose as at least the start of a line of conduct leading naturally to the crime.\u201d The court also expressly considered the four countervailing factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>256 Conn. 854, 888, 776 A.2d 1091 (2001),<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and determined that \u201cnone of them either [individually] or together [was] sufficient to outweigh the probative value of . . . Banning\u2019s testimony.\u201d Although the court informed the defendant that it would consider a request for a cautionary instruction to minimize any possible prejudice that might flow from Lanning\u2019s testimony, the defendant made no such request.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Lanning then testified before the jury that sexual offenders fall along a \u201cmotivation continuum\u201d ranging from situational sex offenders to preferential sex offenders. According to Lanning, situational sex offenders take advantage of opportunistic situations to engage in sex offenses and are typically thought-driven, under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>taking action without consideration of getting caught. Lanning testified further that preferential sex offenders are individuals who have specific sexual preferences for certain activities or victims and whose behavior is normally need-driven or fantasy-driven. Preferential sex offenders typically collect pornography, erotica and mementos relating to their sexual interest or preference and spend a great deal of time and money in fulfilling their sexual needs or fantasies. With respect to preferential sex offenders with an interest in children, they may use child pornography to rationalize abhorrent behavior, fuel and reinforce their sexual arousal or lower a potential victim\u2019s inhibitions by conveying the message that other children are doing it. Preferential sex offenders typically will engage in a prolonged and elaborate grooming or seduction process that is designed to exploit and manipulate vulnerable children. Preferential sex offenders may lessen the grooming time by targeting a child who is sexually experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. In this regard, the trial court is vested with wide discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence. . . . Accordingly, [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>273 Conn. 266, 274, 869 A.2d 640 (2005). \u201cBecause a trial court\u2019s ruling under <em>Porter </em>involves the admissibility of evidence, we review that ruling on appeal for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id., 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We first consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in declining to subject Lanning\u2019s testimony to a <em>Porter </em>hearing. On appeal, the defendant concedes that Lanning\u2019s testimony was not \u201cscientific\u201d but argues that the testimony nevertheless required the trial court to conduct a <em>Porter </em>hearing because it was \u201cother spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>cialized knowledge\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-2 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. The state argues that no <em>Porter </em>hearing was required because Lanning\u2019s testimony was not based on any scientific theory but, rather, on his training and experience in the field of child victimization. We agree with the state that, because Lanning\u2019s testimony was not based on scientific knowledge, the trial court properly determined that a threshold admissibility hearing under <em>Porter </em>was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u201cIn <em>[Porter], </em>we adopted the test for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence set forth in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>[509 U.S. 579, 589-92, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993)]. We noted therein two requirements established under <em>Daubert. </em>First, [we noted] that the subject of the testimony must be scientifically valid, meaning that it is scientific knowledge rooted in the methods and procedures of science . . . and is more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation. . . . This requirement establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability ... as, [i]n a case involving scientific evidence, evidentiary reliability will be based upon scientific validity. . . . Second, [we noted that] the scientific evidence must fit the case in which it is presented. ... In other words, proposed scientific testimony must be demonstrably relevant to the facts of the particular case in which it is offered, and not simply be valid in the abstract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u201cIn <em>Porter </em>we recognized that Daubert\u2019s vagueness as to how and when to apply the factors of the test was necessary. ... In order to maintain flexibility in applying the test, we did not define what constitutes \u2018scientific evidence.\u2019 . . . Consequently, our initial inquiry is whether the [evidence] at issue ... is the type of evidence contemplated by <em>Porter.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>In the present case, the defendant concedes, and we agree, that Lanning\u2019s testimony did not concern scientific knowledge. That conclusion forecloses the defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a <em>Porter </em>hearing because <em>Porter </em>applies only to expert scientific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The defendant nevertheless asserts that the trial court improperly declined to conduct a <em>Porter </em>hearing because Lanning\u2019s testimony involved the kind of \u201cspecialized knowledge\u201d for which such a hearing is necessary. In essence, the defendant seeks to have us adopt the approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999). In <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd., </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a trial court\u2019s gatekeeping function under <em>Daubert </em>applies not only to expert scientific testimony but also to expert testimony based on technical or other specialized knowledge. Id., 149. We decline to consider the defendant\u2019s claim, however, because the defendant failed to raise it in the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 48, 717 A.2d 77 (1998) (claims not properly raised before trial ordinarily will not be considered on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The defendant also maintains that the trial court should have precluded the state from eliciting Lanning\u2019s testimony because the prejudicial effect of that testimony outweighed its probative value. We disagree. \u201cExpert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>263 Conn. 677, 683, 822 A.2d 228 (2003); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-2. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>trial court\u2019s discretionary determination that the probative value of evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. . . . [B]ecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process . . . every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only whe[n] an abuse of discretion is manifest or whe[n] injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>261 Conn. 336, 358, 803 A.2d 267 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1217, 123 S. Ct. 1318, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The trial court reasonably concluded that Lanning\u2019s testimony was relevant and likely to assist the jury in light of the nature of the charges and Lanning\u2019s experience and expertise in matters relating to the victimization of children. The court also carefully evaluated the potential prejudicial effect of the testimony and reasonably concluded that its probative value outweighed any such effect. Moreover, the court guarded against the possibility of undue prejudice by limiting the scope of Lanning\u2019s testimony to the \u201c \u2018customs and habits\u2019 \u201d of preferential sex offenders in general and by prohibiting banning from expressing any opinion either about the defendant\u2019s mental state or about whether the defendant fit the profile of a preferential sex offender. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of Lanning\u2019s testimony outweighed any prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Sexual intercourse is defined as \u201cvaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between two persons regardless of sex.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

Although the record is adequate for review of all of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved constitutional claims, including his claim that the offenses of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree and attempt to commit risk of injury to a child are not cognizable crimes, for reasons that we discuss hereinafter, he cannot prevail on his <em>Golding </em>claims because he cannot establish a constitutional violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> It is trae, of course, that the \u201cvictim\u201d in the present case was not a person at all, let alone a person under the age of sixteen. The defendant has not claimed, however, that that fact has any bearing on his contention that attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree is not a cognizable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>crime. In other words, the defendant makes no claim that that offense is not a cognizable crime under the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We note, moreover, that the state alleged, in the two counts of the information charging the defendant with attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree, that, on or about March 8, 2000, and March 14, 2000, respectively, the defendant, \u201cacting with the requisite mental state to commit sexual assault in the second degree, did intentionally engage in conduct which, under the circumstances as he believed them to be, would constitute a substantial step in the commission of the crime of sexual assault in the second degree, to wit: traveling to the city of New Britain for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse with a person he believed to be a [thirteen] year old female, said conduct being in violation of \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) . . . [and] \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) . . . .\u201d Thus, the state expressly assumed the burden of establishing that the defendant knew that the victim was thirteen years of age. As we have explained, the state normally would not be required to prove that fact because, under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), the state is not required to establish that an accused knew that the victim was underage. In the circumstances of this case, however, in which the victim, Danuta333, was not a real person, the state was required to prove that the defendant believed that Danuta333 was thirteen years of age because, in the absence of such proof, the state could not establish a crime at all. In other words, for purposes of this case, which arises out of an Internet sting operation, because there was no <em>actual </em>person under the age of sixteen with whom the defendant was attempting to have sexual intercourse, the state necessarily had to prove that the defendant <em>believed </em>that there was a person under that age with whom he was going to engage in sexual intercourse. In the absence of such proof, the state would have established only that the defendant was seeking to meet a person of unknown age for the purpose of having sexual intercourse. Such proof would have been inadequate to establish an attempt by the defendant to commit any crime, let alone the specific crime that the state believed that the defendant was predisposed to commit, namely, sexual intercourse with a person less than sixteen years of age. As we indicated previously, however, the fact that the state assumed that burden in this case does not bear upon the defendant\u2019s broader claim, namely, that an attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree is not a cognizable crime regardless of whether the victim is a real person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> In its brief to this court, the state advances the view that, to prove the crime of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree, it was required to establish both that the defendant intended to have sexual intercourse with the victim <em>and </em>that the defendant knew that the victim was under sixteen years of age. In light of the requirement of \u00a7 53a-49 (a) that a person be found to have acted \u201cwith the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime,\u201d and because \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) does not require proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the victim is less than sixteen years old, we are unclear as to why the state has taken the broad position that it bears the burden of proving that an accused charged with an attempt to violate \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) knew that the victim was less than sixteen years of age. As we have explained; see footnote 19 of this opinion; the state understandably, and properly, assumed that burden in this Internet sting case, but the state\u2019s position appears to be that it would be required to assume that burden even in a case involving a real victim. Even if the state is correct in its analysis, our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim would be the same: attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree is a cognizable offense. Moreover, as we explain hereinafter; see part II of this opinion; the evidence amply supported a finding that the defendant believed that the victim was thirteen years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> We note that, in the circumstances of this case, which arises out of an Internet sting operation that did not involve a real underage victim, the state necessarily undertook the burden of establishing that the defendant believed that the victim was under sixteen years of age. See footnote 19 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> Moreover, as the state notes, in the present case, each of the counts of the information pursuant to which the state charged the defendant with attempt to commit risk of injury to a child under \u00a7 53-21 (1) alleged that the defendant intentionally, rather than recklessly; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Davila, supra, 75 Conn. App. 438 (intent to do some act coupled with reckless disregard of consequences of that act sufficient to establish violation of \u00a7 53-21); had engaged in conduct that was likely to injure or to impair the morals of a child under the age of sixteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> We note, preliminarily, that the defendant does not claim that the fact that Danuta333 is not a real person bars his prosecution for any of those crimes under a theory of impossibility. \u201c[SJection [53a-49] sweeps aside any consideration of the defense of impossibility, including the distinction between so-called factual and legal impossibility. Under subsections (a) (1) and (2), the liability of the actor turns on his purpose, considered in the light of his beliefs, and not on what is actually possible under existing circumstances.\u201d Conn.

See footnote 19 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\"> We note, as well, the following observations by Judge Henry Friendly regarding the type of evidence necessary to establish an attempt. \u201cMany of our country\u2019s most distinguished judges have labored over the definition of an attempt, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee, 177 </em>Mass. 267, 272, 59 N.E. 55 (1901) (Holmes, J.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Werblow, </em>241 N.Y. 55, 61-62, 148 N.E. 786 (1925) (Cardozo, J.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coplon, </em>185 F.2d 629, 632-33 ([2d] Cir. 1950) [(Hand, J.)], cert. denied, 342 U.S. 920, 72 S. Ct. 362, 96 L. Ed. 688 (1952) . . . and over the years various approaches have been urged. Some courts and commentators have asked whether there was a physical or dangerous proximity to success; others whether the actor had reached a point where it was unlikely that he would have voluntarily desisted; still others whether the actor\u2019s conduct was by itself unequivocal evidence of criminal intent. . . . The drafters of the Model Penal Code considered and rejected all previous formulations in favor of one which provides, so far as here relevant, that \u2018[a] person is guilty of an attempt ... if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he . . . purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u2019 [Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.01 (1) (c) (Proposed Official Draft 1962)]. Conduct \u2018shall not be held to constitute a substantial step . . . unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.\u2019 [Id., \u00a7 5.01 (2)]. This definition, by shifting the emphasis from what remains to be done to what the actor already has done, was designed to widen the ambit of attempt liability, consistent with the drafters\u2019 belief that the proper concern of the law of attempts is the dangerousness of the actor, as a person manifesting a firm disposition to commit a crime, not the dangerousness of his conduct.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ivic, </em>700 F.2d 51, 66 (2d Cir. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\"> E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 468-69, 758 A.2d 824 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 400-01, 404, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lapia, </em>202 Conn. 509, 510, 513-14, 522 A.2d 272 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 259-60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>709 So. 2d 580, 582 (Fla.

Among other things, Miles testified that once an image is converted into a digital file, it can be edited with readily available and inexpensive technology. Miles further testified that he could not determine whether the two images that the state had introduced into evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt with respect to the charge of importing child pornography depicted a real person because those images, having been digital images, were capable of being altered without traces of alteration. On the basis of the evidence adduced by the state, however, the jury was free, notwithstanding Miles\u2019 testimony, to conclude that the photographs depicted a real person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b210-6\"> In his initial brief, the defendant cited to one case, namely, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>363 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that government \u201cmust introduce relevant evidence in addition to the [alleged pornographic] images\u201d to prove that images depict real child), to support his .claim that the state was required to adduce expert testimony to establish that the photographs introduced into evidence by the state depicted a real child.

What this means is that if there\u2019s evidence that the [defendant] imported into Connecticut or caused to be imported into Connecticut two or more copies of anything that is child pornography . . . that evidence by itself is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>sufficient to prove that the child pornography was imported by the [defendant] with the intent to promote child pornography.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> Although the two photographs that the state relied on to establish the charge of importing child pornography depicted the same young, partially nude girl, each of the photographs depicted the girl in a slightly different pose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> In support of his claim, the defendant cites to several instances during a debate of the bill that eventually became \u00a7 53a-196c in which several members of the House of Representatives used the term \u201ctwo copies\u201d in referring to 1he kinds of materials that are prohibited under the legislation. See, e.g., 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16,1985 Sess., pp. 5674,5685, remarks of Representatives Richard D. Tulisano and William J. Gibes, Jr. A review of those proceedings, however, reveals that the discussion did not focus on whether 1he copies had to be of the same image; rather, the discussion dealt more generally wi1h what constitutes child pornography under the law. We note, moreover, that, at an earlier stage in the legislative debate, Representative James T. Fleming referred to the provision as giving rise to a prima facie case when \u201ctwo or more items\u201d of child pornography have been brought into this state. Id., p. 5672.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> The defendant does not otherwise challenge the propriety of the trial court\u2019s charge on the crime of obscenity. With respect to that charge, the court instructed the jury \u201cto consider all of the images which [the defendant] allegedly sent by the Internet to Danuta333 . . . [including the two photographs that formed the basis of the charge of importing child pornography] ... as well as the other still and moving images which have been shown to you and about which you have heard testimony.\u201d The court also instructed the jury that it \u201cmay . . . consider the content of the [instant messaging] chats [between Danuta333 and the defendant] ... in determining whether [the defendant] is guilty or not guilty of the crime of obscenity.\u201d The court provided the jury with the definition of obscene materials and instructed the jury to apply \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d in its deliberations on the obscenity charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\"> We note that the issue of whether the trial court improperly sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict by failing to give a specific unanimity charge generally arises in cases involving a claim that criminal liability has been premised on the violation of one of several alternative subsections of a statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 419, 832 A.2d 14 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 619-20, 595 A.2d 306 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> We note that the defendant may not have challenged the obscenity count on duplicity grounds for reasons of strategy, namely, to avoid the risk of being charged with multiple counts of obscenity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"> The defendant also contends that the evidence was insufficient to permit a finding of guilty of obscenity. The defendant, however, has not further articulated the basis of his claim because, he maintains, he is unable to do so by virtue of the trial court\u2019s allegedly improper refusal to give a specific unanimity instruction on the obscenity charge. According to the defendant, the court\u2019s refusal to give such an instruction has \u201ceffectively deprived\u201d him of his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the charge because, the defendant asserts, there is \u201cno way of ascertaining the factual basis\u201d of his conviction. In light of our rejection of the defendant\u2019s claim concerning the impropriety of the court\u2019s instructions on the crime of obscenity, we also reject his unsubstantiated claim of evidentiary insufficiency with respect to that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> Wo note that \u00a7 53a-193 (13) recently has been amended. See Public Acts 2004, No. 04-139, \u00a7 2. The current statutory definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d now <em>expressly </em>covers \u201cany visual depiction, including any photograph, film, videotape, picture or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a person under sixteen years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct, provided whether the subject of a visual depiction was a person under sixteen years of age at the time the visual depiction was created is a question to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-193 (13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> For example, Representative James T. Fleming stated: \u201c[The proposed legislation] will enable . . . the [s]tate to hit the wholesaler of child pornography at the source, as the material enters this state. In effect, I think it will make it too expensive for child pomographers to operate in Connecticut.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 7,1985 Sess., p. 2199. William Wholean, executive director of the Connecticut Catholic Conference stated in support of the proposed legislation: \u201cA favorable report . . . will be the first step in curbing the lucrative pornography business in Connecticut. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u201cThere has been a certain reluctance on the part of police departments and prosecutors to tackle the pornography industry. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u201cIt\u2019s time we got the pornography peddlers on the run and away from our children.\u201d Id., p. 2334.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"><em> </em>The defendant also suggests that, because \u00a7 53a-196c \u201cis concerned <em>solely </em>with commercial activity . . . that is interstate in nature\u201d; (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted); that provision violates the commerce clause of the United States constitution. See, e.g., <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Beer Institute, </em>491 U.S. 324, 336-37, 109 S. Ct. 2491, 105 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1989). As we have explained, however, the assumption underlying the defendant\u2019s suggestion, namely, that \u00a7 53a-196c pertains only to commercial activity, is incorrect. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s activities in the present case were not commercial in nature. For either of those reasons, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\"> Lanning had spent twenty years in the behavioral sciences unit of the FBI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> The parties stipulated that Lanning never had interviewed the defendant personally and had not reviewed any of the evidence relating to the charges against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> Section 7-2 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201cA witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, education or otherwise may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise concerning scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge, if the testimony will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> In <em>Pappas, </em>we set forth the following countervailing factors that may militate against the admission of probative evidence: \u201c(1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the [jurors\u2019] emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Papas, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 888; see also Conn.
