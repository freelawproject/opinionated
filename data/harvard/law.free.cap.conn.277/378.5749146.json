The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court improperly denied the acquittee\u2019s motion to strike a report to the court submitted by the psychiatric security review board (board) because: (1) the report was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial; (2) its admission violated the acquittee\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the United States constitution; and (3) its admission violated the acquittee\u2019s right to due process. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. In 1992, the acquittee was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of two counts of arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll and two counts of refusing fingerprinting in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-17. Thereafter, the trial court conducted a hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (d) and (e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and determined that the acquittee was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>a person who should be confined. It committed him to the jurisdiction of the board* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>6 for a period of time not to exceed ten years. The acquittee was sent to Whiting, a maximum security psychiatric hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">When the acquittee\u2019s term of commitment approached its conclusion in 2002, the state\u2019s attorney filed with the Superior Court a petition for continued commitment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, the board held a hearing to investigate whether the acquittee should be recommitted and filed its report with the trial court. The report, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>board is required to submit under \u00a7 17a-593 (d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contained the board\u2019s factual conclusions and recommendation as to whether the court should grant the state\u2019s petition. The board concluded: \u201cBased on the preceding facts, the [b]oard finds by clear and convincing evidence that [the acquittee] remains a person who should be confined and he has a psychiatric disability to the extent that his discharge or conditional release would constitute a danger to himself or others. Further, the [b]oard finds due to the extent of [the acquittee\u2019s] violent behavior he can only be treated safely in a maximum-security setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The acquittee filed motions to dismiss the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment and to strike the board\u2019s report. The trial court denied both motions and granted the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment. The acquittee then filed a motion to reargue and for reconsideration of the court\u2019s judgment in light of a Superior Court decision that had recently held \u00a7 17a-593 (c) unconstitutional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court granted the acquittee\u2019s motion to reargue, but it ultimately reaffirmed its prior judgment in favor of the state. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">At the outset, we briefly review the law governing continued commitment proceedings for insanity acquittees. After a defendant is acquitted by reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of mental disease or defect pursuant to \u00a7 53a-13, the Superior Court must conduct a hearing to assess the acquittee\u2019s mental state and to determine whether the person should be confined or released.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (a) and (e).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The acquittee bears the burden of proof at the hearing and must show by a preponderance of the evidence that he should be discharged. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (f). If the court determines that the acquittee has not met this burden, it must commit him to the jurisdiction of the board for a term \u201cnot to exceed the maximum sentence that could have been imposed if the acquittee had been convicted of the offense . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1) (A). The board initially determines where to confine the acquittee and monitors his progress by holding hearings and periodically reviewing his status to determine whether he should be conditionally released or discharged. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-583 through 17a-592.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Prior to the expiration of the term of commitment fixed by the trial court, an acquittee may apply directly to the Superior Court for release, or the board itself may recommend discharge. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 520, 847 A.2d 862, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004). In addition, the board is required to hold a hearing every two years to review the acquittee\u2019s status and to determine whether confinement still is appropriate. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-585. The board retains jurisdiction over the acquittee until his term of commitment expires or until the Superior Court rules that he should be released from the board\u2019s jurisdiction. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">When an acquittee reaches the end of the definite term of commitment set by the court, the state may submit a petition for continued commitment if \u201creasonable cause exists to believe that the acquittee remains a person with psychiatric disabilities ... to the extent that his discharge at the expiration of his maximum term of commitment would constitute a danger to himself or others . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c). After the state files its petition, the board is required, by statute, to submit a report to the court setting forth the board\u2019s findings and conclusions as to whether discharge is warranted. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (d). When making its decision, the Superior Court is not bound by the board\u2019s recommendation, but considers the board\u2019s report in addition to other evidence presented by both parties and makes its own \u201cfinding as to the mental condition of the acquittee . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">This statutory scheme differs from the scheme that applies to civilly committed individuals. The Probate Court, which has jurisdiction over civil commitment proceedings; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-497 (a); may order commitment only if it finds \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the person complained of has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself</p>\n<p id=\"AVY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>or others or [is] gravely disabled . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-498 (c). In addition, civil committees are not monitored by the board or by a similar agency. When the Probate Court periodically considers whether a civil committee should be discharged, it relies on the testimony of two court-appointed, impartial physicians, one of whom is a practicing psychiatrist.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-498 (c) and (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 425, 645 A.2d 965 (1994), this court concluded that once an acquittee\u2019s definite term of commitment has expired, the state bears the same burden of proof in seeking to recommit the acquittee that it would have in civil commitment proceedings. The acquittee in <em>Metz </em>moved to dismiss the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment, which was filed as he approached the conclusion of a six year term set by the trial court. Id., 402-405. He claimed, inter alia, that \u00a7 17a-593 violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions because civilly committed individuals and prisoners confined at mental hospitals beyond the expiration of their prison sentences were protected by the civil \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of proof, while insanity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>acquittees whom the state sought to commit beyond their original terms bore the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Id., 411-12, 424-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We concluded that the acquittee\u2019s equal protection claim raised serious constitutional issues because \u201cit is difficult to find a constitutional justification for a categorical distinction between an insanity acquittee and an incarcerated prisoner who was transferred to a mental hospital while he was serving his criminal sentence.\u201d Id., 424. Therefore, we held that \u201cconstitutional concerns lead us to construe the maximum period of commitment authorized by \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1) (A) as a reasonably identified point of demarcation beyond which the presumption of dangerousness initially accompanying an acquittee does not continue.\u201d Id., 425. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201c\u00a7 17a-593 (c) impliedly imposes the same burden on the state at a hearing for the continued commitment of an acquittee beyond his current definite period of commitment as is imposed in a civil commitment hearing under \u00a7 17a-498 (c); namely, to show by clear and convincing evidence that the acquittee is currently mentally ill and dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled.\u201d Id. In sum, we determined that the acquittee bears the burden of proof at the initial commitment proceeding under \u00a7 17a-582 and if he seeks release pursuant to \u00a7 17a-593 prior to the expiration of his court-ordered term. Once that term expires, however, the burden shifts to the state, which must prove the need for continued commitment by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 514, the trial court concluded that <em>all </em>of the procedural protections afforded in civil commitment proceedings must also be afforded in continued commitment proceedings. Consequently, the trial court struck down \u00a7 17a-593 (c) on constitutional grounds, dismissed the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment, and directed it to pursue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>instead, a petition for civil commitment before the Probate Court. Id., 514-15. We reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that although principles of equal protection require that the burdens of proof in continued commitment and civil commitment proceedings be identical, those same principles do not require that the <em>procedures themselves </em>be identical. See id., 536-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Having set forth the applicable law, we now address the acquittee\u2019s claims. We first address the acquittee\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly admitted the board\u2019s report because it was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. Specifically, he claims: (1) the board applied the incorrect legal standard of dangerousness to the acquittee and (2) the report was biased against the acquittee because the board is required by General Statutes \u00a7 17a-584<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to consider the protection of society as its primary concern. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. Section 4-1 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides that evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Relevant evidence may be excluded, however, \u201cif its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury . . . .\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3. Unfair prejudice exists when the evidence \u201ctends to have some adverse effect upon [the party against whom the evidence is offered] beyond tending to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ancheff v. Hartford Hospital, </em>260 Conn. 785, 804, 799 A.2d 1067 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>272 Conn. 515, 542, 864 A.2d 847 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The acquittee first claims that the trial court should have excluded the report because the board improperly used the definition of dangerousness set forth in \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Comecticut State Agencies instead of the definition set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-495 (b), the statute pertaining to civil commitment. He argues that if the civil \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d burden of proof applies to continued commitment proceedings, the civil definition of dangerousness also should apply. The state responds that there is no legally significant difference between the definitions of dangerousness employed in board and civil commitment hearings. Therefore, as long as the trial court applied the correct \u201cclear and convincing\u201d burden of proof to the case as a whole, there was no error. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The acquittee claims that the civil commitment definition of dangerousness is more stringent because it \u201crequires a \u2018substantial risk\u2019 of physical harm, whereas, the [board\u2019s] dangerousness standard merely requires \u2018a risk\u2019 of physical harm.\u201d We disagree. The regulations define \u201c \u2018[d]anger to self or to others\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe risk of <em>imminent </em>physical injury to others or self . . . includ [ing] the risk of loss or destruction of the property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>others.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (6). In contrast, one is \u201c \u2018dangerous to himself or herself or others\u2019 \u201d in civil commitment proceedings if there is a \u201ca substantial risk that physical harm will be inflicted by an individual upon his or her own person or upon another person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-495 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Thus, in order to meet the statutory standard, the board would have to find a substantial risk that the acquittee would harm himself or another, while, in order to meet the regulatory standard, the board would have to find an imminent risk that the acquittee would harm himself or others.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cImminent\u201d is defined as \u201cready to take place; esp: hanging threateningly over one\u2019s head . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Thus, the regulatory standard is significantly more demanding than the acquittee claims. In fact, it is difficult to perceive any meaningful difference between the standards. Certainly, if the board had believed that the acquittee\u2019s release would lead to a risk of physical injury \u201changing threateningly\u201d over the acquittee or others, it must have believed that the risk of harm was substantial. In other words, if physical injury is \u201changing threateningly\u201d over a person\u2019s head, that threat necessarily creates a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that physical harm will be inflicted upon that person. Accordingly, we reject the acquittee\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The acquittee next claims that the board\u2019s report to the court was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial because its authors inherently are biased in favor of recommitment. He argues that the board\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>mandate under \u00a7 17a-584 to consider the protection of society as its primary concern improperly biases the board in favor of commitment when its paramount consideration under the clear and convincing evidence standard should be the acquittee\u2019s liberty. In response, the state claims in the alternative that (1) the board is not biased against the acquittee and (2) even if the board is biased, the trial court, which ultimately decides whether continued commitment is appropriate, is not required to defer to the board\u2019s recommendations. Thus, the alleged bias merely effects the weight to be given to the report by the fact finder, not its admissibility. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">First, we consider whether the report was relevant. As we previously stated, evidence is relevant and, therefore, admissible if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more ... or less probable . . . . \u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1. \u201cSo long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 521, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 536, we recognized the board\u2019s psychiatric expertise and its \u201cgeneral and specific familiarity with all acquittees beginning with their initial commitment . . . .\u201d Thus, in the present case, the board\u2019s report clearly was relevant because it provided an expert assessment of the acquittee\u2019s mental state. Moreover, even if it is assumed that the board\u2019s report was biased, allegations of witness bias affect the <em>weight </em>that the fact finder gives to the evidence, not its <em>admissibility. </em>See <em>National Folding Box Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>146 Conn. 578, 586, 153 A.2d 420 (1959) (\u201cthe acceptance or rejection of an opinion of a qualified expert is a matter for the trier of fact unless the opinion is so unreasonable as to be unacceptable to a rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>mind\u201d); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 552, 757 A.2d 482 (2000) (\u201c[o]nce the trial court has served its gate-keeping function in accordance with <em>[State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 69, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998)] and determined that the expert testimony will be admitted, any challenges to the methodology used in the [expert\u2019s analytical] process generally go to the weight of the testimony and not its admissibility\u201d). The remedy is to bring the expert witness\u2019 bias to the attention of the fact finder, a remedy which the acquittee\u2019s counsel utilized in the present case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Next, we address the acquittee\u2019s alternative claim that even if the report was relevant, its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. We disagree. \u201c[T]here are situations where the potential prejudicial effect of relevant evidence would suggest its exclusion. These are: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliman, </em>214 Conn. 38, 51, 570 A.2d 680 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>We conclude that the report does not meet this standard. It contained nothing that would unduly arouse the fact finder\u2019s emotions. The report did not create a side issue or consume an undue amount of time, and the acquittee certainly anticipated the evidence because the board is required to submit this report to the trial court. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (d). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the acquittee\u2019s motion to strike the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The acquittee next claims that the trial court\u2019s admission of the board\u2019s report violated his sixth amendment rights under the confrontation clause because he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the report\u2019s authors. He claims that the report constituted inadmissible testimonial hearsay, meaning that it was a hearsay statement that otherwise would be admissible under the rules of evidence, but that could not be admitted without violating the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 50-53, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004) (admission of testimonial hearsay in criminal cases violates confrontation clause of sixth amendment to United States constitution unless witness is unavailable and defendant had prior opportunity for cross-examination). The acquittee acknowledges that the sixth amendment applies only to criminal prosecutions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He urges us to hold, however, that recommitment proceedings are criminal actions because they are similar to criminal prosecutions in many respects.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The state responds that the sixth amendment does not apply because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>recommitment proceeding is not a criminal prosecution. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The question of whether continued commitment proceedings are criminal prosecutions to which the sixth amendment applies is a question of law. Accordingly, our review is plenary. See <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 318, 803 A.2d 287 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361-69, 117 S. Ct. 2072, 138 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1997), the United States Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the commitment of prison inmates as sexually violent predators is a civil proceeding. In that case, the state of Kansas filed a petition seeking civil confinement of a prison inmate who was a pedophile pursuant to Kansas\u2019 recently enacted Sexually Violent Predator Act (act).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id., 353-54. The trial court granted the state\u2019s petition, but the state Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, holding that the act violated the inmate\u2019s substantive due process rights. Id., 355-56. Both parties appealed to the United States Supreme Court, where the inmate claimed, inter alia, that the act violated the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses of the United States constitution. Id., 350, 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The court held that these constitutional protections did not apply because the proceeding to commit the inmate was not a criminal prosecution. Id., 361, 369. In reaching this conclusion, the court observed that the two primary objectives of criminal punishment are retribution and deterrence. Id., 361-62. It concluded that, because the primary purpose of the act was to protect the public, rather than to punish the committee, the act did not establish criminal proceedings; id., 363, 369; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>and the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses, therefore, did not apply. Id., 369, 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Like the proceedings at issue in <em>Hendricks, </em>the primary purpose of continued commitment proceedings is to protect society and to treat the acquittee\u2019s mental illness, not to punish the acquittee. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Fairfield Hills Hospital, </em>215 Conn. 675, 683-84, 578 A.2d 1025 (1990) (\u201c[C]onfinement of insanity acquittees, although resulting initially from an adjudication in the criminal justice system, is not punishment for a crime. The purpose of commitment following an insanity acquittal, like that of civil commitment, is to treat the individual\u2019s mental illness and protect him and society from his potential dangerousness.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Accordingly, we conclude that continued commitment proceedings are not criminal prosecutions and, therefore, the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment does not apply and did not preclude the report\u2019s admission in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Finally, the acquittee claims that, even if we conclude that a continued commitment hearing is civil in nature, admission of the report violated the acquittee\u2019s procedural due process rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The state responds that the acquittee was provided with constitutionally adequate procedures. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The question of whether the trial court\u2019s admission of the report violated the acquittee\u2019s procedural due process rights is a question of law. Therefore, our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. The state initiated this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>action by filing a petition for continued commitment of the acquittee with the Superior Court. Pursuant to \u00a7 17a-593 (d), the board then investigated whether the acquittee was \u201ca person who should be discharged\u201d by holding an evidentiary hearing during which it heard testimony from Carol Knight, a licensed clinical social worker at Whiting, and Patrick Fox, a consulting forensic psychiatrist who had testified regularly before the board. The acquittee was represented before the board by a deputy assistant public defender. He did not call any witnesses at the hearing. Two weeks after the hearing, the board issued a written decision recommending that the court should recommit the acquittee to Whiting for a period of time not to exceed five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">On August 19, 2002, the trial court held a separate evidentiary hearing, during which it considered evidence presented by both parties in addition to the board\u2019s report. The state presented two witnesses: Enayat Khorramzadeh, the acquittee\u2019s treating psychiatrist at Whiting, and Fox. The acquittee submitted various exhibits, including the transcript from a 1994 hearing before the board, copies of treatment notes taken by the acquittee\u2019s former therapist, a psychological assessment report prepared at Whiting in 1993, and Probate Court documents appointing and later terminating a conservator for the acquittee in 1998 and 1999. Will Brady, a patient advocate at Whiting, testified on behalf of the acquittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We previously have recognized that \u201c[d]ue process is inherently fact-bound because due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. . . . The constitutional requirement of procedural due process thus invokes a balancing process that cannot take place in a factual vacuum. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court [has] set forth three factors [which this court has followed] to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>when analyzing whether an individual is constitutionally entitled to a particular judicial or administrative procedure: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). ... Due process analysis requires balancing the government\u2019s interest in existing procedures against the risk of erroneous deprivation of a private interest inherent in those procedures.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 523-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u201cThe fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard . . . [which] must be at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. . . . [T]hese principles require that a [party] have timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for [the proposed action], and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Applying the <em>Mathews </em>test to the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s admission of the report did not deprive the acquittee of a meaningful opportunity to be heard. The procedures governing the recommitment of insanity acquittees undoubtedly affect an important private interest, namely the acquittee\u2019s interest in liberty. \u201c[T]here can be no doubt that involuntary commitment to a mental hospital, like involuntary confinement of an individual for any reason, is a deprivation of liberty .... [C]ommitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>that requires due process protection . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 524. Turning to the third factor of the <em>Mathews </em>test, we also conclude that it is \u201cundisputed that the state has an interest in confining individuals who, as a result of mental illness, pose a potential danger to themselves or others.\u201d Id. It is clear, therefore, that both parties\u2019 interests are substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Accordingly, we focus our analysis on the second factor of the <em>Mathews </em>test: \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation [of the acquittee\u2019s liberty] through the procedures used . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We conclude that the procedures used in this case adequately protected the acquittee\u2019s liberty interest and that admission of the report into evidence did not deprive him of due process. The acquittee received a meaningful opportunity to be heard. He was represented by counsel before the board, and he could have presented his own witnesses at the board hearing. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-595. Thus, he had the opportunity to influence the board\u2019s decision before it even issued its report to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">At trial, the acquittee could have cross-examined all of the witnesses who testified at the board hearing, and he could have presented his own expert witness at the state\u2019s expense. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (e).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court also had access to the transcript of the board\u2019s hearing, to the acquittee\u2019s medical records, and to other pertinent documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Moreover, unlike decisions rendered by other administrative agencies, the report to which the acquittee objects is not subject to deferential review by the trial court. Compare <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>266 Conn. 492, 503, 832 A.2d 660 (2003) (describing limited standard of review for agency decisions) with General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (f) and (g) (directing trial court to consider other evidence at recommitment hearing and to draw its own factual and legal conclusions). Consequently, the acquittee was free to rebut the board\u2019s recommendation in the report by calling witnesses and by presenting his own evidence. We conclude that the acquittee was provided with constitutionally adequate procedural protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\"> An acquittee is \u201c[a] person found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect . . .
