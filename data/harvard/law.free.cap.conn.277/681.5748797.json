The plaintiffs were bom and raised in India and came to the United States to further their education. Although they own considerable property in India, the plaintiffs purchased an apartment located at 320 Central Park West in New York City in 1987. The plaintiffs purchased an additional apartment at the 320 Central Park West building in 1989, and also purchased a home in Greenwich that same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In 1989 and 1990, the plaintiffs filed capital gains, dividends and interest income tax returns in Connecticut, reporting taxes due of $95,787 and $162,005, respectively. The plaintiffs also filed Connecticut personal income tax returns for the years 1991 through 1993.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 1993, the state of New York performed a personal income tax audit on the plaintiffs for the years 1989 through 1993. The plaintiffs subsequently paid the state of New York $2.4 million to settle their tax liabilities as New York residents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They then filed amended Connecticut tax returns and claims for refunds of capital gains, dividends and interest income taxes paid from 1989 through 1993, contending that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-505,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> they were not Connecticut residents for that time period and, accordingly, were not subject to Connecticut taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The defendant granted the plaintiffs a refund for taxes paid in the years 1991 through 1993, but declined to do so for the years 1989 and 1990, stating that the three year statute of limitations provided by \u00a7 12-515 precluded him from doing so. The plaintiffs subsequently requested a hearing before the appellate division of the department of revenue services, and also requested that the defendant exercise his discretionary authority pursuant to \u00a7 12-39s; see footnote 2 of this opinion; and grant their claims for refunds of the 1989 and 1990 taxes. The defendant denied both requests, again citing the three year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the defendant\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-522.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the trial court found that the plaintiffs had filed their claims for a refund after the expiration of the statute of limitations, it nevertheless concluded that \u00a7 12-515 did not preclude the defendant<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> from exercising her discretion to refund the 1989 and 1990 taxes under \u00a7 12-39s. Accordingly, the trial court remanded the case to the defendant to consider the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for a refund under \u00a7 12-39s. The trial court \u201crecognize [d] that the [defendant] has not made a determination of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the merits of this case,\u201d and concluded that, \u201cit would be inappropriate for this court to stand in the shoes of the [defendant] and make a decision on the merits . . . .\u201d The trial court further concluded that the decision of whether to grant a refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-39s rested solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>with the defendant and stated: \u201cSince the [defendant\u2019s] decision under \u00a7 12-39s (c) cannot be appealed, this remand is a final judgment.\u201d Neither party appealed from the trial court\u2019s remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">On remand, the defendant again declined to issue the plaintiffs a refund, concluding that the requested refund was not authorized by \u00a7 12-39s (b) because the taxes in question were not \u201c \u2018erroneously or illegally collected or computed.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for judgment in the trial court, claiming that the defendant had violated the trial court\u2019s prior order by not considering the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. In denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the trial court stated that \u00a7 12-39s (c) precluded it from reviewing the defendant\u2019s decision on the merits. The trial court then rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly: (1) refused to review the question of whether the defendant complied with its remand order; (2) concluded that \u00a7 12-39s (c) precluded it from reviewing the defendant\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a refund under \u00a7 12-39s (b) because the taxes in question had not been \u201cerroneously or illegally collected or computed\u201d; and (3) interpreted \u00a7 12-39s (c) in a way that violates the constitutional guarantees of due process, equal protection and separation of powers. The defendant, in response, contends that the trial court correctly interpreted \u00a7 12-39s (c) as precluding judicial review of the defendant\u2019s decision, and also that such preclusion is constitutionally permissible. We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 second claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Because the present case involves an appeal from a decision of the defendant, \u201c[a] brief overview of the statutory scheme that governs administrative appeals ... is necessary to our resolution of this issue. There is no absolute right of appeal to the courts from a decision of an administrative agency. . . . Appeals to the courts from administrative [agencies] exist only under statutory authority .... Appellate jurisdiction is derived from the . . . statutory provisions by which it is created, and can be acquired and exercised only in the manner prescribed. ... In the absence of statutory authority, therefore, there is no right of appeal . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nine State Street, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>270 Conn. 42, 46, 850 A.2d 1032 (2004). This principle applies with equal force in tax appeals. <em>Millward Brown, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>73 Conn. App. 757, 764, 811 A.2d 717 (2002) (\u201c[f]or jurisdictional purposes ... we can see no distinction between tax appeals and other statutory appeals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Although a statutory scheme exists to provide refunds to taxpayers who have overpaid their capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>gains, dividends and interest income taxes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it is undisputed that the plaintiffs seek to recover taxes paid beyond the three year statute of limitations provided by \u00a7 12-515. See footnote 4 of this opinion. The plaintiffs, therefore, seek to recover under \u00a7 12-39s, which permits the defendant to refund the improperly paid taxes despite the untimeliness of their request. Whether the defendant\u2019s decision to deny their request under \u00a7 12-39s is appealable is an issue of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\u201cThe issue before this court involves a question of statutory interpretation that . . . requires our plenary review. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005). Moreover, in seeking to ascertain the meaning of a statute, we must consider General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z, which provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Accordingly, we begin with the language of the applicable statutes. Section 12-522, the statute under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the plaintiffs appealed, provides that \u201cany person aggrieved because of any order, decision, determination or disallowance of the Commissioner of Revenue Services <em>under the provisions of this chapter </em>may . . . take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, \u00a7 12-522 does not permit an appeal from the defendant\u2019s decision to deny a refund requested pursuant to \u00a7 12-39s. In fact, the application of \u00a7 12-522 is explicitly limited to denials made \u201cunder the provisions of [chapter 224 of title 12 of the General Statutes] . ...\u201d In contrast \u00a7 12-39s is contained in chapter 202 of title 12 of the General Statutes and is, therefore, beyond the ambit of \u00a7 12-522.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Moreover, \u00a7 12-39s (c), which provides that \u00a7 12-39s \u201cshall not be construed as authorizing suit against the state by a person against whom any tax, penalty or interest has been erroneously or illegally assessed or from whom any tax, penalty or interest has been erroneously or illegally collected and shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity,\u201d expressly precludes judicial review of the defendant\u2019s decision. Notwithstanding the plaintiffs\u2019 contention to the contrary, the term \u201csuit,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 12-39s, includes the present appeal. \u201cIn the absence of a statutory definition, words and phrases in a particular statute are to be construed according to their common usage. ... To ascertain that usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New England Pipe Corp. </em>v. <em>Northeast Corridor Foundation, </em>271 Conn. 329, 336, 857 A.2d 348 (2004); General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). The word \u201csuit,\u201d which previously has not been defined in the context of \u00a7 12-39s by either the legislature or the courts, is commonly understood as \u201c[a] court proceeding to recover a right or claim.\u201d American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2002). Clearly, the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to secure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>tax refund through this appeal falls within the definition of the word \u201csuit,\u201d especially because tax appeals are tried de novo, without the deference that characterizes other administrative appeals. See, <em>e.g., Leonard v. Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>264 Conn. 286, 294, 823 A.2d 1184 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Additionally, it is axiomatic that we strictly construe legislative exceptions to the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 312, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). \u201cTherefore, because the state has permitted itself to be sued in certain circumstances, this court has recognized the well established principle that statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity should be strictly construed. . . . Where there is any doubt about their meaning or intent they are given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The plaintiffs attempt to circumvent the explicit preservation of sovereign immunity contained in \u00a7 12-39s (c) by arguing that the legislature has waived sovereign immunity by enacting \u00a7\u00a7 12-515 and 12-522. The plaintiffs overlook, however, the fact that the legislature explicitly provided a three year limitation on a taxpayer\u2019s remedies under those sections. \u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute. . . . Moreover, statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>254 Conn. 578, 602, 758 A.2d 327 (2000). The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation renders the second clause of \u00a7 12-39s (c) meaningless by permitting suit in the face of a clear mandate that \u00a7 12-39s does not vitiate sovereign immunity. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-39s (c). \u201cWhen one construction thwarts the purpose of an enactment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>another does not, the latter construction, where possible, is preferred.\u201d <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 288, 130 A.2d 293 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Furthermore, \u00a7 12-39s (b) specifically provides that the defendant <em>\u201cof h[er] own motion, is authorized, </em>if [she] determines that any tax, penalty or interest has been . . . erroneously or illegally collected or computed, to credit such amount against any amounts then due and payable from such person . . . and to refund, upon order of the Comptroller, the balance, if any, to such person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As the statute\u2019s plain language indicates, it is permissive in nature and does not <em>require </em>the defendant to refund money to a taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Finally, the legislative genealogy and history of \u00a7 12-39s indicate that our construction of the statute is consistent with its intended purpose. Section 12-39s was intended to serve as a legislative grace provision, allowing the defendant to grant a discretionary refund where one ordinarily would no longer be available. In fact, the statutes predating \u00a7 12-39s, namely, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 12-425 (l)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 12-549,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>clearly <em>mandated </em>that the defendant refund improperly paid sales and use and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, whereas \u00a7 12-39s merely <em>permits </em>the granting of refunds. \u201cWhen the legislature amends the language of a statute, it is presumed that it intended to change the meaning of the statute and to accomplish some purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>227 Conn. 534, 543, 630 A.2d 1059 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislative debates to suggest that \u00a7 12-39s required the repayment of improperly paid taxes. Rather, the remarks of Gene Gavin, former commissioner of revenue services, before the Joint Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue and Bonding, indicate that \u00a7 12-39s was characterized as a permissive statute granting the defendant the <em>ability </em>to refund taxes that were incorrectly paid. See, e.g., Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Finance, Revenue and Bonding, Pt. 1,1995 Sess., p. 105, remarks of Commissioner Gavin (\u201cAnother one of our proposals is [this bill, which] insures that the [Commissioner <em>can </em>redress any problems that may arise when taxes have been illegally or erroneously assessed or credited. . . . This will be especially important [when], for example, an income tax liability is assessed, but the taxpayer does not protest within the [sixty] day statutory period. Even though the taxpayer presents proof that he has no tax liability, under current law, the [department of [rjevenue [s]ervices cannot cancel the assessment. This bill will afford us the <em>ability </em>to cancel the assessment . . . .\u201d [Emphasis added.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that refunds under \u00a7 12-39s are committed to the defendant\u2019s sole discretion, and that it was, therefore, without jurisdiction to evaluate the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for a refund under \u00a7 12-39s (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We now turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-39s (c) as precluding judicial review of the defendant\u2019s decision raises several constitutional issues. Specifically, the plaintiffs aver that the prohibition of judicial review mandated by \u00a7 12-39s (c) violates: (1) the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions; (2) the separation of powers clause of the state constitution; and (3) the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that only one of the previously mentioned constitutional issues was raised before the trial court, namely, whether \u00a7 12-39s (c) violates the federal constitutional due process clause. Additionally, the plaintiffs do not seek review of their other federal claims in this court under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and did not, before either this court or the trial court, provide independent analysis of their state constitutional claims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>270 Conn. 516, 518 n.1, 853 A.2d 105 (2004) (\u201c\u2018[w]e have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the [claimant] has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we confine our review to the plaintiffs\u2019 federal due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\u201cProcedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of \u2018liberty\u2019 or \u2018property\u2019 interests within the meaning of the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause of the . . . [fourteenth [a]mendment.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). We have previously stated that \u201c[o]ur due process inquiry takes the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>of a two part analysis. [W]e must determine whether [the plaintiff] was deprived of a protected interest, and, if so, what process was . . . due.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 499, 778 A.2d 33 (2001). \u201cTo have a property interest ... a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. It is well established that the assessment and collection of taxes constitutes a deprivation of property that requires the state to provide appropriate procedural safeguards. See, e.g., <em>McKesson Corp. </em>v. <em>Florida Alcohol &amp; Tobacco Division, </em>496 U.S. 18, 36, 110 S. Ct. 2238, 110 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\u201cTo protect government\u2019s exceedingly strong interest in financial stability in this context, [the United States Supreme Court has] long held that a [s]tate may employ various financial sanctions and summary remedies . . . in order to encourage taxpayers to make timely payments prior to resolution of any dispute over the validity of the tax assessment.\u201d Id., 37. Additionally, \u201c[s]tates may avail themselves of a variety of procedural protections against any disruptive effects of a tax scheme\u2019s invalidation, such as providing by statute that refunds will be available to only those taxpayers paying under protest, or enforcing relatively short statutes of limitation applicable to refund actions.\u201d Id., 50. Indeed, such procedural devices secure the state\u2019s ability to engage in stable financial planning. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Clearly, the state has provided a meaningful and comprehensive administrative process for refund claims made within the applicable statute of limitations, including judicial review of denials. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-515 et seq. The plaintiffs cannot, therefore, seriously contend that the state was <em>obliged </em>to enact \u00a7 12-39s to provide relief for taxpayers whose claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>have lapsed. The plaintiffs\u2019 failure timely to invoke the normal administrative remedy process does not render unconstitutional an otherwise proper administrative scheme. The three year statute of limitations balances the state\u2019s important interest in financial stability with the plaintiffs\u2019 interest in recouping their allegedly improper payment of taxes. Section 12-39s is, therefore, a matter of legislative grace that does not give rise to a constitutionally protected property interest. Thus, we agree with the defendant\u2019s conclusion that \u201cwhen the three year statute of limitations period contained in [\u00a7 12-515] expired, so too did the plaintiffs\u2019 protected property interest in the taxes that were the subject of their claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\"> At the time of the initiation of the underlying proceedings, Gene Gavin was the commissioner of revenue services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-39s provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The Commissioner of Revenue Services, of his own motion, is authorized, where any tax, penalty or interest has been erroneously or illegally assessed against any person by said commissioner, to cancel the unpaid portion of such tax, penalty or interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\u201c(b) The Commissioner of Revenue Services, of his own motion, is authorized, if the commissioner determines that any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or computed, to credit such amount against any amounts then due and payable from such person to said commissioner and to refund, upon order of the Comptroller, the balance, if any, to such person.

The trial court, in its memorandum of decision following the plaintiffs\u2019 first appeal, had ordered the defendant to <em>\u201cconsider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim </em>pursuant to \u00a7 12-39s, without considering the statute of limitations in \u00a7 12-515.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the trial court did not state explicitly that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>had complied with its previous order, it noted that the plaintiffs essentially had requested that it <em>reexamine </em>the defendant\u2019s decision not to grant a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The plaintiffs, unhappy with the defendant\u2019s refusal to grant them a refund despite the trial court\u2019s holding that the statute of limitations did not preclude her from doing so, now seek review on the merits of the defendant\u2019s decision under the auspices of enforcing the trial court\u2019s original order. Significantly, the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in support of this claim address the question of whether the defendant properly construed \u00a7 12-39s (b) in denying their refund request. For example, in their brief to this court, the plaintiffs argue that the defendant did not comply with the trial court\u2019s order because she failed to \u201cproperly interpret or apply [\u00a7 12-39s].\u201d Plainly, their arguments address the merits of the defendant\u2019s substantive decision not to issue a refund, not her compliance with the court\u2019s order to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> Normally, a taxpayer who believes that he has overpaid his dividends, capital gains and interest income taxes may file a written claim for a refund with the defendant under \u00a7 12-515.
