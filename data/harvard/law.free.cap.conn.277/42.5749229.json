The defendant raises two issues on appeal, the first of which contains several subparts. First, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court\u2019s admission of a third party\u2019s prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986): (1) did not violate <em>Whelan's </em>requirement of personal knowledge; (2) satisfied the requirements of the dual inculpatory statement and adoptive admission exceptions to the rule against hearsay; and (3) did not abridge the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>83 Conn. App. 28, 33-42, 847 A.2d 1064 (2004). Second, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that his right to counsel failed to attach upon the signing of an information by the state. Id., 32. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>As part of a six count information, the defendant was charged with capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b, murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>53SL-54C,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>two counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the defendant moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>to suppress written and oral statements obtained by the police on June 14 and 24, 1999, based upon the argument that his right to counsel had attached upon the state\u2019s signing of an information on May 13, 1999. Additionally, during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant objected to the admission for substantive purposes, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 743, of a prior inconsistent statement from a third party witness containing out-of-court statements that incriminated the defendant in the alleged crimes. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress statements he had made to the police, and overruled his objection to the admissibility of the prior inconsistent statement of the third party. The jury subsequently found the defendant not guilty of the capital felony and the murder charges. It found the defendant guilty, however, of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55,* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and also found the defendant guilty of felony murder, kidnapping and robbery. The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. The defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claims and affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction on all counts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 42. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 22,1998, at approximately 11 p.m., the victim, James Connor, visited his parents on their boat located at the Essex Marina. A short time later, the victim borrowed his father\u2019s car, a light colored Saab, and informed him that he was going to the Black Seal, a restaurant and bar located near the marina. The victim left the Black Seal prior to 1:30 a.m., at which point he placed a telephone call from his father\u2019s place of business to Lucky\u2019s Caf\u00e9 (Lucky\u2019s), a bar located in New London. Between the hours of 1:30 a.m. and 2 a.m., the victim arrived at Lucky\u2019s and sought to purchase a small quantity of crack cocaine from the defendant. The defendant had arrived at Lucky\u2019s at approximately 10 p.m. with two friends, Abin Britton and Jeffrey Smith, as well as Smith\u2019s friend, Junito Jarvis. The defendant informed the victim that he did not have any drugs with him, but that he could get some from his home, which was located on Michael Road in New London. The victim offered to drive the defendant to the defendant\u2019s home in order to obtain the cocaine and then to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>him back to Lucky\u2019s once the transaction was complete. The defendant agreed, and instructed Smith and Britton to wait for him at Lucky\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Shortly after the victim and the defendant left the bar, at Smith\u2019s request, Jarvis drove Britton and Smith to the defendant\u2019s home. Upon parking at the defendant\u2019s apartment building, Jarvis observed the defendant exit the building and approach another vehicle that appeared to be a light colored Saab. The defendant stood next to the driver\u2019s side window and proceeded to have a conversation with the driver of the vehicle. A short time later, Smith and Britton exited Jarvis\u2019 vehicle and joined the defendant\u2019s conversation. The defendant, Smith and Britton then entered the Saab, and a struggle ensued. Jarvis observed the defendant, Smith and Britton pull the driver out of the vehicle, then punch and kick him for several minutes. All three individuals loaded the driver of the Saab into the backseat, at which point they reentered the vehicle, and the defendant drove the Saab out of the housing development. Jarvis did not see the defendant, Britton or Smith again that evening and subsequently drove his own vehicle home. When Jarvis visited Smith at his apartment several days later, Smith revealed several additional details about the incident. Specifically, Smith stated that the individual whom Jarvis had observed in the Saab died after Britton had choked him and hit him in the face with a pipe. Smith also expressed concern to Jarvis over where he, the defendant and Britton had buried the body and asked for assistance from Jarvis in buying concrete in order further to conceal any evidence of the incident. Jarvis refused to provide Smith with any assistance, and never spoke about the incident with him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">On August 23, 1998, at approximately 6:30 a.m., Harrison Fortier, a sergeant with the Waterford police department, was called upon to investigate a Saab that was partially submerged in the town\u2019s duck pond. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Fortier arrived at the scene, the driver\u2019s side door of the car was open, the transmission was in neutral, the keys were missing, and the parking brake was disengaged. In addition, there were bloodstains throughout the interior of the vehicle. A search of motor vehicle records revealed that the Saab was registered to Donald Connor, the victim\u2019s father. Upon further examination of the vehicle, the police also discovered two palm prints, which Christopher Grice, a criminalist for the state forensic laboratory, later identified as matching Britton\u2019s palms. Additionally, a further review of the vehicle\u2019s contents revealed that four chrome plated brass pipes were missing from the Saab\u2019s trunk. Among the items found in the car was a card for Lucky\u2019s, with the handwritten number that the victim had called the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On January 10, 1999, the badly decomposed remains of a body were found in Bates Woods, a recreation area in New London located across from Michael Road, where the defendant lived. Upon examining the skull found at the scene, Harold Wayne Carver II, chief medical examiner for the state of Connecticut, identified the remains as belonging to the victim and classified the manner of death as a homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">On two separate occasions, one in the fall of 1998, and the other in the late winter of 1999, Amanda Blackmon, a friend of the defendant, Britton and Smith, overheard conversations in which the defendant made incriminating statements regarding the victim\u2019s death. Specifically, on October 31, 1998, Blackmon attended a party with all three individuals, and during an unrelated disturbance at the party, she heard the defendant say, \u201cFlick them niggers. We\u2019ll kill them and bury them too.\u201d Similarly, in February, 1999, at a birthday party that Blackmon attended with the defendant, Britton and Smith, she observed that at one point during the party Britton looked as if he were depressed and had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>crying. She then overheard the defendant tell Britton that \u201cif he keep[s] his mouth shut, the cops had nothing on them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">During the course of their investigation into the victim\u2019s death, the police questioned the defendant several times and obtained several written and oral statements from him. Initially, the defendant met with Detective Anthony Buglione, of the Connecticut state police, on February 10, 1999, and provided a written statement after being advised of and waiving his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). As part of this statement, the defendant denied playing any role in the incident or having any information regarding involvement by Britton or Smith. Buglione met with the defendant once again on March 1,1999, at which point Buglione advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant provided a second written statement to police, now acknowledging that he had met the victim at Lucky\u2019s with Britton and Smith, and that he had agreed to sell the victim crack cocaine. The defendant stated that the victim had driven him to the defendant\u2019s home in order to complete the transaction, and that the victim had waited outside in his Saab while the defendant went upstairs to get the drugs out of his apartment. The defendant next claimed that, as he was coming out of his apartment, he observed Britton beat the victim, throw him into the back of the Saab, and drive away. The defendant further claimed that he never saw the victim again, but that the victim was alive when Britton left the defendant\u2019s apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">On March 8, 1999, the defendant met with Detective James McGlynn, of the Connecticut state police, and Detective David Gigliotti, of the New London police department, in his home, where he provided them with a third written statement after again having been advised of and waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the defendant told the detectives that, when he was returning to the parking lot to complete the drug transaction, he could see both Smith and Britton beating the victim. The defendant claimed that Britton later told him that after beating the victim in the parking lot, he and Smith took the victim in his Saab to Bates Woods, beat him some more, and then left him for dead. Additionally, the defendant told McGlynn and Gigliotti that he later had learned that, upon returning a few hours later, Britton and Smith found the victim still alive, at which point Britton killed the victim by shoving a pipe into the victim\u2019s mouth. Britton and Smith then dragged the victim\u2019s body into the woods and covered it with a black plastic bag, garbage and dirt. The defendant also informed the police that the only other person who knew about the murder was Norman Carr, a friend of the defendant, Britton and Smith, because Britton had told Carr about the murder while all four men were working together at Quality Cleaners.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">On May 13, 1999, the police obtained a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest in connection with the victim\u2019s murder. The police eventually apprehended the defendant on June 14,1999, in Garden City, New York. While in custody, the defendant gave yet another written statement to the police after having been advised of and waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In this statement, although the defendant maintained that Britton and Smith were the ones who had beaten the victim in the parking lot of the defendant\u2019s home, he acknowledged that he had assisted in loading the victim into the back of the Saab and that he had accompanied Britton and Smith to Bates Woods. The defendant told police that Britton had stripped the victim completely naked and proceeded to beat the victim with a silver pipe that Britton had found in the trunk of the Saab. As part of this statement, the defendant claimed that he left Bates Woods separately from Britton and Smith, and that Britton later informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>him. that he and Smith had returned to Bates Woods in the very early morning and had discovered that the victim was still breathing. The defendant told police that Britton later confessed to him that he had killed the victim by shoving a pipe into the victim\u2019s mouth, and that Britton and Smith subsequently disposed of the victim\u2019s body in Bates Woods by dragging it out of view, pouring bleach on it to conceal the smell, and covering it with black plastic bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the felony murder, kidnapping and robbery counts, and also found the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of eighty-five years imprisonment. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">ADMISSIBILITY OF PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT OF THIRD PARTY</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court properly had admitted for substantive purposes, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 743, a prior inconsistent statement from a third party witness containing out-of-court statements that incriminated the defendant. Specifically, the defendant contends that certain out-of-court statements made by Britton referred to within the prior inconsistent statement of Carr should not have been deemed admissible because the admission of Carr\u2019s prior inconsistent statement: (1) violated Whelan\u2019s requirement that the declarant have personal knowledge of the incident; (2) failed to satisfy the requirements of the dual inculpatory statement and adoptive admission exceptions to the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>against heat-say; and (3) abridged the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to confront the witnesses against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The following additional facts relevant to this claim are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThe state called [Carr] as a witness during its case-in-chief. Caix was friendly with the defendant and the two codefendants, [Britton] and [Smith]. On February 16, 1999, Carr provided the state police with a seven page written statement at his attorney\u2019s office, describing certain incriminating statements made by Britton and the defendant in Carr\u2019s presence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>83 Conn. App. 33. \u201cCarr\u2019s statement was a description of what he heard the defendant and Britton say about the victim\u2019s homicide. Carr stated that the conversation took place sometime in the summer of 1998, possibly late August or September, when he, the defendant and Britton sat in the back of a company van while returning from a work site. According to Carr\u2019s statement, Britton began by describing how the victim came into [Lucky\u2019s], attempting to purchase some crack cocaine. Britton said that he drove with the victim in the victim\u2019s Saab to the defendant\u2019s apartment in New London to execute a drug sale. The defendant, Smith and [Jarvis] followed them in a separate car. [As described in detail in footnote 6 of this opinion] Carr\u2019s statement provided, in relevant part, as follows . . . \u2018[Britton] and [the defendant] then said that after they beat the guy, they put the guy back inside the Saab and drove him to Bates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Woods behind the dog pound. [Britton] and [the defendant] then said that once they arrived at Bates Woods parking lot, they took the guy out from the car and again started to beat on him. [Britton] started to brag and said that he took a pole and placed it into the guy\u2019s mouth. [Britton] said that he really jammed the pole down his throat and then twisted the pole to break his neck. [Britton] said that prior to doing this with the pole, the guy was still alive but after he did this, the guy died immediately.\u2019 \u201d Id., 33-34 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u201cDuring his testimony at trial, however, Carr insisted that he never had heard Britton or the defendant discuss the killing of the victim. He maintained that any assertion to the contrary in his February 16, 1999 written statement to the police was false.\u201d Id., 33-34. \u201cCarr testified that he had known the defendant and Britton for approximately two years before the summer of 1998. Carr described himself as friendly with both men and testified that they all had socialized and worked together. He testified that he had frequented [Lucky\u2019s] in New London, where the victim sought to purchase crack cocaine on August 23,1998. He also testified that he had visited the defendant\u2019s apartment on Michael Road.\u201d Id., 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following additional facts. With respect to Carr\u2019s written statement, Carr required that he be interviewed by McGlynn and Gigliotti at the office of his attorney, Peter Rotella, and that his attorney be present while he gave his statement to the police. At the conclusion of the police interview, Carr carefully reviewed the written summary prepared by McGlynn, edited portions of it with the assistance of McGlynn and, prior to signing it, met privately with his attorney for approximately twenty minutes. After meeting with his attorney in private, Carr and the investigating detectives all signed each page of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the statement in the presence of Carr\u2019s attorney, thus attesting to the statement\u2019s accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">When Carr took the stand at trial, he acknowledged having met with police at his attorney\u2019s office and that the police had prepared a written statement for his review. He confirmed that his signature was on each page of the written statement that had been presented to him by the police, but denied ever actually having reported the incident to the police as was memorialized in his written statement. Rather, Carr testified that the police had pieced the statement together from other sources and presented it as a finished document for him to sign. Additionally, Carr acknowledged that he had ridden with the defendant and Britton in the back of a van while working with them at Quality Cleaners, but claimed that he did not remember having had a prolonged conversation with either individual while returning from the job site. Similarly, during cross-examination, Carr claimed that he did not remember either Britton or the defendant having made any of the statements referred to in his written statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Personal Knowledge Requirement of <em>Whelan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Before turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s first claim, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cThe admissibility of evidence, including the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>Whelan, </em>is a matter within the . . . discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 596, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. ... On review by this court, therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>George </em>B., 258 Conn. 779, 791, 785 A.2d 573 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, [200 Conn. 751-53] we reviewed our continued adherence to the traditional rule prohibiting the use as substantive evidence of a prior inconsistent out-of-court statement of a nonparty witness. We rejected the traditional view and joined the growing number of jurisdictions that allow prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence when the declarant takes the stand and is available for cross-examination. ... In deciding to abandon the common law rule, we relied on the assessment of various legal scholars and commentators that the reasons behind the rule do not apply when the witness testifies and is available for cross-examination: [W]hen the declarant is available for cross-examination the jury has the opportunity to observe him as he repudiates or varies his former statement. The cross-examination to which a recanting witness will be subjected is likely to be meaningful because the witness will be forced either to explain the discrepancies between the earlier statements and his present testimony, or to deny that the earlier statement was made at all. If, from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude that what he says now is not the truth, but what he said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court. . . . The jury can, therefore, determine whether to believe the present testimony, the prior statement, or neither. . . . Quite simply, when the declarant is in court, under oath, and subject to cross-examination before the factfinder concerning both his out-of-court and in-court statements, the usual dangers of hearsay are largely nonexistent. . . . These considerations convinced us that the prevailing reasons for refusing to allow any prior inconsistent statement to be used as substantive evidence are no longer valid. . . . We concluded that an exception to the hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>rule is necessary to allow the trial court to admit for substantive purposes prior inconsistent statements given under prescribed circumstances reasonably assuring reliability. ... We therefore adopted a rule allowing the substantive use of prior written inconsistent statements where the declarant: (1) has signed the statement; (2) has personal knowledge of the facts stated; and (3) testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>221 Conn. 93, 98-99, 602 A.2d 581 (1992). This rule has also been codified in \u00a7 8-5 (1) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which incorporates all of the developments and clarifications of the <em>Whelan </em>rule that have occurred since <em>Whelan </em>was decided. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>260 Conn. 730, 737 n.5, 799 A.2d 1056 (2002); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-5 (1), commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The defendant first asserts that Carr\u2019s prior inconsistent statement should have been deemed inadmissible because it does not satisfy the requirement set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753, that the declarant have \u201cpersonal knowledge of the facts stated . . . .\u201d Specifically, the defendant claims that Carr\u2019s statement is inadmissible because it was not reflective of any personal knowledge Carr had of the facts underlying what was told to him. The defendant\u2019s argument relies on the reasoning and the rule of law set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>16 Conn. App. 390, 399, 547 A.2d 916, cert. denied, 210 Conn. 802, 553 A.2d 616 (1988), in which the Appellate Court concluded that, \u201cin order for a prior inconsistent statement containing statements of a third party to be admissible as substantive evidence the declarant must have personal knowledge of the facts underlying the statement and not just personal knowledge that the statement was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, we have on multiple occasions rejected the Appellate Court\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>pretation of the <em>Whelan </em>\u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d requirement. Most notably, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 99, we concluded \u201cthat the personal knowledge prong of the <em>Whelan </em>rule does not require that the declarant have witnessed the commission of the crime that is the subject of the prior inconsistent written or recorded statement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Additionally, we have noted that \u201c[i]f the substance of the prior inconsistent statement of a witness is an admission made by the defendant to the witness, the witness has \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 of that admission, within the meaning of <em>Whelan. </em>Thus, as long as the witness\u2019 statement meets the other requirements for admissibility under <em>Whelan, </em>and the words spoken by the defendant to the witness, as related in the witness\u2019 prior statement, would be admissible as an admission by the defendant if testified to by the witness, the \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 prong of <em>Whelan </em>is satisfied.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>227 Conn. 1, 22, 629 A.2d 386 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The defendant conceded at oral argument before this court that <em>Grant </em>and <em>Woodson </em>reject <em>Green\u2019s </em>requirement that personal knowledge must be knowledge of the facts underlying the statement. Essentially, the defendant is asking us to overrule our prior holdings in <em>Grant </em>and <em>Woodson, </em>and to retreat to the interpretation of the personal knowledge requirement espoused by the Appellate Court in <em>Green. </em>We are not inclined to do so, particularly in light of the fact that, as noted previously, the <em>Whelan </em>rule and all of the developments and clarifications of the rule that have occurred since <em>Whelan </em>was decided, have been codified in \u00a7 8-5 (1) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The judges of the Superior Court adopted the Connecticut Code of Evidence (code) in June, 1999, with the intent of codifying Connecticut evidentiary case law. See D. Borden, \u201cThe New Code of Evidence: A (Very) Brief Introduction and Overview,\u201d 73 Conn. B.J. 210, 211-12 (1999). Significantly, \u201cthe [c]ode cannot be properly understood without reference to the accompanying [c]ommentary. The [commentary provides the necessary context for the text of the [c]ode, and the text of the [c]ode expresses in general terms the rules of evidence that the cases cited in the [c]ommentary have established.\u201d Id., 212. Additionally, \u201cthe [j]udges took an unusual step when they formally adopted the [c]ode. Unlike other situations, in which the [j]udges, when voting on rules, are guided by but do not formally adopt the commentary submitted by the [r]ules [c]ommittee that normally accompanies proposed rule changes, in adopting the [c]ode the [j]udges formally adopted the [c]ommentary as well. This is the first time that the [j]udges have done so. Thus, the [c]ode must be read together with its [c]ommentary in order for it to be fully and properly understood.\u201d Id., 213. Therefore, the personal knowledge prong of the <em>Whelan </em>rule, as codified by the requirements of \u00a7 8-5 (1) (C) of the code, must be understood as also incorporating our holdings in <em>Grant </em>and <em>Woodson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Furthermore, when evaluating whether the requirements of the personal knowledge requirement have been met, we are mindful that the requirement was included in the <em>Whelan </em>rule at least in part to ensure that the statement was trustworthy and reliable. In deciding Whelan, we \u201cemphasized that a prior inconsistent statement had to be given under circumstances ensuring its reliability and trustworthiness in order to be admissible. We therefore declined to allow prior oral statements of a witness to be used as substantive evidence, limit[ing] substantive admissibility of prior inconsistent state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ments to situations in which the likelihood of fabrication is slight and the risk of coercion, influence or deception is greatly reduced. . . . While we noted that the requirement that prior statements be written and signed is not an absolute guaranty of reliability, it does provide significant assurance of an accurate rendition of the statement and that the declarant realized it would be relied upon.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 100. Furthermore, we are mindful of the fact that \u201ca prior inconsistent statement that fulfills the <em>Whelan </em>requirements may have been made under circumstances so unduly coercive or extreme as to grievously undermine the reliability generally inherent in such a statement, so as to render it, in effect, not that of the witness. In such circumstances, the trial court must act as a gatekeeper to ensure that the statement does not go to the juiy for substantive purposes. We emphasize, however, that the linchpin of admissibility is reliability: the statement may be excluded as substantive evidence only if the trial court is persuaded, in light of the circumstances under which the statement was made, that the statement is so untrustworthy that its admission into evidence would subvert the fairness of the fact-finding process. In the absence of such a showing by the party seeking to exclude a statement that meets the <em>Whelan </em>criteria, the statement is admissible as substantive evidence; like all other evidence, its credibility is grist for the cross-examination mill.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 306-307, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Applying this reasoning in the context of the present case, we note that Carr\u2019s written statement to the police bears several indicia of reliability that weigh in favor of admitting it into evidence, and permitting the jury to determine for itself whether to credit Carr\u2019s trial testimony, his prior inconsistent statement, or neither. First, at Carr\u2019s insistence, his statement was taken at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>attorney\u2019s office, and his attorney was present during police questioning. Additionally, Carr reviewed his written statement with his attorney for approximately twenty minutes and then signed the document in eight different places, thus greatly reducing the threat of coercion or undue influence. Furthermore, Carr indicated that he was giving the statement of his own free will, and by allowing his conversation with the police to be recorded, it is reasonable to conclude that he understood that the statements likely would be relied upon in a subsequent prosecution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 23. Moreover, we note that making false statements to the police could have subjected Carr to criminal prosecution, thus placing further incentive for Carr to report truthfully and accurately what was told to him by Britton and the defendant. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-157b; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 23. In light of all of these considerations, we conclude that Carr\u2019s written statement to police had sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Finally, we have not located any precedent from other jurisdictions that suggests a retreat from our holdings in <em>Grant </em>and <em>Woodson </em>is warranted. In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of the fact that some jurisdictions have decided to adopt a \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d standard more akin to the rule set forth by the Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 400, wherein it is necessary to demonstrate that the declarant had personal knowledge of the facts underlying the statement that was made.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By contrast, however, some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>jurisdictions appear not to have implemented apersonal knowledge standard, opting instead for a standard that hinges more upon whether the defendant is in court and subject to cross-examination.* ******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In short, we are not aware of the development of such a consensus in favor of requiring the declarant to have personal knowledge of the facts underlying his statement that would argue in favor of revisiting and possibly reversing our prior rejection of such a standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The defendant\u2019s remaining claims with respect to the admissibility of Carr\u2019s prior inconsistent statement center on two issues. First, the defendant claims that Carr\u2019s statement actually contains hearsay within hearsay, and that the trial court improperly concluded that Britton\u2019s statements recounted within Carr\u2019s statement to the police were admissible under the dual inculpatory statement and adoptive admission exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Second, the defendant claims that the admission of Carr\u2019s statement unconstitutionally abridged his right to confront the witnesses against him. We now address each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Admissibility of Hearsay within Carr\u2019s Prior Inconsistent Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201cThe law regarding out-of-court statements admitted for the truth therein is well settled. An out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay. ... As a general rule, such hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>268 Conn. 351, 360, 844 A.2d 191 (2004), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 633, 835 A.2d 895 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Carr\u2019s written statement to police contains two levels of hearsay. First, Carr\u2019s written statement itself constitutes hearsay because it is a statement that differs from the one made by Carr while testifying at trial that was offered into evidence for the truth of the matter asserted. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-1 (3). Second, contained within Carr\u2019s written statement to police are the alleged statements made to Carr by Britton detailing the participation of Britton and the defendant in the victim\u2019s murder. \u201cHearsay within hearsay is admissible only if each part of the combined statements is independently admissible under a hearsay exception.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-7; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 802, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998) (\u201c[w]hen a statement is offered that contains hearsay within hearsay, each level of hearsay must itself be supported by an exception to the hearsay rule in order for that level of hearsay to be admissible\u201d); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988 &amp; Sup. 1998) \u00a7 11.14.5, pp. 229-30 and p. 389; 2 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 324.1, pp. 368-70. Therefore, in order for the full content of Carr\u2019s written statement to police to be admissible for substantive purposes, the statement itself must not only be admissible under the <em>Whelan </em>rule, as dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>cussed in part I A of this opinion, but the statements made to Carr by Britton linking himself and the defendant to the victim\u2019s murder must be admissible in their own right under separate hearsay exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The state contends that Britton\u2019s statements to Carr, as memorialized in Carr\u2019s written statement to the police, properly were admitted into evidence against the defendant as a dual inculpatory statement and an adoptive admission. The defendant claims that, even if Carr\u2019s statement meets the personal knowledge standard and fulfills all of the other prongs of <em>Whelan </em>as an admissible prior inconsistent statement, it did not satisfy the requirements of the dual inculpatory statement and adoptive admission exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Specifically, the defendant attempts to discredit the reliability and trustworthiness of Britton\u2019s admissions to Carr by claiming that Carr\u2019s statement was not articulated with sufficient precision to allow one to determine whether Britton, the defendant, or Smith was actually the individual carrying out the crime. Consequently, the defendant argues, it is impossible to determine whether Britton was making a statement against his penal interest, or merely reporting on someone else\u2019s conduct. Similarly, in light of this confusion, the defendant contends that one cannot conclude that the defendant intended to adopt Britton\u2019s confession as his own. We are not persuaded. After reviewing Carr\u2019s written statement to police; see footnote 6 of this opinion; we agree with the state that a fair reading of the written statement, viewed through the lens of common sense, makes it abundantly clear that the statements attributed to Britton subject both Britton and the defendant to criminal liability. In our estimation, the defendant\u2019s argument focuses on discreet passages of the statement, searching for slight vagaries in language that, when viewed in isolation, confuse what is clear when the statement is read as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In light of our previous conclusion, we agree with the state that Carr\u2019s prior inconsistent statement is admissible under <em>Whelan, </em>and that Britton\u2019s statements to Carr inculpating both himself and the defendant are independently admissible under separate hearsay exceptions. Specifically, as explained further in part I B 1 and 2 of this opinion, Britton\u2019s statements to Carr are admissible as statements against Britton\u2019s penal interest, and the details of Britton\u2019s statement inculpating the defendant are admissible against the defendant as adoptive admissions. We note, however, that in light of our previous holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 22, wherein we stated that \u201c [i]f the substance of the prior inconsistent statement of a witness is an admission <em>made by the defendant to the witness, </em>the witness has \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 of that admission, within the meaning of Whelan(emphasis added); our conclusion regarding admissibility is dependent on the fact that the defendant also was present while Britton made his statements against penal interest to Carr. As discussed in more detail in part I B 2 of this opinion, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the statements made by Britton linking him to the victim\u2019s murder qualifies under the adoptive admission exception to the rule against hearsay, thus permitting the inference that the defendant was adopting Britton\u2019s statements as his own. In this sense, the admissibility of Britton\u2019s statements against the penal interest of the defendant are still within the personal knowledge requirements of <em>Woodson </em>because, by way of the defendant\u2019s adoption of Britton\u2019s statements, it is as if the \u201cwords [were] spoken by the defendant to the witness\u201d himself. Id. By contrast, if the defendant had not been present when Britton made his statements against penal interest to Carr, the defendant would not have had the opportunity to adopt those statements. Consequently, Britton, rather than the defendant, would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the only individual making statements to the witness that inculpated the defendant, thus possibly requiring a further extension of the personal knowledge prong of <em>Whelan </em>beyond our holding in <em>Woodson. </em>We need not reach this question, however, because, within the context of this case, the defendant was present when Britton\u2019s statements against penal interest were made and the defendant can be deemed to have adopted Brit-ton\u2019s admissions to the witness as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Britton\u2019s Statements Against Penal Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The state offered Britton\u2019s statement to Carr as a dual inculpatory statement, which is \u201ca statement that inculpates both the declarant and a third party, in this case the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 145 n.15, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999). A dual inculpatory statement is admissible as a statement against penal interest under \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which \u201ccarves out an exception to the hearsay rule for an out-of-court statement made by an unavailable declarant if the statement at the time of its making ... so far tended to subject the declarant to . . . criminal liability . . . that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 148-49; id. (construing rule 804 [b] [3] of Federal Rules of Evidence, federal analog to \u00a7 8-6 [4] of Connecticut Code of Evidence). In short, the admissibility of Britton\u2019s statements to Carr hinges on whether his statements were against his own penal interest and whether they were sufficiently trustworthy. The fact that Britton\u2019s statements also inculpate the defendant make Britton\u2019s statements relevant with respect to the defendant, but do not make the statements admissible against the defendant in their own right. Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>first examine whether Britton\u2019s statements to Carr are sufficiently trustworthy in order to meet the requirements of a statement against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u201cIn determining the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest, the court shall consider (A) the time the statement was made and the person to whom the statement was made, (B) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case, and (C) the extent to which the statement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 361; Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Additionally, when evaluating a statement against penal interest, \u201cthe trial court must carefully weigh all of the relevant factors in determining whether the statement bears sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant its admission.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 154. As we previously have stated, when viewing this issue through an evidentiary lens, we examine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion. Id., 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">A review of the factors considered by the trial court when weighing the admissibility of Britton\u2019s statement to Carr leads us to conclude that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, we conclude that Britton\u2019s statement to Carr was squarely against his penal interest.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Although Britton implicated the defendant in the homicide, he clearly admitted his own participation in the crime by reference to the fact that he \u201creally jammed the pole down [the victim\u2019s] throat and twisted the pole to break his neck.\u201d In particular, Britton acknowledged that \u201cprior to doing this with the pole, the guy was still alive but after he did this, the guy died immediately.\u201d Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that Britton was attempting to shift blame to the defendant or to otherwise minimize his own criminal involvement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 155 (\u201c[although declarations such as we killed [him] could be viewed as an attempt to share blame, they could not reasonably be seen as an attempt to shift blame away from [the declarant] because [such] assertions [implicate the declarant] fully and equally in the [crime]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hallum, </em>585 N.W.2d 249, 255 (Iowa 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Second, the circumstances under which Britton allegedly made his statements to Carr were strongly indicative of their reliability. Specifically, Britton made the statements on his own initiative, to an individual who was a friend and someone he routinely socialized with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and not \u201cin the coercive atmosphere of official interrogation (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 369. Such statements are significantly more trustworthy than statements obtained by government agents for the purpose of creating evidence that would be useful at a future trial. Id., 370. In short, neither facing arrest nor being under arrest when making his statements to Carr, Britton lacked the obvious incentive to shift blame or curry favor with the police. Id. Additionally, although Carr was not a relative of Britton or the defendant, a factor that we have previously noted when evaluating whether a statement is trustworthy, the trial court specifically found that Carr was far from a stranger either. Carr testified that he had known Britton, the defendant and Smith for a couple of years, that they were friends, and that they regularly socialized together. Although the trial court correctly acknowledged that the relationship of trust between Britton and Carr was not necessarily as strong as if Britton and Carr were blood relatives, the fact remains that they shared a friendship and a relationship of trust. Consequently, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the relationship was sufficient to balance in favor of a finding of reliability. See id., 369 (\u201cspeaking to acquaintances unconnected to law enforcement makes statements eminently trustworthy\u201d), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>York, </em>933 F.2d 1343, 1362-63 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 916, 112 S. Ct. 321, 116 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Third, the timing of Britton\u2019s statement against penal interest further bolsters its reliability. \u201cIn general, declarations made soon after the crime suggest more reliability than those made after a lapse of time where a declarant has a more ample opportunity for reflection and contrivance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>254 Conn. 309, 317, 757 A.2d 542 (2000). In the present case, Britton made his statements to Carr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in late August or September, 1998, just a couple of weeks after the homicide, thus suggesting that the details of each individual\u2019s participation in the incident were still fresh in Britton\u2019s mind. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 370 (statements made within five months of homicide deemed trustworthy); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 634, 431 A.2d 501 (confession made within three months of murders trustworthy), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Fourth, there is an abundance of other evidence strongly corroborating the truthfulness of Britton\u2019s statement against his penal interest. In particular, the defendant\u2019s own statements to police told a very similar story about how the victim died after Britton shoved a pipe down his throat, and also specifically acknowledged that Britton had told Carr about the details of the incident while the three of them were returning from a work site. Additionally, the defendant\u2019s statement to police and the fact that a card for Lucky\u2019s was found in the victim\u2019s Saab corroborated Britton\u2019s claim that the victim had come to Lucky\u2019s in search of drugs. Furthermore, Britton stated that he and the defendant drove the victim\u2019s Saab, attempted to deposit the Saab in the Waterford pond, and buried the victim in Bates Woods. The police investigation revealed both the Saab and the victim\u2019s body in precisely those locations. Moreover, Britton stated that he and the defendant beat the victim in the parking lot of the defendant\u2019s home after meeting the victim to sell him cocaine. Jarvis testified that he observed Britton and the defendant beat the victim in that same parking lot, load him into the back of his Saab, and drive off in the direction of Bates Woods. Finally, Blackmon testified that she overheard a conversation between Britton and the defendant wherein the defendant exclaimed: \u201cFuck them niggers. We\u2019ll kill them and bury them too.\u201d These statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>further corroborated Britton\u2019s statement that both he and the defendant beat the victim and disposed of his body. In light of all of the preceding factors, we conclude that Britton\u2019s statements to Carr were trustworthy statements against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Adoptive Admissions by the Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Connecticut also recognizes an exception to the rule against hearsay when an individual is deemed to have adopted the admission of another party. \u201cWhen a party\u2019s conduct indicates that the party assents to or adopts a statement made by another person, the statement is admissible against the party.\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 11.5 (d) (6). Specifically, \u201c[w]here hearsay accusations are sought to be introduced as evidence against a defendant in a criminal proceeding on grounds that the hearsay was adopted by the defendant . . . the trial court must first determine that the asserted adoptive admission be manifested by conduct or statements which are unequivocal, positive, and definite in nature, clearly showing that in fact [the] defendant intended to adopt the hearsay statements as his own.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>199 Conn. 389, 393, 507 A.2d 1001 (1986). Generally, \u201cstatements made within the accused\u2019s hearing, which are relevant and material, to which he makes no reply, may be given in evidence as indicative of conduct on his part, when the circumstances show that he heard, understood and comprehended the statement, and the facts are known to him and he had the opportunity to speak and the circumstances naturally called for a reply from him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>182 Conn. 220, 228-29, 438 A.2d 38 (1980). In other words, under such circumstances, and if \u201cno other explanation is equally consistent with [the defendant\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>silence,\u201d the defendant\u2019s silence may be \u201cconstrued as an admission of guilt . . . .\u201d Id., 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly considered the previously enumerated factors when determining that it was reasonable to conclude that the defendant had adopted as his own Britton\u2019s statements inculpating the defendant in the victim\u2019s murder. First, Britton, Carr and the defendant were sitting very close together in the back of their work van when Britton made his alleged statement to Can-, thus providing the defendant with ample opportunity to hear what Britton was saying about his involvement in the crime. Additionally, as previously discussed, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that Britton\u2019s statement was too imprecise to conclude that the defendant had been inculpated in the incident, and that his silence cannot be viewed as a proxy for agreement. As aptly noted by the Appellate Court, \u201cCarr\u2019s statement reflects that Britton and the defendant each contributed to the story surrounding the victim\u2019s homicide. . . . When Britton spoke alone, the nature of his statement naturally called for a denial from the defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 38. Moreover, the brutality of the incident reported by Britton led the trial court to conclude that the defendant had an obligation to deny any participation in the crime if he had in fact not been involved. Under the facts of this case, there was no other explanation suggested equally consistent with the defendant\u2019s silence, in the face of Britton\u2019s statements attributing to him such brutal and horrific behavior, than that the defendant, by remaining silent, assented to those statements, effectively adopting them as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In sum, after reviewing Carr\u2019s written statement in its entirety, we agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s determination that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Carr\u2019s prior inconsistent statement into evidence. Britton\u2019s statements contained within Carr\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>written statement to police were squarely against Brit-ton\u2019s penal interest and were sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted as an exception to the rule against hearsay. Additionally, by not objecting to Britton\u2019s statements against penal interest, the defendant is deemed to have adopted them as his own, including, most relevantly, those portions that also inculpated the defendant in the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Defendant\u2019s Right to Confront the Witnesses Against Him</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The defendant further contends that Carr\u2019s written statement to police was inadmissible because it infringed upon his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In particular, this contention relates to the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront both Britton and Carr regarding the statements that Britton made to Carr and the defendant. As an initial matter, we note that with respect to the question of whether an out-of-court statement possesses sufficient indicia of credibility in order to satisfy the requirements of the confrontation clause, our review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cBeyond [the previously mentioned] evidentiary principles, the state\u2019s use of hearsay evidence against an accused in a criminal trial is limited by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. In defining the specific limits of the confrontation clause, the United States Supreme Court consistently has held that the confrontation clause does not erect a per se bar to the admission of hearsay statements against criminal defendants. . . . [W]hile a literal interpretation of the [confrontation [c]lause could bar the use of any out-of-court statements when the declarant is unavailable, [the] [c]ourt has rejected that view as unintended and too extreme .... At the same time, [although . . . hearsay rules and the [confrontation [c]lause are generally designed to protect similar values, [the court has] also been careful not to equate the [c]onfrontation [clause\u2019s prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. . . . The [c]onfrontation [c]lause, in other words, bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 361-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u201cTraditionally, for purposes of the confrontation clause, all hearsay statements were admissible if (1) the declarant was unavailable to testify, and (2) the statement bore adequate indicia of reliability. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). ... [In <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004)], however, the United States Supreme Court overruled <em>Roberts </em>to the extent that it applied to testimonial hearsay statements. ... In <em>Crawford, </em>the court concluded that the reliability standard set forth in the second prong of the <em>Roberts </em>test is too amorphous to prevent adequately the improper admission of core testimonial statements that the [confrontation [c]lause plainly meant to exclude. . . . The court held, therefore, that such testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>monial hearsay statements may be admitted as evidence against an accused at a criminal trial only when (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify, and (2) the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Rivera, supra, 268 Conn. 362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u201cIn so concluding, the court drew a distinction between testimonial hearsay statements and those deemed nontestimonial. Where <em>nontestimonial </em>hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the [fjramers\u2019 design to afford the [s]tates flexibility in their development of hearsay law\u2014as does <em>Roberts, </em>and as would an approach that exempted such statements from [confrontation [cjlause scrutiny altogether. ... In other words, nontestimonial hearsay statements may still be admitted as evidence against an accused in a criminal trial if it satisfies both prongs of the <em>Roberts </em>test, irrespective of whether the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u201cAlthough the court declined to define the terms testimonial and nont\u00e9stimoniai, it considered three formulations of th[e] core class of testimonial statements .... The first formulation consists of ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially .... The second formulation consists of extrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions .... Finally, the third formulation consists of statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial .... The court did not adopt any one particular formulation, noting that, [tjhese formulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>all share a common nucleus and then define the [clause\u2019s coverage at various levels of abstraction around it. Regardless of the precise articulation, some statements qualify under any definition\u2014for example, ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing. . . . Similarly, [statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard. . . . Therefore, [w]hatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations. These are the tnodern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the [confrontation [c]lause was directed.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The previously mentioned framework demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of Carr\u2019s written statement to police abridged his right to confront the witnesses against him actually implicates two types of hearsay statements requiring separate analyses to determine whether Carr\u2019s statement meets the requirements of the confrontation clause. Specifically, it is undisputed that Carr\u2019s written statement, which was the product of a police interrogation, is testimonial in nature and therefore implicates the standards discussed in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 68. By contrast, Britton\u2019s statement to Carr inculpating himself and the defendant was not made under circumstances that would \u201clead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial\u201d; id., 365; nor does the defendant contend that Britton\u2019s statements to Carr were testimonial in nature. In particular', Britton made his statements on his own initiative, to a friend whom he had known for several years, nearly six months before either he or the defendant were arrested for the crime. In light of these circumstances, we conclude that Brit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ton\u2019s statement was nontestimonia! in nature, thus implicating the two part test set forth in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 365 (\u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We set forth each of these analyses separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Defendant\u2019s Constitutional Right to Confront Carr</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">As a \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay statement, Carr\u2019s written statement to the police falls under the general rubric of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 68, which held that \u201c[w]here testimonial evidence is at issue . . . the [s]ixth [a]mendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d Therefore, based on <em>Crawford, </em>in order for Carr\u2019s written statement to police to be admissible, Carr must have been unavailable at the time of trial, and the defendant must have had a prior opportunity to cross-examine Carr regarding the details of his statement. <em>Crawford </em>makes clear, however, that, \u201cwhen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the [c]onfrontation [c]lause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements. ... It is therefore irrelevant that the reliability of some out-of-court statements cannot be replicated, even if the declarant testifies to the same matters in court. . . . The [c] lause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 59-60 n.9. This clarification is significant because if Carr is deemed to have been available for cross-examination at trial, his statement does not implicate the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause. Conversely, if Carr is deemed to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>unavailable for cross-examination at the time of trial, the statement would be inadmissible under <em>Crawford </em>because it is undisputed that the defendant was not afforded a prior opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The defendant contends that, despite the fact that Carr took the stand and answered questions, he was \u201cfunctionally unavailable\u201d for cross-examination as to the contents of his statement. Specifically, the defendant claims that in light of the fact that at trial Carr claimed that he could not remember ever having heard any of the information recounted in the written statement, that he never had substantively reviewed the statement, and had signed the document only to stop the police from harassing him, the defendant was denied the opportunity to cross-examine Carr, in violation of the requirements of the confrontation clause. The defendant\u2019s argument equates a declarant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to remember prior statements made to the police with a general unavailability from cross-examination in its entirety. The state contends that Carr took the stand and was available for cross-examination by defense counsel, and thus <em>Crawford </em>does not place a restriction on his testimony. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In deciding <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court did not define what it means for a witness to be \u201cunavailable\u201d under <em>Crawford, </em>nor have we previously considered this question.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Connecticut courts, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ever, have interpreted the prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753, requiring that the declarant testify at trial and be subject to cross-examination in order to introduce a prior inconsistent statement for substantive use. We believe that these cases are instructive as to whether Carr should be deemed \u201cfunctionally unavailable\u201d for purposes of <em>Crawford. </em>Specifically, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>56 Conn. App. 794, 799, 746 A.2d 210, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 904, 753 A.2d 938 (2000), the Appellate Court concluded that, despite the witness\u2019 failure to remember any of the statements made in a prior inconsistent statement, the witness \u201cwas not sufficiently subject to cross-examination to meet <em>Whelan\u2019s </em>requirements.\u201d The court also noted, \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the phrase subject to cross-examination in rule 801 (d) (1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence proves instructive. . . . Ordinarily a witness is regarded as subject to cross-examination when he is placed on the stand, under oath, and responds willingly to questions. Just as with the constitutional prohibition, limitations on the scope of examination by the trial court or assertions of privilege by the witness may undermine the process to such a degree that meaningful cross-examination within the intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the [r]ule no longer exists. But that effect is not produced by the witness\u2019 assertion of memory loss\u2014which ... is often the very result sought to be produced by cross-examination, and can be effective in destroying the force of the prior statement.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 561-62, 108 S. Ct. 838, 98 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodson, </em>84 Conn. App. 786, 797, 856 A.2d 1012 (\u201cOn cross-examination, the defendant had the opportunity to demonstrate [the witness\u2019] bias, interest and motive, which were for the jury to assess. Furthermore, the jury had the opportunity to observe and to assess [the witness\u2019] demeanor. Given [the witness\u2019] claimed loss of memory, defense counsel was not without resources in his cross-examination because the jury might have been persuaded that [the witness\u2019] prior testimony was as unreliable as his memory arguably was. The defendant, therefore, was hardly reduced to cross-examining a written statement.\u201d), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 941, 861 A.2d 514 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">When evaluating the requirements of the confrontation clause in other cases, we also have noted that \u201c[t]he sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. . . . However, [t]he [confrontation [c]lause guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>248 Conn. 1, 11, 726 A.2d 104 (1999). Additionally, \u201c[although it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine the extent of cross-examination . . . the preclusion of sufficient inquiry into a particular matter tending to show motive, bias and interest may result in a violation of the constitutional requirements of the sixth amendment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 249, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996). \u201cThe right of confrontation is preserved [however] if defense counsel is permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Additionally, we note that other jurisdictions that have had the opportunity to interpret what it means to \u201c[appear] for cross-examination\u201d under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 59-60 n.9 have concluded that a refusal or inability by the witness to recall the events recorded in aprior statement does not render the witness unavailable for purposes of cross-examination. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>355 Ill. App. 3d 786, 792-93, 825 N.E.2d 706 (2005), the Illinois Appellate Court noted that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court in <em>Crawford </em>did not explain what it means for a declarant to appear for cross-examination. However, the [c]ourt\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford </em>neither overruled nor called into question its two earlier decisions that addressed and resolved this issue: <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>[supra, 484 U.S. 554].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Specifically, consistent with Connecticut case law, the court in <em>Sharp </em>noted that the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he [c]onfrontation [c]lause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>supra, 793, quoting <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>supra, 20. Similarly, the court in <em>Sharp </em>noted that the Supreme Court also stated that \u201c[w]e do not think such an inquiry [into the reliability of the testimony] is called for when a hearsay declarant is present at trial and subject to unrestricted cross-examination. In that situation, as the [c]ourt has recognized in <em>[California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970)], the traditional protections of the oath, cross-examination, and opportunity for the jury to observe the witness\u2019 demeanor satisfy the constitutional requirements. . . . We do not think that a constitutional line drawn by the [c] onfrontation [c]lause falls between a forgetful witness\u2019 live testimony that he once believed this defendant to be the perpetrator of the crime, and the introduction of the witness\u2019 earlier statement to that effect. ... It seems to us that the more natural reading of subject to cross-examination concerning the statement includes what was available here. Ordinarily a witness is regarded as subject to cross-examination when he is placed on the stand, under oath, and responds willingly to questions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>supra, 794, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>supra, 560-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In light of this precedent, and the fact that the witness was present at trial and answered all of the questions posed to her on cross-examination, the court in <em>Sharp </em>concluded that the witness was available for cross-examination at trial under <em>Crawford, </em>and that the confrontation clause did not bar- the admission of the hearsay statements at issue. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>supra, 355 Ill. App. 3d 795-96. Several other courts have reached similar conclusions. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Candelaria, </em>107 P.3d 1080, 1087 (Colo. App. 2004) (holding that inability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to recall prior statements at trial did not change fact that defendant had opportunity to cross-examine witness about her statement in accordance with requirements of Crawford); <em>People </em>v. <em>Bueno, </em>358 Ill. App. 3d 143, 155-56, 829 N.E.2d 402 (2005) (concluding that witness answered all questions asked of him by defense counsel and that, therefore, despite claimed loss of memory, witness had appeared for cross-examination under <em>Crawford); State </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>854 A.2d 1164, 1177-78 (Me. 2004) (holding that despite inability to remember prior statements and events and fact that she may have been impaired by psychiatric medications, witness who was subject to cross-examination at trial was not constitutionally unavailable for purposes of confrontation clause analysis under <em>Crawford); State </em>v. <em>Yanez, </em>2005 Minn. App. LEXIS 412 (concluding that despite witness\u2019 inability to remember what was contained in her prior inconsistent statement to police, she was available for cross-examination under <em>Crawford </em>and defendant was not denied his right to confrontation); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>682 N.W.2d 169, 176 n.1 (Minn. App. 2004) (holding that <em>Crawford </em>is not implicated where declarant of hearsay statement was present at trial and subject to cross-examination); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>692 N.W.2d 544, 549 (S.D. 2005) (concluding that testimonial statements need not be subject to cross-examination at time they were made if witness is available and subject to cross-examination at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In the present case, Carr took the stand at trial, agreed to testify truthfully, was subject to cross-examination by the defendant, and answered all questions posed by defense counsel. In particular, Carr acknowledged meeting with the detectives in his attorney\u2019s office and signing the written statement prepared by the investigating officers. Additionally, Carr responded to several questions regarding his motives and interest in providing information to the police. Carr acknowledged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>as of the time he met with police on February 16, 1999, he had charges pending against him in an unrelated matter, and that those charges later were resolved by his plea to a probation violation and a failure to appear. Furthermore, Carr stated that he had signed the written statement despite the fact that it was not accurate, because the police had contacted him on several occasions and he was interested in trying to get them to stop bothering him. Moreover, Carr confirmed several other pieces of information contained in the statement, including that he had seen news reports about the victim\u2019s death, that he had worked with the defendant and Britton at Quality Cleaners around the time of the incident, and that he drank several beers with the defendant and Britton on the way back from the job site. Carr claimed to have no memory, however, of hearing Britton describe how he and the defendant murdered the victim in the manner memorialized in his signed statement to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Despite the fact that Carr claimed that he could not remember ever having heard a description of the victim\u2019s murder, we conclude that he was available for cross-examination at trial, thus removing any issue under the confrontation clause. First, as previously noted we have held on prior occasions that \u201can important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying\u201d and have emphasized the importance of \u201celicit[ing] facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 11. We agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that based on the questions Carr answered, \u201c[d]efense counsel was presented with, and used, plenty of ammunition to attack Carr\u2019s credibility and truthfulness on cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 41. In particular, defense counsel\u2019s questions demonstrated that Carr\u2019s own legal problems may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>have given him an incentive to provide police with information in exchange for the ability to negotiate a more favorable sentence. Conversely, defense counsel also elicited testimony to suggest that Carr may have signed the written statement merely to avoid further questioning from McGlynn. Regardless of whether the jury ultimately believed either possibility, Carr\u2019s statements provided the defendant with the opportunity to show Carr\u2019s bias, interest, potential motives and demeanor as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Furthermore, we agree with those jurisdictions that have interpreted \u201cavailability for cross-examination\u2019\u2019 under <em>Crawford </em>as needing to be synthesized with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>supra, 484 U.S. 561-62, and <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>supra, 474 U.S. 20. Specifically, although \u201cavailability\u201d was not defined in <em>Crawford, Owens </em>and <em>Fensterer </em>make clear that the right to cross-examination does not imply a right to cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish. This theme also runs through the existing cases in Connecticut wherein a witness has been deemed subject to cross-examination at trial for <em>Whelan </em>purposes despite a claimed inability to remember the details surrounding his or her prior statement. In sum, we conclude that a witness\u2019 claimed inability to remember earlier statements or the events surrounding those statements does not implicate the requirements of the confrontation clause under <em>Crawford, </em>so long as the witness appears at trial, takes an oath to testify truthfully, and answers the questions put to him or her during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Defendant\u2019s Constitutional Right to Confront Britton</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The defendant also challenges the admission of Brit-ton\u2019s statement, contained within Carr\u2019s <em>Whelan </em>state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ment, as violative of his sixth amendment right to confrontation. As previously noted, nontestimonial hearsay statements may still be admitted as evidence against an accused in a criminal trial if they satisfy both prongs of the test in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66, namely: (1) if the declarant was unavailable to testily; and (2) the statement bore adequate indicia of reliability. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 362. In the present case, it is undisputed that Britton was unavailable at trial because he invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. Therefore, the only question that remains is whether Britton\u2019s statements to Carr bore sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy the second prong of <em>Roberts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u201cUnder the second prong of <em>Roberts, </em>a statement is presumptively reliable if it falls within a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 hearsay exception. . . . The United States Supreme Court recently has addressed the constitutional framework in which hearsay statements against penal interest may be admitted into evidence under the second prong of <em>Roberts. </em>In <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 127, 119 S. Ct. 1887, 144 L. Ed. 2d 117 (1999), the court recognized that, \u2018due to the sweeping scope of the label, the simple categorization of a statement as a declaration against penal interest . . . defines too large a class for meaningful [confrontation [c]lause analysis.\u2019 . . . Hence, the court divided statements against penal interest, offered into evidence in criminal trials, into three principal categories: \u2018(1) as voluntary admissions against the declarant; (2) as exculpatory evidence offered by a defendant who claims that the declarant committed, or was involved in, the offense; and (3) as evidence offered by the prosecution to establish the guilt of an alleged accomplice of the declarant.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 365-66. As in the present case, the third category of statements against penal interest was at issue in <em>Lilly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Lilly, </em>a plurality of the court determined that this third category of hearsay encompasses statements that are inherently unreliable. . . . Specifically, th[e] truth-finding function of the [confrontation [c]lause is uniquely threatened when an accomplice\u2019s confession is sought to be introduced against a criminal defendant without the benefit of cross-examination. . . . Due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant\u2019s statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence. . . . Accordingly, the plurality concluded that accomplices confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule ....</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u201cA majority of the court reaffirmed, however, that statements against penal interest nonetheless may be admitted, consistent with the confrontation clause, under the second prong of <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66, provided that they possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness .... The plurality further concluded: [W]hen deciding whether the admission of a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements violates the [c]onfrontation [c]lause, [appellate] courts should independently review whether the government\u2019s proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy the demands of the [c]lause.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 366-67. Accordingly, our review of whether Britton\u2019s statement was sufficiently trustworthy under the confrontation clause is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">When assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of Britton\u2019s statement for purposes of compliance with the confrontation clause, we are mindful of the fact that the analysis is similar, but not identical, to that carried out with respect to whether the statement was properly admitted under the statement against penal interest exception to the rule against hearsay. See part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>I B 1 of this opinion. Specifically, with respect to the requirements of the confrontation clause, \u201c[w]e note that independent corroborative evidence may not be used to support a statement\u2019s particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, because reliance on such evidence gives rise to an undue risk that presumptively unreliable hearsay evidence will be admitted not on the basis of its inherent reliability but, rather, by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial .... In other words, evidence not directly related to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement cannot be used to substantiate the statement\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 367 n.15. Therefore, in order for Britton\u2019s statement to withstand scrutiny under the confrontation clause, the statement and the circumstances under which it was made must have been sufficiently trustworthy on their own, without the assistance of corroborating evidence, in order for the statement to be deemed reliable. In light of the first three reasons already enumerated in part I B 1 of this opinion, our independent review of the circumstances under which Britton made the statement to Carr persuades us that the statement bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d thereby satisfying the reliability requirements of the confrontation clause as described by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66. In sum, Britton\u2019s statement was squarely against his penal interest, it was made to a friend on Britton\u2019s own initiative outside the coercive influence of a police interrogation, and it was made during a period that was very close in time to the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">DEFENDANT\u2019S SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The defendant next claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that his sixth amendment right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>to counsel failed to attach upon the signing of an information by the state on May 13, 1999.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The state contends that it was not until the entire arrest warrant, with the attached signed information, was filed with the court at arraignment that the document became an information within sixth amendment jurisprudence, thus triggering the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The office of the state\u2019s attorney first became involved in the investigation of the victim\u2019s death when the victim\u2019s skeletal remains were located in Bates Woods on January 10, 1999. During the course of their investigation, between February 10, 1999, and March 8, 1999, the police obtained three written statements from the defendant. In each of these statements, the defendant minimized his role in the crime. On May 13, 1999, the Connecticut state police submitted an arrest warrant application with an attached information for the defendant, which was reviewed and signed by both an assistant state\u2019s attorney and a judge of the Superior Court. On June 14, 1999, law enforcement authorities from the Connecticut state police, New London police department, and the Garden City police department arrested the defendant in Garden City, New York, as a fugitive from the underlying Connecticut warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Upon being arrested in New York, the defendant met with McGlynn and Buglione, and provided an eleven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>page statement and three diagrams related to the victim\u2019s murder. This statement included reference to the fact that the defendant was with the victim when he was beaten in the parking lot of the defendant\u2019s apartment and taken to Bates Woods, as well as the fact that Britton had taken a metal pipe from the victim\u2019s car and had hit the victim about the face until he died. Additionally, the defendant provided oral statements to McGlynn and Buglione on June 24, 1999, while they were transporting the defendant back to Connecticut for arraignment. Specifically, after entering Connecticut from New York, the defendant was once again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, at which point he noted that his girlfriend in New York was pregnant and he became emotional about the prospect of not being able to see his child. The defendant also inquired about what was going to happen to him upon returning to Connecticut, and he stated that he was upset that Smith had not been arrested. McGlynn and Buglione suggested that it may be a good time for the defendant \u201cto speak to the state\u2019s attorney and look for some type of deal.\u201d They also inquired as to whether the defendant would \u201ctake [fifty] years\u2014[fifty-five] years,\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201c[w]ell, it\u2019s better than life, he would take it . . . .\u201d The defendant subsequently was arraigned in Connecticut the following day, June 25, 1999, at which point the arrest warrant with the attached signed information also was filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress his June 14, 1999 written statement as violating his sixth amendment right to counsel. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, holding that an arrest following the issuance of a warrant does not mark the commencement of formal legal proceedings against the defendant. Subsequent to this ruling, the defendant filed a supplemental motion to suppress, seeking the suppression of the oral statement the defendant made to McGlynn and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Buglione on June 24, 1999. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court again denied the motion, referencing its earlier decision, and concluding once again that an arrest pursuant to a warrant does not signal the formal commencement of legal proceedings entitling a defendant to the protections of the sixth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">As an initial matter, we note that \u201c[o]ur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [When] the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [our review is plenary, and] we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>271 Conn. 300, 322-23, 857 A.2d 329 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 949, 125 S. Ct. 1711, 161 L. Ed. 2d 527 (2005), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>267 Conn. 495, 503, 838 A.2d 981 (2004). The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that the critical stage triggering the protections of the sixth amendment did not occur until the information was filed and the defendant was charged at his arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u201cThe [s]ixth [a]mendment guarantees that \u2018[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the [assistance of [c]ounsel for his defence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 187, 104 S.

This right attaches only \u201cat or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 689, 92 S.

Ed. 2d 411 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>196 Conn. 557, 560, 494 A.2d 1190 (1985). \u201cThe initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>mere formalism. It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice. For it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of [the] government and [the] defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law. It is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the criminal prosecutions to which alone the explicit guarantees of the [s]ixth [ajmendment are applicable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 689-90. We also have noted that the time of the attachment of the right to counsel under the federal constitution is no different under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 64, 536 A.2d 936 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has indicated that the sixth amendment\u2019s core purpose is to assure that in any criminal prosecutiofn] . . . the accused shall not be left to his own devices in facing the prosecutorial forces of organized society. ... By its very terms, it becomes applicable only when the government\u2019s role shifts from investigation to accusation. For it is only then that the assistance of one versed in the intricacies ... of law ... is needed to assure that the prosecution\u2019s case encounters the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cichowski, </em>203 Conn. 97, 101-102, 523 A.2d 503 (1987). In this regard, \u201c[w]e have consistently adopted the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court with respect to when the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches in a criminal proceeding, finding that [n]o right to counsel attaches until prosecution has commenced.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ted.) Id., 102; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 44 n.10, 463 A.2d 573 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>185 Conn. 607, 609, 441 A.2d 595 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 563-64, we concluded that an extradition hearing does not represent the same type of critical confrontation between an accused and a prosecutor such as found in an arraignment where counsel is constitutionally required. Specifically, we noted: \u201cAt an arraignment, a defendant is advised of the charges against him and enters a plea. ... By contrast, at an extradition hearing, a defendant is not asked to plead or to make any other decisions that could affect his right to a fair trial. . . . [M]ost courts in other jurisdictions have held that even proceedings contesting extradition are not a critical stage in the prosecution requiring the presence of counsel.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 564. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 232, 460 A.2d 961 (1983), we concluded that an interrogation following an arrest, but prior to arraignment or indictment, regardless of whether accompanied by a warrant, does not call into play the sixth amendment right to counsel. In particular, in <em>Vitale </em>we noted that \u201c[the defendant] seeks to analogize his situation . . . to that of a defendant who has been formally charged with a crime by indictment or information. From such a defendant the government may not elicit self-incriminating evidence in the absence of counsel.\u201d Id., 231, citing <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 206, 84 S. Ct. 1199, 12 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1964). \u201cThe rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of a defendant against self-incrimination prior to the formal commencement of a judicial criminal proceeding against him are, of course, protected by the <em>Miranda </em>warning requirements. We see no necessity for superimposing the more complete <em>Massiah </em>restrictions during the period between the arrest and the filing of an information or indictment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We recognize that, prior to the present case, we have not specifically addressed the question of whether the signing of an information in conjunction with obtaining an arrest warrant constitutes the commencement of adversarial judicial proceedings within the meaning of the sixth amendment. The defendant argues that once the state\u2019s attorney signed an information in conjunction with obtaining a warrant for his arrest, the state had committed itself to prosecute. We are not persuaded. To the contrary, we conclude that it is not simply the signing of the information document that triggers the protections of the sixth amendment. Rather, it is the state\u2019s decision to move forward with the prosecution of the crimes charged in the information document, by arraigning the suspect and filing the information with the court, that signifies the state\u2019s commitment to prosecute as well as the initiation of the adversary judicial proceedings that trigger a defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the sixth amendment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 562 (\u201c[n] either the request of a state\u2019s attorney, nor the action of a court in granting that request, converts an arrest warrant into an official accusation signaling the state\u2019s commitment to prosecute\u201d). Additionally, as we noted in <em>Falcon, </em>if an arrest and extradition hearing have not been viewed as a commitment to prosecute or the initiation of an adversarial judicial proceeding triggering rights under the sixth amendment, the signing of an information attached to an arrest warrant application hardly can be considered definitively prosecutorial and adversarial in nature. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the arrest warrant and information are prepared largely without the defendant\u2019s knowledge and it is not until the defendant is formally charged in open court at arraignment that he enters a plea, is faced with an adversarial judicial process, and the prosecution begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Furthermore, we agree with the state that a review of the procedure for and contents of an arrest warrant and information, as set out in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a736 and 37, is instructive. \u201cThe warrant shall be signed by the judicial authority and shall contain the name of the accused person, or if such name is unknown, any name or description by which the accused can be identified with reasonable certainty, and the conditions of release fixed, if any. It shall state the offense charged and direct any officer authorized to execute it to arrest the accused person and to bring him or her before a judicial authority without undue delay.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 36-3. The offenses charged are written on court form JD-CR-71, entitled \u201cInformation,\u201d and the \u201cTitle, Allegation and Counts\u201d section of the form is filled out and signed by a state\u2019s attorney. A copy of the arrest warrant with the attached and signed information are then given to the accused upon being taken into custody. See Practice Book \u00a7 36-5. Subsequently, once the information is filed and the defendant is brought before the court at arraignment, he is advised of his constitutional rights, including his right to the services of an attorney. See Practice Book \u00a7 37-3. The rules of practice also contain provisions for canceling or amending arrest warrants and informations as necessary. Specifically, Practice Book \u00a7 36-6 provides: \u201cAt the request of the prosecuting authority, any unserved arrest warrant shall be returned to a judicial authority for cancellation. A judicial authority also may direct that any unserved arrest warrant be returned for cancellation.\u201d Similarly, Practice Book \u00a7 \u00a7 36-16,36-17 and 36-18 allow for the amendment of the information for substantive and nonsubstantive reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>prior to trial for any reason, and after trial, but prior to verdict, upon a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">These provisions of the rules of practice all indicate that the signing of an information does not necessarily represent a commitment by the state to prosecute the defendant. Instead, it may be more accurately considered a prelude to a criminal prosecution, subject to amendment or cancellation as necessary, rather than the initiation of an adversarial judicial proceeding in its own right. In short, as suggested by Practice Book \u00a7 37-3, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel did not attach upon the signing of the information, but when the information was acted upon by the state and filed at the defendant\u2019s arraignment. It is at this point in the process that the \u201cprosecutorial forces of organized society\u201d aligned against the defendant, and the defendant actually found himself \u201cimmersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law,\u201d thus warranting protection under the sixth amendment. <em>Kirby </em>v. Illinois, supra, 406 U.S. 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Finally, the defendant points to a recent case in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut as persuasive authority for the proposition that the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches upon the state\u2019s signing of the information. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3.03-CR-0032, slip op. 11 (D. Conn. October 1,2003). Specifically, in <em>Mills, </em>\u201cone day prior to the detectives\u2019 interview with the defendant, an [assistant [sjtate\u2019s [attorney for the [s]tate of Connecticut completed an [information in Connecticut Superior Court. The [ijnformation charged the defendant with three counts of [cjarrying a [pjistol [wjithout a [pjermit . . . and two counts of [i]Ilegal [tjransfer of a [fjirearm .... One day after the detectives\u2019 interview with the defendant, June 19, 2002, the defendant was brought to New Haven Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and arraigned on the [state] felony gun charges contained in the [i]nformation.\u201d Id., 4. Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion to suppress his statements made to police, arguing that \u201csince an [i]nformation was issued by an [assistant [s]tate\u2019s [attorney\u201d the day before his interview he should have been afforded counsel when he spoke with detectives. Id., 10. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s [s]ixth [a]mendment right to counsel had attached at the time of the interview since an [information had already been issued . . . .\u201d Id., 11. It also noted: \u201cThe fact that the [information must be signed by the prosecutorial authority indicates that a prosecutorial\u2014rather than investigatory\u2014stance has begun once the [information is signed. . . . For these reasons, the court finds that once an [information is filed in Connecticut, the [s]ixth [a]mendment right to counsel attaches, as formal charges, including an information, had been filed.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">As an initial matter, we agree with the state that the District Court\u2019s use of the words \u201cfiled,\u201d \u201cissued\u201d and \u201csigned\u201d nearly interchangeably in its order makes it difficult to discern at which point in the warrant application procedure it concluded that the critical stage triggering the protections of the sixth amendment actually took place. For all of the foregoing reasons, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>extent that it concluded that the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches in Connecticut upon the signing of an information by the state, we disagree. Alternatively, to the extent that its conclusion was limited to the proposition that the right to counsel in Connecticut attaches upon the filing of an information with the court, we note that in the present case the information was not filed at the time of signing on May 13, 1999, but more than one month later when the defendant was arraigned. Consequently, the holding in <em>Mills </em>is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides: \u201cA person is guilty of felonymurder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first degree, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants, except that in any prosecution under this section, in which the defendant was not the only participant in the underlying crime, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant: (1) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and (2) was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any dangerous instrument; and (3) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon or instrument; and (4) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical ipjury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and: (1) His intent is to compel a third person (A) to pay or deliver money or property as ransom or (B) to engage in other particular conduct or to refrain from engaging in particular conduct; or (2) he restrains the person abducted with intent to (A) inflict physical injury upon him or violate or abuse him sexually; or (B) accomplish or advance the commission of a felony; or (C) terrorize him or a third person; or (D) interfere with the performance of a government function.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or (2) is armed with a deadly weapon; or (3) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm, except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged.

Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion to reconsider our order on the petition for certification, arguing that new information had come to his attention that changed the constitutional analysis of when his sixth amendment right to counsel attached from that presented to the Appellate Court. We granted the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and granted certification to review the following additional issue: \u201cDid the defendant\u2019s right to counsel attach upon the signing of an information by the state on May 13, 1999?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> In Carr\u2019s written statement to police, he said that he \u201coverheard [Britton] and [the defendant] talking about the murder of [the victim], I asked [Britton] and [the defendant] what were they talking about.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u201c[Britton] then told me that a guy came to [Lucky\u2019s], [Britton] said that he and the guy left the bar and went into the guy\u2019s gray colored Saab.

[Britton] and [the defendant] then said that once they arrived at Bates Woods parking lot, they took the guy out from the car and again started to beat on him. [Britton] started to brag and said that he took a pole and placed it into the guy\u2019s mouth. [Britton] said that he really jammed the pole down his throat and then twisted the pole to break his neck. [Britton] said that prior to doing this with the pole, the guy was still alive but after he did this, the guy died immediately. [Britton] stated that after he broke the guy\u2019s neck, he took the pole and threw it into the woods. [Britton] stated that after a couple of days, he went back to Bates Woods and took the pipe out from the woods so there would be no evidence left at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\u201c[Britton] continued by stating that after they killed the guy, they dragged his body into the woods. They tried to bury his body but the ground was too cold, so they took some type of tarp and covered his body. They were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>able to place rocks over the tarp to hold the tarp down. [Britton] stated that they then threw and kicked dirt over the tarp to cover everything up.

Therefore, the focus of our analysis is on whether Britton\u2019s statement was sufficiently trustworthy to warrant admission as a statement against his penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\"> As reported in Carr\u2019s written statement to police, Britton\u2019s most damaging statements against himself and the defendant include the following: \u201c[Britton] and [the defendant] then said that after they beat the guy, they put the guy back inside the Saab and drove him to Bates Woods behind the dog pound. [Britton] and [the defendant] then said that once they arrived at Bates Woods parking lot, they took the guy out from the car and again started to beat on him. [Britton] <em>started to brag and said that he took a pole and placed it into the guy\u2019s mouth. [Britton] said that he really jammed the pole down his throat and then twisted the pole to break his neck. [Britton] said that prior to doing this with the pole, the guy was still alive but after he did this, the guy died immediately. [Britton] stated that after </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>tie broke the guy\u2019s neck, he took the pole and threw it into the woods. [Britton] stated that after a couple of days he went back to Bates Woods and took the pipe from the woods, so there would be no evidence left at the scene.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\"><em>\u201c[Britton] continued by stating that after they killed the guy they dragged [the victim\u2019s] body into the woods. They tried to bury his body but the ground was too cold, so they took some type [of] taip and covered his body. </em>They were able to place rocks over the tarp to hold the tarp down. [Britton] stated that they then threw and kicked dirt over the tarp to cover everything up. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u201c[Britton] and [the defendant] then said that after they buried the guy, they took his Saab and dumped it inside a pond in Waterford. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">\u201cI also want to add that when [Britton] and [the defendant] were mentioning how they buried [the victim], they said before they actually buried him, they threw bleach over his body and clothes, to wash away any possible fingerprints.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> The defendant notes in passing in his brief that the admission of Carr\u2019s statement into evidence abridged both his state and federal rights to confrontation. To the extent that he is attempting to allege a violation of article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, we decline to reach the defendant\u2019s claim because it does not meet the standard we enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). \u201cWe have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . . Without a separately briefed and analyzed state constitutional claim, we deem abandoned the defendant\u2019s claim . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>270 Conn. 516, 518 n.1, 853 A.2d 105 (2004). Consequently, we analyze the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation arguments under the requirements of the United States constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> As the defendant notes, however, we have determined what it means for a witness to be unavailable within the context of the admissibility of a statement against penal interest. Specifically, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 145, we concluded that in light of the witness\u2019 asserted inability to remember many of the material facts relating to the events leading up to the victim\u2019s death, his memory loss rendered him \u201cunavailable\u201d for the purpose of the hearsay exception. In making this determination, we were concerned with the applicability of rule 804 (a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which corresponds with our common-law definition of unavailability with respect to the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. In particular, rule 804 (a) (3) provides that unavailability of a witness can include situations in which the declarant \u201ctestifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement . . . .\u201d We went on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>note in <em>Schiappa, </em>however, that \u201ceven though [the witness] was unavailable for purposes of rule 804 (a) (3) because of his asserted memory loss, he testified at trial and, consequently, was subject to cross-examination. Although the defendant\u2019s ability to question [the witness] regarding his statement . . . was limited due to [the witness\u2019] claimed inability to recall the substance of his statement, the defendant nevertheless had the opportunity to examine [the witness] about the crime and the reasons for his asserted memory loss, thereby further reducing any confrontation clause concerns.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 160 n.34. Therefore, although the meaning of \u201cavailable for cross-examination\u201d was not at issue in <em>Schiappa, </em>we specifically noted that our holding with respect to how the witness\u2019 memory loss pertained to the admissibility of a statement against penal interest did not render the witness unavailable for purposes of cross-examination. See id. In light of this conclusion, we find to be misplaced the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Schiappa </em>as precedent for the proposition that a witness\u2019 memory loss is necessarily equated with unavailability under the confrontation clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\"> The defendant also argues that, assuming his right to counsel attached upon the state signing the information on May 13, 1999, his waiver of his fifth amendment rights did not act as a valid waiver of his sixth amendment right to counsel under the federal constitution or his right to counsel under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel did not attach on May 13, 1999, but rather at arraignment when the entire arrest warrant with the attached signed information was filed in court, we need not address these additional claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> To the extent that we have offered inconsistent guidance in this area, it has not been in favor of a finding that the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches upon the signing of an information by the state, as is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>advocated for by the defendant. Rather, without actually deciding the issue of when the right to counsel attaches, we have previously stated that it is still incumbent upon the defendant to exercise his sixth amendment rights once they attach. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 612-13, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991) (\u201c[e]ven if the defendant is correct and his right to counsel had attached [when an information was filed in court], his ensuing statements would not be rendered inadmissible under the sixth and fourteenth amendments unless he had invoked that right\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> We are mindful of the fact that on appeal, the District Court\u2019s order suppressing the defendant\u2019s statements was affirmed. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>412 F.3d 325, 327 (2d Cir. 2005). On appeal, however, the government did not challenge the District Court\u2019s determination that the police officers had violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel as to the state charges. Rather, the issue on appeal was whether statements taken by the police, in violation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel as to previously charged state offenses, but prior to the filing of federal charges for the same crime, could be admitted in a separate federal prosecution. Id., 328. Thus, we do not read the affirmance by the United States Court of Appeals as holding that the signing of a Connecticut arrest warrant, without more, triggers the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
