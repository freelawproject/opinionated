On direct appeal, he contends (1) that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of conspiracy or of violating the Drug Act, either as a principal actor or as an accomplice; (2) that the statements of an alleged co-conspirator constituted inadmissible hearsay and should not have been received; and (3) that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress physical evidence seized from his person and the truck in which he was seated. These claims lack merit; and the judgment of sentence, therefore, will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The test to be applied in determining the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, accepting as true all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences arising therefrom upon which, if believed, the trier of fact could properly have based its verdict, it is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the crime or crimes with which he has been charged. As with all challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, in this case the Commonwealth, which is entitled to the benefit of all favorable inferences arising therefrom. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>498 Pa. 33, 44, 444 A.2d 653, 658 (1982); <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, the entire trial record must be evaluated, and all evidence actually received must be considered, whether or not the trial court\u2019s rulings thereon were correct. <em>Commonwealth v.

Carter, </em>272 Pa.Super. 411, 414, 416 A.2d 523, 524 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>265 Pa.Super. 494, 500, 402 A.2d 546, 549 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Henderson, </em>249 Pa.Super. 472, 483, 378 A.2d 393, 398 (1977). \u201cThe crime by its very nature is frequently not susceptible of proof except by circumstantial evidence. \u2018A conspiracy may be inferentially established by showing the relationship, conduct or circumstances of the parties, and the overt acts on the part of co-conspirators have uniformly been held competent to prove that a corrupt confederation has in fact been formed.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth v. Horvath, </em>187 Pa.Super. 206, 211, 144 A.2d 489, 492 (1958).\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Carter, supra </em>(citations omitted). In <em>Commonwealth v. Anderson, supra, </em>the court, per Hoffman, J., listed circumstances relevant, though by themselves insufficient, to establish a corrupt confederation as follows: (1) association between alleged conspirators; (2) knowledge of the commission of a crime; (3) presence at the scene of the crime; and (4) in some situations, participation in the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">When a conspiracy to commit a particular crime or crimes has been shown, each conspirator is responsible for the acts of his co-conspirators committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. The agreement is the nexus which renders a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>conspirator vicariously liable for the acts of his associates. <em>Commonwealth v.

Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 64 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The evidence adduced at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing proper inferences in favor of the Commonwealth, established that the charges against Plusquellic arose out of a controlled purchase<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of cocaine arranged by Trooper Ronald J. Ceyba of the Drug Enforcement Office of the Pennsylvania State Police. On September 13, 1979, Ceyba made arrangements with Edwin Anker, Plusquellic\u2019s alleged co-conspirator,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to purchase one-quarter pound of cocaine. The transaction was to take place later that evening at a designated meeting site in Verona, Allegheny County. Prior to proceeding to the pre-arranged site, Ceyba dispatched a surveillance van equipped with one-way glass windows and containing state police officers and Justice Department agents. The surveillance van parked in a nearby lot so that the officers could observe the drug transaction and provide back-up assistance if required. Additional officers were stationed in a conventional vehicle approximately three blocks away. At the pre-arranged time, Anker arrived on foot and entered Ceyba\u2019s vehicle, ostensibly to \u201ccheck Ceyba out\u201d and also to count his money. Anker suggested that Ceyba accompany him to a nearby home where his cocaine supplier was waiting. Ceyba, of course, preferred that the transaction take place in its entirety at the pre-arranged location. Anker agreed, indicating that he and the supplier would return shortly in a black truck with the drugs. Within five minutes, Anker returned in a black Chevrolet Blazer driven by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Plusquellic. The truck stopped behind Ceyba\u2019s vehicle, whereupon Anker alighted and re-entered Ceyba\u2019s vehicle. Plusquellic, meanwhile, remained at the wheel of the Chevrolet Blazer. Prior to completing the transaction, Anker apparently became suspicious of the surveillance van and directed Ceyba to relocate his vehicle. Plusquellic also moved his truck, entering the parking lot in which the surveillance van was parked and peering into it inquisitively. He eventually stopped and parked immediately behind Ceyba\u2019s vehicle. Inside the vehicle, Anker removed two plastic bags containing cocaine from his trousers, weighed them and turned them over to Trooper Ceyba. Thereafter, both Anker and Ceyba emerged from the vehicle, at which time Ceyba signaled the surveillance officers to indicate that the drug transaction had been completed. Upon Ceyba\u2019s order, the officers approached the Chevrolet Blazer and placed Plusquellic, who had been attempting to hide a loaded pistol beneath the driver\u2019s seat, under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">This evidence was sufficient to show that appellant had been consciously involved in an unlawful confederation with Anker. The conclusion is buttressed by Anker\u2019s statements to Ceyba which identified appellant as his supplier of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Appellant contends, however, that Anker\u2019s statements were hearsay and should not have been received as substantive evidence. There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">It is well established in our law that statements by a co-conspirator are admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule if they are made during the conspiracy and in furtherance thereof. However, there must be evidence other than the statement of the co-conspirator to prove that a conspiracy existed. <em>Commonwealth v. Dreibelbis, </em>493 Pa. 466, 475, 426 A.2d 1111, 1115 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>478 Pa. 406, 421, 387 A.2d 46, 53-54 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Ellsworth, </em>409 Pa. 505, 509, 187 A.2d 640, 642 (1963); <em>Commonwealth v. Hirsch, </em>225 Pa.Super. 494, 497, 311 A.2d 679, 681 (1973). See also: P.L.E. Criminal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 331-334, 3 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 642 (13th ed. Torchia 1973). The conspiracy may be established inferentially by showing the relation, conduct or circumstances of the parties. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dreibelbis, supra. </em>Moreover, the order of proof is within the discretion of the trial court which may, upon only slight evidence of the conspiracy, admit such statements subject to later proof of the conspiracy. P.L.E. Criminal Law \u00a7 334. See also: <em>Commonwealth v. Esposito, </em>236 Pa.Super. 127, 130, 344 A.2d 655, 657 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Appellant contends in the instant case that independent proof of the existence of a conspiracy was lacking. The record belies this argument. The evidence adduced at trial established that, following preliminary negotiations between an undercover drug agent and appellant\u2019s alleged co-conspirator for the purchase of nearly $10,000 worth of cocaine, appellant transported his alleged co-conspirator to the site of the proposed transaction, surveyed the surveillance van stationed in a nearby parking lot, and oversaw the entire transaction from his truck parked directly behind the undercover vehicle in which the transaction took place. He also had a firearm in his possession. This was sufficient to establish independently the existence of a conspiracy. The statements by appellant\u2019s alleged co-conspirator, made during the conspiracy and in furtherance thereof, were properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Appellant contends finally that the suppression court erred in refusing to suppress a cocaine user\u2019s kit and a .380 caliber automatic pistol<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which had been removed respectively from his person and truck. The seizure of these items was incident to appellant\u2019s arrest. The pistol was observed protruding from the space beneath the driver\u2019s seat in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>appellant waited while Anker completed the drug transaction; the cocaine user\u2019s kit was found on appellant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The law is clear that a warrantless seizure is proper if incident to a lawful arrest. See: <em>Commonwealth v. Holzer, </em>480 Pa. 93, 102 n.5, 389 A.2d 101, 106 n.5 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Rivera, </em>273 Pa.Super. 105, 107-108, 416 A.2d 1111, 1112 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Harm, </em>272 Pa.Super. 431, 436, 416 A.2d 533, 535 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em>247 Pa.Super. 132, 136, 371 A.2d 1362, 1364 (1977). A warrantless arrest is lawful if the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer\u2019s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are such as would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe an offense has been or is being committed and the person to be arrested is probably the perpetrator. <em>Commonwealth v. Bartlett, </em>486 Pa. 396, 400, 406 A.2d 340, 341 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Stokes, </em>480 Pa. 38, 43, 389 A.2d 74, 76 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Gambit, </em>274 Pa.Super. 571, 577, 418 A.2d 554, 557 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the law enforcement officers present at the scene had probable cause to believe that an illegal drug transaction had taken place and that appellant was a party thereto. Thus, they had a right to make an arrest and conduct a search of appellant\u2019s person. If there had been any earlier doubt about the need for such a search, it was removed when a gun was observed on the floor of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The seizure of the gun was lawful because it was in plain view. The \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine holds that weapons and contraband within the plain view of a police officer can be seized without a warrant, provided the police officer had a right to be in the place from which he was able to view the item. <em>Commonwealth v. Bentley, </em>276 Pa.Super. 41, 47, 419 A.2d 85, 88 (1980). Because the police had probable cause to make an arrest of appellant while he was seated in the truck, it cannot seriously be argued that they had no right to be where they could observe the gun lying on the floor and protruding from beneath the seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Our review of this case discloses no merit in any of appellant\u2019s allegations of error. The judgment of sentence, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-17\">. Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, No. 64, \u00a7 13, as amended, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 780-113(a)(16); 780-113(a)(30).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-18\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-19\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">. The operation was described as a \u201cbuy-bust\u201d\u2014meaning that the arrests would immediately follow the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\">. Edwin Anker was tried separately on January 30, 1980, and was convicted of violations of the Drug Act and criminal conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b44-6\">. Appellant, in his brief, makes the same argument with regard to a holster seized at the same time from the passenger\u2019s seat of the Chevrolet Blazer. This claim was not the subject of appellant\u2019s post trial motions; it therefore has not been properly preserved for appellate review. See: <em>Commonwealth v. Nesbitt, </em>276 Pa.Super. 1, 4 n.l, 419 A.2d 64, 65 n.l (1980); <em>Commonwealth v. Kennerly, </em>269 Pa.Super. 404, 408-409, 410 A.2d 319, 321 (1979). Even if we were to consider this issue on its merits, the considerations and conclusions applicable to the seizure of the gun would be determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
