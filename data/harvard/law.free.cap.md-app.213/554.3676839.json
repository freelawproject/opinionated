These charges were the result of Khan\u2019s alleged assault of two girls in a cosmetics store where Khan worked as a security guard. After a jury trial, Khan was found guilty of one count of second degree assault and found not guilty of all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>charges. On February 8, 2012, Khan was sentenced to five years\u2019 incarceration, with all but sixty days suspended, and placed on supervised probation for three years upon release. Khan subsequently noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Appellant presents four questions, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">I. Did the trial court err in reseating a white male juror, struck by the defense, on the basis of a <em>Batson </em>challenge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">II. Did the trial court err in permitting the State to present evidence of prior customer complaints against appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">III. Did the trial court err in allowing the State to question appellant regarding possible racial prejudice held by appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">IV. Did the trial court err in <em>voir dire </em>by asking potential jurors whether they would be biased by the charges against appellant, without attributing that potential bias to \u201cstrong feelings?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">For the reasons that follow, we answer no to each question and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"AXp\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">On March 27, 2011, Khaliq Khan was working as a security guard at Ulta, a cosmetics store in downtown Silver Spring, when twelve-year-old Joie Gadsden and thirteen-year-old Jazmyn Parker came into the store. Gadsden and Parker entered the store to look around while Gadsden\u2019s parents were in a nearby bookstore. According to testimony by both Gadsden and Parker, Khan called the girls over to show them perfume. Both girls testified that Khan sprayed perfume on them, including on their chests, and had the girls smell each other. Gadsden testified that during this encounter Khan grabbed her waist and squeezed her buttocks, and Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>testified that Khan touched both of their buttocks when they began to leave. Gadsden and Parker reported this encounter to Gadsden\u2019s parents, who returned to the store and called the police. An officer from the Montgomery County Police Department was dispatched to the store and arrested appellant. Khan was charged with two counts of third degree sex offense and two counts of second degree assault and brought to trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Jury <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the court asked the following question: ]T]he State claims that the defendant, Mr. Khan, had sexual contact with two minors. Is there any member of the panel who, by reason of the nature of the charges, that is to say, by reason of what he\u2019s alleged to have been, to have done, will be unable to listen fairly and impartially?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">There were no affirmative responses. After the court finished questioning jurors, defense counsel objected to the form of the above question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">The time that I remembered that Your Honor asked it, you used \u201cbased on this allegation, does anybody, would anybody be unable to be fair,\u201d or something along those lines. And so, the question that I would, that we had asked in our voir dire is, \u201cdoes it arouse strong feelings?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The court overruled the defense\u2019s objection, stating that the question asked by the court was sufficient to discover any bias from potential jurors owing to the alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\"><em>Batson </em>Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">During jury selection for Khan\u2019s trial, the court noted that the defense had exercised five of its seven peremptory strikes against white men. After asking defense counsel to provide race- and gender-neutral reasons for each strike, the court was dissatisfied with counsel\u2019s proffer in regard to one potential juror, number 95, and so reseated this juror. Defense counsel explained the peremptory strike against juror 95 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>[Generally for him, Your Honor, it was he\u2019s an attorney with the federal government. The way he dressed. The way that his grooming was. It was, to me, again, somebody that was very conservative. It had nothing to do with the fact that he was a male or white. It was just the conservative sense[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Defense counsel went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">But I\u2019m talking about my vision and my judgment of the way he dresses, the way he grooms, the way he carries himself, he strikes me as a conservative type person.... I\u2019m conservative in many ways. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m a good juror....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">After a discussion regarding this juror, and each of the others, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">... the only one I\u2019m finding pretextual is 95, because the others, based on the record, I accept the explanations, not withstanding the five out of seven pattern. I\u2019m going to reseat 95.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Following the court\u2019s ruling, defense counsel continued to assert that his reasons for the strike were not pretextual, to which the judge responded: \u201cI think you\u2019re being candid. I just don\u2019t have to buy it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">\u201cBad Acts\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">During appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Georgia Kalapothakos, the manager of the store where appellant worked, defense counsel asked about her opinion of appellant as a worker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axa\">Q: What would you say, how would you describe Mr. Khan as a worker at the store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">[At this point, the prosecution objected and was overruled.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayj\">A: ... He was reliable. He was always early. He\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">Q: Were you pleased with his work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-14\">A: Yes. Overall, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-15\">Following this cross-examination, the prosecution asked for a ruling from the court that this testimony \u201copened the door\u201d for the prosecution to ask Kalapothakos about a customer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>complaint. The State sought to establish that the complaint was the impetus for a conversation Kalapothakos had with appellant regarding the boundaries and duties of a security guard\u2014a conversation she had previously testified about during the prosecution\u2019s direct examination. The prosecution reasoned that the testimony regarding Kalapothakos\u2019s \u201coverall\u201d satisfaction with appellant\u2019s work \u201copened the door\u201d to testimony about problems that had arisen in appellant\u2019s work history. The court ruled that such testimony would be allowed, and during the prosecution\u2019s redirect examination of Kalapothakos, she testified that her aforementioned discussion regarding a security guard\u2019s boundaries had resulted from a customer complaint. During this testimony, Kalapothakos never testified about the details of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellant, appellant\u2019s wife, and appellant\u2019s stepson also discussed this complaint. Appellant\u2019s wife, Chanaz Khan (\u201cMrs. Khan\u201d), acknowledged that she was aware of the prior complaint, though from her testimony she appeared not to have known its details. Appellant\u2019s stepson, Asman Nasir (\u201cMr. Nasir\u201d), testified that he had no knowledge of the prior complaint. During the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of appellant, he was asked whether he remembered the conversation he had with Kalapothakos regarding his boundaries and duties as a security guard, and whether he remembered a prior complaint from a customer regarding appellant \u201ctouching her.\u201d The court allowed the above testimony, ruling that the prosecution was allowed to respond to the character evidence and issues introduced by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Testimony Regarding Racial Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">At trial, Khan testified that Gadsden and Parker had made him nervous, that he intended to \u201coccupy\u201d them to prevent them from misusing products in the store, and that he never intended to offend or touch either girl inappropriately. On direct examination, appellant provided the following response to a question about his duties at the store:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">You go according to the books, because the neighborhood of that Silver Spring will, I mean, not a discrimination, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>over there you cannot control the (unintelligible) if you don\u2019t have all type of, if you go according to the books, okay, they will play it like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">During the State\u2019s cross-examination, appellant was asked to clarify' what he meant by his comment \u201cnot a discrimination.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During this line of questioning, the prosecution asked appellant if his comment was in regard to the high number of African Americans in the area of the store. The prosecutor also alluded to the incident in question and asked whether \u201c[t]wo African American 12 year olds looking at ... perfume made [appellant] nervous[.]\u201d Appellant responded affirmatively to this last question, but he stated throughout his testimony that he was not referring to prejudice against any particular race in his initial remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">A jury found Khan guilty of one count of second degree assault and acquitted him of the other charges. On February 8, 2012, Khan was sentenced to five years of confinement, with all but sixty days suspended, and placed on supervised probation for three years upon release. Following his sentencing, Khan noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Appellant first contends that the circuit court erred in finding defense counsel\u2019s race- and gender-neutral explanation for one of its peremptory strikes to be pretextual. For the reasons explained below, we do not agree that the circuit court committed reversible error in reseating this juror.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Parties in a criminal trial cannot use a peremptory challenge to strike a potential juror based on the juror\u2019s race. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 99, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The Supreme Court has made clear that the use of peremptory strikes on the basis of race is unconstitutional not only when exercised by the prosecution, but also when exercised by a defendant in a criminal trial. <em>Georgia v. McCollum, </em>505 U.S. 42, 55, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992). Though <em>\u201cBatson </em>challenges\u201d originally were used to challenge the striking of black jurors, purposeful discrimination against white jurors is also an impermissible use of a peremptory challenge. <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 624-45, 667 A.2d 876 (1995). Additionally, the use of peremptory challenges to strike a juror on the basis of gender is impermissible. <em>Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 266, 623 A.2d 648 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Supreme Court has laid out a three-part analysis by which a trial court should examine a party\u2019s use of peremptory challenges if contested as unconstitutionally discriminatory. Pu<em>rkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767-68, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995). First, the trial court must determine whether a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination against potential jurors exists. <em>Id. </em>If such a finding is made, the party exercising the peremptory strikes must present a race-neutral explanation for each strike. <em>Id. </em>The trial court must then decide whether purposeful discrimination has occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing [a] trial judge\u2019s <em>[Batson </em>] decision, appellate courts do not presume to second-guess the call by the \u2018umpire on the field\u2019 either by way of <em>de novo </em>fact finding or by way of independent constitutional judgment.\u201d <em>Bailey v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 323, 328, 579 A.2d 774 (1990). Therefore, in examining a <em>Batson </em>challenge, this court reviews the trial judge\u2019s findings using a clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 579 A.2d 774. <em>See also Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 364, 111 S.Ot. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (\u201cIn <em>Batson </em>we explained that the trial court\u2019s decision on the ultimate question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact of the sort accorded great deference on appeal----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Appellant takes issue with the circuit court\u2019s application of the second and third steps in its <em>Batson </em>analysis. He argues that the race- and gender-neutral reasons proffered by his counsel for striking juror 95 were believable, and that because the trial judge acknowledged that counsel was being \u201ccandid,\u201d the court\u2019s finding of pretext was clear error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In completing the second step of a <em>Batson </em>analysis, the question is only whether the reasons offered for the peremptory strike are race-neutral. This step \u201cdoes not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible.\u201d <em>Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769. It is true that the reasons offered by defense counsel for the use of a peremptory strike against juror 95 appear to be race- and gender-neutral. Defense counsel noted that his reasons for striking this juror were based on the conservative appearance of the juror and the fact that the juror was a government attorney. Appellant argues that because these reasons proffered for striking juror 95 were facially valid and race- and gender-neutral, they should be accepted. This is not the final step in a <em>Batson </em>analysis, however, and it does not necessarily establish that the strikes were proper. In <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 667 A.2d 876 (1995), defense counsel proffered as his reasons for one challenged peremptory strike the fact that the juror was wearing a blazer and khaki slacks and was a student with sixteen years of education\u2014not unlike the explanation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>issue in the present case. In <em>Gilchrist, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the trial court was \u201cwarranted in holding that these reasons were pretextual.\u201d 340 Md. at 628, 667 A.2d 876. Therefore, it is clear that an explanation that is race- and gender-neutral and an accurate description of the juror is not alone sufficient to withstand a <em>Batson </em>challenge. The explanation must not be <em>pretextual. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Thus, appellant\u2019s real argument is focused on the third step of the <em>Batson </em>analysis: whether the circuit court erred in finding that these race- and gender-neutral reasons for striking this juror were pretextual, and whether the circuit court therefore erred in finding purposeful discrimination in this strike. For each of the other white male jurors who were struck, defense counsel offered reasons for his exercise of peremptory strikes which generally consisted of characteristics that defense counsel had noted on paper prior to the <em>Batson </em>challenge being raised. These characteristics included the juror\u2019s age, the fact that the juror\u2019s spouse was a homemaker, the fact that the juror was closely related to law enforcement, and for one juror the fact that he was a statistician. None of these explanations fit juror 95, prompting defense counsel\u2019s explanation that juror 95 was a young, conservative-looking attorney working for the government. Given these circumstances, the trial court believed this explanation to be pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The judge\u2019s statement here that he believed that defense counsel was being \u201ccandid\u201d does not indicate error in the judge\u2019s ruling. The fact that the court believed defense counsel was partially motivated by certain characteristics he observed does not mean that the court was required to exclude the challenged juror. The trial court\u2019s determination is whether \u201cintentional discrimination was a <em>substantial or motivating factor </em>in the decision to exercise the strike.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Jones v. Plaster, </em>57 F.3d 417, 420-21 (4th Cir.1995) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 359, 111 S.Ct. 1859). Immediately after acknowledging defense counsel\u2019s candor, the judge stated \u201cI just don\u2019t have to buy it.\u201d Therefore, it is clear from the record that the circuit court ultimately was not persuaded by defense counsel\u2019s explanation and that it believed purposeful discrimination had been a substantial factor in the striking of juror 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">As a reviewing court, we give the trial court\u2019s finding \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Bridges v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 113, 134, 695 A.2d 609 (1997) (\u201cThe trial judge is able to get the \u2018feel\u2019 of the opposing advocates-to watch their demeanor, to hear their intonations, and to spot their frequently unspoken purposes.\u201d (quoting <em>Bailey v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 323, 328, 579 A.2d 774 (1990))). In the present case, the trial court noted a pattern of strikes against white male jurors, and the explanation proffered for the defense\u2019s strike against juror 95 was offered when his previously-noted explanations for this series of strikes did not apply to this juror. The explanation given was different from any of the other explanations accepted by the trial court. Given these circumstances, we do not see clear error in the court\u2019s finding that this particular explanation was pretextual and that purposeful discrimination had occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Appellant next argues that testimony regarding a prior customer complaint was inadmissible \u201cprior bad acts\u201d evidence, and that because the circuit court erroneously ruled that appellant \u201copened the door\u201d to the State\u2019s questions, the court should not have admitted testimony on that subject from appellant, his manager, and his wife and stepson.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">According to the testimony of several witnesses, the prior complaint was from a customer who alleged that appellant inappropriately touched her, but it was never verified.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant contends that this evidence was inadmissible as a \u201cbad act\u201d under Maryland Rule 5-404(b). \u201c[A] bad act is an activity or conduct, not necessarily criminal, that tends to impugn or reflect adversely upon one\u2019s character, taking into consideration the facts of the underlying [trial].\u201d <em>Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 116, 134, 857 A.2d 88 (2004) (quoting <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 547, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999)). Rule 5-404(b) states that \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Evidence of prior acts <em>is </em>admissible, however, for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, common scheme or plan, knowledge, or absence of mistake or accident. Md. Rule 5-404(b); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Behrel v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 64, 125, 823 A.2d 696 (2003) (citing <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 407, 697 A.2d 432 (1997)) (noting that exceptions listed in Rule 5-404(b) are not exclusive, but only representative).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We need not delve into the intricate standard of review for prior bad acts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the subject of the disputed testimonies in this case was not, in fact, a prior bad act. Instead, the witnesses\u2019 testimonies concerned only a <em>complaint </em>about a prior, unspecified act, which was relevant in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">First, Kalapothakos\u2019s testimony was relevant according to the \u201copen door\u201d doctrine, which \u201cis based on principles of fairness and permits a party to introduce evidence that otherwise might not be admissible in order to respond to certain evidence put forth by opposing counsel.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 388, 969 A.2d 989 (2009) (citing <em>Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 545, 693 A.2d 781 (1997)). \u201cIf one party has introduced irrelevant evidence, over objection, or, indeed, even \u2018admissible evidence which generates an issue,\u2019 the trial court may rule that the first party has \u2018opened the door\u2019 to evidence offered by the opposing party that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>previously would have been irrelevant, but has become relevant.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 388, 969 A.2d 989 (quoting L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 103:13(c)(i)). The doctrine \u201cis implicated when a party seeks to respond to the other party\u2019s evidence with either (1) evidence which is competent, or (2) evidence which is similar to the adversary\u2019s evidence which was ruled competent <em>over objection.\u201d Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 87, 629 A.2d 1239 (1993) (emphasis in original). This doctrine is narrow, and a response to the issues injected by the adverse party should be tailored appropriately. <em>Donaldson v. State, </em>416 Md. 467, 493, 7 A.3d 84 (2010) (citing <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 389, 969 A.2d 989). Furthermore, this evidence may also be excluded if a court finds that \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-403; <em>Clark, </em>332 Md. at 87, 629 A.2d 1239 (citing Fed.R.Evid. 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On direct examination, the prosecution asked only whether Kalapothakos had a prior conversation with appellant regarding the boundaries and duties of a security guard. The scope of that question was limited to the fact that this discussion occurred, and not the impetus for it. On cross-examination, it was <em>defense </em>counsel who raised the issue of appellant\u2019s past work in general by asking how Kalapothakos would \u201cdescribe him as a worker\u201d and whether she was \u201cpleased with his work.\u201d In response to these questions, Kalapothakos answered that appellant was \u201creliable\u201d and that she was pleased with his work \u201coverall.\u201d This testimony regarding appellant\u2019s past work performance\u2014elicited by the defense over objection\u2014\u201copened the door\u201d for the State to clarify Kalapothakos\u2019s statement that she was pleased with appellant\u2019s work \u201coverall\u201d by asking whether she had been informed of any specific misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Second, the testimony of the remaining witnesses about the prior complaint was relevant to impeach evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>appellant\u2019s character for truthfulness. Md. Rule 5\u2014608(a)(4); Md. Rule 5-616(a)(3). During the defense\u2019s direct examination of Mrs. Khan, she testified that her husband was \u201cvery honest at his job [and] at home....\u201d Following this testimony, the prosecution asked the court to allow questioning regarding Mrs. Khan\u2019s knowledge of the prior complaint against appellant from a customer, arguing that whether appellant had discussed this incident with his wife was relevant to his honesty, a character issue about which Mrs. Khan had testified. Similarly, appellant\u2019s stepson, Mr. Nasir, was asked by defense counsel to testify about appellant\u2019s honesty, to which he responded: \u201cTruthful, trustworthy, good moral character, and a man of integrity.\u201d The prosecution, during cross-examination, asked Mr. Nasir whether appellant had told him about the prior customer complaint, to which Mr. Nasir responded that he had not. The State\u2019s purpose of this line of questioning was evident from its follow-up question: \u201cNow that you know about that, does that change your opinion about his honesty in any way?\u201d Finally, appellant initially denied there having been prior customer complaints against him, making the complaint relevant as direct impeaching evidence. Md. Rule 5-616(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">While the proverbial door was opened to the disputed testimony, it remained for the trial court to balance its probative value against its prejudicial nature, <em>see </em>Rule 5-403, and here we see no abuse of discretion. The evidence in question was not presented to prove that an untoward incident <em>actually had occurred, </em>and the complaint\u2019s substance was never addressed in detail. The testimony elicited from Kalapothakos during the State\u2019s redirect examination was narrowly tailored to respond to her testimony during the defense\u2019s cross-examination. As soon as the State attempted to elicit testimony regarding the <em>details </em>of the prior complaint, defense counsel\u2019s objections were sustained. Kalapothakos did not discuss the details of this complaint; her testimony was only that a complaint had been made. Similarly, neither Mrs. Khan nor Mr. Nasir testified as to <em>details </em>of the prior complaint. Mrs. Khan acknowledged that she was aware of the prior complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>against her husband, but she did not know the details of its substance, and that was the end of the State\u2019s inquiry. The prosecution asked appellant\u2019s stepson, Mr. Nasir, whether appellant had told him about the prior customer complaint, to which Mr. Nasir responded that he had not. Given the context of the witnesses\u2019 testimonies and their limited scope, appellant suffered no undue prejudice requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to question him regarding racial prejudice. We review whether such evidence was admissible under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 384, 394, 827 A.2d 167 (2003) (\u201cIt is ordinarily within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine the admissibility of evidence.\u201d (citing <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 176, 729 A.2d 910 (1999))). Though we agree with appellant that evidence of racial prejudice is generally inadmissible and caution against its use, we conclude that there was no reversible error in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Appellant cites <em>Eiler v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 439, 492 A.2d 1320 (1985), to argue that evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s racial prejudice is inadmissible. In <em>Eiler, </em>the prosecution asked the defendant to explain how he had described a particular neighborhood in a previous hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 492 A.2d 1320. During this testimony, the prosecution quoted extensively from the defendant\u2019s testimony in a previous trial, where the defendant had referred to the neighborhood in question as \u201cSpade Area,\u201d then explained that by \u201cSpade Area\u201d he meant \u201ccolored,\u201d and stated that \u201c[being called spade] is better than being called black or colored....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 492 A.2d 1320. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals held that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant regarding the defendant\u2019s testimony in a previous hearing was \u201cprejudicial, irrelevant, and collateral\u201d to the case. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 492 A.2d 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The present case is distinguishable from <em>Eiler </em>for two reasons. First, because of the context of the questioning in the present case, the evidence here was not \u201cirrelevant\u201d and \u201ccollateral\u201d in the same way as the evidence at issue in <em>Eiler. </em>Additionally, appellant\u2019s testimony here, taken as a whole, was not as prejudicial as the testimony in <em>Eiler. </em>We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In <em>Eiler, </em>the prosecution introduced racially-charged testimony from the defendant\u2019s prior trial. In the present case, however, appellant himself had testified about the store\u2019s neighborhood, and he made a follow-up comment that he did not intend to sound discriminatory. This vague testimony left considerable room for misinterpretation, and the State\u2019s questioning was a relevant attempt to clarify these comments. Appellant\u2019s remarks pertaining to \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and how this affected his conduct as a security guard were relevant to the case, because in appellant\u2019s testimony he attempted to explain his conduct toward both girls by testifying that they made him nervous and that he therefore sought to engage and \u201coccupy\u201d them. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 97, 111, 792 A.2d 368 (2002) (\u201cGenerally, evidence is relevant and admissible if it tends either to establish or disprove issues in the case.\u201d (citing <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 591, 762 A.2d 125 (2000))); <em>Snyder, </em>361 Md. at 592, 762 A.2d 125 (\u201c[T]he relevancy determination is not made in isolation. Instead, the test of relevance is whether, in conjunction with all other relevant evidence, the evidence tends to make the proposition asserted more or less probable.\u201d (citing <em>Spector v. State, </em>289 Md. 407, 434, 425 A.2d 197 (1981))). In short, the fact that the prosecution was attempting to clarify <em>appellant\u2019s </em>own remarks made previously in the same trial distinguishes the testimony here from that in <em>Eiler, </em>in which the <em>prosecution </em>injected issues of racial prejudice by asking the defendant to testify about remarks made <em>prior </em>to his current trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Furthermore, we note that the testimony in the present case does not appear to be as racially charged as that in <em>Eiler. </em>In <em>Eiler, </em>the prosecution quoted extensively testimony from the defendant\u2019s previous trial and repeated the defendant\u2019s racial slurs. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s racial prejudice was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>fact demonstrated by the evidence at issue, potentially creating jury \u201cprejudice, hostility, or sympathy.\u201d <em>Eiler, </em>68 Md.App. at 453, 492 A.2d 1320. This stands in contrast to the present case, in which appellant\u2014in responding to the prosecutor\u2019s questions\u2014repeatedly clarified that he had not been referring to any \u201crace\u201d or \u201cparticular segment of people\u201d but rather people \u201coverall\u201d when he made his comment regarding discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Therefore, while we caution against questioning similar to that at issue in this case, the evidence elicited here was relevant to appellant\u2019s prior testimony and did not cause unfair prejudice. For these reasons, the admission of this evidence at trial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Appellant\u2019s final argument is in regard to the following question asked at <em>voir dire:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">[T]he State claims that the defendant, Mr. Khan, had sexual contact with two minors. Is there any member of the panel who, by reason of the nature of the charges, that is to say, by reason of what he\u2019s alleged to have been, to have done, will be unable to listen fairly and impartially?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred because this question did not ask potential jurors whether the crime might arouse \u201cstrong feelings\u201d causing bias against the defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>rulings, we examine the record \u201cas a whole for an abuse of discretion, that is, questioning that is not reasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias, partiality, or prejudice.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>399 Md. 146, 160, 923 A.2d 44 (2007) (citing <em>White v. State, </em>374 Md. 232, 243, 821 A.2d 459 (2003)). \u201cThe scope of voir dire and the form of questions propounded rest firmly within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>399 Md. at 159, 923 A.2d 44 (citing <em>Curtin v. State, </em>393 Md. 593, 603, 903 A.2d 922 (2006)). The primary purpose of <em>voir dire </em>is \u201cto ensure a fair and impartial jury by determining the existence of cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>disqualification.\u201d <em>State v. Logan, </em>394 Md. 378, 396, 906 A.2d 374 (2006) (citing <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 207, 798 A.2d 566 (2002)). Refusal by the trial court to ask a question regarding \u201ca specific cause for disqualification\u201d constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Shim, </em>418 Md. 37, 45, 12 A.3d 671 (2011) (quoting <em>Moore v. State, </em>412 Md. 635, 654, 989 A.2d 1150 (2010)). Specific causes include biases related to the defendant, witnesses, or the crime. <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 45, 12 A.3d 671 (citing <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 10, 759 A.2d 819 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Appellant cites <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566 (2002), and <em>Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 806 A.2d 265 (2002), to argue that a trial court abuses its discretion when it denies a defendant\u2019s request to include the words \u201cstrong feelings\u201d in a <em>voir dire </em>question targeting juror bias from the nature of the crime alleged. We do not believe that such a literal reading of these cases is accurate. In both of these cases, as well as the more recent case <em>State v. Shim, </em>the Court of Appeals held that a question aimed at uncovering the bias of potential jurors based on the defendant\u2019s alleged crimes must be asked if requested. In <em>Shim, </em>the court wrote: \u201cwe recognize today that the potential for bias exists in most crimes, and thus we will require <em>voir dire </em>questions which are targeted at uncovering these biases.\u201d 418 Md. at 54, 12 A.3d 671. The court noted that a question targeted at biases related to the crime must be asked \u201cregardless of the crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We believe that the <em>voir dire </em>question that <em>was </em>asked in the present case was sufficiently \u201ctargeted at uncovering these biases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant\u2019s contention is solely based on the absence of two words: \u201cstrong feelings.\u201d We do not believe that, simply because the requested questions in <em>Thomas, Sweet, </em>and <em>Shim </em>happened to contain these two words, their presence was a <em>necessa/ry </em>part of the court\u2019s holdings in those cases. In <em>Thomas, </em>on which appellant relies, the trial court had refused to ask a question targeting biases related to the crime, stating that he had covered the requested question through other questions asked during <em>voir dire. </em>In holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>that the questions asked by the trial court were not sufficient, the Court of Appeals noted that the question to which the trial judge was referring was a \u201cgeneral voir dire question\u201d and that it had previously \u201ccautioned against the use of such questions to ascertain bias of a specific kind----\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>369 Md. at 214, 798 A.2d 566. Therefore, the issue in <em>Thomas, </em>as well as <em>Sweet </em>and <em>Shim, </em>was the <em>absence </em>of a question specifically targeting biases based on the crime, not the <em>form </em>of such a question that <em>was </em>asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">When a required question is asked, and the objection is related to the form of the question asked, we will give great deference to the trial court. <em>Stewart, </em>399 Md. at 159, 923 A.2d 44 (\u201cThe scope of voir dire and the form of questions propounded rest firmly within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d (citing <em>Curtin, </em>393 Md. at 603, 903 A.2d 922)). The court in <em>Shim </em>was asked to determine whether the defense\u2019s requested question targeting bias based on the alleged crime was too broad, as it contained the language \u201cviolent death,\u201d rather than \u201cmurder\u201d or \u201cthe criminal charges in this case.\u201d The <em>Shim </em>court held that such a departure from the general question targeting bias based on the crime was acceptable, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">To hold differently ... would make <em>voir dire </em>an exercise in semantics and a minefield for criminal defendants and the State. We decline to make such fine distinctions or create more uncertainty. A proposed <em>voir dire </em>question need not be in perfect form, and the court is free to modify the proposed question as needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\"><em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 55, 12 A.3d 671 (citing <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop, </em>217 Md. 595, 606, 143 A.2d 627 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">To find reversible error in the failure to include \u201cstrong feelings\u201d in the <em>voir dire </em>question before us would similarly be an exercise in mere semantics. Moreover, as the State persuasively argues, the question asked at <em>voir dire </em>was <em>more </em>favorable to the defendant, because it did not frame bias as defendant solely on \u201cstrong\u201d feelings. As a broader question, it potentially excluded <em>more </em>jurors unfavorable to the defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>and any error was therefore not prejudicial to appellant. The court\u2019s question asking if the nature of the charges against appellant would prevent any jurors from listening \u201cfairly and impartially\u201d fulfills the requirement laid out in <em>Thomas, Sweet, </em>and <em>Shim, </em>and creates \u201ca reasonable assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>399 Md. at 159, 923 A.2d 44 (citing <em>White, </em>374 Md. at 242, 821 A.2d 459). Therefore, reversal is not required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">. Appellant is not a native English speaker, and an interpreter was used to assist with some questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\">. In appellant\u2019s brief, he states that the circuit court also denied improperly his later motion to reconsider the court\u2019s reseating of this juror. However, the substance of appellant\u2019s argument concerns the judge\u2019s finding of pretext made during jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Even if appellant's argument that the court denied improperly his motion to reconsider were made in full, there was no error. Defense counsel, after jury selection, noted to the court that juror 95 stared at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>him the \u201centire time\u201d during the jury\u2019s oath. After a lengthy discussion regarding this and the previous explanation offered by defense counsel for its strike of juror 95, the judge stated that he would \u201ccarefully observe the jury\u201d as the trial progressed, and asked counsel to raise the issue again if something additional came up. After the first day of testimony, defense counsel again raised this issue, to which the judge responded that he had been observing this juror and did not believe him to seem \u201cany different than any other juror.\u201d Therefore, we note that the judge did in fact reconsider appellant\u2019s arguments regarding juror 95, but found defense counsel\u2019s additional explanation regarding the juror\u2019s demeanor to be without merit based on his own observations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">. The federal circuits have split in their analyses of <em>Batson </em>challenges in which both race-based and race-neutral reasons have motivated peremptory strikes. Some circuits have adopted the \"mixed-motive\u201d test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>[W]here both race-based and race-neutral reasons have motivated a challenged decision, a supplementary analysis applies. In these situations, the Court allows those accused of unlawful discrimination to prevail, despite clear evidence of racially discriminatory motivation, if they can show that the challenged decision would have been made even absent the impermissible motivation, or, put another way, that the discriminatory motivation was not a \"but for\u201d cause of the challenged decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><em>Cook v. LaMarque, </em>593 F.3d 810, 814 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Kesser v. Cambra, </em>465 F.3d 351, 372 (9th Cir.2006)). <em>See also, e.g., Gattis v. Snyder, </em>278 F.3d 222, 232-35 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Wallace v. Morrison, </em>87 F.3d 1271, 1274-75 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam); <em>Jones v.

Senkowski, </em>986 F.2d 24, 27-30 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Although the Supreme Court is aware of the \"mixed-motives\u201d test, it has not adopted a specific stance beyond the basic rule of law in <em>Batson. </em>In <em>Snyder v. Louisiana, </em>552 U.S. 472, 485-86, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008), the Court noted that it has held, in <em>non-Batson </em>scenarios:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">Once it is shown that a discriminatory intent was a substantial or motivating factor in an action taken by a state actor, the burden shifts to the party defending the action to show that this factor was not determinative. We have not previously applied this rule in a <em>Batson </em>case, and we need not decide here whether that standard governs in this context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Thus, the \"substantial motivating factor\u201d language from <em>Batson </em>remains the prevailing standard, and it does not require a specific causative analysis. <em>See Cook, </em>593 F.3d at 814-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Although we are not the final authority on this matter, we would echo the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 observation that the mixed-motives test presents severe conceptual problems. <em>Id. </em>at 814-15. The Supreme Court itself \"alluded to the difficulty of determining on collateral review which of the prosecutor\u2019s motives were \u2018but for\u2019 causes.\" <em>Id. </em>at 815 (citing <em>Snyder, </em>552 U.S. at 485-86, 128 S.Ct. 1203).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">More importantly, we doubt that a trial court could actually make such a subtle causal distinction in any given trial. The mixed-motives test applies by definition when <em>\"both </em>race-based and race-neutral reasons have <em>motivated </em>a challenged decision.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>593 F.3d at 814 (emphases added). If equal protection is violated only when the challenger\u2019s race-based reason was a but-for cause of the challenge, then the rae <em>e-neutral </em>reason for a challenge must have been an <em>insufficient </em>cause, standing alone (otherwise, the race-based reason could not be a causative factor). Thus, the entire mixed-motive analysis is premised upon the challenger\u2019s race-neutral reason being <em>a motivating </em>factor, but somehow not motivating <em>enough </em>to cause the strike when the race-based reason is \"subtracted\u201d from the decision to challenge. As a practical matter, we cannot imagine how a trial court could make such a determination, and as a constitutional matter, we believe it is fair to disallow a strike where racial bias plays <em>any </em>part in the decision to strike a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Although we would not hold trial courts to the mixed-motives test, the present case ultimately does not <em>require </em>us to resolve this constitutional question, for even if the mixed-motive analysis were required\u2014or merely permitted\u2014under <em>Batson, </em>neither side raised the issue at trial. There is no record from which we could potentially reconstruct a but-for causation analysis, and whether the trial court should have employed a mixed-motives analysis was not preserved for our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b593-6\">.
