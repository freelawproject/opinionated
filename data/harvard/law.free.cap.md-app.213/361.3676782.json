The court imposed consecutive sentences of ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the conviction for third degree burglary, ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the conviction for second degree assault, and one year of imprisonment for the fourth degree sex offense conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">On appeal, appellant raised two questions for our review which we rephrase as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">1. In concluding that appellant had waived his right to a trial by a jury, did the trial court err by failing to comply with the provision of Maryland Rule 4-246(b) that requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the court to \u201cdeterminen and announced on the record that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">2. Was the evidence adduced at trial insufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Upon review of the first issue, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination and announcement of waiver of the appellant\u2019s right to a trial by jury did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 4-246(b), and reversal is required by the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Valonis v. State, </em>431 Md. 551, 66 A.3d 661 (2013). Accordingly, because there is no merit to the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we will vacate the judgments of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">PROCEEDINGS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On June 8, 2010, prior to the start of trial, the following exchange took place in open court regarding appellant\u2019s decision whether to proceed by way of a jury trial or bench trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">[THE COURT]: How are we proceeding, with a jury trial this morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Mr. Costen, you sure you want a jury trial? Remember what I told you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">[APPELLANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIs\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The judge is going to ask you some questions about whether or not you want a jury trial. I want you to listen to each question that [the judge] asks you and answer him distinctly so the court reporter can hear your responses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\">[THE COURT]: All right. Mr. Costen, do you understand what you are charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>[THE COURT]: Burglary in the first degree, burglary, burglary in the\u2014do you know these penalties off the top of your head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No, but I can get\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">[THE COURT]: All right. Burglary in the first degree is 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: 20 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">[THE COURT]: You\u2019re also charged with burglary in the third degree. Is that 10?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">[THE COURT]: Burglary in the fourth degree is three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL0\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">[THE COURT]: Assault in the second degree is ten-year maximum penalty. Attempted first degree rape is a potential life sentence. Attempted second-degree rape is 20. Sex offense in the third degree I believe is a 10-year penalty. And fourth degree sex offense is a maximum penalty of one year. It\u2019s alleged that these events occurred on or about October 3rd, 2010, in Snow Hill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">Do you understand what you are charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeg\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">[THE COURT]: Do you understand the penalties involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aez\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">[THE COURT]: And you have discussed the elements of these offenses with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-17\">[THE COURT]: Do you understand because of the penalties you do have a right to a jury trial, which consists of 12 people selected from this panel that is presently in the courtroom, and those 12 people would all have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt in order for you to be found guilty. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-18\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-19\">[THE COURT]: Knowing that[,] do you want a jury trial in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-20\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>[THE COURT]: You\u2019re going to give up your right to a jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">[THE COURT]: Has anybody forced you or coerced or promised you anything to get you to proceed in this fashion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">[THE COURT]: All right. I find that he has waived his right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Following the court\u2019s finding that appellant had waived a jury trial, the court proceeded with trying the merits of the case, and appellant was convicted of four offenses as noted above. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Appellant contends that, although the trial judge did advise him about the charges against him, the corresponding penalties, and the basic nature of a jury trial, the court\u2019s declaration that \u201cI find that he has waived his right to a jury trial\u201d was not in compliance with the express requirements of Rule 4-246(b). That Rule provides that a trial court \u201cmay not accept\u201d a waiver of the right to be tried by a jury unless there has been an examination of the defendant in open court after which \u201cthe court determines and announces on the record that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear that the trial court in this case did not announce on the record that the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">We perceive no material distinction between the facts surrounding the purported waiver in this instance and those which were described by the Court of Appeals in <em>Valonis </em>as being insufficient to support a valid waiver of trial by jury. In <em>Valonis, </em>the Court of Appeals reviewed two cases in which the respective defendants had expressed a desire to waive a trial by jury. In one of the cases, at the conclusion of the examination of the defendant regarding his jury waiver, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>counsel stated: \u201cIt is my understanding you are waiving your right to a jury trial and have [His] Honor hear the case today?\u201d After the defendant said \u201c[y]es,\u201d the trial judge announced: \u201cAll right. We will note the waiver of the right to trial by jury.\u201d In the second case, the waiver examination concluded with the judge asking a final question: \u201cDo you wish to have, to elect a bench trial?\u201d After the defendant responded \u201c[y]es, sir,\u201d the trial judge announced: \u201cOkay. All right. You may have a seat. Ready to start?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In holding that the trial judge in each of the above cases had failed to comply with the determination-and-announcement requirement of Rule 4-246(b), the Court of Appeals observed that that Rule \u201ccould not be clearer,\u201d <em>Valonis, </em>431 Md. at 563, 66 A.3d 661 noting: \u201cSubsection (b) requires the circuit court judge to make an express determination on the record that the defendant acted knowingly and voluntarily. In other words, the judge is required to announce his or her finding as to the knowing and voluntary waiver on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 66 A.3d 661. As a consequence of each trial judge\u2019s failure to make an express determination and announcement in the two cases under review in <em>Valonis, </em>both cases were remanded for new trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The <em>Valonis </em>Court explained that, prior to the amendment of Rule 4-246(b)\u2014pursuant to an order which was effective January 1, 2008\u2014the announcement requirement which the rule now imposes upon trial judges had been less strict. In <em>Powell v. State, </em>394 Md. 632, 907 A.2d 242 (2006), the Court had held \u201cthat the version of Rule 4-246(b) [then in effect] did not compel that the trial judge state explicitly on the record that he or she found the jury trial waiver to be knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>Valonis, </em>431 Md. at 562, 66 A.3d 661. In response to the <em>Powell </em>ruling, however, Rule 4-246(b) was amended. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 66 A.3d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In <em>Valonis, </em>the Court reviewed the history of the amendment, stating, <em>id. </em>at 562, 66 A.3d 661:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">By adopting the recommendation of the Rules Committee to amend Rule 4-246(b), by Order of this Court dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>December 4, 2007, effective January 1, 2008, we deleted the words \u201cit determines\u201d and added to the Rule the phrase \u201cthe court determines and announces on the record\u201d and further added Committee and Cross reference notes. By adding the phrase, \u201cthe court determines and announces on the record,\u201d the Court clearly directed circuit court judges to make an explicit determination of a defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver, or lack thereof, on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">[I]n <em>Walker [v. State, </em>406 Md. 369, 377 n. 1, 958 A.2d 915 (2008) ], we acknowledged that the changes we made to Rule 4-246(b) were substantive and confirmed that \u201c[tjrial judges are now required to determinen and announce[] on the record that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The <em>Valonis </em>Court emphasized: \u201cWe amended Rule 4-246(b) to require the circuit court to announce its factual determination on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 66 A.3d 661. The Court reiterated, <em>id. </em>at 568, 66 A.3d 661:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">After the court determines that the waiver is knowing and voluntary, the court is required to announce that determination on the record. It is the responsibility of the trial judge to make a determination and to announce it on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Furthermore, the <em>Valonis </em>Court rejected the State\u2019s arguments about appellate preservation of this specific variety of error, and held that the absence of any objection to the circuit court\u2019s lack of strict compliance with the announcement requirement of Rule 4-246(b) did \u201cnot preclude appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 66 A.3d 661.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The Court held that the issue of whether each defendant\u2019s jury trial waiver was valid was \u201cpreserved for appellate review notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 66 A.3d 661. To the extent that this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ray v. State, </em>206 Md.App. 309, 350, 47 A.3d 1113 <em>cert. granted, </em>429 Md. 81, 54 A.3d 759 (2012), held otherwise, that portion of that opinion is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The <em>Valonis </em>Court also added this specific variety of error to the very limited category of trial errors that are not subject to analysis for whether the mistake was a \u201charmless error,\u201d stating, 431 Md. at 569, 66 A.3d 661: \u201cMoreover, the trial judge\u2019s failure to announce its determination on the record is not a mere technicality and is not subject to harmless error analysis.\u201d To the extent that this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Ray, supra, </em>206 Md.App. at 356, 47 A.3d 1113 and <em>Aguilera v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 426, 437-38, 997 A.2d 888 (2010), held otherwise, those portions of the opinions are disapproved. The <em>Valonis </em>Court explained its rationale for conferring preferential status upon this error, 431 Md. at 570, 66 A.3d 661:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">[T]he waiver provisions in place in Rule 4-246(b) are intended to ensure that the defendant\u2019s waiver [of] a jury trial is made knowingly and voluntarily. Strict compliance with the requirements of Rule 4-246(b) will ensure that there is an adequate examination of the defendant, such that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>may determine and announce on the record that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Consequently, in the present case, we conclude that, as the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Valonis, id.: </em>\u201cthe trial judge[] committed reversible error in failing to comply with the determine and announce requirement of Rule 4-246(b) and thereby failed to demonstrate a valid waiver of [the appellant\u2019s] right to a trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.

The dissenting opinion took issue with the majority's conclusion that the issue had been preserved for appeal, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">Both of these defendants appealed their respective convictions on a single ground. To place the basis of their appeals in perspective, it is also worth noting what they do not argue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">Neither defendant contends that he did not knowingly and voluntarily ask for a bench trial in lieu of a jury trial. Neither defendant now contends that the substance of the inquiry as to his intention to waive a juiy trial was inadequate. Neither contends that the trial judge did not, in fact, find his waiver to be knowing and voluntary. Neither defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>argues that the ensuing trial was unfair. Neither defendant complains that his counsel was ineffective. Neither defendant complains of overreaching by the police or prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">Each defendant asks for his conviction to be overturned <em>only </em>because the trial judge failed to document explicitly the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had waived a jury knowingly and voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">The Court's decision today reverses the results of two bench trials for faulty documentation despite the absence of any objection by defense counsel that the trial court had inadequately documented its determination that the defendant acted knowingly and voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">The majority opinion holds that we must overlook the failure of the defense counsel to raise any objection to the adequacy of the trial court's documentation of its finding as to the defendant\u2019s intent with respect to the waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">431 Md. at 556-58, 66 A.3d 661 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b391-8\">WATTS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">I, respectfully, dissent.
