The court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for the felony murder conviction and a consecutive sentence of twenty years for the conspiracy conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">On appeal, appellant presents seven questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">1. Did the trial court err by refusing to ask appellant\u2019s requested voir dire question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">2. Must appellant\u2019s convictions be reversed as a result of the introduction of other crimes evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">3. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence that appellant called out his girlfriend\u2019s name while in custody, and thereafter in refusing to allow appellant to introduce evidence to explain his action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">4. Did the trial court err in restricting appellant\u2019s ability to cross-examine a witness regarding her eligibility for parole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">5. Did the trial court err in admitting hearsay evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">6. Did the trial court err in refusing to tailor its flight and concealment of evidence instructions to both sides\u2019 theories of the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">7. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s request to appear without shackles during the announcement of the verdict and polling of the jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On July 25, 2010, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Stephen Pitcairn arrived at Penn Station in Baltimore City. He was returning from a trip to New York, where he celebrated his 24th birthday with his sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">While Mr. Pitcairn was walking from the station to his apartment, located in the Charles Village section of Baltimore City, he was attacked and robbed by two individuals. Less than an hour later, at 12:05 a.m. on July 26, 2010, Mr. Pitcairn died due to a stab wound to his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">When Mr. Pitcairn arrived at the train station at approximately 11:00 p.m., he called his mother, Gwen Pitcairn, to let her know that he was back in Baltimore. He said he was going to walk home from the station, which he estimated to be a 15-20 minute walk. Mr. Pitcairn asked his mother to talk to him on his cell phone until he got home, stating: \u201cI always feel so safe when you\u2019re on the phone with me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Mr. Pitcairn was telling Ms. Pitcairn about his weekend with his sisters when Ms. Pitcairn heard \u201ca lot of noise and commotion.\u201d She heard Mr. Pitcairn state that he did not have any money, and he said: \u201cHere, take my wallet.\u201d Ms. Pitcairn heard a man say \u201cshut up\u201d twice. She then heard \u201csomething [that] sounded like [Mr. Pitcairn] got punched\u201d and \u201cshuffling\u201d sounds. Someone then disconnected the call from Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Ms. Pitcairn, who was at her home in Florida, called 411 and was connected to 911 in Baltimore. By the time she spoke with the 911 operator, the Baltimore police already were aware that there had been an incident. At 2:45 a.m. on July 26, 2010, Ms. Pitcairn learned that Mr. Pitcairn had been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Prior to the assault, Reggie Higgins was at his home on St. Paul Street. He heard loud noises outside, looked out of his second-floor window, and saw three people scuffling on the sidewalk in front of his home. Mr. Higgins observed a thin white male who was approximately six feet tall, whom he later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>learned was Mr. Pitcairn, backing away from two black individuals, both of whom Mr. Higgins believed were men. One of the individuals had braided hair or twists, and the other had short hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Mr. Pitcairn yelled: \u201c[H]elp,\u201d and Mr. Higgins ran down the stairs to his first-floor window to get a better view. He saw the two individuals tussling with Mr. Pitcairn, and he went to get his keys to go outside. When he looked back out the window, he saw Mr. Pitcairn on the ground. The assailant with short hair was leaning over Mr. Pitcairn, and the other was holding something, which appeared to be a wallet. Mr. Higgins used his keys to open his security door and yelled: \u201cHey!\u201d By that time, however, the two assailants were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Mr. Higgins ran to Mr. Pitcairn, saw that he was badly injured, and ran back inside to call 911. When he returned, he told Mr. Pitcairn that the police and an ambulance were on the way. Mr. Pitcairn kept struggling to speak, but the only word Mr. Higgins could make out was: \u201cMom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Officer Michael Harren, a police officer with the Baltimore City Police Department, responded to Mr. Higgins\u2019 address at 11:25 p.m. He saw Mr. Higgins holding and comforting Mr. Pitcairn. Mr. Pitcairn was alive, but he was not very responsive. Medics arrived at the scene three to four minutes later and rushed Mr. Pitcairn to Johns Hopkins Hospital. Forty minutes later, Officer Harren learned that Mr. Pitcairn had died at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Mr. Higgins told the police that Mr. Pitcairn was attacked by two men. He believed that both assailants were men: (1) because he assumed that a woman would not be involved in that kind of activity; and (2) based on their build and stature. Both assailants were shorter than six feet tall and slightly built. Due to the low light, he was unable to get a close look at their faces, but he could tell that they both had medium complexions. Mr. Higgins observed that the attacker with the short hair was wearing blue jeans and a white or light gray T-shirt. He was not sure about the color of the attacker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>clothing, however, as he is <em>\u201ca </em>little colorblind\u201d and has trouble seeing certain colors.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Mr. Higgins believed that the assailants had run south, down St. Paul Street. Police investigators later obtained video footage from the intersection of Charles Street and 26th Street that showed two people running westbound on 26th Street, between St. Paul and Charles Streets, at 11:22 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">At approximately 11:50 p.m., Gregory Boris, the lead detective in the investigation of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s murder, arrived at Mr. Higgins\u2019 address. The crime scene, which took up a small portion of the sidewalk, consisted of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s \u201cred and black gym bag, a flip-flop\u201d and a pool of blood. After returning to the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit, Detective Boris called Ms. Pitcairn, who advised that her son had offered his iPhone and brown leather wallet to the assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In response to the murder, Officer Kevin Ege was assigned to patrol the area. At 2:54 a.m. on July 26, 2010, as Officer Ege was driving north on Charles Street approaching 25th Street, he saw two individuals talking animatedly and gesturing abruptly. As he got closer, one of the two, Tyrene Williams, flagged him down. The person with Ms. Williams, a black male wearing dark-colored shorts and a white t-shirt, ran away as Officer Ege approached.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ms. Williams pointed to the man and said: \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re looking for him for the robbery at the gas station tonight.\u201d Officer Ege believed that Ms. Williams\u2019 comment was related to Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s robbery and murder. He detained Ms. Williams and tried to follow the man who had been with her, but he was unable to locate the man. Officer Ege took Ms. Williams to the Homicide Unit; she arrived at the police station at 3:04 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">At 4:00 a.m., Detective Boris was notified that Officer Ege had located a possible witness to Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s murder. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>interviewed Ms. Williams, who gave a taped statement to the police at 4:27 a.m., stating that appellant robbed a white man, hurt him, and took his credit card. Ms. Williams advised that she had gone to a gas station as part of a scheme to use Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card to buy gas for people in exchange for money. Based on information from Ms. Williams, the police obtained a search and seizure warrant for the second floor apartment at 2607 Maryland Avenue, where Ms. Williams lived with a number of other individuals, including appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">At 5:52 a.m., before the search warrant was executed, a police officer located Kevin Cosby. He was walking on the 2400 block of Charles Street, and the officer flashed his lights and told Mr. Cosby to stop. In response to the officer\u2019s question regarding a murder, Mr. Cosby told him that he did not know anything about anyone getting killed. The officer took Mr. Cosby to the Homicide Unit, where he was immediately placed in a holding cell. Mr. Cosby was wearing a white tank top, checkered shorts, white tennis shoes with green stripes, and a white baseball cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Detective Boris interviewed Mr. Cosby at the police station. After receiving his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, Mr. Cosby agreed to speak with the police about his actions the night of July 25, 2010. Mr. Cosby stated that appellant advised that he \u201cbeat a man to death,\u201d and Mr. Cosby then used the victim\u2019s credit card to get money. Mr. Cosby told Detective Boris the location of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card, he went with Detective Boris to a location several blocks from appellant\u2019s apartment, and he pointed out where the credit card was concealed. Detective Boris found the card hidden in a wall, wrapped in a Powerball ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">At 7:10 a.m., a SWAT team executed the search warrant for appellant\u2019s apartment. Detective Boris arrived at the residence after all the individuals present had been secured in the kitchen. These individuals, including appellant, appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>girlfriend Lavelva Merritt, Howard Michael Martin, Earlene Thomas, Tameka Quashie, Rodney Brown, as well as Rodney Brown\u2019s infant son, were then transported from the residence to the Homicide Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">When Detective Boris arrived at the residence, he noticed what appeared to be blood smudges on the door. After the arrival of the crime lab, Detective Boris began searching the apartment for evidence related to the murder. In the front bedroom, Detective Boris noticed a LeBron James jersey that was draped over the back of a chair. The jersey appeared to be damp and cool, indicating that it could have been washed recently. Underneath the jersey was a pair of blue jean shorts, which Detective Boris placed on top of the jersey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Detective Boris also observed under the chair a pair of white tennis shoes, which appeared to have been worn recently and had possible blood stains. He recovered a cell phone from inside one of the shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On a shelf in the bedroom, in plain view, Detective Boris saw the card insert portion of a brown leather Coach wallet, which Ms. Pitcairn later identified as a portion of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s wallet. He asked the crime scene technician to photograph and recover the wallet insert.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In addition to the other clothing items, the police also recovered a white hat that appeared to have blood on the brim, along with a second pair of white tennis shoes inside of a milk crate on the floor of the room. Detective Boris discovered a black folding knife inside the left shoe, and Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s iPhone in the right shoe. Under a bed in the room, he found three other knives, two sharpened screwdrivers, a brown or maroon wallet, and several cell phones.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>On July 27, 2010, appellant was charged with first degree murder, second degree murder, armed robbery, robbery, first degree assault, second degree assault, theft, conspiracy to commit murder, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Five of the residents of 2607 Maryland Avenue testified at appellant\u2019s trial as witnesses for the State, including Ms. Merritt, who was charged with the same crimes as appellant for her role in Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Ms. Merritt testified that, prior to July 25, 2010, she had been living at 2607 Maryland Avenue with appellant, her boyfriend; her mother, Ms. Thomas; her mother\u2019s boyfriend, Mr. Martin; her cousin, Mr. Cosby; and Ms. Williams, for a few weeks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She and appellant, whom she also called \u201cYa-Ya,\u201d had been dating for two years and they had a good relationship. At that time, she was using \u201ca lot of drugs,\u201d including heroin and cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">On July 25, 2010, Ms. Merritt was at home during the day; she had not used any drugs. That evening, Ms. Merritt and appellant left the apartment because appellant said he \u201cwanted some money.\u201d Ms. Merritt understood appellant to mean that he \u201cwanted to rob somebody.\u201d She agreed to go with him to find someone to rob, and they left, without having any particular destination. Ms. Merritt did not bring a weapon with her, but appellant brought a \u201cpocket knife.\u201d Ms. Merritt described appellant\u2019s clothing that day as khaki shorts, white Nike Airs, and a LeBron James jersey. She wore pink stretch pants, a grey shirt, and flip flops.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">A couple hours later, they saw Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby. Ms. Merritt, appellant, and Mr. Cosby talked about robbing people, and Ms. Williams listened. Mr. Cosby told the group that he previously had \u201crobbed a white lady\u201d and \u201chad no problem with robbing anybody.\u201d They discussed profiling victims based on whether or not they looked like they had any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>money, and at the end of the conversation, the two couples went their separate ways, with no plans to meet up again.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Ms. Merritt and appellant went to a bar on St. Paul Street, near the train station, waiting for a victim. They noticed Mr. Pitcairn as he was leaving the train station. Appellant and Ms. Merritt looked at each other to signal that \u201che was our victim.\u201d They followed Mr. Pitcairn up the street, and when he reached a part of the street where Ms. Merritt and appellant thought no one would see them, Ms. Merritt and appellant grabbed him from behind. Mr. Pitcairn told them he did not have any money; he tried to back away as appellant held him with one hand and pulled the knife out with the other. Appellant attempted to close the knife while keeping his grip on Mr. Pitcairn, and as he swung Mr. Pitcairn around to get a better grip, he stabbed him with the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Mr. Pitcairn fell to the ground and said: \u201c[T]ake my wallet, I don\u2019t have [any] money.\u201d Once Mr. Pitcairn was on the ground, appellant took his wallet, and Ms. Merritt punched him in the head and took his phone. Ms. Merritt heard a female voice on the phone saying \u201chello, hello, hello,\u201d and then hanging up. Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s phone subsequently rang and displayed the name \u201cdad,\u201d at which point Ms. Merritt turned the phone off.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">After taking Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s wallet and phone, appellant and Ms. Merritt ran back to their apartment. Ms. Merritt did not realize that appellant had stabbed Mr. Pitcairn until she saw \u201ca bunch of blood\u201d on appellant\u2019s hands. Appellant told Ms. Merritt that he thought he hurt Mr. Pitcairn \u201creally bad,\u201d and he had \u201cnever seen this much blood in my life.\u201d When they got to the apartment, appellant opened the front door, and they headed straight to the bathroom to take off appellant\u2019s jersey, shorts, and shoes, and to wash the knife. Ms. Merritt washed Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s blood off the knife, and appellant washed his jersey and shoes. Ms. Merritt and appellant also washed their hands. Appellant took off his khaki shorts and put them in a plastic bag, along with Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s wallet, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tied the bag. Ms. Merritt told appellant to get rid of the jersey, but instead, he placed it on top of a chair in their room.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">After cleaning up, Ms. Merritt and appellant went to the front bedroom. Appellant was upset over what happened with Mr. Pitcairn, and he began crying, stating: \u201c[A]ll that over a phone, I didn\u2019t mean to do it\u201d and \u201cI think I stabbed him twice ... that was a lot of blood.\u201d Ms. Merritt told appellant not to worry about it, that \u201che\u2019s going to make it.\u201d After Ms. Merritt and appellant talked about what had happened, they \u201cgot down to business\u201d to try to figure out how they could get money. Ms. Merritt stated that she was \u201cgoing to sell his phone tomorrow.\u201d Appellant suggested that they use Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card to get money, but he stated that he did not know how to use a credit card to get cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">While appellant and Ms. Merritt were talking in the bedroom, Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby arrived. Appellant asked Ms. Merritt if she wanted to ask Mr. Cosby how to get cash from the credit card, but Ms. Merritt stated: \u201cI don\u2019t trust [Mr. Cosby] like that.\u201d Appellant told them that \u201cwe just hurt this white boy pretty bad.\u201d He did not give them specifics as to what happened, just that they had hurt Mr. Pitcairn. He explained that they had taken Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card, but he did not know what to do with it. Ms. Williams then suggested they use it to sell gas. Ms. Merritt and appellant told Mr. Cosby and Ms. Williams that they could not go outside for fear of the police. Mr. Cosby and Ms. Williams then offered to use Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card to sell gas, on the condition that Mr. Cosby and appellant would split whatever money they made.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">As they were leaving the house, Mr. Cosby took the bag containing appellant\u2019s shorts and Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s wallet and put it in a dumpster. Mr. Cosby and Ms. Williams returned to the house shortly thereafter; they were unable to use Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card without having his zip code. Mr. Cosby got Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s wallet from the dumpster, obtained his Florida ID, and then appellant wrote Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s zip code on a lottery ticket and gave it to Mr. Cosby. Appellant removed the insert portion of appellant\u2019s wallet, which contained cards and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>photos, put the rest of the wallet back in the plastic bag, and Mr. Cosby threw the bag back in the dumpster.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Mr. Cosby returned later with <em>money </em>and \u201cready,\u201d which Ms. Merritt testified was a form of crack cocaine. Appellant and Mr. Cosby smoked the crack in the bathroom and split the money between them. Mr. Cosby then woke Ms. Williams, who was sleeping on the floor, to go with him to the gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">After Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby left, appellant began crying again. Ms. Merritt tried to console him, telling him that Mr. Pitcairn would be alright. Appellant and Ms. Merritt fell asleep, and they woke up to the sound of the police coming into the apartment. Appellant put Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s phone and the knife in a pair of shoes in a crate.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">At trial, Ms. Merritt used a laser pointer to identify herself and appellant from the video footage taken of two people running on 26th and Charles Streets. She described appellant\u2019s clothing in the video, including the LeBron James jersey, khaki shorts, white tennis shoes, and a white hat. From the footage, it appeared that Ms. Merritt had something in her hands, which she testified were her flip-flops and Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s phone. Ms. Merritt identified the knife police found in the white shoe as the knife that appellant used to stab Mr. Pitcairn. She and appellant shared the white tennis shoes that were worn by appellant the night of the murder, which the police found underneath a chair in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Ms. Merritt acknowledged that the facts she gave in her testimony were different from those she gave when she first spoke to the police. The initial version of events that she gave to the police, in a taped statement, was that, on July 25, 2010, she and appellant were at home all day, and that her cousin, Mr. Cosby, had come to the apartment -with a credit card around 11:00 p.m. She gave the statement to protect appellant because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want him to go to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">After giving her initial statement, she went back to her cell. Later that day, she decided she wanted to speak to the detectives again because she \u201cwanted the truth to get out,\u201d because \u201cwhat happened to Mr. [Pitcairn] was wrong and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>shouldn\u2019t never happened.\u201d Ms. Merritt was led back to an interview room, passing appellant\u2019s cell on the way, and she began giving the police different information regarding her involvement. While in the interview room, she heard appellant shouting her name several times. After hearing appellant, she \u201cfelt that [she] was doing him wrong, so I told the police that I didn\u2019t want to cooperate.\u201d At that point, she ended the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On September 13, 2010, after Ms. Merritt had been charged with murder and other offenses, she met with police detectives and an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney to discuss a proffer agreement. Ms. Merritt understood the terms of the agreement to be that nothing she said that day would be used against her in court unless she were to testify in her own defense. Ms. Merritt decided to tell the police what happened on July 25, 2010, because she \u201cfelt bad for the family,\u201d and Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s murder \u201cwasn\u2019t even supposed to go down like that and it should have never happened.\u201d She initially lied about what happened to protect appellant, not herself, explaining: \u201c[I]f I really wanted to protect myself then I would still not say nothing whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">On May 11, 2011, Ms. Merritt entered into a plea agreement, pursuant to which she would be given a 15-year sentence, the State would dismiss the murder charges and conspiracy to commit murder charges, and she would testify against appellant. Ms. Merritt acknowledged that she \u201ccould still be prosecuted for first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree murder if the State [was] not satisfied with [her] testimony.\u201d Ms. Merritt, who had two prior convictions for possession of narcotics with intent to distribute was aware that, on April 18, 2011, her thumb print was found on Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s iPhone.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby both testified for the State regarding the events leading up to and following Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ms. Williams had lived at 2607 Maryland Avenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>for three months prior to July 25, 2010. She described the sleeping arrangements in the bedroom she shared, as follows: Ms. Thomas and Mr. Martin slept on the one bed in the room; appellant, whom Ms. Williams knew only as \u201cYa-Ya,\u201d and Ms. Merritt slept on a mattress on the floor; and Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby slept on blankets on the floor. The back room of the apartment was occupied by a young woman, her boyfriend, and their baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On July 25, 2010, Ms. Williams, who described herself as a \u201cmoderate drug user,\u201d used cocaine and heroin throughout the day, stating that her drug use went \u201cfrom the moment I woke up until like twelve o\u2019clock that night.\u201d Mr. Cosby, who described himself as a \u201clight drug user,\u201d testified that he used heroin and cocaine with Ms. Williams throughout the day. Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby left the apartment around 9:00 a.m. and walked to Charles Street, and they remained out of the apartment all day.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">At 11:00 p.m. on July 25, 2010, Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby were sitting on a bench at a bus stop at Charles Street and 25th Street. Appellant and Ms. Merritt joined them and began talking. Ms. Williams testified that appellant said that he was looking for someone to rob, and while he and Ms. Merritt discussed robbing someone, she and Mr. Cosby just listened. Mr. Cosby testified that he did not participate in the conversation about robbing people because he did not want to \u201cgo[ ] to no jail for no stupid stuff.\u201d At the end of the conversation, appellant and Ms. Merritt walked away and turned right on 25th Street toward St. Paul Street, and Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby walked up Charles Street back toward their apartment on Maryland Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">On the way home, Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby ran into a friend, with whom they used drugs. They then returned to the house and noticed police cars around the area of Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Street and Maryland Avenue, as well as a police helicopter flying overhead.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">When Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby arrived at the apartment, appellant and Ms. Merritt were in their bedroom, along with Ms. Thomas and Mr. Martin, who were sleeping. Mr. Cosby testified that appellant and Ms. Merritt were \u201cbreathing all hard,\u201d and when he asked why they were out of breath, appellant told him that he \u201cjust beat this little white guy up so bad, I feel bad about what I did to him.\u201d Ms. Williams testified that appellant told her that \u201che had robbed this guy at the gas station ... he hurt him real bad.\u201d Ms. Merritt and appellant then asked Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby how to use a credit card to get cash. Appellant showed Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card, wallet, Florida driver\u2019s license, and iPhone. Appellant came up with the idea to use the credit card at a gas station to buy people gas in exchange for cash, but he and Ms. Merritt did not want to go outside because the police were out, and appellant knew he had seriously hurt Mr. Pitcairn. Mr. Cosby volunteered to go instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Ms. Williams accompanied Mr. Cosby to the gas station, explaining that she was \u201cfading\u201d and wanted more drugs. They unsuccessfully attempted to use the card at one gas station, after which Ms. Williams returned to the house because she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel right.\u201d Mr. Cosby went to another gas station and then returned to the house twenty minutes later after he was unable to use the credit card without Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s zip code. Appellant then wrote Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s zip code down and gave it to Mr. Cosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Mr. Cosby testified that appellant instructed him to throw away Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s wallet, and he put the wallet in a dumpster. Mr. Cosby did not recall a pair of bloody shorts being in the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">When Mr. Cosby returned to the gas station, he used the card to buy gas in exchange for cash, and he then used some of the money to buy crack cocaine. He returned an hour later with the money and crack, which he split with appellant. Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Williams and appellant then got into an argument. They left the apartment and continued arguing until they reached Charles Street and 25th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">At that point, Ms. Williams saw a police officer, and she flagged him down for the purpose of telling the officer that Mr. Cosby had a stolen credit card. Mr. Cosby, who had drugs and Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card on him, ran. Ms. Williams then told the officer: \u201c[TJhere he goes ... he\u2019s the one that did the robbery at the gas station.\u201d She made that statement to indicate that Mr. Cosby had the stolen credit card; she did not want him to have it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Mr. Cosby ran to a friend\u2019s house on Charles Street and \u201cstayed in there until it got late.\u201d He was sitting on the front steps when he saw a police car coming up the street. Mr. Cosby got up and started walking down the street, with the officer following him. The officer flashed his lights at Mr. Cosby and told him to stop. At that point, Mr. Cosby had hidden Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card, and he did not have any drugs on him. Mr. Cosby stopped, gave the officer his name, and the officer said that the police were looking for him. The officer asked Mr. Cosby about a murder, and Mr. Cosby said he did not know anything about anyone getting killed. The officer then took Mr. Cosby to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Ms. Williams\u2019 description of appellant\u2019s clothes that evening matched that given by Ms. Merritt, i.e., a LeBron James jersey, khaki-colored pants, a white hat, and white tennis shoes. She identified the white tennis shoes that contained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>knife and Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s iPhone as appellant\u2019s shoes, and she described the knife as \u201cthe knife that Ya-Ya carries.\u201d Ms. Williams had seen appellant with the knife the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Mr. Cosby testified that the white shoes under the chair in the room, as well as the LeBron James jersey, were appellant\u2019s. Mr. Cosby testified that he kept his clothes in a little black bag in the room, and that the only shoes he owned were the white and green shoes that he was wearing on July 25 and 26, 2010. Both Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby acknowledged that they had prior convictions, Ms. Williams for robbery and theft, and Mr. Cosby for first-degree burglary, robbery, attempted distribution of cocaine, rogue and vagabond and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Ms. Thomas testified that she owned the apartment at 2607 Maryland Avenue where she lived with appellant, Ms. Merritt, Ms. Williams, Mr. Cosby, and Mr. Martin. Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby stayed at the apartment occasionally and kept \u201ca couple plastic bags of clothes\u201d in the room. On July 25, 2010, Ms. Thomas went to bed between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m. At that time, appellant, Ms. Merritt, Mr. Martin, and the family that lived in the back bedroom of the house were at home. Mr. Martin was lying in bed next to Ms. Thomas watching television, and appellant and Ms. Merritt were on their mattress on the floor, also watching television.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Ms. Thomas subsequently woke up between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m. She went into the kitchen and observed Mr. Cosby and Ms. Williams arguing; they then left the apartment. Ms. Thomas went back to sleep in the bedroom with Mr. Martin; Ms. Merritt and appellant also were in the bedroom. She woke up at approximately 7:30 or 8:00 a.m.; the police were entering the apartment. Ms. Thomas went to the police station, where she gave a taped statement, which was consistent with her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Ms. Thomas identified the jersey and shoes recovered from the apartment as belonging to appellant. She testified that she kept a butcher knife, several other knives, a box cutter, and a screwdriver under her mattress. Ms. Thomas had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>never seen appellant with a knife, but she knew that her daughter, Ms. Merritt, carried a small pocket knife. Ms. Thomas acknowledged that she had prior convictions for second-degree burglary and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Mr. Martin testified that, on the day of the murder, he spent the day watching movies and drinking. Appellant and Ms. Merritt were at the apartment during the day; they left at approximately 11:00 p.m. and returned approximately an hour later. When appellant and Ms. Merritt left the apartment, Mr. Martin was watching movies, while Ms. Thomas was sleeping beside him. When Mr. Martin went to sleep at approximately 4:00 a.m., appellant and Ms. Merritt were on the floor sleeping. Mr. Martin identified the jersey found by police in the apartment as appellant\u2019s, along with the pair of white tennis shoes found under the chair in the front bedroom. He testified that the white tennis shoes found in the crate in the bedroom also belonged to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Detective Boris testified that Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card records confirmed that his Citibank card was used on July 26, 2010, at 1:48 a.m. to make a $56.96 purchase at an ExxonMobile gas station, and then again at 2:07 a.m. to make a $43.64 purchase at the Greenmount BP Amoco station. Detective Boris obtained video footage from both gas station parking lots, which depicted a man, who Detective Boris identified as Mr. Cosby, purchasing gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The State presented numerous witnesses to explain the forensic evidence that was recovered during the investigation of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s robbery and murder. The blood smudges observed by Detective Boris on the front door of 2607 Maryland Avenue yielded a DNA profile consistent with Mr. Pitcairn and the DNA of an unknown individual. Swabs taken from the neckline and sleeve cuffs of the jersey identified as appellant\u2019s, contained a DNA profile consistent with appellant, Ms. Merritt, and at least one unknown individual. Mr. Pitcairn, Ms. Thomas, Mr. Martin, and Ms. Williams could not be excluded as potential contributors to the DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The suspected blood stain on the left shoe that police found under the chair yielded a DNA profile consistent with a mixture of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s DNA and the DNA of another individual. Appellant and Ms. Merritt were identified as possible contributors to the DNA profile that was mixed with Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s. The chances of selecting an unrelated individual as a possible contributor to that sample was one in 118,000 for African American individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Swabs taken from the interior of the shoe under the chair contained a DNA profile consistent with a mixture of appellant\u2019s, Ms. Merritt\u2019s, and at least two unknown individuals\u2019 DNA. Swabs from the right shoe contained a DNA profile consistent with a mixture of appellant\u2019s, Ms. Merritt\u2019s, and at least one unknown individual\u2019s DNA. A blood stain on the inside of the handle of the folding knife found inside one of the white shoes contained a DNA profile that was consistent with that of Mr. Pitcairn and an unknown individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Numerous pieces of evidence obtained from 2607 Maryland Avenue were tested for the presence of fingerprints. The only latent print that was found was on Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s iPhone, and fingerprint analysis revealed that the print matched Ms. Merritt\u2019s left thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Dr. Russell Alexander, an Assistant Medical Examiner in the Office of Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, determined that Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s death was a homicide, and the cause of death was a two-inch deep stab wound to Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s chest, which injured the left ventricle, or the main pumping chamber, of his heart. He explained that a stab wound to the heart is characterized by \u201cvery rapid and very severe [ ] bleeding,\u201d both internally and externally. Dr. Alexander also observed scrapes on Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s lips as well as his left hand, knees, legs, and feet, but he was unable to determine whether the stab wound or the other injuries occurred first. Dr. Alexander agreed that abrasions could be a sign that a physical struggle occurred, but he opined that Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s injuries could have been caused by \u201cterminal collapse,\u201d when an injured person falls to the ground as part of the dying process.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>As indicated, the jury convicted appellant of first degree felony murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Yoir Dire Question</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">During voir dire, the court addressed the potential jurors about the nature of the charges and then asked the following three-part question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">First, has any member of the jury panel ever been the victim of a violent crime? Second, has any member of the jury panel ever been convicted of a crime? And, third, does any member of the jury panel have a pending criminal charge?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The prosecutor asked that the court to broaden the question to include \u201cany member of [the jurors\u2019] immediate family.\u201d Defense counsel agreed, asking the court to further broaden the scope of the inquiry to include jurors\u2019 close friends. The court noted that, in previous trials, where a potential juror was \u201caffected by a family member being a victim of a crime, they responded].\u201d It asked defense counsel whether the question he was proposing was \u201ca mandatory voir dire question,\u201d and defense counsel responded that the question was not mandatory \u201cin and of itself.\u201d The court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in refusing to broaden the voir dire question regarding whether a panel member had been a victim of a violent crime to include family members and close friends. He argues that the voir dire question asked by the court, without the additional inquiry regarding family and friends, \u201cwas insufficient to root out prejudice\u201d and was not adequately covered by other questions. He asserts that, given the facts of this case, \u201cwhere the State presented evidence that the victim\u2019s mother was on the phone with the victim while he was being attacked,\u201d \u201ca juror whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>family member or close friend had been victimized would be less able to set aside the emotional response in favor of an impartial assessment of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The State argues that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in declining to ask appellant\u2019s requested voir dire question, asserting that the question was \u201cnot reasonably likely to reveal a challenge for cause\u201d and was \u201cfairly covered by other questions posed by the court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, it contends that, \u201cwhether the panel members, themselves, had ever been the victim of a violent crime was not a required area of inquiry in the first instance, and it was not incumbent upon the court to extend the inquiry to include friends and family.\u201d It further contends that, even if a prospective juror was biased based on his or her experience with a family member or friend who was a victim of a crime, that person would have strong feelings about the offense charged and would have responded to other voir dire questions asked by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\"> In Maryland, \u201c \u2018the sole purpose of voir dire is to ensure a fair and impartial jury by determining the existence of cause for disqualification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington v. State, </em>425 Md. 306, 312, 40 A.3d 1017 (2012) (quoting <em>Stewart v. State, </em>399 Md. 146, 158, 923 A.2d 44 (2007)). The voir dire process \u201centails examination of prospective jurors through questions propounded by the judge (or either of the parties, if allowed by the judge) to determine the existence of bias or prejudice, and literally translated, means \u2018to say the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charles and Drake v. State, </em>414 Md. 726, 733, 997 A.2d 154 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We review a trial court\u2019s refusal to propound a requested voir dire question under the abuse of discretion standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>State v. Shim, </em>418 Md. 37, 43-44, 12 A.3d 671 (2011). We afford the trial court \u201cbroad discretion in running <em>voir dire, </em>\u201d <em>id. </em>at 44, 12 A.3d 671 because \u201c[t]he trial judge has had the opportunity to hear and observe the prospective jurors, to assess their demeanor, and to make factual findings.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>425 Md. at 314, 40 A.3d 1017. The judge\u2019s conclusions are \u201centitled to substantial deference, unless they are the product of a voir dire that \u2018is cursory, rushed, and unduly limited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>White v. State, </em>374 Md. 232, 241, 821 A.2d 459 (2003)). That discretion, however, \u201cis circumscribed by the defendant\u2019s \u2018right to have questions propounded to prospective jurors on their voir dire, which are directed to a specific cause for disqualification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 44-45, 12 A.3d 671 (quoting <em>Moore v. State, </em>412 Md. 635, 644-46, 989 A.2d 1150 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained that specific causes for disqualification involve biases \u201cdirectly related to (1) the defendant, (2) the witnesses, or (3) the crime.\u201d <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 45, 12 A.3d 671. Thus, it is mandatory for the court to inquire into the following areas: bias based on race, ethnicity, or cultural heritage; bias against defense witnesses; religious bias; an unwillingness to convict in capital cases; a juror\u2019s strong feelings toward the crime charged; and placement of undue weight on police officer credibility. <em>Washington, </em>425 Md. at 315, 40 A.3d 1017; <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 45-46, 12 A.3d 671; <em>Curtin v. State, </em>393 Md. 593, 609-10 n. 8, 903 A.2d 922 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Appellant concedes that \u201can affirmative answer to the question of whether a family member or close friend was the victim of a violent crime would not have provided cause for disqualification by itself.\u201d Maryland case law supports that concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">In <em>Perry v. State, </em>344 Md. 204, 217-18, 686 A.2d 274 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1146, 117 S.Ct. 1318, 137 L.Ed.2d 480 (1997), the circuit court asked the venire: \u201c \u2018Has any member of the prospective jury panel or a member of your family or a close personal friend of yours ever had a prior experience as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>juror, witness, victim or defendant in any criminal homicide or aggravated assault proceeding?\u2019 \u201d On appeal, Perry argued that the court committed reversible error in declining to broaden the question to substitute \u201cany crime of violence\u201d for \u201caggravated assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 686 A.2d 274. The Court rejected that argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">A juror\u2019s having had prior experience as a juror, witness, victim or defendant in a criminal proceeding of any kind, or in one involving a crime of violence, is not <em>per se </em>disqualifying. It is even less tenable to argue that a juror is disqualified simply because of the experience of a member of the prospective juror\u2019s family or on the part of a close personal friend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>Id. Accord Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 37, 633 A.2d 867 (1993) (\u201cShort of those instances where there is a demonstrably strong correlation between the status in question and a mental state that gives rise to cause for disqualification, mere status or acquaintance is insufficient to establish cause for disqualification of a prospective juror.\u201d); <em>Yopps v. State, </em>234 Md. 216, 221, 198 A.2d 264, <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 922, 85 S.Ct. 279, 13 L.Ed.2d 336 (1964) (court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to ask whether any jurors or family members had been the victim of burglary because it did not relate to a cause of disqualification); <em>Phenious v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 385, 388, 274 A.2d 658 (\u201can inquiry concerning whether or not a prospective juror has been the victim or a witness to a crime similar to the one charged in the indictment is not a proper question on voir dire since it does not provide a basis for challenge for cause\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 748 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Appellant notes that, in <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 17, 759 A.2d 819 (2000), the Court of Appeals acknowledged \u201cthe relevance of the experiences and associations to the venire persons\u2019 qualification to serve on the jury.\u201d <em>Dingle </em>did not, however, overrule the above cited cases, and as appellant has acknowledged, the Court of Appeals, in subsequently listing the mandatory areas of inquiry, has not listed an inquiry regarding whether a juror, or family or friends, has been a victim of a crime. Given the existing precedent, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>conclude here that, after exercising its discretion to ask potential jurors if they had been victims of violent crimes, the court abused its discretion in declining to broaden the question to include family members or close friends.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Even if the Court of Appeals subsequently overrules its prior precedent, we note that, in this case, the trial judge determined, based on his experience, that other questions asked of the panel would elicit any bias related to the victimization of family members or friends. The record supports this determination; multiple panel members responded to the question asking if any member of the panel held \u201cstrong feelings regarding robberies or homicides,\u201d including panel members whose \u201cstrong feelings\u201d were based upon the experience \u00f3f victimized family and friends. Accordingly, where the question appellant requested was not a mandatory question, and where other questions \u201c \u2018created a reasonable assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present,\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington, </em>425 Md. at 313-14, 40 A.3d 1017 (quoting <em>White, </em>374 Md. at 242, 821 A.2d 459), we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in conducting voir dire in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Other Crimes Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Appellant next contends that his convictions should be reversed because other crimes evidence was improperly admitted on four occasions. Specifically, appellant argues that the court erred in: (1) admitting photo arrays containing his mug shot; (2) permitting Ms. Merritt to suggest that she knew he had committed other robberies; (3) admitting evidence that he used crack cocaine; and (4) denying his motion for a mistrial after Mr. Cosby testified that appellant had been \u201clocked up\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>in the past. The State argues, as set forth below, that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion with respect to each of the four rulings challenged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Photo Array</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the photo arrays from which Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby identified him as the person who told them that he had robbed and hurt someone. He acknowledges that \u201cthe identity of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s assailant was in dispute,\u201d but he asserts that \u201cthe ability of Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby to identify [appellant] was not,\u201d and therefore, the photo arrays \u201cadded nothing of probative value to the State\u2019s case.\u201d Moreover, he argues, because the photo arrays \u201cobviously contained mug shots,\u201d suggesting that he had committed other crimes, the prejudice in admitting the photo arrays outweighed any probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The State argues that the court properly admitted the photo arrays. It asserts that they were relevant, and, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, appellant\u2019s photo was not obviously a mug shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Evidence is relevant if it has \u201c \u2018any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 725, 25 A.3d 144 (2011) (quoting Md. Rule 5-401). \u201cEvidence that is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Md. Rule 5-402. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s determination that evidence is relevant and admissible, we apply the \u201cde novo\u201d standard of review to the court\u2019s \u201cconclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not \u2018of consequence to the determination of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simms, </em>420 Md. at 725, 25 A.3d 144 (quoting <em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 437, 970 A.2d 320 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Even if legally relevant, however, \u201cevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-403. The weighing determination is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion and is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Simms, </em>420 Md. at 725, 25 A.3d 144. <em>Accord Cousar v. State, </em>198 Md.App. 486, 517, 18 A.3d 130 (2011) (the \u201c \u2018final balancing between probative value and unfair prejudice is something entrusted to the wide discretion of the trial judge\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Oesby v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 144, 167, 788 A.2d 662 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201c \u2018a ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009) (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)). Rather, the \u201c \u2018decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>North, </em>102 Md.App. at 14, 648 A.2d 1025). <em>Accord Oesby, </em>142 Md.App. at 167-68, 788 A.2d 662 (\u201cReversal should be reserved for those rare and bizarre exercises of discretion that are, in the judgment of the appellate court, not only wrong but flagrantly and outrageously so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Thus, the first step in our analysis is whether the ability of Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby to identify appellant in the photo arrays was relevant. The record reflects that Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby had known appellant only for a few months before Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s murder, they spoke with him only in passing, and they knew him only as \u201cYa-Ya.\u201d Further, in light of Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby\u2019s testimony that they had been using drugs the day and night of the murder, including during the time when they interacted with and observed appellant, their ability to accurately identify him was at issue. Accordingly, the fact that Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby independently selected appellant\u2019s photo as that of \u201cYa-Ya\u201d was relevant to show that they were able to accurately identify appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Moreover, we disagree with appellant regarding the potential prejudice of the photo. To be sure, in <em>Arca v. State, </em>71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Md.App. 102, 104, 106, 523 A.2d 1064, <em>cert. denied, </em>310 Md. 276, 528 A.2d 1287 (1987), this Court held that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a photographic array that included \u201cwhat is obviously a police \u2018mug shot\u2019 of appellant,\u201d noting that the admission of the police photographs created a danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant because, \u201c[w]ith the defense being self-defense, the jury\u2019s decision could well have been influenced by the thought that appellant had a prior record and was consequently a bad person.\u201d In that case, however, the photographs \u201cshowed the front and profile view commonly associated with police \u2018mug shots.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 523 A.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Here, by contrast, appellant\u2019s photo displayed in the arrays was not \u201cobviously\u201d a mug shot. Rather, the photo was a head shot of appellant, taken from a similar perspective as the other photos in the array, in which all that was visible was appellant\u2019s face and neck area. Appellant\u2019s photograph was not obviously a mug shot. The circuit court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the photo arrays as relevant evidence that did not pose a risk of unfair prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Ms. Merritt\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Prior to trial, the court addressed the admissibility of evidence of Ms. Merritt\u2019s understanding of the following question appellant asked Ms. Merritt: \u201c[D]o you want to make some money[?]\u201d The State proffered that Ms. Merritt would testify that she understood that to mean that appellant wanted to commit a robbery, based on her \u201cparticipation in past robberies with the Defendant.\u201d Defense counsel objected to Ms. Merritt\u2019s testimony as \u201cinadmissible other crimes evidence,\u201d arguing that the testimony was \u201can attempt to admit through the back door prior alleged untried robberies committed by [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The court ruled that the State could elicit Ms. Merritt\u2019s interpretation of Mr. Wagner\u2019s question, but not the basis for her interpretation. The court reasoned that the \u201cinterpretive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>statement\u201d was \u201crelevant, intrinsic evidence of the crime of conspiracy,\u201d and \u201cthe probative value of this outweighs any unfair prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">At trial, Ms. Merritt testified that, when she and appellant left their apartment the day of the robbery, appellant said he \u201cwanted some money.\u201d Ms. Merritt understood appellant to mean that he \u201cwanted to rob somebody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Appellant argues on appeal that the court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence because it permitted Ms. Merritt \u201cto suggest that she knew [ajppellant to have committed other robberies.\u201d The State disagrees, arguing that this evidence did not constitute other crimes evidence, and, in any event, it was relevant to the crime of conspiracy. Finally, the State contends, \u201ceven assuming the testimony was admitted in error, the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was merely cumulative to other evidence to the same effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">We agree that the evidence was not other crimes evidence, but rather, it was admissible to show agreement between appellant and Ms. Merritt, a critical element to the charge of conspiracy. <em>See Mitchell v. State, </em>363 Md. 130, 146, 767 A.2d 844 (2001) (\u201c[CJonspiracy is necessarily a specific intent crime; there must exist the specific intent to join with another person in the accomplishment of an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose by unlawful means.\u201d). And, because the evidence was highly probative to establish the element of one of the crimes charged, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the admission of the evidence did not unfairly prejudice appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Evidence of Drug Use</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Appellant next argues that the circuit court erred in allowing testimony that appellant used drugs following Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s robbery and murder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He contends that this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>stituted other crimes evidence, and the court erred in admitting the post-crime drug use as proof of motive, asserting that \u201cuse of drugs did not, in an of itself, make it any more likely that he committed the robbery absent evidence that he had a special financial need caused by drug use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The State contends that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in admitting evidence that appellant \u201cshared in the proceeds of the robbery.\u201d It asserts that the evidence was properly admitted as: (1) evidence intrinsic to the crime of robbery and probative of the crime itself; and (2) evidence of motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In arguing that evidence of appellant\u2019s post-crime drug use was inadmissible other crimes evidence, appellant ignores the first basis for the court\u2019s ruling, that the evidence was \u201cintrinsic or relevant to the actual crime itself\u2019 and \u201cprobative of the crime itself.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">[The evidence] shows [appellant\u2019s] connection to the crime as he had a connection to the proceeds and what was purchased with the proceeds. And that he, immediately after the proceeds were converted to drugs, that he was able to take the drugs, and also shows a relationship with Mr. Cosby and could complete the picture of the post-crime activity and [appellant\u2019]s relation with Mr. Cosby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">And therefore, I find that again its probative value under</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT1\">Rule 5-403 outweighs its unfair prejudice to [appellant]. Alternatively, the court found that the evidence was admissible as other crimes evidence because it was probative of motive, it could be \u201cproven by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d and \u201cthe probative value outweighs any unfair prejudice to [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">We agree with the court that the evidence was admissible on either ground. Initially, the evidence was intrinsic to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>crimes charged. <em>See Silver v. State, </em>420 Md. 415, 435-36, 23 A.3d 867 (2011) (evidence that was \u201cintertwined and part of the same criminal episode\u201d did not \u201cengage the gears of \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence law,\u201d even though it may \u201c \u2018show some possible crime in addition to the one literally charged\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Odum v. State, </em>412 Md. 593, 611, 989 A.2d 232 (2010)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1039, 181 L.Ed.2d 765 (2012). Evidence that appellant shared in the proceeds of the robbery and drugs obtained with cash received from use of Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s credit card, shortly after the robbery, was probative of appellant\u2019s participation in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Alternatively, the circuit court properly admitted the testimony pursuant to an \u201cother crimes\u201d analysis. Rule 5-404(b) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Pursuant to this Rule, \u201c[propensity evidence, or evidence suggesting that because the defendant is a person of criminal character it is more probable that he committed the crime for which he is on trial, is not admissible into evidence.\u201d <em>Hurst v. State, </em>400 Md. 397, 407, 929 A.2d 157 (2007). Evidence of other crimes may be admissible, however, if the evidence has \u201c \u2018special relevance, i.e. is substantially relevant to some contested issue in the case and is not offered simply to prove criminal character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 929 A.2d 157 (quoting <em>Harris v. State, </em>324 Md. 490, 500, 597 A.2d 956 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">To determine the admissibility of other crimes evidence, the court must engage in a three-step analysis. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 634-35, 552 A.2d 896 (1989)). First, the evidence must fall within one of the exceptions listed in Rule 5-404(b), or otherwise have special relevance to some contested issue in the case. <em>Thompson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>State, </em>181 Md.App. 74, 84, 955 A.2d 802 (citing <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d 896), <em>aff'd, </em>412 Md. 497, 988 A.2d 1011 (2010) . The determination of whether evidence has special relevance is a legal determination that does not involve any exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 489, 947 A.2d 519 (2008) (citing <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 317, 718 A.2d 588 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">After determining whether the contested evidence falls within an exception to the general bar on the use of other crimes evidence, the court must find that the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Henry v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 146, 168, 964 A.2d 678 (2009) (quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d 896), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>419 Md. 588, 19 A.3d 944 (2011) . This Court \u201cwill review this decision to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 635, 552 A.2d 896. In conducting this review on appeal, \u201cwe look \u2018only at the legal question of whether there was some competent evidence which, if believed, could persuade the fact finder as to the existence of the fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henry, </em>184 Md.App. at 168-69, 964 A.2d 678 (quoting <em>Emory v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 585, 622, 647 A.2d 1243 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">If that requirement is met, the trial court then must weigh the necessity for and probative value of the other crimes evidence against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 964 A.2d 678. The trial court\u2019s conclusion to admit or deny this evidence based on its probative value will be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 641, 552 A.2d 896. (\u201cA decision to admit other crimes evidence which is clearly incorrect \u2018on this question of balancing probative value against danger of prejudice will be corrected on appeal as an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Brafman v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 465, 474, 381 A.2d 687 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Here, the circuit court properly determined that the evidence of appellant\u2019s post-crime drug use was admissible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>show appellant\u2019s motive for robbing the victim, i.e., to obtain cash and drugs. Moreover, in light of the serious nature of the charges against appellant, the court properly determined that evidence that he used a small amount of drugs was not unfairly prejudicial in light of its probative value in connecting appellant to the chain of events that occurred following the crime.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">On direct examination of Mr. Cosby, the prosecutor asked Mr. Cosby whether he knew how long Ms. Merritt and appellant were a couple. Mr. Cosby replied: \u201cNo, sir. I knew he was locked up and he came home and they introduced ....\u201d At that point, defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. The court stated that Mr. Cosby\u2019s statement about appellant being \u201clocked up\u201d was \u201cabsolutely quick,\u201d noting: \u201cI have to say myself I didn\u2019t quite catch it.\u201d The State argued that it was not clear how Mr. Cosby\u2019s statement would prejudice appellant, as \u201c[w]e don\u2019t know why he was locked up, when he was locked up or anything having to do [with] that.\u201d Defense counsel declined to have the court strike Mr. Cosby\u2019s statement, arguing that striking the testimony would \u201cplace undue emphasis on it,\u201d and he declined an instruction to the jury not to consider the testimony based on his \u201cfear it highlights\u201d the testimony. The court, after listening to the testimony again, and considering the issue overnight, denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Appellant argues that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion. He candidly acknowledges that this Court previously has upheld a trial court\u2019s ruling denying a mistrial based on an isolated statement that the appellant had been \u201clocked up.\u201d <em>See Mitchell v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 312, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>323-29, 752 A.2d 653 (2000) (court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial where a witness made an isolated, unresponsive statement that defendant had been \u201clocked up\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>363 Md. 130, 767 A.2d 844 (2001); <em>Turner v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 370, 377, 428 A.2d 88 (1981) (court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial where witness, on cross-examination by the State, testified that defendant had been \u201clocked up\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>294 Md. 640, 452 A.2d 416 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Appellant contends, however, that this case is distinguishable because the reference here was prejudicial given the other prior bad act evidence elicited. He argues that Mr. Cosby\u2019s remark followed Ms. Merritt\u2019s \u201csuggestion] that she and [appellant] had a history of committing robberies,\u201d and the evidence that Ms. Williams \u201cidentified [appellant] from his mug shot in a photo array.\u201d He asserts that the jury \u201conly had to put two and two together to infer that the three references were related and that [appellant] was not facing a robbery charge for the first time.\u201d Accordingly, he contends that there was no way to eliminate the prejudice from Mr. Cosby\u2019s statement \u201cshort of granting a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The State asserts that the court\u2019s ruling was correct as a matter of law, and that appellant \u201chas failed to demonstrate that he suffered the substantial prejudice necessary to warrant the extraordinary remedy of a mistrial.\u201d It further argues that appellant\u2019s contention that Mr. Cosby\u2019s remark was highly prejudicial when combined with Ms. Merritt\u2019s testimony and with Ms. Williams\u2019 identification is not properly before this Court, as it was not made before the circuit court, nor was it the basis for the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Initially, we agree with the State that appellant\u2019s contention that a mistrial was required because the evidence as a whole gave the inference that appellant was \u201cnot facing a robbery charge for the first time\u201d is not preserved for our review because it was not raised below. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide [an] issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>or decided by the trial court.\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, we address only the issue preserved, counsel\u2019s argument below that the testimony that appellant had been \u201clocked up\u201d required a mistrial because \u201cthe jury is going to speculate now that my client was locked up for something else, that he was a bad guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">A mistrial \u201cis an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooley v.

State, </em>148 Md.App. 601, 666, 814 A.2d 1 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">As indicated, this Court previously rejected the argument that a mistrial is required based on testimony that a defendant had been \u201clocked up.\u201d <em>See Mitchell, </em>132 Md.App. at 323-29, 752 A.2d 653; <em>Turner, </em>48 Md.App. at 377, 428 A.2d 88. In <em>Mitchell, </em>132 Md.App. at 323, 752 A.2d 653, a witness stated, in response to a question whether he had seen Mr. Mitchell in a certain time period, that a friend of Mr. Mitchell\u2019s told him that Mr. Mitchell was \u201clocked up.\u201d We upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the defense motion for a mistrial, stating: \u201c[W]e are not persuaded that any significant damage resulted from [the] remark, as it was a single, isolated statement that was wholly unresponsive to the State\u2019s question, and the court\u2019s curative instruction was adequate to overcome any taint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 752 A.2d 653.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>In <em>Turner, </em>48 Md.App. at 377, 428 A.2d 88, a witness responding to a question on cross-examination regarding whether he and the defendant spent time together, answered: \u201c \u2018No, because he was locked up then.\u2019 \u201d The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for mistrial, and we affirmed, reasoning that \u201cthe response given ... was inadvertent and unexpected,\u201d and \u201cthe bald statement that \u2018he was locked up then\u2019 would seem to carry very little prejudicial information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Similarly, here, the bald statement was isolated, unsolicited and unlikely to cause significant prejudice.

As indicated, she testified that, when she was taken into custody, she initially gave a statement that she and appellant were at home all day, and that Mr. Cosby had come to the apartment with a credit card around 11:00 p.m. Ms. Merritt later initiated further contact with the detectives because she \u201cwanted the truth to get out.\u201d On the way to the interview room, Ms. Merritt passed appellant\u2019s cell. In the interview room, she began to give a second statement to the police, but she stopped when she heard appellant shouting her name from his holding cell. Ms. Merritt testified that, after hearing appellant, she \u201cfelt that I was doing him wrong, so I told the police that I didn\u2019t want to cooperate,\u201d and she ended the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court \u201cerred in admitting evidence that [he] called out Ms. Merritt\u2019s name while he was in custody,\u201d asserting that the evidence was \u201ctoo ambiguous\u201d to be relevant and was \u201cunfairly prejudicial.\u201d Moreover, he contends that, \u201cto the extent that the evidence had some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>probative value, it also brought with it a high risk of unfair prejudice to [him] in that the jury was likely to infer that [he] wanted Ms. Merritt to keep quiet as he had done.\u201d He argues that, to counteract that prejudice, the court should have allowed him to introduce his taped statement given to police before he called out Ms. Merritt\u2019s name, based on \u201cthe doctrine of completeness and fundamental fairness.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The State argues that the court properly exercised its discretion: (A) to admit evidence that appellant repeatedly shouted Ms. Merritt\u2019s name; and (B) to refuse to admit appellant\u2019s exculpatory statement to police. With respect to the relevancy of appellant\u2019s shouting to Ms. Merritt, it argues that the jury could \u201creasonably infer from the circumstances\u201d that, when appellant saw Ms. Merritt return to the interview room for a second time in the company of the police, \u201che shouted out her name in order to silence her or intimidate her so that she would not incriminate him.\u201d With respect to appellant\u2019s contention that his statement to the police should have been admitted pursuant to the doctrine of completeness or as a matter of fundamental fairness, the State argues that this contention is without merit, asserting that the doctrine of completeness is inapplicable and the cases appellant cites regarding fundamental fairness do not \u201cremotely support\u201d the admission of appellant\u2019s exculpatory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Evidence of Shouting</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">As indicated, evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. \u201cRelevant evidence may be excluded, however, if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>unfairly prejudicial, confusing to the fact finder, or a waste of time.\u201d <em>Decker v.

If so, the evidence is relevant and generally admissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 919 A.2d 49 (quoting <em>Thomas v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 682, 712, 899 A.2d 170 (2006)). \u201cSimply because there is a possibility that there exists some innocent, or alternate, explanation for the conduct does not mean that the proffered evidence is per <em>se </em>inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 919 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Here, a reasonable fact finder could infer that, when appellant saw Ms. Merritt return to the interview room for the second time, he yelled Ms. Merritt\u2019s name in an effort to stop her from making further statements to the police regarding Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s robbery and murder.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This desire to conceal evidence is consistent with consciousness of guilt regarding his actions, as well as actual guilt. Although, as appellant asserts, there may have been another explanation for appellant shout<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ing Ms. Merritt\u2019s name, appellant offered no such explanation, and the issue was one for the jury to determine. It did not render the evidence irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Further, the admission of Ms. Merritt\u2019s testimony did not unfairly prejudice appellant. Appellant appears to argue that, because evidence was admitted regarding his statement to Ms. Merritt, the jury would unfairly infer that this was the only statement he made while he was in custody, i.e., that he remained silent, which was incorrect. We are not persuaded. There was no error in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Admissibility of Appellant\u2019s Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">We similarly are not persuaded that the court erred in declining to admit into evidence appellant\u2019s exculpatory statement to the police, which he made prior to yelling Ms. Merritt\u2019s name. The general rule is that a defendant is not entitled to admit an exculpatory statement. <em>Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 544, 693 A.2d 781 (1997) (exculpatory out-of-court statement offered by appellant was \u201cinadmissible hearsay\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999). Appellant relies, however, on the doctrine of verbal completeness, arguing that his statement denying guilt \u201cwas admissible to rebut any inference that he did not talk to the police.\u201d As indicated, we are not persuaded by the factual assumption in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">In any event, the doctrine of verbal completeness does not apply here. That doctrine provides that, \u201c[w]hen part or all of a writing or recorded statement is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\u201d Md. Rule 5-106. The doctrine of completeness \u201callows a party to respond to the admission, by an opponent, of part of a writing or conversation, by admitting the remainder of that writing or conversation.\u201d <em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 541, 693 A.2d 781. Here, evidence that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>shouted Ms. Merritt\u2019s name was not the \u201cremainder\u201d of appellant\u2019s prior exculpatory statement to the police, but rather, it was a separate incident generated by events that occurred after appellant\u2019s statement ended. The doctrine of verbal completeness is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Nor should the exculpatory statement have been admitted as a matter of fundamental fairness, which applies when reliable evidence is excluded due to \u201carbitrary\u201d state evidentiary rules. <em>See Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 </em>U.S. 319, 326, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006) (the Constitution \u201cprohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote.\u201d). As indicated, the statement here was not admissible because it was \u201c \u2018inherently suspect as being self-serving.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 545, 693 A.2d 781 (quoting <em>Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 656, 498 A.2d 666 (1985)). The doctrine of fundamental fairness does not apply here, and the circuit court\u2019s rulings in this regard will not be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Cross-Examination on Witness Eligibility for Parole</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Ms. Merritt regarding her plea agreement with the State, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, if you testify consistently with the State\u2019s version of events, you will receive a jail sentence of 15 years; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">[MS. MERRITT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So\u2014and you are aware that on a 15 year jail sentence you will be eligible for parole after 7 and a half\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The court then sustained the State\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">On appeal, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in restricting his ability to cross-examine Ms. Merritt regarding her eligibility for parole after serving half of the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>called for by the plea agreement. He argues that the court\u2019s restriction on his cross-examination of Ms. Merritt was prejudicial, reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The State contends that the court \u201cproperly excluded evidence that was only marginally probative to impeach [Ms.] Merritt and that strayed into a collateral matter that would have confused the jury.\u201d It further argues that appellant\u2019s question was improper because it was not something within Ms. Merritt\u2019s personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u201cThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee a criminal defendant the right to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Martinez v. State, </em>416 Md. 418, 428, 7 A.3d 56 (2010). A defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness, however, is not unlimited: \u201c \u2018[T]rial courts retain wide latitude in determining what evidence is material and relevant, and to that end, may limit, in their discretion, the extent to which a witness may be cross-examined for the purpose of showing bias.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 399, 426, 970 A.2d 968 (2009) (quoting <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 413, 697 A.2d 432 (1997)). <em>Accord Martinez, </em>416 Md. at 428, 7 A.3d 56 (\u201cA trial court may impose reasonable limits on cross-examination when necessary for witness safety or to prevent harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, and inquiry that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u201c \u2018Managing the scope of cross-examination is a matter that falls within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>185 Md.App. at 426, 970 A.2d 968 (quoting <em>Simmons v. State, </em>392 Md. 279, 296, 896 A.2d 1023 (2006)). This discretion is exercised by balancing \u201c \u2018the probative value of an inquiry against the unfair prejudice that might inure to the witness. Otherwise, the inquiry can reduce itself to a discussion of collateral matters which will obscure the issue and lead to the fact finder\u2019s confusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Pantazes v. State, </em>376 Md. 661, 681, 831 A.2d 432 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 178, 468 A.2d 319 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>In <em>Coleman v. State, </em>321 Md. 586, 610, 583 A.2d 1044 (1991), the Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court\u2019s ruling precluding cross-examination of a witness\u2019s awareness, when he entered into his plea agreement, that he faced a mandatory life sentence without parole. The Court held that, in light of all the other testimony regarding the witness\u2019s motives to testify, his bias, and otherwise to impeach his credibility, this evidence \u201cwould be of minimal significance, if any at all, and certainly would not be essential for the jury to appreciate fully the \u2018sweetness\u2019 of the deal made by the State to encourage him to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 583 A.2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Similarly, here, Ms. Merritt\u2019s motive to lie was extensively explored. Defense counsel asked Ms. Merritt whether she realized that, if she testified \u201cconsistently with the State\u2019s version of events,\u201d the charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder would be nol prossed. Counsel read the terms of Ms. Merritt\u2019s plea agreement to that effect, and he highlighted that her \u201cconsistent\u201d testimony would result in her receiving a 15 year sentence, as opposed to, as phrased by defense counsel, \u201ca possible sentence of double life plus 40 years,\u201d that she otherwise would face. Counsel\u2019s question regarding Ms. Merritt\u2019s understanding of her potential eligibility for parole was a collateral issue that could have caused confusion to the jury, and the court properly exercised its discretion in limiting the scope of appellant\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Appellant\u2019s next contention involves the testimony of Detective Raymond Hunter, who showed the photo arrays containing appellant\u2019s photo to Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby. Detective Hunter testified regarding the process by which he presented the arrays to Ms. Williams and Mr. Cosby. With respect to Ms. Williams, after Detective Hunter showed her the photo array, he asked her to initial the array sheet, sign it, and in the \u201ccomment\u201d section, state in her own words why she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>identified the person she selected. Ms. Williams wrote: \u201cY[a]y[a] brag to me and my boyfriend Kevin Cosby how he terrible beat up the guy and that he rob him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Detective Hunter repeated the same process with Mr. Cosby. He explained, however, that nothing was written on the back of the photo array because, when he asked Mr. Cosby to \u201cin his own words place who this individual was and what part did they have in this particular incident now being investigated,\u201d Mr. Cosby answered that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t read and write.\u201d The comments section of Mr. Cosby\u2019s photographic array sheet is blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred in admitting Detective Hunter\u2019s testimony that Mr. Cosby told the detective that he could not read and write, asserting that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay. He contends that this testimony was prejudicial because the State\u2019s theory was that appellant wrote the zip code for the credit card on the lottery ticket recovered because Mr. Cosby could not read and write.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The State argues that the court properly admitted Detective Hunter\u2019s statement because it was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore, it was not hearsay. It further assets that, \u201ceven if the testimony was inadmissible hearsay, the error in admitting it was harmless because whether [appellant] or Cosby wrote the number on the lottery ticket was not a significant issue at trial, if it was an issue at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">A ruling involving the admission of hearsay ordinarily is an issue of law that we review <em>de novo. In re Matthew S., </em>199 Md.App. 436, 461, 23 A.3d 250 (2011). Hearsay is an out-of-court statement, offered by someone other than the declarant, to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Md. Rule 5-801(c). Hearsay generally is inadmissable. Md. Rule 5-802. An out-of-court-statement may be admissible, however, \u201cif it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted or if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 158, 729 A.2d 910 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Here it is clear that Detective Hunter\u2019s testimony was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that Mr. Cosby could not read or write. Rather, the testimony was elicited to explain why the comments section of his photographic array sheet was blank, as opposed to that of Ms. Williams, on which she wrote her comments. The testimony was not hearsay, and the court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Moreover, appellant does not provide any citation to the record to support his factual assertion that the State\u2019s theory was that Mr. Cosby\u2019s inability to write made clear that appellant wrote the zip code on the lottery ticket. <em>See Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, Inc., </em>174 Md.App. 681, 760-61, 923 A.2d 971 (2007) (\u201cWe decline to comb through the eight-volume, 3,876-page record extract to ascertain information that ... should have [been] provided\u2014a clear reference to a page or pages of the record extract.\u201d). Our review of the record indicates that the issue of who wrote Mr. Pitcairn\u2019s zip code on the lottery receipt was not an important issue at trial; indeed, the prosecutor did not even mention it in opening statement or closing argument. We are satisfied that \u201c \u2018there is no reasonable possibility\u2019 \u201d that the error, if any, contributed to the guilty verdict. <em>See State v. Stringfellow, </em>425 Md. 461, 474, 42 A.3d 27 (2012) (quoting <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 164, 950 A.2d 125 (2008)). Accordingly, even if the court erred in allowing Detective Hunter\u2019s testimony, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976); <em>Morris v. State, </em>418 Md. 194, 221-22, 13 A.3d 1206 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Appellant\u2019s next contention involves the jury instructions regarding flight and concealment of evidence. Appellant initially objected to the State\u2019s request for any such instructions, asserting that, the \u201cevidence is not clear at all\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>appellant attempted to flee or conceal himself. Alternatively, he requested that the instructions \u201cbe read and applied to [Mr.] Cosby.\u201d The State objected to appellant\u2019s request that the instructions be given with respect to Mr. Cosby, arguing that there was no legal support for modifying the instructions to include \u201cother people ... not charged in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The circuit court gave the following instructions to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">A person\u2019s flight and/or concealment immediately after the commission of a crime or after being accused of committing a crime is not enough by itself to establish guilt, but it is a fact that may be considered by you as evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">Flight and/or concealment under these circumstances may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with innocence. You must first decide whether there is evidence of flight and/or concealment by the Defendant or <em>some other person </em>in this case. If you find, if you decide there is evidence of flight and/or concealment by the Defendant <em>or some other person in this case, </em>you then must decide whether this flight and/or concealment shows a consciousness of guilt. You\u2019ve heard ... evidence that the Defendant and <em>other persons </em>may have concealed or destroyed evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">Concealment or destruction of evidence is not enough by itself to establish guilt, but may be considered as evidence of guilt. Concealment or destruction of evidence may be motivated again by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with innocence. You must first decide whether the Defendant, <em>and/or some other person, </em>or persons concealed or destroyed evidence in this case. And if you find that the Defendant, <em>and/or some other person, or persons </em>concealed or destroyed evidence in this case, then you must decide whether this conduct, that particular conduct, shows a consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">(Emphasis added). At the conclusion of the instructions, appellant objected to the instructions, and he renewed his request that Mr. Cosby\u2019s name be included in the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Appellant contends that the court erred in refusing to give the instructions he requested, asserting that his instructions \u201ccorrectly stated the law, were supported by the evidence, and were not fairly covered by the other instructions.\u201d The State disagrees, asserting that appellant \u201creceived more than that to which he was entitled when the trial court modified [the pattern instructions] to include persons in addition to the defendant,\u201d and that the instructions, as modified, were not prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides that the trial court must, upon the request of any party, instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Tucker v. State, </em>407 Md. 368, 379, 965 A.2d 900 (2009). The court is required to give a requested instruction if: \u201c \u2018(1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of law; (2) the requested instruction is applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the requested instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in the jury instruction actually given.\u2019 \u201d <em>McMillan v. State, </em>428 Md. 333, 354, 51 A.3d 623 (2012) (quoting <em>Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 302-03, 901 A.2d 208 (2006)). As we recently explained, \u201c[a]n appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision not to grant a jury instruction under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Hajireen v. State, </em>203 Md.App. 537, 559, 39 A.3d 105 <em>cert. denied, </em>429 Md. 306, 55 A.3d 908 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Here, the circuit court acted within its discretion in declining appellant\u2019s request to modify the jury instructions for flight or concealment or destruction of evidence. The Court of Appeals has noted the distinction between instructions with respect to the <em>\u201capplicable law </em>\u201d which, upon request and under proper circumstances, are required to be given pursuant to Rule 4-325(c), and instructions regarding facts and inferences of fact, which are \u201cnormally not required.\u201d <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 683-85, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999). Accordingly, trial judges generally \u201cneed not instruct, even when requested or when facts might support the inference, on the presence or absence of most evidentiary inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 741 A.2d 1119; <em>cf. Cost v. State, </em>417 Md. 360, 373, 378-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>80, 10 A.3d 184 (2010) (reaffirming the principle stated in <em>Patterson </em>but determining that, under the \u201cunusual facts\u201d in that case, \u201csubstantive Maryland evidence law\u201d required a missing evidence instruction). Appellant has cited no authority supporting his argument that the court was required to modify the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions (\u201cMPJI-Cr\u201d) on flight and concealment of evidence to include factual inferences the jury could make relating to Mr. Cosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Indeed, we note that MPJI-Cr 3:24 is entitled, \u201cPlight or Concealment <em>of Defendant,\u201d </em>and MPJI-Cr 3:26 twice refers to <em>\u201cthe defendant </em>\u201d concealing or destroying evidence in the case. As the jury is determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant, not a witness, the instructions apply only to the defendant\u2019s conduct, i.e., whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crimes. As the instructions are not written to include a person other than the defendant, appellant received more than that to which he was entitled when the trial court modified the jury instructions to include \u201csome other person.\u201d The court did not abuse its discretion in declining to further modify the pattern instructions as requested by appellant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Shackling of Appellant During the Rendition of the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention involves the court\u2019s decision that he remain in restraints during the rendition of the verdict and the polling of the jury. He asserts that the court abused its discretion in making this decision without first making an individualized determination of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The State argues that the court properly exercised its discretion in ordering that appellant remain shackled when the verdict was rendered. In any event, it contends that \u201cthere is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>no evidence that the jury ever saw [appellant\u2019s] restraints, and the trial court observed that they could not be seen,\u201d and therefore, appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">After the jury reached its verdict, the court stated that appellant would remain shackled for the rendition of the verdict. It instructed appellant \u201cto be seated the whole time the jury is in the room,\u201d with his hands and feet under the table. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected, and when the court asked him to explain the prejudice, counsel stated his concern that, if the jury was not unanimous in its verdict and had \u201cto go back to deliberate,\u201d they already would have seen appellant in shackles. The prosecutor stated that he agreed with defense counsel \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The court acknowledged counsels\u2019 concern, but it stated that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a security issue which I have to decide.\u201d After requesting court security to approach the bench,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the court confirmed that there was concern because a defendant facing \u201ca homicide charge with a potential exposure\u201d may create a security issue. The court decided to keep appellant\u2019s shackles on, but keep them hidden, explaining for the record that courtroom personnel \u201cput [appellant\u2019s] suit coat ... over the shackles or over the chains.\u201d It further stated that, \u201cfrom my vantage point, I can\u2019t tell that he\u2019s chained [or] has any sort of restraints on.\u201d The court instructed that neither appellant nor counsel should stand for the reading of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The jury then entered the courtroom, and the foreperson announced its verdict. Defense counsel requested a polling of the jury, and each of the jurors expressed their agreement with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u201cThe decision as to the method and extent of courtroom security is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Miles v.

As the Court of Appeals has explained, reviewing courts \u201c \u2018uniformly rely upon an abuse of discretion standard for reviewing the action of trial judges in the matter of restraint.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunt v.

This is because requiring a defendant to wear shackles that will be seen by a jury implicates the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. <em>See Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 630, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005) (\u201cVisible shackling undermines the presumption of innocence and the related fairness of the factfinding process.\u201d); <em>Whittlesey, 340 </em>Md. at 85, 665 A.2d <em>223 </em>(the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>use of \u201crestraints might derogate the presumption of innocence in the eyes of the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u201cShackling a defendant during the guilt/innocence phase of trial is inherently prejudicial because it highlights the \u2018need to separate a defendant from the community at large.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunt, </em>321 Md. at 409, 583 A.2d 218 (quoting <em>Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 569, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986)). Accordingly, it is appropriate only when there is a compelling state interest. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere are three essential state interests which may justify physically restraining a defendant: Preventing the defendant\u2019s escape, protecting those in the courtroom, and maintaining order in the courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 583 A.2d 218. \u201cUnless one or more of these factors outweigh any prejudice to the defendant, physical restraint is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Before exercising its discretion to order a defendant to appear in restraints, the court must make \u201c \u2018an individualized evaluation of both the need for shackling and the potential prejudice therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 569, 781 A.2d 787 (quoting <em>Whittlesey, </em>340 Md. at 85, 665 A.2d 223). The trial judge must \u201censure that the record reflects the reasons for the imposition of extraordinary security measures.\u201d <em>Whittlesey, </em>340 Md. at 86, 665 A.2d 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in ordering him to remain shackled when the jury entered the courtroom to read its verdict without first making an individualized determination of the need for such a security measure. We agree, finding <em>Lovell, </em>347 Md. at 642-48, 702 A.2d 261, instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In <em>Lovell, </em>the Court of Appeals discussed circumstances that justified shackling at a capital sentencing hearing, such as multiple escape attempts, misconduct by the defendant at trial, and threats by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>In that case, however, the record was devoid of any indication that appellant had made any threats or posed an escape risk, and the circuit court\u2019s order that appellant wear restraints \u201crest[ed] entirely on his having committed murder, attempted murder, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>batteries while armed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648, 702 A.2d 261. The Court of Appeals noted that: \u201cMurder is intrinsically a most violent crime, but, if that alone justified shackling at a capital sentencing, then all murderers could be shackled when sentenced by a jury. That is not the way in which the Due Process Clause is applied[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court held that the circuit court erred \u201cin failing to base its decision to shackle on an individualized evaluation of whether the State interest in the protection of persons in the courtroom outweighed the prejudice to Lovell.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Duckett v. Godinez, </em>67 F.3d 734, 748-49 (9th Cir.1995) (the trial court erred by requiring defendant to appear before capital sentencing jury in physical restraints where the court\u2019s \u201conly stated reason for requiring [defendant] to appear in shackles during the penalty phase of the case was that he had just been convicted of two counts of murder\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1158, 116 S.Ct. 1549, 134 L.Ed.2d 651 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">That same analysis applies here. As in <em>Lovell, </em>the court did not express concern that appellant posed any particular threat, or was potentially at risk to escape. Rather, the court\u2019s rationale for ordering appellant to remain in shackles for the rendition of the verdict was that appellant was charged with murder, explicitly stating a concern \u201cfor any defendant, especially certainly ... on a homicide charge with a potential exposure.\u201d Accordingly, the court abused its discretion in determining that requiring appellant to wear shackles for the rendition of the verdict was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">As the State notes, however, that is not the end of the inquiry. In reviewing a circuit court\u2019s order requiring a defendant to wear restraints, we must determine whether \u201cthe scene presented to jurors,\u201d and what they saw, \u201cwas so inherently prejudicial as to pose an unacceptable threat to defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial; if the challenged practice is not found inherently prejudicial and if the defendant fails to show actual prejudice, the inquiry is over.\u201d <em>Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 721, 569 A.2d 1254 (1990) (quoting <em>Holbrook, </em>475 U.S. at 572, 106 S.Ct. 1340).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>As indicated, the general rule is that requiring a defendant to wear shackles that are visible to the jury during the guilt or innocence phase of trial is inherently prejudicial. <em>Deck, </em>544 U.S. at 635, 125 S.Ct. 2007 (visible shackling is \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d); <em>Hunt, </em>321 Md. at 408-09, 583 A.2d 218 (\u201cPlacing a defendant under physical restraints such as leg irons at a guilt/innocenee trial is an inherently prejudicial measure and requires a compelling state interest.\u201d). In this case, however, the shackling was not inherently prejudicial for two reasons. First, the shackling occurred after the jury had reached its verdict, albeit before it was announced. Second, the record does not reflect that the shackles were visible to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">With respect to the timing of the shackling here, at least one court has held that, when the shackling occurs after the jury has reached its verdict, but before it is announced in open court, there is no presumption of prejudice. <em>State v. Clark, </em>143 Wash.2d 731, 24 P.3d 1006, <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1000, 122 S.Ct. 475, 151 L.Ed.2d 389 (2001). In <em>Clark, </em>the Washington Supreme Court explained that, in this situation, the \u201cjury ha[s] already arrived at its verdict of guilt,\u201d and therefore, \u201cthe presumption of innocence was not at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 776, 24 P.3d 1006. Accordingly, in <em>Clark, </em>the court held that, although the court erred in ordering the defendant shackled without any individualized analysis of the need to restrain him, the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">That same analysis applies here. We hold that requiring a defendant to wear shackles during the rendering of the jury verdict, after the jury has reached a guilty verdict and the presumption of innocence has been overcome, is not inherently prejudicial. Unless there is some indication in the record that the shackling caused prejudice to the defendant, any error in requiring shackling at this point will be deemed harmless.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>A second reason that the shackling was not inherently prejudicial in this case is that the court employed measures to hide the restraints from the view of the jury. Indeed, it specifically stated that court personnel put appellant\u2019s suit coat over the shackles, and the restraints were not visible from the court\u2019s vantage point. Thus, appellant\u2019s claim that his right to a presumption of innocence \u201cwas irrevocably damaged by his appearance in handcuffs and leg irons when the jurors entered the courtroom to render their verdict\u201d is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>Bruce, </em>318 Md. at 715-16, 569 A.2d 1254 the Court of Appeals addressed extra security measures taken outside of the courtroom, including armed guards on the roof of the courthouse and extra metal detectors. The Court noted that counsel did not establish that the security measures were seen by the jury, and it stated that \u201c[s]ecurity measures that are not observed ... by the jury generally do not offend due process rights to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716-18, 569 A.2d 1254. Accordingly, the Court held that Bruce \u201cfailed to establish any unacceptable risk of prejudice from the limited description, on the record, of the security forces deployed in, around, and on top of the courthouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719-20, 569 A.2d 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Other courts have applied this reasoning to the use of shackles, holding that, if shackles are hidden from the view of the jury, their use is not so \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d to create a ground for reversal. For example, in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>148 N.M. 50, 229 P.3d 523, 532-33 (2010), the Supreme Court of New Mexico noted that, in <em>Deck, </em>544 U.S. at 634, 125 S.Ct. 2007, where the United States Supreme Court held that there was inherent prejudice due to visible shackling during the sentencing phase of his trial, the record was clear that the jury knew the defendant was shackled. In <em>Johnson, </em>229 P.3d at 533, by contrast, there was \u201cno indication that the jury saw the leg irons.\u201d Based on the lack of record evidence that the shackles were visible, the court stated that \u201cthe factors tending to show prejudice [were] not present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that, \u201cwhere a defendant is restrained in a manner not visible to the jury, prejudice is not presumed,\u201d explaining that, \u201c[a]s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the jury was not aware of Defendant\u2019s restraint, [his] presumption of innocence was not violated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Madsen, </em>57 P.3d 1134 (Utah Ct.App.2002), the Court of Appeals of Utah addressed the claim that requiring the defendant to stand trial in leg shackles was inherently prejudicial. In rejecting that claim, the court acknowledged that, although visible shackling is inherently prejudicial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">[I]f the jury cannot see the defendant\u2019s shackles, there can be no prejudice. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mayes, </em>158 F.3d 1215, 1226-27 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe restraints in this case were not capable of affecting the jury\u2019s attitude in any way because the district court took great care to ensure that the jury never saw that the appellants were wearing leg irons.\u201d); <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1158 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cDefendants, moreover, have not shown a realistic likelihood that they were prejudiced by what was done, the shackles having been screened from view.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1136 (quoting <em>Moon v. Head, </em>285 F.3d 1301, 1317-18 (11th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The court in <em>Madsen </em>noted that the appellant had not alleged or shown support in the record that the shackles were visible to the jury, and the record suggested \u201cthe opposite: an apron was placed in front of Madsen\u2019s table to prevent the jury from viewing his leg irons. Moreover, the trial judge indicated that they were not visible and allowed Madsen to be seated prior to the jury\u2019s entrance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1137. Accordingly, the court found no inherent prejudice from the use of the shackles. <em>Accord U.S. v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (where shackles \u201cwere not visible to the jury, and thus did not undermine the presumption of innocence in the jurors\u2019 minds such that they were \u2018inherently prejudicial\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Deck, </em>544 U.S. at 634, 125 S.Ct. 2007); <em>People v. Letner, </em>50 Cal.4th 99, 112 Cal.Rptr.3d 746, 235 P.3d 62, 107 (2010) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2097, 179 L.Ed.2d 897 (2011); <em>State v. Wright, </em>153 Idaho 478, 283 P.3d 795, 804 (Ct.App.2012) (\u201cIt is axiomatic, therefore, that before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>a defendant may assert a violation of due process by the use of restraints, there must be evidence to show the jury was aware of the restraints and had an opportunity to draw a conclusion regarding the defendant\u2019s character.\u201d); <em>State v. Sparks, </em>68 So.3d 435, 480 (La.2011) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1794, 182 L.Ed.2d 621 (2012) (\u201cwhere the restraints are not visible to the jury, prejudice is not inherent\u201d and, accordingly, where there was \u201cno indication in the record before us that the jury ever saw or could see the shackles ... the factors tending to show prejudice are not present\u201d); <em>State v. Shoen, </em>598 N.W.2d 370, 378 (Minn.1999) (\u201cfor erroneous restraints to have any prejudicial effect at all, the jury first must be aware that the defendant is wearing a restraint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Applying this reasoning to the present case, the shackling that occurred here was not inherently prejudicial. Indeed, the record shows no prejudice. The court made clear on the record that appellant\u2019s suit coat was pulled over the shackles, and the court instructed appellant not to stand to prevent the jury from seeing the leg shackles. The court specifically stated that appellant\u2019s restraints were not visible from the court\u2019s vantage point.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Accordingly, although the trial court abused its discretion in failing to make a proper individualized determination that restraints were warranted, their use here was not inherently prejudicial, and appellant\u2019s claim that his right to a \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d was \u201cirrevocably damaged by his appearance in handcuffs and leg irons\u201d is without merit.
