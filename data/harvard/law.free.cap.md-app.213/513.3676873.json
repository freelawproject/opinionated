This tale of deception began when appellant Old Frederick Rd., LLC (the \u201cLLC\u201d), through its sole and managing member, appellant Vincent S. Serio, engaged appellee John H. Wiseman to manage the construction of a house on Old Frederick Road in Ellicott City. After finishing the project, Wiseman filed a claim in the Circuit Court for Howard County for money he contended was still owed under contract. Serio defended the suit with a second competing contract and argued that Wiseman already had been paid under that agreement. The trial court was faced with deciding which contract represented the actual terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. The court concluded that Serio\u2019s document was the phony contract, which he created to try to avoid the terms of the real agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Wiseman prevailed on a request for a mechanic\u2019s lien against the constructed property and on his contract claim against the LLC and Serio. Additionally, the court required the LLC and Serio to jointly and severally pay $13,393.30 in attorney\u2019s fees because of Serio\u2019s frivolous defense against Wiseman\u2019s claims. The LLC and Serio filed a limited appeal, asking this Court to find that the circuit court erred in its judgment for attorney\u2019s fees against Serio in his individual capacity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the court\u2019s decision to hold Serio personally liable for the judgment awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Serio is the sole and managing member of Old Frederick Rd., LLC, which he apparently created to build and sell a single family home. The LLC planned for construction of the house located at 8906 Old Frederick Road in Ellicott City to begin sometime in July of 2009. At that time, Serio, as managing member of the LLC, entered into a contract with Wiseman for his services to manage the construction of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">After the construction was completed, in August 2010, Wise-man filed a complaint in the circuit court. He alleged that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>was still owed $7,609.56. Wiseman first sued to establish and enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, for unjust enrichment, and for breach of contract. The mechanic\u2019s lien was sought only against the LLC and the other two counts named the LLC and Serio. Serio answered the Complaint contending that Wiseman submitted a sham contract, and he attached to his Answer what he claimed was the true agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Before the trial on the merits, Wiseman amended his Complaint twice. The final iteration contained four counts. He amended the mechanic\u2019s lien action to add Serio as a party because he had become the property\u2019s owner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wiseman also retained his breach of contract claim against Serio and the LLC. He further added a count against both parties for attorney\u2019s fees under Md.Code (1974, 2010 RepLVol.), Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d), \u00a7 9-303 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a count for attorney\u2019s fees against Serio under Md. Rule 1-341.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">A bench trial was held in December 2011. Wiseman introduced a copy of a contract and Serio introduced what he said were the two originals of a rival contract. Although Wiseman did not object to the admission of Serio\u2019s contracts, Wiseman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>copy was entered into evidence over Serio\u2019s objection that the contract was not an original. Each party contended his respective contract represented the agreement between the LLC and Wiseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Suspiciously, the differences dealt almost exclusively with payment terms. Both contracts were three-pages long. The first pages were identical except for the dates. Wiseman\u2019s agreement was dated July 7 and Serio\u2019s was July 16. The second page contained the payment terms. The second page of Wiseman\u2019s agreement read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\n<em>ESTIMATE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">4. The estimated total cost for the Builder/Consultant to perform the above delineated work will be $12,000.00. Upon the execution of this Agreement, a fee of $4,000.00 is required. Upon the issuance of a Howard County Framing inspection, another payment of $4,000.00 will become payable and due. Upon the issuance of the Final Inspection and Use and Occupancy Permit from Howard County, a balance of $4,000.00 will become due and payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">5. The Builder/Consultant had estimated the above fee based on an estimated building time of 90 work days from the time of the excavation of the foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">6.

All costs to purchase any materials and payment for the work performed for the Owner by any contractor, distributor, or engineer, but not limited to the aforementioned, are to be paid by the Owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">The second page of the agreement that Serio presented to the court contained several differences. The following is a reproduction of the second page with the differences emphasized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">\n<em>ESTIMATE PAYMENT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">4. The estimated total cost for the Builder/Consultant to perform the above delineated work will be $12J?00.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>$8,000.00. Upon the execution of this Agreement, a fee of $4,000.00 is required. Upon the issuance of a Howard County Framing inspection, another final payment of $4,000.00 will become payable and due. Upon the issuance of the Final Inspection and Use and Occupancy Permit from Howard County, a balance of $4,000.00 will become due and payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">5. The Builder/Consultant had estimated the above fee based on an estimated building time of 90 240 work days from the time of the excavation of the foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">6.

All costs to purchase any materials and payment for the work performed for the Owner by any contractor, distributor, or engineer, but not limited to the aforementioned, are to be paid by the Owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">8. The Builder/Consultant will NOT perform any labor nor provide any materials for this house, without a separate signed written Agreement with Owner, to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The third pages were simply signatures. Wiseman testified that his signature on Serio\u2019s contracts could have been his, however, Serio testified that he did not believe his signature on Wiseman\u2019s contract was his. A handwriting expert testified that Serio\u2019s signature, on Wiseman\u2019s contract, was likely a simulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">As the fact-finder, the judge determined that the agreement between the parties was embodied in the contract that Wise-man introduced and that Serio had simply created his version of the contract to avoid the original agreement. Several pieces of evidence support the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Wiseman testified that normally he would charge around $30,000 for the type of job Serio asked him to perform. He also stated that the project requested typically would take around 90 days. Wiseman introduced contracts from some of his other jobs, which corroborated his testimony regarding his rate and time estimate. However, Wiseman also testified that he offered to perform the job for $15,000 because it was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>difficult project, he could finish it quickly because it was close to his own house, and it was a good business investment for him because Serio owned many other properties. Wiseman stated that eventually Serio negotiated the price to $12,000. Other witnesses testified that Serio routinely engaged in extensive negotiations over projects like this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Wiseman introduced a preliminary version of the parties\u2019 agreement, without objection. He explained that Serio would not accept the document because his company\u2019s name was spelled incorrectly (Old Frederick Road, LLC instead of Old Frederick Rd., LLC). Wiseman then produced a copy of the final agreement, which was exactly the same as the preliminary one, except that the company name was spelled correctly. The court admitted the copy into evidence over Serio\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The contract\u2019s terms for payment were consistent with the contracts for other jobs that Wiseman introduced into evidence. For example, he is paid a fee upfront, again upon framing and inspection, and a final payment when the job is complete. Furthermore, all the contracts Wiseman introduced contained a clause that he would be reimbursed if he paid subcontractors. Wiseman testified that he kept Serio updated on what he had paid and how much so that he could be reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The contract date, July 7, also corresponds with evidence that Wiseman introduced showing that he had taken steps to begin the project at least by July 13. Although Wiseman\u2019s contract estimated that the project would be completed within 90 days, testimony from Wiseman and other subcontractors revealed that Serio delayed the project because he was constantly trying to renegotiate contracts with the subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Serio introduced his competing contract into evidence. The court found Serio\u2019s contract was a fake for several reasons. For one, it was dated July 16, which is after Wiseman started doing work under the contract on July 13. The time-frame was also curious. It provided that the project would take 240 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>days, which was inconsistent with Wiseman\u2019s typical estimate for similar projects. The heading of the payment terms section was also unusual. Serio\u2019s contract titled the section \u201cpayment\u201d instead of \u201cestimate,\u201d which was inconsistent with all of Wiseman\u2019s other form contracts introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The word \u201cpayment\u201d supported Serio\u2019s theory that Wise-man had been paid in full under the contract. As for price, Serio testified that he and Wiseman immediately agreed on $8,000, but this was out of sync with Serio\u2019s proclivity to negotiate. That price was also lower than both the industry standard and Wiseman\u2019s ordinary price for a project that would take 240 days to complete. The reimbursement clause of Serio\u2019s agreement was inconsistent with other evidence. It read that Wiseman would not perform any labor nor provide any materials for the house without a separate signed agreement with the owner. The court determined that this provision was contrary to Wiseman\u2019s typical practice, as explained by his testimony and his contracts for other similar projects, to provide the materials and be reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Serio\u2019s testimony that he had possession of the two originals also was problematic. Serio testified that he came into possession of both originals when Wiseman gave the second one to him accidentally with the mechanic\u2019s lien notice. The court found this an unlikely scenario because Wiseman had filed his differing version of the contract with the court at the same time he served Serio with the notice. It was unlikely that he would have given Serio one version of a contract and the court another.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Serio also testified that he was having some financial problems toward the end of construction. Even at the time of the trial, at least one other subcontractor still had not been paid. He testified that he really needed to sell the house. Given the totality of the evidence, the court determined that Serio created the contract after the fact to avoid paying Wiseman the agreed upon price and to avoid having a mechanic\u2019s lien placed on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Accepting Wiseman\u2019s contract as the parties\u2019 true agreement, the court granted the mechanic\u2019s lien on the property in the amount of $7,609.56 and found that amount to constitute the damages for the breach of contract action. The court arrived at this number by finding that Wiseman had been paid $8,000 of the base contract price and was still owed $4,000. Additionally, the contract provided that Wiseman would be reimbursed for certain supplies and $1,990 was still owed. Finally, labor was to be paid at a rate of $35 an hour and $1,619.45 was outstanding. For a number of reasons not relevant to this appeal, the court pierced the corporate veil to also hold Serio, in addition to the LLC, jointly and severally liable for the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The court also held Serio and the LLC jointly and severally liable for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $13,393.30. The court entertained two theories for holding Serio individually liable for this award. First, the court determined that attorney\u2019s fees were proper under RP \u00a7 9-303, which permits a court to award attorney\u2019s fees if it determines that an owner, contractor, or subcontractor had acted in bad faith in failing to pay undisputed amounts in certain construction contracts. The court determined that Serio had acted in bad faith in creating a fake contract to try to avoid paying the undisputed contract price. Further, the court held that its piercing of the corporate veil to hold Serio liable for the construction contract also supported finding him personally liable for the attorney\u2019s fees under RP \u00a7 9-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Second, the court determined that the attorney\u2019s fees award was also warranted under Md. Rule 1-341, which allows the court to order a party to pay attorney\u2019s fees if the court finds that the conduct of the party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith <em>or </em>without substantial justification. The court determined that Serio acted in bad faith and without substantial justification in defending the mechanic\u2019s lien and contract action by disputing Wiseman\u2019s contract price and creating a fake contract. However, the court did not make clear whether its finding against Serio under Md. Rule 1-341 was premised on piercing the corporate veil. The LLC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>and Serio timely appealed to this Court. Additional facts will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Because it is not apparent from the briefs, we think it is important to note that Serio and Old Frederick Rd., LLC stated clearly at oral argument what portions of the court\u2019s ruling they were and were not appealing. They are not appealing the award of contract damages or the mechanic\u2019s lien, which amounted to a total of $7,609.56. They explained that the property was sold to an unrelated purchaser. The mechanic\u2019s lien was not discovered until after the purchase of the property. Thus, the purchaser\u2019s title insurance company paid Wiseman to satisfy the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">However, Serio is still appealing the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees against him individually in the amount of $13,393.30. The court used two bases for this award: Md. Rule 1-341 and RP \u00a7 9-303(b). Although he disputes the propriety of his liability for the award under either theory, Serio acknowledged at oral argument that the circuit court needed to be correct on only one of the theories for the entire award to stand. For these reasons, we focus exclusively on Serio\u2019s contention that the award was not sanctioned by Md. Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">II. Md. Rule 1-341</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Serio argues that his case does not fall under Md. Rule 1-341 because he was not a proper party to any of the claims, and the court relied on inadmissible evidence in determining that he acted in bad faith or without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">A. Proper Party</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">As Serio explains in his brief, he was a named party for the mechanic\u2019s lien count as the owner of the property. He asserts that Md. Rule 1-341 requires the court to have <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over a party, and the mechanic\u2019s lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>was an <em>in rem </em>action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although a mechanic\u2019s lien action is an <em>in rem </em>proceeding, <em>Brendsel v. Winchester Const. Co., Inc., </em>162 Md.App. 558, 580-81, 875 A.2d 789 (2005), we believe Md. Rule 1-341 applies to Serio\u2019s actions. The terms used in Md. Rule 1-341 are broad. The Rule encompasses any party and his or her attorney in a civil action. \u201cCivil action\u201d includes a mechanic\u2019s lien claim. \u201cParty\u201d includes the owner of the subject property in a mechanic\u2019s lien proceeding. The owner of the property is considered to be a necessary party, the defendant, in such an action. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 12-302(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, due process requires that the owner of the property be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before a mechanic\u2019s lien can come into effect. <em>Redland Genstar, Inc. v. Mahase, </em>155 Md.App. 72, 79, 841 A.2d 413 (2004). Md. Rule 1-341 also permits the court to require the offending party\u2019s attorney, over which the court would not have had <em>in person-am </em>jurisdiction, to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Further, this mechanic\u2019s lien action is a contested proceeding\u2014a trial\u2014not the mere filing of a lien. In addition, attorney\u2019s fees were not sought as part of the mechanic\u2019s lien case, but collaterally, as a result of Serio\u2019s misconduct during the course of that proceeding. Finally, to adopt Serio\u2019s position would transform mechanic\u2019s lien proceedings into a \u201cwild west,\u201d with no effective legal restraint on bad faith or unjustified litigative behavior. We find no such exemption in Rule 1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>341 for mechanic\u2019s lien cases. For these reasons, Serio was a proper party to the civil action in this case, making Md. Rule 1-341 applicable to him. <em>See Winkler Const. Co., Inc. v. Jerome, </em>355 Md. 231, 253, 734 A.2d 212 (1999) (noting the application of Md. Rule 1-341 to the parties to a mechanic\u2019s lien action).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In his reply brief, Serio introduced another argument for why he was not a proper party to the mechanic\u2019s lien action. He contends that only the owner of the subject property is a party. Wiseman filed his initial complaint in 2010, but Serio did not become the owner of the property until June 15, 2011, when the circuit court ruled that his deed purporting to transfer the property was a fraudulent conveyance that had no legal effect. This creates another review problem because appellate courts \u201cordinarily will not consider an issue raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 713, 843 A.2d 778 (2004). However, we note that Wise-man filed an amended complaint naming Serio as a party to the mechanic\u2019s lien action as the owner of the property on June 15, 2011. Thus, Serio was a party to the action during the trial in December 2011, so that the circuit court\u2019s ruling under Md. Rule 1-341 correctly embraced Serio\u2019s trial conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">B. An Action in Bad Faith or Without Substantial Justification</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Serio\u2019s next argument for reversal is that the court based its finding that he acted in bad faith or without substantial justification on inadmissible evidence. The argument requires several steps in reasoning. He contends that the court erroneously admitted a copy of Wiseman\u2019s contract into evidence. Building on this premise, Serio asserts that the court compared the two contracts. Then, Serio argues, the court decided that his contract was a fake based on that comparison. Finally, he contends that the court decided that he acted in bad faith and without substantial justification because he created that fake contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In our view, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to admit Wiseman\u2019s copy of the contract. A trial judge\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence will not be set aside absent an abuse of discretion. <em>CSX Transp., Inc,, v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>343 Md. 216, 252, 680 A.2d 1082 (1996). An abuse of discretion only occurs when \u201cno reasonable person would share the view taken by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 601, 976 A.2d 300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Serio relies on Md. Rule 5-1003 for his argument against the admissibility of Wiseman\u2019s copy of the contract. Under Md. Rule 5-1003, \u201c[a] duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.\u201d Serio argues that Wiseman\u2019s contract was a copy and Wise-man admitted that he always considered the version he submitted to be a copy. Serio contends that this copy should not have been admitted into evidence because he raised a genuine issue as to the authenticity of the original. He asserts that this genuine question of authenticity was raised when he testified that the signature on Wiseman\u2019s contract was not his. And his forensic expert testified that Serio\u2019s signature was most likely a simulation and that one page looked like it did not match the other pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Whether a party has raised a genuine question as to the authenticity of the original is a preliminary question of admissibility. Under Md. Rule 5-1008(a), it is an issue the judge must decide. The court found that Serio\u2019s problems with the copy did not question the authenticity of the original contract because he was not contending that Wiseman had altered the original in any way. Indeed, Serio\u2019s position was that he had both originals. Serio\u2019s argument was that Wiseman had created a completely new and fake contract. Thus, the court determined that Serio\u2019s challenge was to the validity of the document as a whole, not to the issue of it being a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the contract copy for two reasons. First, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>court suggests with its ruling, Serio\u2019s questions regarding Wiseman\u2019s contract were to the validity of the entire contract, which is an issue properly addressed under Md. Rule 5-1008(b), not Md. Rule 5-1003. Second, even if Serio\u2019s inquiries questioned the authenticity of the original contract under Md. Rule 5-1003, the problems of authenticity that Serio raised were not genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">1. Md. Rule 5-1008</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Md. Rule 5-1008 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">(a) Except as otherwise provided in section (b) of this Rule, when the admissibility of evidence other than the original of contents of writings, recordings, or photographs under these rules depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the question whether the condition has been fulfilled is for the court to determine in accordance with the provisions of Rule 5-104(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">(b) The following issues, if raised, are for the trier of fact to determine as in the case of other issues of fact: (1) whether the asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed, (2) whether another writing, recording, or photograph produced at the trial is the original, or (3) whether evidence of contents other than the original correctly reflects the contents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In <em>Lorraine v. Markel American Ins. Co., </em>241 F.R.D. 534, 577 (D.Md.2007), the United States District Court for the District of Maryland discussed the federal equivalent of this rule and described the section on issues for the trier of fact as a specialized application of \u201cconditional relevance\u201d that sets forth what must happen when there is a dispute over whether there ever was a writing, recording, or photograph, or when there are conflicting versions of duplicates, originals, or secondary evidence offered into evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applied more specifically to this case, which conflicting version of a contract is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>true agreement between the parties is an issue for the trier of fact because each document\u2019s relevance is conditioned on the finding that the writing is authentic. <em>See Gerald v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 295, 304, 768 A.2d 140 (2001). With two competing contracts in this case, each needed to be admitted because the issue of which one was the authentic contract was properly left to the trier of fact, here the circuit judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Indeed, if Serio had also produced a copy of a contract, or Wiseman produced an original, then each of the duplicates or originals would have individually been admitted without question under Md. Rule 5-1008 as relevant on the condition that it was authentic. What threw a monkey wrench into the case was Wiseman\u2019s testimony that he had always treated the document he produced as a copy. This prompted Serio to object under Md. Rule 5-1003. But this particular factual scenario is not the one contemplated by Md. Rule 5-1003. As the circuit court stated when discussing whether to admit the document: \u201cIf I\u2019m to sustain the objection, because your position [is], that there\u2019s a [genuine] dispute that it\u2019s the original. Well, then, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander, and neither will ever be admitted. And, it would be a perfect defense [in] each and every case, for the Defendant to merely stand up and say, there\u2019s a lie there, there\u2019s a forgery there, therefore, it\u2019s never admissible.\u201d We agree and find that the rules of evidence, which are to be read together and construed to ascertain the truth and justly determine disputes, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 5-102,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> permitted the admission of both contracts in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>2. Md. Rule 5-1003</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In addition to its explicit reasoning for why Wiseman\u2019s contract copy was admissible, the court\u2019s decision stands on another footing. Under Md. Rule 5-1003, a copy is admissible unless a \u201cgenuine\u201d question is raised as to the authenticity of the original. Serio\u2019s supposed questioning of the authenticity of the original came through his testimony that the signature on Wiseman\u2019s contract was probably not his signature. He also brought a handwriting expert to question his signature on Wiseman\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The court\u2019s analysis of Serio\u2019s arguments suggests that even if Serio were challenging the authenticity of Wiseman\u2019s original contract, his challenge was not \u201cgenuine.\u201d Appellate courts, or circuit courts for that matter, do not typically grapple with the intricacies of the best evidence rules. Thus, there is not much in the way of case law on the issue of what constitutes a \u201cgenuine\u201d challenge to the authenticity of a document. However, it is unquestionably a matter for the trial court to decide. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-1008(a). In this case, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>was within the court\u2019s discretion to examine the disputed signature and determine\u2014in the face of all the other evidence indicating that the copy was authentic and Serio was not credible\u2014that the signature was too similar to Serio\u2019s other signatures to raise a genuine question of authenticity. <em>Cf. Bank of Hawaii v. Shaw, </em>88 Hawai'i 50, 924 P.2d 544, 557 (Haw.Ct.App.1996) (finding, under an identical Hawaii provision, that no genuine question as to the authenticity of an agreement had been raised because the court could have disbelieved the party\u2019s testimony that he did not sign the agreement based on the other evidence in the case); <em>People v. Von Villas, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 201, 13 Cal.Rptr.2d 62, 87 (1992) (finding, under an identical California evidence provision, that a trial court\u2019s decision that a party did not raise a genuine question of authenticity was supported by ample evidence where the party\u2019s testimony was contradicted by other witnesses\u2019 testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Further, this case presents a unique situation where the objecting party\u2019s actions suggested that his objection to the other party\u2019s copy of a contract was frivolous. Serio introduced a competing contract, which the court found he created to avoid the obligations of the real contract. Serio\u2019s creation of a fake contract suggests that his challenge to Wiseman\u2019s contract was not a genuine challenge. With the action of creating a pseudo-contract factored into the mix, it would be difficult for any reasonable judge to conclude that Serio\u2019s challenge to the authenticity of Wiseman\u2019s contract was genuine. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the copy of Wiseman\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Serio\u2019s argument that the court erroneously awarded attorney\u2019s fees against him under Md. Rule 1-341 rises and falls on the admissibility of Wiseman\u2019s contract. He is silent as to any alternative argument for why the circuit court\u2019s finding of bad faith in defending the action was an error even if the Wiseman contract was properly admitted. He also does not argue that the amount of attorney\u2019s fees was error. Thus, because we find the contract was not erroneously admitted, our scrutiny of the court\u2019s findings under Md. Rule 1-341 is over. We simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>note that even if the contract had not been admitted into evidence, the trial court still could have reasonably concluded that Serio acted in bad faith. The court\u2019s finding could be upheld based on a comparison between Serio\u2019s contract and Wiseman\u2019s testimony regarding his typical practices and prices, the preliminary version of Wiseman\u2019s contract with the LLC that was admitted without objection, and the contracts of Wiseman\u2019s similar projects that were admitted into evidence. For all the reasons discussed, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment against Serio for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In his brief, Wiseman has sought a remand for appellate attorney\u2019s fees. He did not file a motion in this Court for these fees. Regardless, the preferred way of addressing a request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees is to file a motion for such fees in the circuit court after the appellate court\u2019s decision is filed. <em>See </em>Proposed Rule 2-706, included in the 177th Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, submitted to the Court of Appeals on March 28, 2013. If this rule change is approved, such a request could be resolved entirely at the circuit court level without the need of a formal remand from this Court. Until proposed Rule 2-706 is adopted, we will follow <em>Meade v. Shangri-La Partnership\u2019s </em>lead and remand on this question. 424 Md. 476, 494-95 n. 11, 36 A.3d 483 (2012) (remanding case for consideration of petitioner\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees for appellate work.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED. CASE REMANDED FOR CONSIDERATION OF APPELLEE\u2019S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES FOR APPELLATE WORK. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">. Appellants phrased their questions presented as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">1. Did the [cjircuit [cjourt err by disregarding the limited liability company form\u2014piercing the corporate veil\u2014and holding individual [ajppellant Vincent Serio personally liable for the obligations of [ajppellant Old Frederick Rd., LLC?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">2. Did the [cjircuit [cjourt err in imposing sanctions under Maryland Rule 1-341 against individual [ajppellant Vincent Serio?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">This first question suggests that appellants are appealing the court\u2019s judgments against Serio on the breach of contract claim as well as the attorney\u2019s fees award. In fact, much of appellants\u2019 brief is devoted to the court\u2019s piercing of the corporate veil to hold Serio liable for all of the LLC\u2019s obligations. Although Serio has struggled earnestly to make piercing the corporate veil the main issue in this case, he and the LLC conceded at oral argument that they are not appealing the breach of contract ruling and that piercing the corporate veil is only relevant to the extent that it relates to Serio being held individually liable for the attorney's fees award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">. In June 2011, as part of a separate action against Serio involving money owed for construction of another property located at 2965 Brookwood Road in Ellicott City, the circuit court found that a 2008 deed which purported to transfer the property at Old Frederick Road from Serio to another LLC, Brookwood Road, LLC, was a fraudulent conveyance and had no legal effect. This ruling made Serio the owner of the Old Frederick Road property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">. RP \u00a7 9-303(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">If a court determines that an owner, contractor, or subcontractor has acted in bad faith by failing to pay any undisputed amounts owed as required under \u00a7 9-302 of this subtitle, the court may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">. Under Md. Rule 1-341:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-5\">. Serio provides no support for the contention that Md. Rule 1-341 requires <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. This runs afoul of Md. Rule 8-504(a)(6) and we are not required to address the argument. <em>See Kramer v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>124 Md.App. 616, 633 n. 4, 723 A.2d 529 (1999); Md. Rule 8-504(a)(6): (\"(a) A brief shall comply with the requirements of Rule 8-112 and include the following items in the order listed; ... (6) Argument in support of the party\u2019s position on each issue.\u201d) However, we use our discretion to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">. Md. Rule 12-302 explains what needs to be done to commence an action to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien. Section (c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">The plaintiff shall bring an action to establish a mechanics lien against the owner of the land against which the lien is sought to be established. The plaintiff may join, but is not required to join, any other person who has or may have an interest in the land and who may be entitled to share in the proceeds of a sale of the land.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\">. In Maryland, conditional relevance is discussed in Md. Rule 5-104(b), which explains, \"[w]hen the relevance of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding by the trier of fact that the condition has been fulfilled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">. Md. Rule 5-102 specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">The rules in this Title shall be construed to secure fairness in administration, eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay, and promote the growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. Wiseman also contends that his contract was admissible under two of the exceptions to Md. Rule 5-1003. These exception are described in Md. Rule 5-1004:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The contents of a writing, recording, or photograph may be proved by evidence other than the original if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(a) All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(b) No original can be obtained by any reasonably practicable, available judicial process or procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">(c) At a time when an original was under the control of the party against whom offered, that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing or trial, and that party does not produce the original at the hearing or trial; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">(d) The writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">First, Wiseman testified that he was not completely sure that the contract he proffered was not the original (he had just always assumed it was a copy). He said that if the contract was a copy, he had looked for an original and he could not find one. Serio did not assert that Wiseman lost the original in bad faith. Thus, Wiseman argues, the copy was admissible under exception (a). Second, Wiseman asserts that Serio testified that he had both originals. Therefore, Wiseman contends, the copy was admissible under exception (c). Our conclusion that the copy was otherwise properly admitted means we need not address Wiseman's theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">. Because we find the attorney\u2019s fees were properly awarded against Serio individually under Md. Rule 1-341, we need not reach a decision on whether they also were proper under RP \u00a7 9-303. Additionally, Serio agreed at oral argument that piercing the corporate veil was only an issue for the finding of attorney's fees under RP \u00a7 9-303. Thus, we also need not address whether the court erred in piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
