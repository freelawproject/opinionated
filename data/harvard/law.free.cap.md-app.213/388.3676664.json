The court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment, all but 50 years suspended, for first degree murder and 20 years, consecutive, for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">On appeal, appellant presents four questions for our review, which we have revised slightly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">1. Did the trial court err in granting the State\u2019s motion to compel recordings of two witness statements, which were made by State\u2019s witnesses to a defense investigator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-14\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting prior inconsistent statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">3. Did the court err in admitting other crimes evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>4. Did the motions court err in denying the defense motion to suppress two out-of-court identifications made based on a photo array?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Alvin Alston was shot on September 13, 2009, at approximately 12:00 p.m. near the corner of Coldspring Lane and Reisterstown Road, in Baltimore City, Maryland. Mr. Alston later died at a local hospital of gunshot wounds to the head. The manner of death was determined to be homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Eyewitnesses to the murder were interviewed by the Baltimore City Police Department. Detective Aaron Cruz, the primary investigator in this case, spoke with Anthony Jordan on September 30, 2009, and Mr. Jordan informed him that appellant was the shooter. Mr. Jordan was nervous and concerned for his safety. Mr. Jordan was shown a photo array, and he identified appellant in about \u201c30, 40 seconds. It was relatively quick.\u201d Mr. Jordan also gave a statement at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">On November 23, 2009, Detective Cruz spoke with Latrice Wilson. Ms. Wilson arrived at the police station with her children, and her children waited in a witness waiting room. Ms. Wilson was then shown a photo array and identified appellant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">On October 15, 2009, appellant was arrested. He provided police with two addresses; one was the home of his sister, and the other was the home of his girlfriend. Both addresses were located within blocks of the murder scene. Detective Cruz also testified that the location where appellant and the victim, Mr. Alston, previously had been arrested in an unrelated case was located less than a mile away.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>On cross-examination, Detective Cruz agreed that he received information that the victim, Mr. Alston, was selling drugs on the day of the murder. Six bags of heroin were recovered from Mr. Alston\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Detective Daniel Nicholson was present with Detective Cruz when Mr. Jordan was shown a photographic array. The array initially was face down, and Mr. Jordan was read a set of instructions informing him that the array may or may not contain a picture of a subject in connection with the investigation. After this, Mr. Jordan turned the array over, and within seconds, Mr. Jordan selected a photograph of appellant. Mr. Jordan also wrote a statement on the back of the array; the police did not tell Mr. Jordan what to write in making that identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Detective Marvin Sydnor was present during Ms. Wilson\u2019s viewing of the photographic array on November 23, 2009. Ms. Wilson also made an identification within seconds and wrote on the back of the array why she made the identification. Detective Sydnor testified that Ms. Wilson identified only one person from the array; she did not identity anyone else as the shooter or indicate that she knew anyone in the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Mr. Jordan testified that he was selling newspapers at the pertinent intersection, located near a Burger King, when he observed a young man shoot Mr. Alston. Mr. Jordan testified that Mr. Alston was known to him as a \u201chustler,\u201d a \u201cdrug dealer.\u201d Mr. Jordan heard Mr. Alston say: \u201cOh, no,\u201d and then he heard two gunshots. Thereafter, Mr. Jordan saw a \u201cyoung man in a black hoodie\u201d get into a Jeep. Mr. Jordan maintained that he did not \u201csee no facial\u201d of the shooter, and he did not know if the man in the hoodie was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The day of the shooting, Mr. Jordan went to the police station and gave a statement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Jordan testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>did not identify the shooter to the police because he had not seen anyone\u2019s \u201cfacial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">A couple months later, according to Mr. Jordan, Detective Cruz asked him to come back to the police station.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Jordan testified that the police detained him for several hours. At some point, Detective Nicholson told him: \u201cIf I even thought you had something, mm-mm to do with it I will lock you up.\u201d Afterwards, Mr. Jordan was asked to make an identification. Mr. Jordan claimed he needed to pick someone or be detained. He testified that the police used a piece of paper to highlight certain photographs during the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Mr. Jordan then testified that, on two occasions, he had spoken to a defense investigator, Mr. Donald Jacobs. He recalled telling Mr. Jacobs that he had been treated unfairly by police, but he was not sure if he told Mr. Jacobs that the police told him who to pick out in the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Mr. Jordan was presented with a copy of the photo array. He agreed that his signature appeared on both the front and the back of the document. His statement on the back of the array read: \u201cOn the corner of Reisterstown and Coldspring I witnessed that a young man shot Alvin two times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Over objection, Mr. Jordan\u2019s prior statement to police, taken on the day of the shooting, was played into evidence for the jury. In this statement, Mr. Jordan states that a person wearing a black hoodie got out of a Jeep, approached the victim, and said something to Mr. Alston, to which Mr. Alston replied: \u201cOh, no.\u201d The person in the hoodie then shot Mr. Alston two times in the head, got back into the Jeep, and fled the scene. Mr. Jordan denied that he had ever seen the shooter before.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Mr. Jordan also was presented at trial with a transcript of the recorded statement taken on September 30, 2009, when he was interviewed by Detective Cruz and shown a photo array. Mr. Jordan agreed that the police asked him at the end of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>interview if he had been threatened, and Mr. Jordan denied that he had been. He also agreed that he told police that he came to the station that day freely and voluntarily, and that he had not been promised anything in exchange for his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On cross-examination, Mr. Jordan maintained that he never saw the shooter\u2019s face. When asked by defense counsel if he told police that he \u201cglanced at the person,\u201d Mr. Jordan testified that he \u201cdid not see no one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">On redirect, Mr. Jordan was presented with an audio tape cassette recording of his statement to Detective Cruz on September 80, 2009, and he agreed that he signed the cassette. Over defense objection, the State then played the tape for the jury. During that interview, Mr. Jordan stated that he \u201cglanced\u201d at the shooter. When asked by the officer whether he \u201crecognized who he was,\u201d Mr. Jordan replied: \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Ms. Wilson testified that she was in the area of the shooting. Her car had stalled, and she was sitting inside her vehicle when she saw a van arrive. After the van left, four men were standing nearby. One man was standing on the corner \u201cfiddling with some papers.\u201d Moments later, a man wearing a hoodie pulled out a gun and shot the man with the papers twice in the back of the head. Ms. Wilson described the shooter as being a tall, African American male, wearing a black pullover hoodie, jeans, and white \u201ctenners.\u201d Ms. Wilson saw the gun and described it as a \u201csilver, revolver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Ms. Wilson saw the shooter\u2019s faee. She had seen him before in the neighborhood, but she did not know this man\u2019s name. Ms. Wilson saw the shooter put the gun back in his waistband, then run away from the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">After the police arrived on the scene, Ms. Wilson was able to restart her car, and she went to the police station. After waiting in the police waiting room, Ms. Wilson spoke with Detective Cruz and gave a statement consistent with her testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>On November 28, 2009, the day of her daughter\u2019s birthday, police officers arrived at Ms. Wilson\u2019s residence and demanded that she accompany them to the police station to make an identification. They threatened to arrest her if she did not come with them at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">At the station, Ms. Wilson was presented with a photo array, which she signed on the front and back, indicating that she picked out a photograph of the shooter. Ms. Wilson wrote on the back: \u201cI saw the man in the photo shoot another man in the back of the head. I was on west Coldspring.\u201d Ms. Wilson testified that none of the detectives told her who to pick or what to write. Ms. Wilson initially identified appellant at trial as the person she saw at the time of the shooting. Subsequently, however, she stated that she saw appellant at the scene, but she did not see appellant shoot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On cross-examination, Ms. Wilson agreed that she previously had testified that she initially picked out a photo other than appellant\u2019s from the array, and Detective Cruz told her \u201cstop playing,\u201d \u201ccome on, you know who the guy is.\u201d She also testified that the shooter was \u201cdefinitely taller than the victim because the way he was standing over top of him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">On redirect examination, Ms. Wilson testified that she told Detective Cruz that appellant was there, but he was not the shooter. She testified at trial that appellant was not the shooter in this case, stating: \u201c[N]o, he did not shoot the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Over defense objection, the jury then heard a recorded statement Ms. Wilson gave to a defense investigator, Mr. Jacobs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ms. Wilson told Mr. Jacobs that she did not remember anything about the shooting. When asked about the photo array, Ms. Wilson told Mr. Jacobs she did not remember what the shooter looked like, but she did remember making an identification from a photo array. She then told Mr. Jacobs that she did remember some details of the shoot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ing, including that four men got out of the van, that the shooter shot the victim in the head, and that, afterwards, the shooter ran toward her stalled car while the other two men ran in the opposite direction. Ms. Wilson also told Mr. Jacobs that she hesitated in picking out a photo from the array because she believed she saw a photo of a man she had seen on prior occasions in the company of her father-in-law. She concluded by again telling Mr. Jacobs that she could not remember details from the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On recross-examination, defense counsel asked about conflicts between her cross-examination, stating that the shooter walked away, and her interview with Mr. Jacobs, stating that the shooter ran. Ms. Wilson testified that the shooter walked toward her location and did not run from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">A gun was not found in connection with this case, but several pieces of ballistic evidence were recovered. A live round recovered near the scene of the shooting was a Winchester nine millimeter Luger. Two shell casings recovered near the body were also nine millimeter Lugers. These shell casings were determined to have been fired from the same firearm. A DNA test was performed on the bullet, and the results were inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Regarding motive, the jury learned that, after Mr. Alston was pronounced dead, Detective Cruz went to the hospital and spoke with Randolph Alston, the victim\u2019s brother. After this conversation, and after reviewing witness statements, Detective Cruz learned that the victim previously had been arrested, with appellant and another individual, for conspiracy to distribute heroin and related charges that carried a potential sentence of 40 years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Three days prior to the murder, a court date relating to that charge was postponed. By the time of what would have been the ninth scheduled trial date, because Mr. Alston, the person the State alleged to have been actually selling the drugs, was deceased, the prosecutor offered plea agreements to appellant and Marvin Brown, who then pleaded guilty and received sentences of time served. Appellant was not in jail the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Mr. Alston was shot, but the third individual, Mr. Brown, was incarcerated at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We shall include additional details in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion to compel production of statements that two State\u2019s witnesses made to a defense investigator. He asserts that the statements were not discoverable because the defense did not intend to use the statements at trial, and the statements were protected under the work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The State disagrees. It asserts that \u201cthe trial court properly determined that two audio recordings of State\u2019s witnesses made by a defense investigator were subject to discovery by the State, and the trial court properly exercised its discretion to compel disclosure after conducting an in camera review of the recordings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Prior to trial, the State filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-263(e)(6), a motion to compel disclosure of recorded statements the defense obtained from Mr. Jordan and Ms. Wilson. Defense counsel argued that the recordings of these State\u2019s witnesses, obtained by the defense investigator, Mr. Jacobs, were not discoverable because they were attorney work product, and he did not intend to use the recordings at trial. After further inquiry, however, defense counsel confirmed that, if these witnesses testified \u201cto something different, then at that point in time the material would be used as impeachment material.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The court ordered the defense to provide the recordings to the court for an <em>in camera </em>review. After its review, the court ordered disclosure of the recordings of Mr. Jordan and Ms. Wilson to the State. With respect to appellant\u2019s claim of protection pursuant to the work product doctrine, the court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the recordings of Mr. Jordan and Ms. Wilson did not include opinions, thoughts, or conclusions of defense counsel, but instead, they were recordings of facts from the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Maryland Rule 4-263(e)(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Maryland Rule 4-263 sets forth the discovery requirements of the parties in a criminal case. The obligations of the defense are set forth, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">(e) Disclosure by Defense. Without the necessity of a request, the defense shall provide to the State\u2019s Attorney:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">(6) Documents, Computer-generated Evidence, and Other Things. The opportunity to inspect, copy, and photograph any documents, computer-generated evidence as defined in Rule 2-504.3(a), recordings, photographs, or other tangible things that the defense intends to use at a hearing or at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">(g) Matters Not Discoverable. (1) By any Party. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Rule, neither the State\u2019s Attorney nor the defense is required to disclose (A) the mental impressions, trial strategy, personal beliefs, or other privileged attorney work product or (B) any other material or information if the court finds that its disclosure is not constitutionally required and would entail a substantial risk of harm to any person that outweighs the interest in disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The Court of Appeals has explained the underlying policies of the discovery rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>We have often stated that the scope of pretrial disclosure requirements under Maryland Rule 4-268 must be defined in light of the underlying policies of the rule____Inherent benefits of discovery include providing adequate information to both parties to facilitate informed pleas, ensuring thorough and effective cross-examination, and expediting the trial process by diminishing the need for continuances to deal with unfamiliar information presented at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\"><em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 172, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision whether a party is required to disclose information, we note that \u201c[discovery questions generally \u2018involve a very broad discretion that is to be exercised by the trial courts. Their determinations will be disturbed on appellate review only if there is an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cole v. State, </em>378 Md. 42, 55, 835 A.2d 600 (2003) (quoting <em>North River Ins. Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 34, 47, 680 A.2d 480 (1996)). Factual findings of the trial court will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous, but the question whether a discovery violation occurred under the Maryland Rules is reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 55-56, 835 A.2d 600. Where a discovery rule has been violated, the remedy is \u201cin the first instance, within the sound discretion of the trial judge. The exercise of that discretion includes evaluating whether a discovery violation has caused prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 680 A.2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Here, the circuit court properly determined that the defense violated Rule 4-263(e)(6) by refusing to provide the recordings. Contrary to appellant\u2019s claims on appeal, the record shows that appellant intended to use the statements of Mr. Jordan and Ms. Wilson if the witnesses testified to something different from what was stated in the recordings. <em>See State v. Young, </em>94 Or.App. 683, 767 P.2d 90, 93 (1989) (\u201cif defense counsel, even though not certain, can \u2018reasonably predict\u2019 that she will use certain exhibits to impeach a State\u2019s witness, she must give timely discovery to the prosecutor\u201d); <em>State v. Dunivin, </em>65 Wash.App. 728, 829 P.2d 799, 801-02 (a prosecutor \u201cintends to use\u201d a document for purpose of the discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>rule where the State is \u201caware of the document and there is a reasonable possibility that the document will be used during any phase of the trial\u201d), <em>review denied, </em>120 Wash.2d 1016, 844 P.2d 436 (1992). Thus, the trial court properly exercised its discretion to review the recordings <em>in camera </em>and then to order that the statements be disclosed to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Work Product</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We also agree with the trial court that the statements were not protected from disclosure under the work product doctrine. The work product doctrine \u201cprotects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation from disclosure.\u201d <em>Blair v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 571, 607, 747 A.2d 702 (2000). <em>Accord E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 407, 718 A.2d 1129 (1998). There are two categories of attorney work product, fact and opinion, included in this doctrine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u201cFact work product generally consists of \u2018materials gathered by counsel (or at counsel\u2019s instructions) in preparation of trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blair, </em>130 Md.App. at 607, 747 A.2d 702 (quoting Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 904(A) (3d ed. 1999)). A witness\u2019 statement generally is considered fact work product. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 747 A.2d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Opinion work product concerns the attorney\u2019s mental processes. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 747 A.2d 702. Although both fact and opinion work product generally are not discoverable, opinion work product \u201c \u2018is almost always completely protected [from] disclosure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 747 A.2d 702 (quoting <em>Forma-Pack, </em>351 Md. at 408, 718 A.2d 1129). By contrast, \u201c \u2018as the work product of the attorney becomes less a matter of creative legal thought and more a mere recognition of observed fact, the work product becomes increasingly susceptible to discovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Duplan Carp. v. Peering Milliken, Inc., </em>397 F.Supp. 1146, 1200 (D.S.C.1974)). Thus, fact work product may be subject to disclosure. <em>See Morris v. State, </em>59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Md.App. 659, 669, 477 A.2d 1206 (1984) (the doctrine \u201cwas never intended to be an evidentiary privilege\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Here, the circuit court, after listening to the recordings, found that the statements of Mr. Jordan and Ms. Wilson to appellant\u2019s defense investigator were fact work product. The court stated, and appellant does not dispute, that the recordings did not reveal the creative thought processes or mental impressions of counsel, but rather, they conveyed only the verbatim factual content of the witnesses\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Other states addressing similar situations have determined that such statements from witnesses are not protected from disclosure under the work product doctrine. <em>See People v. Lego, </em>116 Ill.2d 323, 107 Ill.Dec. 647, 507 N.E.2d 800, 805 (1987) (order compelling defense to produce tape recordings made by defendant\u2019s investigators of State witnesses did not violate work product rule because \u201c[t]he verbatim statements of witnesses obtained by the investigator here do not fall within the scope of protection afforded by the rule\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 902, 109 S.Ct. 251, 102 L.Ed.2d 240 (1988); <em>State v. Culkin, </em>791 S.W.2d 803, 811 (Mo.Ct.App.1990) (rejecting claim that notes of interview between defense counsel and a State\u2019s witness constituted work product because they did not include \u201copinions, theories or conclusions\u201d of attorney); <em>People v. Perez, </em>171 Misc.2d 75, 653 N.Y.S.2d 527, 529 (Sup.Ct.1996) (tapes of defense interviews of State\u2019s witnesses not work product, noting that recorded interviews \u201care unlikely to contain opinions, theories or conclusions of defense counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We agree with this analysis. Disclosure of a defense investigator\u2019s recorded statement of the State\u2019s witness, which contains only the verbatim statements of the witness, does not violate the work product doctrine. The circuit court\u2019s decision, to direct disclosure of the recordings after its <em>in camera </em>review, was not erroneous and does not entitle appellant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Appellant next challenges the admission of two prior statements made by Mr. Jordan and Ms. Wilson, Mr. Jordan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>statement to the police and Ms. Wilson\u2019s statement to the defense investigator. He contends that the State failed to lay the proper foundation under Maryland Rule 5-613 to impeach the witnesses with the prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The State disagrees. It argues that Maryland Rule 5-613, which governs the use of prior inconsistent statements when offered to impeach a witness\u2019 testimony, was inapplicable here because the statements were offered pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(a), which pertains to the admission of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The general rule regarding the admissibility of evidence is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">A ruling on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Blair v.

E-J Enters., </em>189 Md.App. 310, 364, 984 A.2d 361 (2009) (quoting <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\"><em>Hajireen v. State, </em>203 Md.App. 537, 552, 39 A.3d 105 <em>cert. denied, </em>429 Md. 306, 55 A.3d 908 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">As appellant notes, Maryland Rule 5-613 permits impeachment of a witness\u2019 credibility by evidence that the witness made a prior statement that is inconsistent with his or her in-court testimony, but only if a sufficient foundation first has been established. The Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">(a) Examining witness concerning prior statement. A party examining a witness about a prior written or oral statement made by the witness need not show it to the witness or disclose its contents at that time, provided that before the end of the examination (1) the statement, if written, is disclosed to the witness and the parties, or if the statement is oral, the contents of the statement and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>circumstances under which it was made, including the persons to whom it was made, are disclosed to the witness and (2) the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">(b) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of witness. Unless the interests of justice otherwise require, extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible under this Rule (1) until the requirements of section (a) have been met and the witness has failed to admit having made the statement and (2) unless the statement concerns a non-collateral matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In <em>Hardison v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 225, 702 A.2d 444 (1997), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Maryland Rule 5-616 permits extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements to be used for the purpose of impeachment, in accordance with Maryland Rule 5-613(b). Under Rule 5-613(b), for extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent oral statement to be admissible for impeachment, the following foundation must be laid: 1) the contents of the statement and the circumstances under which it was made, including the person to whom it was made, must have been disclosed to the witness during his trial testimony; 2) the witness must have been given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement; 3) the witness must have failed to admit having made the statement; and 4) the statement must concern a noncollateral matter. Before the requirements of Rule 5-613(b) come into play, however, the prior statement of the witness must be established as inconsistent with his trial testimony. <em>See Stevenson v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 715, 721, 619 A.2d 155, 158 (1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARF\"><em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 702 A.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">These foundational requirements, however, apply only when the prior inconsistent statement is offered to impeach. As this Court indicated in <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 311, 322-23, 827 A.2d 124, <em>cert. denied, </em>377 Md. 276, 833 A.2d 32 (2003), when extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is offered as substantive evidence, Maryland Rule 5-802.1 controls. We explained that Rule 5-802.1 \u201cdoes not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>contain the same foundational requirements as Rule 5-613.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 827 A.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Maryland Rule 5-802.1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">(a) A statement that is inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, if the statement was (1) given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; (2) reduced to writing and signed by the declarant; or (3) recorded in substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Here, the prior statements, which were recorded by electronic means, met the requirement of this rule. Appellant does not contend otherwise. Rather, he argues only that the foundational elements of Rule 5\u2014613(b) were not satisfied. Because the statements were admissible as substantive evidence, however, Rule 5-613(b), regarding admissibility as impeachment, is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Appellant next asserts that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of other crimes, specifically, evidence that appellant had charges pending against him relating to an undercover drug buy involving the victim and Mr. Brown. The State disagrees, arguing that the court properly admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">At the motions hearing, the State proffered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">The State would like to move into evidence that on November 15th, 2007 in the 3600 block of Woodlawn Avenue the Defendant, Charles Thomas unlawfully engaged in a conspiracy with the victim in this case Alvin Alston and another man, Marvin Brown Jr .... to distribute heroin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>That all three men were indicted on this and later charges by a grand jury for the city of Baltimore.... And that these charges were still pending against all three of those Defendants at the time of Mr. Alston\u2019s murder on September 13th, 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The State asserted that evidence of these other crimes was specially relevant to establish motive, intent, and identity in this case, explaining that the State\u2019s theory was that appellant killed Mr. Alston because Mr. Alston \u201crefused to take the charge.\u201d The State\u2019s proffer continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">It\u2019s the State\u2019s proffer that the three Defendant[s] in that narcotics case were offered individual pleas. The plea offer to Mr. Thomas was a plea for suspended sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">The plea offer to Mr. Brown was jail time and the plea offer to the victim in this case, Mr. Alston was also jail time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">At the time of their arrest, which was on the same date at the same time, all three men were given bail and all three men made bail and were released from custody pending trial. So there was a series of postponements in this case where all three of the co-defendants were on bail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">However, unfortunately for Mr. Brown, the third co-defendant in that narcotics case, Mr. Brown had a violation of probation warrant issued as a result of this arrest. And although it wasn\u2019t served for almost a year, he was eventually locked up and was awaiting a no bail hearing on his violation of probation. And so was in jail as these cases continued to come up. Now Mr. Brown obviously was going to jail in any event. Mr. Alvin Alston again was offered jail time, but was on the street. And Mr. Thomas was offered a suspended sentence. And so, if he went to trial\u2014and the State was refusing to sever the cases\u2014Mr. Brown faced a significantly long jail time or jail term because he was facing felony narcotics cases. So the State would proffer that the motive in this case is to get rid of Mr. Alston so that the State\u2019s case either falls apart or that they could now accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the pleas that Mr. Brown and Mr. Thomas were apparently going to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The State argued the evidence was specially relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">As you will hear, the State\u2019s evidence will show that Mr. Alston was gunned down at about noon on a Sunday in September of 2009 by a gunman. There was no robbery attempt, no argument, no fight. He was approached and shot and killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">This evidence would also be offered, Your Honor, to show intent that it wasn\u2019t enough to hurt Mr. Alston in this case. That would not have done Mr. Thomas any good. Mr. Thomas had to do away with Mr. Alston in order for him to stay out of jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">And finally, Your Honor, the State has a statement that was taken from Mr. Thomas at the time of his arrest on these cases. And in that statement the Defendant says that he had no reason to kill Mr. Alston. And so this evidence would be probative to whether he did in fact have an intent to kill Mr. Alvin Alston.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The State contended that its evidence was clear and convincing, informing the court that the court records, the testimony of the prosecuting attorney in the narcotics case, and the audio and video recording of that narcotics transaction involving appellant, Mr. Alston, and Mr. Brown, would show appellant\u2019s involvement in that other crime. The State also argued that the probative value of this evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">[Tjhis is so much a part and parcel of the State\u2019s case and this homicide that absent this evidence the jury will see this in a vacuum. They\u2019ll have no history. They\u2019ll have no understanding if there was or was not any relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">The State\u2019s witnesses in the case do not know the participants. And so, there\u2019s no background other than this information that the State would offer as identity and motive information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Defense counsel argued that the evidence did not establish motive in this case, asserting that, because the prior charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>originated in 2007, the evidence was \u201ctoo remote,\u201d and he further argued that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial. With respect to the remoteness argument, the prosecutor clarified that the drug case had been postponed on September 10, 2009, and Mr. Alston was murdered three days later, on September 13, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">At the conclusion of the motions hearing, the court stated that it was \u201csatisfied that the evidence in this case certainly goes to motive and could quite arguably go to identity.\u201d It also found that the other crimes evidence was clear and convincing under the second step of the other crimes analysis. Finally, the court determined that the probative value substantially outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice. The court stated: \u201cI have done the balancing analysis and I\u2019m satisfied that any prejudicial value in this case is outweighed by its probative value. I\u2019m satisfied further that there is a genuine necessity in this case to\u2014for the evidence. Accordingly it will be admitted.\u201d As explained below, we perceive no error in the court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">To determine the admissibility of the other crimes evidence, the court must engage in a three-step analysis. <em>Hurst v. State, </em>400 Md. 397, 407, 929 A.2d 157 (2007) (citing <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 634-35, 552 A.2d 896 (1989)). First, the evidence must fall within one of the exceptions listed in Rule 5-404(b), or otherwise have special relevance to some contested issue in the case. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 74, 84, 955 A.2d 802 (citing <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d 896), <em>cert. granted, </em>406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 371 (2008). The determination of whether evidence has special relevance is a legal determination that does not involve any exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 489, 947 A.2d 519 (2008) (citing <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 317, 718 A.2d 588 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">After determining whether the contested evidence falls within an exception to the general bar on the use of other crimes evidence, the court must find that the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>convincing evidence. <em>Henry v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 146, 168, 964 A.2d 678 (2009) (quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d 896), <em>(aff'd on other grounds, </em>419 Md. 588, 19 A.3d 944 (2011). This Court \u201cwill review this decision to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 635, 552 A.2d 896. In conducting this review on appeal, \u201cwe look \u2018only at the legal question of whether there was some competent evidence which, if believed, could persuade the fact finder as to the existence of the fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henry, </em>184 Md.App. at 168-69, 964 A.2d 678 (quoting <em>Emory v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 585, 622, 647 A.2d 1243 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">If that requirement is met, the trial court then must weigh the necessity for and probative value of the other crimes evidence against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 964 A.2d 678. The trial court\u2019s conclusion to admit or deny this evidence based on its probative value will be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 641, 552 A.2d 896 (\u201cA decision to admit other crimes evidence which is clearly incorrect \u2018on this question of balancing probative value against danger of prejudice will be corrected on appeal as an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Brafman v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 465, 474, 381 A.2d 687 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Here, we agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that the evidence of appellant\u2019s involvement in the prior narcotics activity with the victim was specially relevant to establish motive. <em>See Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 554, 693 A.2d 781 (1997) (\u201c[M]otive is one of the \u2018other purposes\u2019 that will overcome the presumption of exclusion that pertains to \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence\u201d). As the State explains in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASs\">[Appellant] and [Mr.] Alston had been arrested and charged with engaging in a drug conspiracy and [appellant\u2019s] ability to take advantage of a plea offer that included a suspended sentence, rather than facing up to 40 years[ ] imprisonment, was dependent upon [Mr.] Alston\u2019s agreement to also enter a guilty plea and serve jail time. [Mr.] Alston, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>was not \u201ctaking the charge,\u201d as evidenced by the numerous postponements in the case. Just three days after the last postponement, [appellant] killed [Mr.] Alston in an execution-style shooting. From this evidence, an inference could be drawn that [appellant\u2019s] motive to murder [Mr.] Alston was to get him \u201cout of the picture\u201d so that [appellant] would not have to serve any time on the other crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence was too remote in time is devoid of merit. Although the crime occurred in 2007, the case was still pending, with the last postponement occurring three days prior to the murder. The evidence was relevant to show appellant\u2019s motive to kill, i.e., whether appellant decided, as the prosecutor argued in closing argument, to \u201csacrifice the life of Alvin Alston to save his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Turning to the next step of the other crimes analysis, the State contended that its evidence was clear and convincing, informing the court that the court records, the testimony of the prosecuting attorney in the narcotics case, and the audio and video recording of that narcotics transaction involving appellant, Mr. Alston and Mr. Brown, would show appellant\u2019s involvement in that other crime. Appellant does not contest the court\u2019s finding that there was clear and convincing evidence of the other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Thus, we turn to the last prong of the analysis, whether the probative value of the prior narcotics case outweighed any undue prejudice. As the prosecution argued, there was little explanation why Mr. Alston was murdered absent the challenged evidence, and therefore, the evidence was of considerable probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">With respect to balancing the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice, this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">This final balancing between probative value and unfair prejudice is something that is entrusted to the wide discretion of the trial judge. The appellate standard of review, therefore, is the highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. The fact that we might have struck the balance otherwise is beside the point. We know of no case where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>trial judge was ever held to have abused his discretion in this final weighing process. As a practical matter, that will almost never be held to have occurred. A properly disciplined appellate court will not reverse an exercise of discretion because it thinks the trial judge\u2019s decision was wrong. That would be substituting its judgment for that of the trial court, which is inappropriate if not forbidden. Reversal should be reserved for those rare and bizarre exercises of discretion that are, in the judgment of the appellate court, not only wrong but flagrantly and outrageously so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><em>Oesby v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 144, 167-68, 788 A.2d 662, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 181, 798 A.2d 553 (2002). There was no abuse of discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the trial court erred in not suppressing the pre-trial identifications that Mr. Jordan and Ms. Wilson made from the photographic arrays. In support, he asserts that the witnesses were coerced into making their identifications and they subsequently disavowed these identifications of appellant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The State argues that the court properly denied the motion to suppress. It contends that the identifications were not suggestive and that any disavowal by the witnesses of their out-of-court identifications properly was left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">On September 30, 2009, Mr. Jordan was asked to respond to the Baltimore City Police Department, where he met with Detective Cruz and Detective Nicholson. Mr. Jordan testified that he was detained in a cell for one to two hours and then shown a photographic array. He initially did not identify anyone, but eventually, he picked out a photo \u201cjust to get out the police department.\u201d Mr. Jordan maintained that he did not see anyone\u2019s \u201cfacial\u201d during the incident, and he claimed that the police would have detained him if he did not pick out someone in the array. Mr. Jordan agreed that he wrote on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the photo he selected: \u201cOn the corner of Reisterstown and Coldspring I witnessed that young man shot Alvin ... two times.\u201d He testified, however, that he could not say if that same person was in court at the time of the motions hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">On cross-examination, Mr. Jordan confirmed that Detective Cruz never informed him that the police had a suspect or that he wanted Mr. Jordan to identify someone. Mr. Jordan agreed that all the men in the array were African-American, had similar appearances, and that no one of the pictures stood out from the rest. Only two police officers were with him at the time he made the identification, and he was not handcuffed at any time. After making the identification, Mr. Jordan went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Detective Cruz testified that he met Mr. Jordan at the homicide office at approximately 12:30 p.m. on September 30, 2009. He showed Mr. Jordan a photographic array involving the murder of Mr. Alston. Appellant\u2019s photograph was in the array, and no other suspects were included.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Detective Cruz testified that the array included six African-American males, all with similar characteristics. Neither he, nor Detective Nicholson, told Mr. Jordan who to pick. They did not point to any suspect and did not tell Mr. Jordan that they had a picture of appellant. Detective Cruz denied marking the photographs in any way to suggest who Mr. Jordan should pick. Detective Cruz agreed that Mr. Jordan did not pick out a photograph immediately, noting that Mr. Jordan was \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cconcerned for his safety.\u201d Subsequently, however, Mr. Jordan picked out appellant\u2019s photograph, and he wrote a statement on the back of the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Detective Nicholson corroborated Detective Cruz\u2019s testimony at the motions hearing. Mr. Jordan waited in a witness waiting room for an hour to an hour and a half before Detective Cruz arrived at the police station. After Detective Cruz arrived, and they showed Mr. Jordan the array in an interview room, Mr. Jordan picked out appellant\u2019s photograph within \u201c[a] few seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Detective Nicholson did not tell Mr. Jordan who to pick out, and he did not tell him that a suspect was included in the array. Mr. Jordan was never handcuffed, nor placed in a detention cell, and he left of his own volition after speaking with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Ms. Wilson testified that, on November 23, 2009, she was told to come to the police station to view an array or else \u201cI would be arrested.\u201d Ms. Wilson told the police that she was \u201cpissed\u201d because it was her daughter\u2019s birthday, and she did not want to assist the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">When Ms. Wilson was shown the array at the police station, she initially identified two separate photographs, was told \u201cno\u201d by one of the detectives and asked to look again. Ms. Wilson then picked out appellant\u2019s photograph, testifying that she identified him because he \u201cwas there that day.\u201d When asked if the third person she picked was the shooter, Ms. Wilson testified that she said \u201cyes\u201d because she \u201cwas just pissed at that point and I was ready to leave.\u201d When asked during the motions hearing why she picked this individual, Ms. Wilson testified: \u201cI remembered his face being there that day standing next to the victim. That\u2019s why I picked him.\u201d Ms. Wilson agreed, however, that she signed the array and wrote: \u201cI saw this man shot the victim in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Detective Cruz was recalled, and he testified that the array was shown to Ms. Wilson in November due to scheduling issues. Ms. Wilson arrived at the police station in her own vehicle and was accompanied by two of her children. Detective Cruz interviewed Ms. Wilson with Detective Sydnor. During the showing of the array, Ms. Wilson appeared \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cconcerned about her safety.\u201d Ms. Wilson never informed the police that she had a child\u2019s birthday party scheduled at the time. Detective Cruz agreed, however, that Ms. Wilson did not \u201cwant to be in the police station.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Detective Cruz did not force Ms. Wilson to look at any photographs, did not tell Ms. Wilson who to pick out, and he did not threaten her. He denied telling Ms. Wilson that the array included possible suspects, testifying: \u201cI just told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>that we had some photos that we wanted her to look at.\u201d Ms. Wilson made an identification \u201crelatively quick,\u201d within \u201c30 seconds or so.\u201d Ms. Wilson wrote a statement on the back of the array and did not express any desire to leave prior to making the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">After argument, the motions court denied the motion to suppress both Mr. Jordan\u2019s and Ms. Wilson\u2019s identifications. The court stated that the identification procedures were neither illegal nor impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">This Court has explained that the scope of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress an out-of-court identification is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">\u201cWe view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion, and will uphold the motions court\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous.

State, </em>85 Md.App. 165, 172, 582 A.2d 568 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>322 Md. 613, 589 A.2d 57 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Suggestiveness exists where the police, in effect, say to the witness: \u201cThis is the man.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>310 Md. at 577, 530 A.2d 743. If the out-of-court identification was not made under suggestive circumstances, the inquiry ends and the identification evidence is admissible. <em>Id. Accord Webster v. State, </em>299 Md. 581, 620, 474 A.2d 1305 (1984). <em>See also Wood v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 146, 160-61, 7 A.3d 1115 (2010) (appellate court does not reach any issue concerning reliability of the identification if the confrontation was not impermissibly suggestive), cer<em>t. denied, </em>418 Md. 192, 13 A.3d 800 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">If, however, the identification was tainted by suggestiveness, the inquiry proceeds to a second stage, in which the trial court assesses \u201cwhether, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was reliable.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>310 Md. at 577, 530 A.2d 743. <em>See also Conyers v. State, </em>115 Md.App. 114, 120, 691 A.2d 802 (\u201c[Reliability was never put forth by the Supreme Court as an additional ground for excluding an extrajudicial identification. It was, by diametric contrast, a severe limitation on such exclusion.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 371, 697 A.2d 111 (1997). The factors to be used in determining reliability include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201c(i) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">(ii) the witness\u2019 degree of attention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">(iii) the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">(iv) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">(v) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-11\"><em>Jones, </em>310 Md. at 578, 530 A.2d 743 (quoting <em>Webster v. State, </em>299 Md. 581, 607, 474 A.2d 1305 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Here, there was conflicting testimony about the identifications. Mr. Jordan claimed that he was detained for up to two hours, and initially, he did not identify anyone. He further claimed that the police suggested who he should pick out by moving a piece of paper over the array in an attempt to narrow down his selection. Mr. Jordan maintained that he did not see anyone\u2019s \u201cfacial,\u201d but eventually, he selected a photograph. In contrast, Detective Cruz testified that neither he, nor Detective Nicholson, pointed to any suspect, told Mr. Jordan that they had a picture of appellant, or marked the array in any way to suggest who Mr. Jordan should pick.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">With respect to Ms. Wilson\u2019s identification, she claimed that she was threatened with arrest if she did not come to the police station to make an identification. She also testified that she initially identified people in the array other than appellant and the police told her she was wrong. She stated that she picked out a photograph because she saw that individual at the scene of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Ms. Wilson\u2019s version of events, however, was contradicted by Detective Cruz, who testified that he did not tell her who to pick. He further stated that, after Ms. Wilson flipped over the array, she made an identification within \u201c[n]o more than 30 seconds or so, something like that. It was relatively quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The motions court, after considering the credibility of the witnesses, did not err in finding that the identification procedure was not impermissibly suggestive. We note that appellant does not argue that the array itself was impermissibly suggestive. Rather, he asserts that the motion to suppress should have been granted because the witnesses were detained and coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">Impermissibly suggestive police misbehavior, even assuming it to have been the case, which we do not, is not a category that embraces every variety of police misbehavior. We offer an extreme hypothetical simply to make the point. Even if it were to be assumed that the police dragged a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>witness screaming into the police station, rudely shoved her down in front of a \u201cmug\u201d book containing a thousand photographs, and threatened her that if she did not pick out one of them within the hour they would shoot her on the spot, such behavior would no doubt be improper. It would not, however, be impermissibly suggestive. To do something impermissibly suggestive is not to pressure or to browbeat a witness to make an identification but only to feed the witness clues as to which identification to make. THE SIN IS TO CONTAMINATE THE TEST BY SLIPPING THE ANSWER TO THE TESTEE. All other improprieties are beside the point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Conyers, </em>115 Md.App. at 121, 691 A.2d 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Even if the court believed that Mr. Jones was detained prior to his identification or that Ms. Wilson was threatened with arrest if she did not come to the station, that does not constitute impermissible suggestiveness. And the circuit court was entitled to credit Detective Cruz\u2019s testimony that there was no action by the police suggesting which photo to select. Under these circumstances, the circuit court did not err in finding that the pre-trial identifications were not impermissibly suggestive and in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
