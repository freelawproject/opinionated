Did the motions court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of a gunshot residue test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support the conviction for illegal possession of a regulated firearm where there was no testimony that the weapon came within the definition of a regulated firearm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">3. Did the trial court err in giving a flight instruction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Discerning neither error nor abuse of discretion, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">On November 5, 2010, at about 7:00 p.m., Jomel Fields was sitting in her car, parked in the driveway of a residence at 923 East Church Street in Salisbury, Wicomico County. While Fields was talking on the phone and waiting for her friend, Tyrell Holly, whom she had just dropped off at the house, two African-American men approached her car. They pulled open the car door, pressed their guns against her head, told Fields to end her phone call, and demanded she hand over her money.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">The men were attempting to remove her from the car when Holly exited the upstairs apartment, drawing their attention. At that time, Fields saw a police car on the adjoining block <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and hit her panic alarm. Startled by the alarm, the two assailants began shooting, first at the house, and then at the car. Fields sustained multiple gunshot wounds to her lower extremities and back as a result of the attack.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Fields was found a few moments after the shooting by Corporal Brian Whitman of the Salisbury Police Department. Whitman called for medical assistance, and questioned Fields to obtain a description of her assailants. Fields was unable to provide a detailed description because her attackers had held their guns to her temple, preventing her from turning her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Officers Ryan Mitchell and Timothy Robinson and Corporal Howard Drewer, all of the Salisbury Police Department, were responding to an unrelated complaint in the area at the time the shooting occurred. Mitchell and Robinson saw two men firing guns into the house at 923 East Church Street, and immediately proceeded to drive around the block to the residence in their separate vehicles. Approximately 30 seconds after observing the shooting, as Mitchell turned the corner onto Church Street, he saw a man walking away from the residence where the shooting had occurred. When Mitchell attempted to stop him, the man grabbed a weapon from where it had been concealed in his waistband and pointed it at the officer. Mitchell exited his car, moving to the rear with his gun drawn. The assailant fled, and Mitchell pursued him on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Robinson, who was in a car directly behind Mitchell, observed the assailant\u2019s actions. When the gunman fled, Robinson pursued him in his vehicle, observing as the gunman ran behind some buildings on Priscilla Street. A few moments later, Robinson observed Drewer pursuing and apprehending the assailant, and went to assist in the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Drewer was in the area of Priscilla Street when he heard the radio communications from Mitchell and Robinson regarding the fleeing assailant. Shortly thereafter, Drewer saw the gunman, who had been running across the road directly towards him \"with a gun in his hand, change direction to run into an adjacent field. Drewer pursued the gunman with his emergency equipment activated, repeatedly yelling over his vehicle\u2019s intercom for the man to stop. When the assailant continued to run, Drewer exited his vehicle and continued the pursuit on foot. The gunman lost his footing near the railroad tracks; when he got up, he turned to face Drewer with his hands raised over his head, the gun held in his right hand. At Drewer\u2019s order, the man tossed the gun about 15 feet to his right, where it was later recovered and preserved as evidence. The gunman was arrested and transported to the Salisbury Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">At trial, Mitchell, Robinson, and Drewer each identified appellant as the man they had pursued and arrested on November 5, 2010. Additionally, they each identified State\u2019s Exhibit 1 as the gun that was discarded by appellant at the time he was apprehended. Jomel Fields also testified that the gun identified as State\u2019s Exhibit 1 \u201clooked like\u201d the gun that was used to shoot her. The gun was admitted into evidence at trial without objection. Upon forensic examination, the gun recovered by Drewer could not be excluded as the weapon that fired some of the bullets that were recovered from the crime scene at 923 East Church Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">I. MOTION TO SUPPRESS RESULTS OF GUN SHOT RESIDUE TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A. <em>Issue Specific Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">After appellant was booked, Detective Thomas Hitty performed a gunshot residue test on appellant\u2019s hands. The swabs taken from appellant\u2019s hands were re-sealed into the gunshot residue kit and submitted to the Maryland Crime Lab for analysis. The gunshot residue kit was admitted into evidence at appellant\u2019s trial without objection. When tested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>particles consistent with gunshot residue were found to be present on the swab taken from appellant\u2019s left hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress the results of the gunshot residue (\u201cGSR\u201d) test. At the motions hearing, Hitty testified as the State\u2019s only witness, preliminarily recounting the circumstances surrounding the charged offenses and appellant\u2019s arrest. Hitty explained that a GSR kit consists of multiple small swabs that are rubbed on a suspect\u2019s hands and the webbing of the fingers to collect any chemical residue given off by a discharged firearm. The swabs are then sealed back into the kit and submitted to the crime lab for analysis. Hitty further testified that the chemical residue on a suspect\u2019s hands degrades \u201cin a short amount of time,\u201d and is easily destroyed or contaminated if the suspect perspires, washes or urinates on his hands, or rubs his hands on his clothing. Instructions in the GSR test kit and Maryland State Police guidelines recommend that a sample be collected within three hours after the suspected discharge of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">As to the timing of the GSR test, Hitty testified that within 45 minutes after appellant\u2019s arrest, he approached appellant in the booking area of the Salisbury Police Department. Hitty informed the court that after identifying himself to appellant, he rubbed appellant\u2019s hands with the swabs from the GSR kit. During the collection of the GSR sample, appellant indicated that \u201che wanted to make no statements without a lawyer present.\u201d Appellant also questioned whether Hitty had a warrant to conduct the GSR test. Otherwise, appellant did not verbally or physically resist Hitty\u2019s collection of the GSR samples. When Hitty finished swabbing appellant\u2019s hands, he left the holding cell without engaging in any additional conversation with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">After hearing the testimony of Hitty and the arguments of counsel, the motions court concluded that the collection of gunshot residue from appellant\u2019s hands was a non-invasive search justified by exigent circumstances, opining in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The most persuasive argument to me to deny the motion to suppress is the fact that the process is not invasive, unlike drawing blood from a suspected drunk driver or a body cavity search, or even reaching into someone\u2019s pants to withdraw something that\u2019s been secreted, such as CDS. Or even a buccal swab. This is less invasive than that. In fact, it\u2019s more like fingerprints. I don\u2019t believe a search warrant is required for the taking of fingerprints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">As to the exigency of the circumstances, the court credited Kitty\u2019s testimony regarding the several ways a defendant could contaminate or remove the residue from his or her hands while in custody. The court further noted that it would be unnecessarily burdensome for the police to have to closely monitor an arrestee to ensure that the evidence was not destroyed while they obtained a search warrant to collect the samples. On these bases, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the GSR test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">B. <em>Arguments of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Appellant contends that the GSR test constituted an unreasonable search and seizure; thus, he concludes, the motions court erred by denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, appellant asserts that in the absence of exigency\u2014given that more than two hours remained before the GSR test results would have been compromised due to the passage of time\u2014the failure of the police to obtain a warrant before collecting physical evidence from his body, without his consent, constituted an illegal search in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Appellant further asserts that the GSR test results should be characterized as an involuntary self-incriminating statement and, further, that he was denied the right to the presence of counsel while incriminating evidence was being collected from his body, in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The State responds that appellant failed to properly preserve his arguments regarding self-incrimination and deprivation of his right to counsel for appellate review, and that even if they were preserved, appellant\u2019s arguments on these points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>are without merit. Addressing the merits of appellant\u2019s preserved arguments, the State maintains that the warrantless intrusion upon appellant\u2019s person for the purpose of collecting GSR evidence was a properly limited search incident to appellant\u2019s lawful arrest and was further justified by the exigency of the situation presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">C. <em>Preservation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Initially, we consider whether appellant\u2019s arguments have been properly preserved for appellate review, as this Court \u201cordinarily will not consider any point or question \u2018unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u2019\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 216, 946 A.2d 456 (2008) (citations omitted); Md. Rule 8-131(a). The State, as previously noted, contends that appellant\u2019s arguments regarding his right to counsel have not been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">To preserve an assignment of error based on an evidentiary question, a party is required to bring its position to the attention of the trial court so that the court may pass upon any objection, and possibly correct any errors. <em>Robinson, </em>404 Md. at 216-17, 946 A.2d 456 (noting that such requirements serve the interest of fairness and judicial economy). The failure to raise a particular argument in support of a request to exclude evidence acts as a waiver of the argument for the purposes of appellate review. <em>See Stone v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 428, 445, 941 A.2d 1238 (2008) (holding that the failure to argue a particular theory at a suppression hearing waives the ability to argue that theory on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">At the suppression hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel did not invoke the protections of either the Fifth or Sixth Amendments as grounds for his motion to suppress. Indeed, when asked by the motions court for the basis of the motion, defense counsel responded that \u201cthe only issue that [h]e would present to the Court\u201d was \u201ca search of Mr. Jones for a GSR analysis.\u201d Allegations of an illegal search implicate a defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not the right against self-incrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>under the Fifth Amendment or the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Based on counsel\u2019s limited response below, the issue of Fifth or Sixth Amendment violations were not before the motions court. Therefore, we conclude that appellant waived his right to now argue that the collection of the GSR evidence infringed upon his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Even had appellant\u2019s arguments been properly preserved, we would conclude that he was not entitled to relief on these grounds. The protections of the Fifth Amendment prohibiting the admission of compelled statements or physical communications that are self-incriminatory do not apply to physical characteristics such as the giving of a blood sample, voice sample, or handwriting exemplar. <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 595-98, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990); <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 7, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973); <em>Gilbert v. California, 388 </em>U.S. 263, 266-67, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967). We agree with other jurisdictions that have considered this issue, concluding that \u201c[a GSR] test is a nontestimonial identification procedure \u2018comparable to handwriting exemplars, voice samples, photographs, and lineups.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Page, </em>169 N.C.App. 127, 609 S.E.2d 432, 436 (2005) (quoting <em>State v. Coplen, </em>138 N.C.App. 48, 530 S.E.2d 313, 318 (2000)); <em>U.S. v. Pettiford, </em>295 F.Supp.2d 552, 560 n. 10 (D.Md.2003) (\u201cA GSR test does not invoke the protections of the Fifth Amendment because it does not provide evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.\u201d). Indeed, appellant concedes that GSR evidence has been classified as nontestimonial evidence. Therefore, we are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that he was forced to make a self-incriminatory statement within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We also find to be unavailing appellant\u2019s arguments regarding his Sixth Amendment right to the presence of counsel while the GSR sample was collected. Absent a waiver, the Sixth Amendment prohibits the admission of a statement by a criminal defendant if the statement is made (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>outside the presence of legal counsel; (2) in response to interrogation; and (3) after the right to counsel has attached with respect to the charge being tried. <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 192, 729 A.2d 910 (1999). Once the right to counsel attaches, a criminal defendant is entitled to the presence of counsel at every \u201ccritical stage\u201d of his trial. <em>See Adams v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 469, 480-84, 995 A.2d 763 (2010) (discussing right to counsel). The GSR test in the instant case was performed after appellant\u2019s arrest, but before any charges or adversarial proceedings commenced. Further, we are not persuaded that the administration of a GSR test, a non-adversarial encounter for the purpose of collecting evidence, is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d at which appellant was entitled to the presence of counsel. Therefore, appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not yet attached and, thus, was not infringed by the collection of GSR evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Moreover, appellant does not contend, and the record does not indicate that the GSR test was conducted in conjunction with any interrogation by the police. Therefore, his rights under the protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment or <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), are likewise inapplicable. Other courts addressing this issue have come to similar conclusions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Odom, </em>303 N.C. 163, 277 S.E.2d 352, 355 (1981) (concluding that arrestee was not entitled to counsel during GSR test, relying on Supreme Court cases indicating that the collection of physical evidence, such as fingerprints, blood, clothing, and hair, does not constitute a critical stage of trial); <em>United States v. Love, </em>482 F.2d 213, 217 (5th Cir.1973) (holding that collection of physical evidence was not a critical stage during which arrestee was entitled to counsel because such tests \u201cinvolve[ ] none of the probing into an individuals\u2019 private life and thoughts that marks an interrogation or search.\u201d). For the foregoing reasons, even had appellant properly preserved his constitutional arguments, we would find that his rights were not violated by the circuit court\u2019s admission of the GSR test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>D. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We now consider appellant\u2019s argument that the warrantless seizure of the GSR evidence constituted an illegal search, requiring that the evidence must be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we consider only the evidence contained in the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 349, 958 A.2d 356 (2008); <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 82-83, 939 A.2d 689 (2008); <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 458, 475-76, 857 A.2d 590 (2004); <em>Mendes v. State, </em>146 Md.App. 23, 40, 806 A.2d 370 (2002). We do not consider the evidence that was admitted at trial. <em>Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 598, 605, 753 A.2d 556 (2000). We \u201cdo not engage in <em>de novo </em>fact-finding.\u201d <em>Haley v. State, </em>398 Md. 106, 131, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007). \u201cInstead, we \u2018extend great deference to the findings of the motions court as to first-level findings of fact and as to the credibility of witnesses, unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Padilla v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 210, 218, 949 A.2d 68, <em>cert. denied, </em>405 Md. 507, 954 A.2d 468 (2008) (quoting <em>Brown v. State, </em>397 Md. 89, 98, 916 A.2d 245 (2007)); <em>Gatewood, </em>158 Md.App. at 475-76, 857 A.2d 590; <em>Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 77, 92-93, 857 A.2d 65 (2004); <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In making our ruling, we \u201creview the evidence and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,\u201d in this case, the State. <em>Bost, </em>406 Md. at 349, 958 A.2d 356; <em>Gatewood, </em>158 Md.App. at 475-76, 857 A.2d 590. But, \u201c[w]e make our own independent appraisal as to whether a constitutional right has been violated by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Bost, </em>406 Md. at 349, 958 A.2d 356; <em>Gatewood, </em>158 Md.App. at 475-76, 857 A.2d 590. <em>See also Williams v. State, </em>372 Md. 386, 401, 813 A.2d 231 (2002) (stating that reviewing court makes \u201can independent, <em>de novo, </em>constitutional appraisal by applying the law to the facts presented in a particular case\u201d); <em>Nathan v. State, </em>370 Md. 648, 659, 805 A.2d 1086 (2002) (recognizing that, in review of a ruling upon a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>suppress, appellate courts consider facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">E. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Generally, a search conducted without a warrant supported by probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. <em>Belote v. State, </em>411 Md. 104, 112, 981 A.2d 1247 (2009); <em>Cherry v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 234, 240, 586 A.2d 70 (1991). Exceptions exist, however, for evidence that is collected in the course of a warrantless search that is conducted \u201cincident to a lawful custodial arrest,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and for evidence that is seized without a warrant due to \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Belote, </em>411 Md. at 112, 981 A.2d 1247 (citations omitted); <em>U.S. v. Pettiford, </em>295 F.Supp.2d 552, 560 (D.Md.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The parties have directed us to no Maryland appellate opinion, nor have we found any, addressing an assertion that the collection of GSR evidence constituted an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment, rendering the evidence inadmissible at trial. We find guidance in opinions of the Federal courts, which have consistently held that, so long as the search is supported by adequate probable cause, GSR evidence is admissible even without a valid search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">For example, in <em>U.S. v. Pettiford, </em>295 F.Supp.2d 552 (D.Md.2003), the defendant was apprehended after the police responded to the scene of a \u201croad rage\u201d shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 555-57. The police observed Pettiford only minutes after the shooting, in a location only a few blocks from where the incident had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>occurred, traveling in the direction the shooter reportedly was driving when he left the scene of the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 558. Pettiford matched the physical description of the shooter and was driving a car that matched descriptions of the shooter\u2019s car. <em>Id. </em>Also, the front passenger window of Pettiford\u2019s car was broken, with glass still falling to the ground, indicating that the damage had occurred recently. <em>Id. </em>Pettiford initially attempted to evade the police, but was quickly apprehended. <em>Id. </em>While questioning Pettiford, the police observed bullet holes in the driver\u2019s side door of his car. <em>Id. </em>at 559. Pettiford admitted that he was involved in the \u201croadrage\u201d incident, but claimed that he was only a victim, not a shooter. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">After the police seized his car and towed it away as evidence of the shooting, Pettiford voluntarily accompanied an officer to the police station where he submitted to a GSR test without objection. <em>Id. </em>at 556. Pettiford was then held at the police station for more than five hours before he was placed under arrest for his participation in the shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 555-57. Prior to trial, Pettiford moved to suppress the GSR evidence, arguing that it was collected without a warrant in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In its ruling on Pettiford\u2019s motion to suppress, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland first determined that the initial investigative stop of Pettiford was adequately supported by reasonable articulable suspicion, and that Pettiford\u2019s subsequent detention and arrest were based upon probable cause; therefore, Pettiford\u2019s arrest was legal. <em>Id. </em>at 558, 559. Considering Pettiford\u2019s argument that suppression of the GSR evidence was necessary, the Court concluded that Pettiford had consented to the collection of the GSR evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 560. The Court further opined, however, that even had Pettiford not consented, the evidence collected during the warrantless search would be admissible pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In support of its holding, the Court recounted the information that was known to the police at the time the GSR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>evidence was collected and concluded that the detective who conducted the search, \u201chad probable cause to believe that the GSR test would yield evidence that Pettiford had discharged a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court next noted testimony indicating that GSR evidence remains detectable on a person\u2019s hands for only a limited period of time after a shooting, and that it is easily destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61. The Court opined that delay to obtain a search warrant to conduct the GSR test increases a detainee\u2019s \u201copportunity to destroy the evidence by simply washing his hands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also observed that the GSR test required only the swabbing of Pettiford\u2019s hands, which constituted \u201conly a minimal intrusion\u201d upon his privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 561. Based upon its determinations, the <em>Pettiford </em>Court ultimately concluded that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless collection of the GSR evidence and, therefore, the evidence was admissible at Pettiford\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 561. <em>See also U.S. v. Bridges, </em>499 F.2d 179, 183-84 (7th Cir.1974) (finding no error in trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence that he had recently handled dynamite, based upon scientific testing of swabs taken from his hands without a warrant, opining that some tests \u201care such minor intrusions into or upon the \u2018integrity of an individual\u2019s person\u2019 that they are not, in the absence of a search warrant, unreasonable intrusions,\u201d and analogizing the swabbing of a suspect\u2019s hands to the collection of fingerprints or taking of photographs, neither of which require a warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Subsequent to <em>Pettiford, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1199, 126 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006), wherein it considered the trial court\u2019s admission of GSR evidence collected after the defendant was lawfully arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 796. The <em>Johnson </em>Court noted that \u201c[i]ncident to a lawful arrest, \u2018it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795 (quoting <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969)). Acknowledging that the presence of gun powder on Johnson\u2019s hands was relevant evidence of the charged offense that could easily be removed or destroyed, the Court opined that, so long as Johnson\u2019s arrest was valid, the GSR test was lawful and the admission of the results of the GSR test at his trial was not erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 795-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Analogizing GSR evidence to other substances that may be collected from a suspect\u2019s body by minimally invasive means, we find the decision of the Federal District Court of Maryland in <em>Pettiford, </em>and of the Fifth Circuit Court in <em>Johnson, </em>to be consistent with the earlier decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cupp v. Murphy, </em>412 U.S. 291, 93 S.Ct. 2000, 36 L.Ed.2d 900 (1973). Cupp\u2019s estranged wife had been strangled in her home. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 93 S.Ct. 2000. The police had probable cause to believe that Cupp was the person who had killed her. <em>Id. </em>at 293-94, 93 S.Ct. 2000. Cupp submitted voluntarily to an interview at the police station, at which time the officers observed a dark spot on Cupp\u2019s finger that appeared to be blood. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 93 S.Ct. 2000. Cupp refused when the police requested to take scrapings from under his fingernails. <em>Id. </em>Cupp was forcibly detained for a short time while the police collected the physical evidence from his hands. <em>Id. </em>The samples from Cupp\u2019s hands were later analyzed and found to contain traces of his wife\u2019s skin and blood cells and fabric from her nightgown. <em>Id. </em>The evidence was admitted at Cupp\u2019s trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On appeal, Cupp asserted the physical evidence was obtained without a warrant in violation of the protections afforded to him by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, prohibiting unreasonable searches. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>incident to an arrest supported by probable cause, police are permitted to conduct a warrantless search of the items or area within the immediate control of a detained suspect for the purpose of seizing any weapons or incriminating evidence that might otherwise be used or destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 295, 93 S.Ct. 2000 (citing <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 762-63, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969)). The Court opined that in light of the circumstances presented, \u201cthe very limited search\u201d was \u201cnecessary to preserve the highly evanescent evidence\u201d on Cupp\u2019s hands. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 93 S.Ct. 2000. On this basis, the Court concluded that the warrantless search did not violate the defendant\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and therefore, the results of scientific tests performed on the evidence collected from Cupp\u2019s hands was properly admitted at his trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Opinions of the appellate courts of our sister States are largely consistent with the Federal precedents discussed above, holding that the warrantless collection of GSR evidence from an individual whom the police have probable cause to believe has recently fired a gun in the course of committing a crime, does not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The limited intrusion on the individual required to collect GSR evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>often analyzed as a search incident to a legal arrest, or justified by exigent circumstances due to how easily GSR evidence can be destroyed through either intentional or unintentional actions. Both analyses are applicable to the facts presented in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Appellant does not assert that his arrest was not supported by adequate probable cause, nor that the collection of the GSR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>evidence was not contemporaneous with his arrest. Therefore, we conclude that the GSR evidence was properly collected in the course of a reasonable search incident to appellant\u2019s lawful arrest, for which no warrant was required. <em>See Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 795 (\u201cIncident to a lawful arrest, \u2018it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Alternately, we note that Kitty\u2019s testimony established that there were temporal and practical barriers that greatly decreased the feasibility of waiting to obtain a search warrant prior to collecting the GSR evidence from appellant\u2019s hands. Hitty\u2019s testimony emphasized that the GSR evidence is viable for only a few hours, and could have been easily destroyed either intentionally or unintentionally by appellant during the time taken to secure a search warrant. Hitty further indicated that the procedure used to collect the GSR evidence is noninvasive, requiring nothing more than the rubbing of a swab across appellant\u2019s hands. Considering all the circumstances, we agree with the suppression court\u2019s determination that exigent circumstances justified the limited invasion of appellant\u2019s privacy to collect the GSR evidence from his hands without delaying to obtain a warrant. <em>See Pettiford, </em>295 F.Supp.2d at 560-61 (where probable cause supported arrest and the evidence sought was highly evanescent, the limited intrusion of a search to collect GSR evidence was reasonable). We find no error in the motions court\u2019s analysis and ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">II. SUFFICIENCY\u2014ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF REGULATED FIREARM</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">A. <em>Issue Speci\u00f1c Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">At trial, the parties stipulated that appellant was prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm under Md.Code (2003), Public Safety (\u201cP.S.\u201d) \u00a7 5-133(b). To meet its burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>proving that the weapon used by appellant was a regulated firearm, the State presented the testimony of four witnesses to identify and describe the gun appellant was carrying on the night he was arrested. Fields, the victim, described the firearm as \u201clike a gun that you would see off of GI Joe, like a machine type thing.\u201d When shown State\u2019s Exhibit 1, Fields stated \u201cthat looks like the gun that shot me.\u201d Mitchell testified that he thought that appellant\u2019s gun was \u201ca Mack 10 or Tech 9,\u201d and that \u201c[appellant] had a handgun, a Mack 10 as [he] called it.\u201d Mitchell also identified State\u2019s Exhibit 1 as the weapon that appellant brandished during their confrontation. Robinson identified State\u2019s Exhibit 1 as \u201cthe weapon that was found in the area of where [appellant] was.\u201d Drewer testified that he observed appellant running with \u201cwhat [ ] looked like, an assault pistol in his hand.\u201d Corporal Drewer also identified State\u2019s Exhibit 1 as the weapon he saw in appellant\u2019s possession, which he recovered and processed as evidence after appellant was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Without objection, the gun that was recovered by the police following appellant\u2019s arrest was admitted into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 1. The trial court, in its instruction to the jury, defined the term \u201cregulated firearm\u201d that was relevant to the charged offense. During his closing argument, defense counsel conceded that appellant possessed the gun, a regulated firearm, on the night of the alleged crimes, stating, \u201cI can make deliberations very easy for you on ... count 8 ... possession of a regulated firearm, that\u2019s what he did.\u201d The jury was permitted to examine the gun after it was admitted into evidence and during their deliberations. Ultimately, the jury found appellant guilty of all of the charged offenses, including those alleging his use and possession of a regulated firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">B. <em>Arguments of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Appellant asserts that there was no evidence presented at his trial expressly indicating that the gun identified as State\u2019s Exhibit 1 fell within the definition of a regulated firearm under P.S. \u00a7 5-101(p). He contends that because the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>cutor failed to elicit an exact classification of the weapon, the State failed to sustain its burden of proof on this count and, therefore, reversal is required. The State disagrees, asserting that sufficient evidence was presented to allow a reasonable juror to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the weapon possessed by appellant was a regulated firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">C. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The often repeated test for sufficiency of the evidence is, \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bordley v.

We further decline to second-guess any reasonable inferences drawn by the fact-finder or to reweigh the fact-finder\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the evidence \u2018either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 then we will affirm the conviction.\u201d <em>Bible v.

P.S. \u00a7 5-101(n)(l); P.S. \u00a7 5-101(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The evidence presented at appellant\u2019s trial, which we view in the light most favorable to the State, established that appellant was prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm. The testimony of the victim and the arresting officers indicated that on the night of the shooting, appellant was observed to be in possession of the gun that was admitted into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 1. Appellant was also found to have gunshot residue on his hands following his arrest. The gun, which was entered into evidence was variously described as, \u201clike a gun that you would see off of GI Joe, like a machine type thing,\u201d \u201ca Mack 10 or Tech 9,\u201d \u201ca handgun,\u201d and \u201can assault pistol.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury, pursuant to P.S. \u00a7 5-101(p)(l), that \u201cany firearm with a barrel less than 16 inches in length\u201d is a handgun, and that \u201cany handgun is a regulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>firearm.\u201d The jury was also given an opportunity to examine the gun, and thus were able to determine for themselves that it met the definition of a regulated handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the recovered gun met the statutory definition of a regulated firearm. <em>See Nash v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 386, 406, 991 A.2d 831 (2010) (concluding that police officer\u2019s undisputed testimony that recovered gun was a \u201chandgun\u201d was sufficient to support conviction for illegal possession of a regulated firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">III. FLIGHT INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"Au4\">A. <em>Issue Specific Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The evidence revealed that police officers first observed appellant walking down the street, away from the scene of the shooting, with his head down. When Mitchell attempted to stop appellant, appellant stopped, then removed the gun he had concealed in his waistband, and pointed it at Mitchell. As Mitchell exited his car, moving to the back of the vehicle to obtain cover, appellant began to run away. He was pursued by Mitchell, and two other officers, and was eventually apprehended and placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The trial court provided the following instruction to the jury over the objection of defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">A person\u2019s flight or conduct analogous to flight immediately after the commission of a crime or after being accused of committing a crime is not enough by itself to establish guilt, but it is a fact that may be considered by you as evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">Flight under these circumstances may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with innocence. You must first decide whether there is evidence of flight. If you decide there is evidence of flight or conduct analogous to flight, you then must decide whether this flight shows a consciousness of guilt.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The jury ultimately found appellant to be guilty of all of the offenses with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">B. <em>Arguments of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Appellant asserts that the evidence failed to generate a flight instruction.

The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals has interpreted Rule 4-325(c) to require a trial court to provide an instruction requested by a party if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">(1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law; (2) the requested instruction is applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the requested instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in the jury instruction actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-10\"><em>Thompson v.

To be characterized as consciousness of guilt evidence, it is not necessary that the evidence conclusively establish a defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 682, 712, 899 A.2d 170 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>397 Md. 557, 919 A.2d 49 (2007) (citing <em>Thomas v.

Alternate explanations for a defendant\u2019s flight that may weaken the inference that the defendant\u2019s actions were attributable to guilt should be considered by the jury to inform their weighing of the evidence. <em>State v. Edison, </em>318 Md. 541, 549, 569 A.2d 657 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On this issue, appellant relies principally on <em>Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 901 A.2d 208 (2006). Thompson was arrested and charged with attempted first degree murder, first degree assault, possession of cocaine, and related charges. <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 901 A.2d 208. When approached by an officer following the crime, Thompson fled on his bicycle. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 901 A.2d 208. He was eventually apprehended and placed under arrest. <em>Id. </em>At the time of his arrest, Thompson was found to have 86 vials of cocaine on his person. <em>Id. </em>Prior to trial, the circuit court dismissed the drug charges against Thompson, and excluded all evidence of the drugs from trial. <em>Id. </em>at 295, 901 A.2d 208. At the conclusion of Thompson\u2019s trial, the court, over objection, provided a flight instruction substantially similar to the one given in the instant case. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 901 A.2d 208. The jury found Thompson guilty of assault and other associated crimes. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Thompson asserted that the trial court abused its discretion by providing the flight instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 901 A.2d 208. Thompson maintained that he ran from the police, not because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>guilty of the assault, but because he was in possession of a large amount of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 901 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In its analysis, the <em>Thompson </em>Court restated the test to determine whether consciousness of guilt evidence is sufficiently probative of guilt to support a flight instruction. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">[T]he probative value of flight evidence as circumstantial evidence of guilt depends upon the degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (1) from the defendant\u2019s behavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.... [A] flight instruction is improper unless the evidence is sufficient to furnish reasonable support for all four of the necessary inferences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 312, 901 A.2d 208 (quoting <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036, 1049, 1050 (5th Cir.1977)) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The <em>Thompson </em>Court focused much of its analysis on the third element of the above stated test. Quoting <em>Thomas v. State, </em>372 Md. 342, 812 A.2d 1050 (2002), the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFu\">Knowledge that the person is suspected of the charged crime is important because the value of the conduct lies in the culprit\u2019s knowledge that he or she has committed the charged offense and in his or her fear of apprehension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak5\"><em>Thompson, </em>393 Md. at 313, 901 A.2d 208 (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>372 Md. at 354, 812 A.2d 1050). The Court further quoted Thomas for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">[E]vidence of flight because of one crime cannot be considered on the trial of another and entirely different offense is apparent, as in such case the flight does not disclose any guilty conscience in regard to the offense in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">Thus many courts emphasize the importance of connecting a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt to a consciousness of guilt for the specific crime alleged. There must be an evidentiary basis, either direct or circumstantial, to connect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt to the particular crime charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Thomas, </em>372 Md. at 354-55, 812 A.2d 1050) (citations and footnote from <em>Thomas </em>omitted in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Ultimately, the <em>Thompson </em>Court concluded that, although the pattern flight instruction constituted a correct statement of Maryland law, <em>Id. </em>at 303, 901 A.2d 208, and the substance of the instruction was not covered in the other instructions that were given by the court, <em>Id. </em>at 308, 901 A.2d 208, the trial court abused its discretion by providing the flight instruction under the circumstances presented. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 901 A.2d 208. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">The gravamen of the issue is whether Mr. Thompson fled in an attempt to avoid apprehension for the crimes for which he was on trial. In the present case, the jury was not presented with evidence of what may have been an alternative and at least a cogent motive for Mr. Thompson\u2019s flight, specifically that drugs were found on his person. During his interview with police, Mr. Thompson asserted that he ran from them because he had drugs in his possession, which, according to the State, amounted to eighty-six vials of crack cocaine at the time of his arrest. He was in essence arrested <em>in flagrante delicto </em>with respect to the crime of possession of controlled dangerous substances. We find that this fact, which was known to all parties involved although not revealed to the jury, undermines the confidence by which the inference could be drawn that Mr. Thompson\u2019s flight was motivated by a consciousness of guilt with respect to the crimes for which he was on trial in the present case; it provides a foundation for the alternate, and equally reasonable, inference that Mr. Thompson fled due to the cocaine in his possession, an action a person in his position may have taken irrespective of whether he also shot and attempted to rob Mr. Gottesman. Mr. Thompson thus was placed in a difficult situation where he must either not object to the highly prejudicial evidence concerning his possession of a significant amount of cocaine being introduced to the jury to explain his flight (or perhaps forced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>make a Hobson\u2019s choice to introduce such evidence himself), or decline to explain his flight and risk that the jury would not infer an alternative explanation for his flight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 901 A.2d 208 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">As did Thompson, appellant maintains that the fact that he was walking down the street away from a house where a shooting had occurred only moments before, does not support a permissible inference that he was fleeing from the scene of the crime. Instead, appellant asserts, one could reasonably infer that he fled from the police because he did not want to be apprehended while carrying a regulated firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In our view, <em>Thompson </em>is distinguishable. Thompson was constrained from providing an alternative explanation for his flight, because to do so would place evidence of additional criminal acts before the jury, which could unduly influence the jury to his prejudice. <em>Thompson, </em>393 Md. at 314 n. 5, 901 A.2d 208. In the absence of an alternative explanation from Thompson for his flight, the flight instruction that was provided by the trial court was prejudicial, if not actively misleading to the jury regarding Thompson\u2019s possible reasons for fleeing from the police. <em>Id. </em>at 315, 901 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In the instant case, however, appellant\u2019s illegal possession of a regulated firearm was a charged offense, concerning which the jury heard substantial evidence throughout appellant\u2019s trial. There was no concern that the jury might be tainted or misled by evidence indicating that appellant fled because he was in possession of the gun rather than out of involvement in the shooting. <em>See id. </em>at 315, 901 A.2d 208 (\u201cWhere the defendant possesses an innocent explanation that does not risk prejudicing the jury against him, it would be expected that the defendant would present his purported reasons for his flight to the jury.\u201d). Indeed, twice during his closing statement, defense counsel made exactly that argument, proffering to the jury appellant\u2019s alternative reason for fleeing from the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Additionally, the jury instruction also emphasized that potentially innocent factors may motivate an individual\u2019s flight. The jury was directed that, if they found evidence of flight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>they must then decide if that evidence demonstrated a consciousness of guilt. Thus, we are persuaded that the instruction properly left to the jury the determination of whether appellant\u2019s action constituted flight, and if so, whether his flight was motivated by consciousness of his guilt for any of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The testimony of the various witnesses, as we have reviewed, constituted more than \u201csome evidence\u201d that appellant fled on the night he was arrested. <em>See Thomas, </em>372 Md. at 355, 812 A.2d 1050 (stating that either direct or circumstantial evidence may connect a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt to the crime charged; the requirement is only for \u201csome evidence\u201d to generate the instruction); <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990) (noting that the requirement that there be \u201csome evidence\u201d to generate an instruction does not establish a specific standard; \u201cIt calls for no more than what it says\u2014\u2018some\u2019, as that word is understood in common everyday usage.\u201d). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by providing the flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In sum, we find neither error nor abuse of discretion in the rulings of either the motions court or the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY AFFIRMED.
