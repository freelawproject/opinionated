H. Meloy, sitting in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, denying relief sought under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The applicant was tried on April 19, 1966, under an indictment charging him with housebreaking, grand larceny and rec\u00e9iving stolen goods. He was found guilty by a jury on the larceny count and was sentenced by the court to ten years imprisonment in the Maryland House of Correction. On appeal, this court found that the State\u2019s witness, Paulette Ann Kurtz, had been an accomplice to the crime, that her testimony was sufficiently corroborated and that the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were not so confusing as to be erroneous, and affirmed the conviction. <em>O\u2019Connor v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Applicant filed a petition for post conviction relief on November 27, 1967, contending that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">1. He was denied the right to effective assistance of trial counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">2. He was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel on appellate review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">3. There-was an illegal search of petitioner\u2019s residence and things seized incident thereto were illegally admitted in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\">4. Evidence found in the apartment of an accomplice, George Tullis, was illegally admitted at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAt\">5. Evidence and/or testimony given concerning George Tullis, deceased at the time of the trial, was inadmissible because he was not charged on the indictment as an accomplice and was not available for cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-15\">6. He was denied the right to an effective appeal because a full transcript was not made available to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-17\">7. He received an illegal sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment since the evidence showed that he was guilty only of petty larceny and not grand larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-19\">At the hearing on the petition, the-applicant raised three additional contentions, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-20\">8. The jury rendered ah improper verdict because petitioner could not be found guilty of larceny since he was acquitted of housebreaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-22\">9. The State\u2019s key witness, Paulette Ann Kurtz, gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>testimony at the trial against the petitioner under duress, a fact unknown at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">10. The State\u2019s key witness, Paulette Ann Kurtz, perjured herself at the trial because she had vowed to \u201cget even\u201d with petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In his memorandum opinion denying relief Judge Meloy concluded that all but applicant\u2019s second, sixth and ninth contentions had been waived under Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 645A(c) by failure to raise them on direct appeal. As to the remaining allegations, an evidentiary hearing was conducted by Judge Meloy, at the conclusion of which he held that none of the remaining contentions were meritorious. Specifically, with respect to applicant\u2019s sixth contention, Judge Meloy found that the claim was based upon the assertion that certain supplemental jury instructions were not included in the record forwarded to the Court of Special Appeals. Judge Meloy ruled, however, that the missing portion of the transcript did not prejudice applicant\u2019s appeal since, at the most, the supplemental instructions related to the inconsistency in finding a verdict of guilty on both the larceny and receiving counts. As the applicant was found guilty only on the larceny count, we agree that there was no prejudice to applicant by the failure to include the supplemental jury instructions in the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The lower court, in concluding that there was no merit to applicant\u2019s ninth contention (that Paulette Kurtz, the State\u2019s key witness, gave testimony at the trial under duress), heard testimony from several inmates at the Maryland Penitentiary to the effect that Miss Kurtz admitted to them that she had been forced to testify against the applicant at his trial. There was testimony, on the other hand, from a police officer and from applicant\u2019s trial counsel which indicated that Miss Kurtz had not testified under duress. Judge Meloy disbelieved applicant\u2019s witnesses and believed the State\u2019s witnesses and, accordingly, this being a matter of credibility, we see no error in the lower court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">With respect to applicant\u2019s second contention (that applicant\u2019s court-appointed appellate counsel was incompetent), the court held that petitioner offered no evidence at the hearing which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>even remotely suggested that counsel did not competently present his case to the Court of Special Appeals. The lower court concluded that the record demonstrated that the petitioner was competently represented on his direct appeal and concluded that the allegation was nothing more than a bare unsupported contention. We believe the court\u2019s conclusion to be essentially correct with the qualification hereinafter noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\n<em>The Allegation That Trial Counsel Was Incompetent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGv\">We think the lower court erred when it concluded that the petitioner\u2019s failure to- assert the incompetency of his trial counsel on appeal constituted a waiver of that contention under Section 645A(c) of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It has been repeatedly held that the allegation that trial counsel was incompetent need not be raised either at trial or on direct appeal in order to be available as a ground for relief under a first petition instituted under the Post Conviction Procedure Act. In other words, the failure to raise the contention at the trial or on appeal does not result in its waiver. See <em>Sample v. Warden, </em>6 Md. App. 103, and cases there cited. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Nor is the scope of the contention any longer limited under the Act to allegations of fraud or collusion on the part of defense counsel with with a prosecution official; neither is it necessary that there be objection or complaint made by the accused during the trial to preserve the point for post conviction review. See <em>Waller v. Director, </em>244 Md. 229; <em>Galloway v. Warden, 2 </em>Md. App. 467. We have consistently declined to consider the question of competency of trial counsel when raised for the first time on direct appeal for the reason, among others, that counsel has not been afforded an evidentiary opportunity to defend himself against the incompetency charge. See <em>Thompson v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 50; <em>Boswell v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 571; <em>Harris v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 408. Our refusal on direct appeal to determine the constitutional adequacy of trial counsel does not preclude the accused from a determination of the question under post conviction proceedings where the determination may be made on factual findings by the lower court upon a hearing at which both the accused and his trial counsel would be afforded full opportunity to offer evidence and be heard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that as to applicant\u2019s first contention the lower court improperly found a procedural waiver to exist under Section 645A(c) and, accordingly, it will be necessary that the case be remanded so that the lower court may properly determine the question on its merits. We point out that the test for determining the competency of trial counsel is no longer whether the representation was so deficient as to make a farce out of the proceedings, but whether, under all the circumstances of the particular case, counsel was so incompetent that the accused has not been afforded genuine and effective legal representation. <em>Reid v. Warden, </em>5 Md. App. 199; <em>Green v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\n<em>The Procedural Waiver of the Remaining Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALo2\">In holding that the applicant waived his third, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, and tenth contentions by failure to raise them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>on direct appeal, Judge Meloy found as a fact that the applicant set forth no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse the waiver. In his application for leave to appeal, applicant makes reference to a letter from his appellate counsel, the substance of which tends to indicate that the applicant wanted to raise certain contentions on direct appeal, but was prevented from doing so by his court appointed appellate counsel who suggested that such contentions need not be included among the grounds asserted on direct appeal, but could be raised on post conviction if the appeal failed. We cannot determine from this letter which contentions applicant wanted raised on direct appeal, but in any event the letter was not included in the record below and consequently is not properly before us at this time. It is nevertheless clear that with the exception of the claim that his trial counsel was incompetent, the other allegations (applicant\u2019s third, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, and tenth contentions) could properly be deemed waived under Section 645A(c) where no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d excusing the failure to raise them at trial or on direct appeal are set forth. Specifically, with reference to applicant\u2019s third contention\u2014that there was an illegal search and seizure of items found in his apartment\u2014failure to properly object at trial to the introduction of such evidence (or, if objected to, and the point is not raised on a subsequent appeal) operates to bar any review of the question under the Act where no special circumstances are shown to excuse the failure to raise the question at trial or on direct appeal. See <em>Robinson v. Warden, </em>5 Md. App. 68; <em>Archer v. Director, </em>1 Md. App. 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We see nothing in <em>Kaufman v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 812, compelling a change in the application of Maryland law governing the existence of procedural waivers, as explicated in <em>Jones v. Warden, 2 </em>Md. App. 343. If, on the other hand, applicant\u2019s appellate counsel was under the impression, and so advised the applicant, that he could raise the question of illegal search and seizure on post conviction, despite his failure to raise it on direct appeal, this may well be deemed by the post convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tion hearing judge to constitute \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse the waiver under Section 645A(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">As a remand of the case is necessary to determine the question of competency of trial counsel, the post conviction hearing judge should afford the applicant an opportunity to make a proper showing of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse the waiver of his third, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, and tenth contentions, so that they may be considered on their merits. In this connection, we note that in no event could the contention that the applicant is confined under an illegal sentence be disposed of on the ground that the contention was waived, since under Maryland Rule 764 the court may correct an illegal sentence \u201cat any time.\u201d It appears, however, that the applicant\u2019s claim that his sentence was illegal is, in reality, based on the insufficiency of evidence to prove grand larceny. If this is so, it is a mere allegation that the evidence was insufficient to support a grand larceny conviction and would not constitute a ground for relief under the Act. As to applicant\u2019s eighth contention, there is no legal basis to support applicant\u2019s conclusion that having been acquitted of housebreaking, he could not be convicted of grand larceny, since the doctrine of merger of offenses is applicable only to preclude multiple <em>convictions </em>on merged offenses. See <em>Tyler v. State, </em>5 Md. App, 158; <em>Stewart v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 565; <em>Lievers v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>Application \u00a1or leave to appeal granted; case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">.
