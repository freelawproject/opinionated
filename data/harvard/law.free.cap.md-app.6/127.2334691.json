Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 645-1 and Md. Rule BK46a. It must therefore be denied. <em>Davis v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The applicant alleges that his lawyer did not tell him that he had a right to apply for leave to appeal. There is no statute or Rule imposing the duty on a lawyer representing a petitioner under post conviction procedures to advise his client of the right to file an application for leave to appeal. Md. Rule 719b6 applies only to a direct appeal from a judgment of conviction and to a review of sentence under Rule 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
