Burch, Attorney General, </em>and <em>John C.

He contends on this appeal that the lower court erred in overruling his pretrial motion to suppress his confession and in thereafter permitting the confession to be received in evidence at the trial. More specifically, he urges that his written statement was inadmissible in evidence because the State failed to prove that he had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his constitutional right to remain silent and to have counsel to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">There was evidence adduced at the trial from which the trier of fact could find that T. J. Cooper, a migrant farm worker, was stabbed while in the living quarters provided him by the Adams Cannery, and that shortly thereafter he died of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>wounds; that State Trooper Charles M. Griffith arrived at the cannery at approximately 4:00 a.m., where he found appellant in a nearby shanty \u201cvery drunk\u201d and arrested him; that he searched appellant, removed a knife from his pocket and transported him to the State Police Barracks where he was placed in a cell; and that there was no conversation with him until the early afternoon when he awoke, ate a meal, and made a written statement to Sergeant Emil C. Myers that he had stabbed Cooper because Cooper had been \u201cpicking on me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">At the hearing on appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress his confession, appellant testified that he was 62 years old, had not advanced beyond the fourth grade in formal education, and at the time of the crime had been employed by the Adams Cannery as a migrant farm worker. He admitted drinking two pints of wine on the night Cooper was killed and that he had not been questioned until after he awoke later that day in a cell. He stated that when Sergeant Myers took him from his cell and began questioning him, he was \u201cfeeling pretty nervous at the time,\u201d and that the conversation began with Sergeant Myers informing him that Cooper had died and that he should \u201ctell him what happened.\u201d His attorney then asked him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201cQ. Did he say anything to you before he asked you to tell him what happened ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">Q.

Fred, did he mention something about a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">A. Well, he mentioned that after he\u2014shortly after he asked me about the\u2014to tell him what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">Q. Fred, are you sure he asked you before or after-wards? Didn\u2019t he mention something to you about a lawyer, and what not ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">A. He did mention something about a lawyer. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">Q. And asked you some questions ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">A.

Well, yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">Q. Did you understand that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">A.

I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Then, on cross-examination, appellant was further questioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-14\">\u201cQ. And after he told you that then he told you you had a right to a lawyer, isn\u2019t that right ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-15\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-16\">Q. And did you ask him for a lawyer ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-17\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-18\">Q. He told you, did he not, that if you wanted a lawyer but couldn\u2019t afford one that the State would furnish one at no cost to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-19\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-20\">Q. But you still didn\u2019t ask for one ? At that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-21\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-22\">\u25a0Q. Now he also told you you had a right to remain silent and not answer any questions, didn\u2019t he ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-23\">A. He might have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-24\">Q. He might have but you don\u2019t remember that. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-25\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-26\">Q. . . .too clearly. Now, he also told you that anything that you said would be used against you, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>could be used against you in a trial later on, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">Q. And he also said that if after you started answering questions you wanted a lawyer that you could have one at any time, didn\u2019t he ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">A. I don\u2019t know sir, he might have, but I don\u2019t remember it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">Q. You don\u2019t deny that he said that? You just don\u2019t remember is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">A. No sir, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">Q. Do you recall Sgt.

You don\u2019t remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-14\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-15\">Q. Do you deny that he asked you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-16\">A.

But he told you you had a right to remain silent and that anything you said could be used against you. Didn\u2019t he tell you that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-19\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-20\">Q. Well, didn\u2019t you understand that to mean that you had a right to remain silent, not to answer anything just as he had told you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-21\">A. No sir, I didn\u2019t know what that mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-22\">Q. I see. Now he also told you that you had a right to a lawyer. Did you know what that meant ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-23\">A. A right to a lawyer ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-24\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-25\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-26\">Q. And you understood, did you not, that a lawyer would be furnished you at no expense if you wanted one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-27\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Q. And you also understood, did not you, that you had the right to stop answering questions at any time that the Sergeant was asking questions of you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">A. No sir, I didn\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">Q. You didn\u2019t know that. Did you at any time ask for a lawyer ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">Q. Did you object to signing the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">A. Well, I had to do\u2014I thought I had to do what he asked me to do. He told me to sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">Q. Do you remember the Sergeant reading the statement back to you before you signed it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">Q. Was what he read back to you correct and accurate ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">A. I guess so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-14\">Q. If the statement as read back to you by Sergeant Myers was not correct in some part of it, if he put down something that you didn\u2019t say would you have spoken up and called that to his attention ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-15\">A. If I could\u2019ve remembered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-16\">Q. * * * The question was asked you, \u2018Do you understand\u2019, and you answered \u2018Yes sir, I do\u2019, and now you say that you didn\u2019t understand. Now my question is why would you first say at that time that you did understand, if in fact you didn\u2019t ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-17\">A. Well, I don\u2019t know what silent means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-18\">Q. You don\u2019t know what silent means ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-19\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-20\">Q. Well, did you ask Sgt. Myers what silent means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-21\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-22\">Q. When he asked you if you understood you said \u2018Yes\u2019, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-23\">A. Yes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-24\">At the conclusion of appellant\u2019s testimony, the defense produced as a witness Dr. William Bosma, a psychiatrist at Clif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ton T. Perkins Hospital, who, on three occasions immediately prior to trial, had examined appellant. He testified that appellant\u2019s intelligence was in the \u201cdull, average\u201d strata, and that while his vocabulary was \u201cvery poor\u201d in connection with anything but his work, he was \u201cextremely good with numbers\u201d; that he categorized appellant as a \u201cpassive character,\u201d one who would not oppose the expressed intentions of other persons, \u25a0and that this personality trait was such that appellant would answer questions asked of him in the affirmative regardless of whether he truly agreed with the responses; that appellant '\u201cwould say no if the statement was untrue but I think if certain pressure were applied, which I understand had not been, he would say yes\u201d; and that when he (Dr. Bosma) read the four-fold constitutional warnings printed at the beginning of the statement form to the appellant, the appellant did not understand the words \u201cabsolute,\u201d \u201csilent,\u201d \u201cstatement\u201d and \u201cto be \u25a0questioned.\u201d It was Dr. Bosma\u2019s opinion that the appellant did not comprehend the meaning of his constitutional warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The State then called Sergeant Myers as a witness, who stated that prior to questioning appellant concerning the crime, he informed him of the rights required by <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and was convinced that he understood them and desired that they be waived. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cA. I was doing it off the cuff but at the same time referring to the form because many times it would say \u2018we\u2019, and of course I was alone, I would have to say T, and for that reason I was more or less talking to him, but at the same time referring to these notes to make certain that I got each of them in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">Q. All right sir. Go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">A. I told him that if he did want to make a statement and did answer our questions, anything he did say would be used against him in a court of law. He also had a right to be alone with a lawyer and to talk to him and be advised by him before being questioned. After he talked to a lawyer he could also have him present during any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>during the taking of the statement, or any time that we talked with him. He was told if he was unable to afford a lawyer but he did want one before talking to us that a lawyer would be appointed to represent him at public expense, without cost to him. If he did decide to talk to me without a lawyer present, but during the questioning he wanted to stop and have a lawyer he had a right to do so and to say nothing more. He was told that he was not being promised anything to make a statement or to answer questions, and that no threats are or would be made against him to have him tell us anything. He was then asked if he understood what T just told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">Q. Well what were the words that you used ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">A. I asked him if he understood what I just told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">Q. And what was his reply?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">Q. Did he ask any questions of you at this stage ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">Q. Did he request an attorney ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">Q. Did he say that he didn\u2019t want to answer any further questions ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-15\">Q. Did he indicate to you that he wished to exercise his right to remain silent ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-16\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-17\">Q. Did you have any reason to feel one way or another whether\u2014as to whether he had or had not understood you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-18\">A. I\u2019ve always felt that he understood me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-19\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-20\">Q. What, if anything, was said by Anderson to cause you to have any question as to whether or not he\u2019d understood what you\u2019d said ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-21\">A. Before asking any questions concerning the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>death or the actual incident surrounding the death of Cooper he was asked several other preliminary questions. For instance, \u2018are you willing to make a voluntary statement after being advised your rights?\u2019 \u2018Do you understand that by making this statement that you are waiving the right you have not to talk to us, and to have a lawyer present?\u2019 \u2018Can you read and write?\u2019 \u2018How far did you go in school?\u2019 \u2018State your name, age and address.\u2019 All those questions were asked prior to the question concerning the actual incident. I realized that his intelligence was not even average in my judgment and so I carefully talked with him during the taking of the statement to be sure that he did understand me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">Q. What caused you to conclude that his intelligence was not average ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">A. His demeanor, the way he spoke coupled with the responses. He only went to the Fifth grade in school. He was very quiet, very cooperative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">Q. Well, what if any, special efforts did you make to try to communicate to him? To explain to him what his rights were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">A. Only by talking slowly, carefully with him, and trying not to give him the impression I was reading something rapidly. I talked with him on each question. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Upon conclusion of Sergeant Myer\u2019s testimony, the court denied appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress his confession, stating its reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">\u201cI feel that under the circumstances of this case that the Sergeant did everything that any person could reasonably do dealing with this Defendant to explain to him what his rights are, and the fact that he goes along and tells the police what happened\u2014until such time as the Courts take the position which they well may take, that statements just may not be used\u2014but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>until that time, until they\u2019re outlawed, it seems to me that under the Miranda ruling, and even with what the Court of Special Appeals has said, thus far, that in this case that this Defendant understood the situation and said he understood it, obviously he\u2019s going to say today he didn\u2019t understand it, * * *. I think in this case the officer was fair, considering this man\u2019s relatively high level of intelligence. I\u2019ve viewed people coming before the Court many of them in the 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s [I.Q.]. This man\u2019s in the 80\u2019s. Admittedly he can say he did not understand what the word statement means, or absolute, or what being questioned means, but he certainly must have understood that he could remain\u2014he didn\u2019t have to answer questions. The term \u2018remaining silent\u2019, he makes a point that he didn\u2019t understand what silence is, but when he\u2019s told he could answer questions or not answer questions, and he could stop anytime the questions were taking place, and ask for a lawyer, he had a right to have a lawyer present during all the questioning, that sort of thing I can\u2019t help but believe from his own demonstration of understanding normal simple English that he understood what was going on, that he wanted to tell them, and if he wanted to tell them why he ought to have a right to tell them * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Subsequently, at the trial Sergeant Myers testified before the jury that appellant was first questioned with no other persons present, in the Investigator\u2019s office at 12 :10 p.m. after he had been fed; that he identified himself and informed appellant that Cooper had died and that before asking him any questions he wanted to inform him of his rights; that he advised him of his four-fold <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201ctalking] to him very slowly and carefully,\u201d and \u201cat the same time referring to the form to make sure that I covered each and every one\u201d; that appellant responded that he understood the warnings, asked no questions and at no time requested an attorney or refused to be questioned; that he answered questions with a yes or no and if required to make an explanation in response to a question, \u201che <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>did make that explanation\u201d; and that he read the completed statement to appellant who signed it without question. Appellant\u2019s testimony was repetitious of that which he gave at the hearing on the motion to suppress and Dr. Bosnia's earlier testimony was stipulated into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The written confession was admitted in evidence over counsel\u2019s objection that appellant had not made <em>\u201ca </em>knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver of his constitutional safeguards prior to making this statement and therefore the statement is inadmissible as evidence.\u201d Photographs taken of the scene of the crime and the knife recovered from appellant\u2019s person at the time of his arrest were also admitted in evidence. Appellant then testified as to the circumstances of the crime, that Cooper had taunted him and that he stabbed Cooper when he thought that Cooper was going to hit him with a pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We think it clear from the evidence that the appellant was apprised of the complete panoply of warnings required under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>prior to his custodial interrogation. Appellant maintains that his mere statement that he understood the import and significance of those rights does not constitute an effective waiver thereof because in view of his limited intellect he was unable to intelligently comprehend the meaning of the rights which he allegedly waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\"><em>Miranda </em>makes clear at page 475 that if after the constitutional warnings required by that case have been given, custodial interrogation is undertaken without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, \u201ca heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel\u201d; and that no evidence obtained as a result of a custodial interrogation can be used against an accused unless and until the prosecution demonstrates a waiver of his constitutional rights within the meaning of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, a case which holds that waiver of a fundamental constitutional right is ordinarily \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,\u201d the determination of which \u201cmust depend in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d A valid waiver, however, \u201cwill not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained,\u201d <em>Miranda </em>at page 475; and in no event can the failure of the accused to ask for a lawyer constitute a waiver, <em>Miranda </em>at page 470. But, as pointed out in <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>385 F. 2d 375 (4th Cir.), an express statement by an accused undergoing custodial interrogation that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and nevertheless wanted to make a statement is not an essential link in the chain of proof of waiver. And the proper inquiry is not whether the accused made an intelligent decision in the sense that it was wise or smart to admit his participation in the crime, but whether his decision was made with the full understanding that he need say nothing at all and that he might then consult with a lawyer if he so desired. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>396 F. 2d 841 (4th Cir.). In <em>People v. Johnson, </em>450 P. 2d 865, the Supreme Court of California held that \u201cOnce the defendant has been informed of his rights, and indicates that he understands those rights, it would seem that his choosing to speak and not requesting a lawyer is sufficient evidence that he knows of his rights and chooses not to exercise them.\u201d In <em>Brown v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 313, we held that despite the fact that the evidence does not show an express waiver of the accused's right to remain silent and to consult with and/or have counsel present during the interrogation, nevertheless a valid constitutional waiver within the meaning of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, </em>can be found where the totality of the circumstances\u2014 the attendant facts of the case\u2014implicitly show that the accused voluntarily and intelligently relinquished his <em>Miranda </em>rights and made a statement. Thus, in <em>Miller v. State, </em>251 Md. 362, the defendant, having been afforded his full <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was asked prior to interrogation whether, in view of these warnings, he wanted to make a statement and he replied in the affirmative. The court there found that the accused had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights after careful and deliberate consideration, citing as attendant circumstances the fact that there was no allegation of mistreatment, the accused said he understood the warnings, and the interrogation was undertaken at the accused\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>request. In <em>Mullaney v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 248, the accused was given full <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked whether \u201chaving these rights in mind\u201d he wanted to talk to the police, in response to which the accused \u201cnodded his head in a yes position.\u201d While the accused did not immediately make a statement, he did so a short time thereafter, and we found an implied waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, observing by way of attendant circumstances that the accused indicated understanding of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, was twenty years old and a high school graduate, there was no evidence of mistreatment or of impaired intellectual endowments, and the accused had been caught red-handed in the act of committing the crime. See also <em>Delone Brown v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 564; <em>Minor v. State, 6 </em>Md. App. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In <em>State v. Kremens, </em>245 A. 2d 313, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, discussing the requirement of the waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, held it absurd to believe that that case requires a formal recitation by an individual that \u201cI do not wish to exercise my right to remain silent; I do not wish to exercise my right to an attorney.\u201d The court there said: (page 317)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201c* * * Any clear manifestation of a desire to waive is sufficient. The test is the showing of a knowing intent, not the utterance of a shibboleth. The criterion is not solely the language employed but a combination of that articulation and the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Cases tending to this view are now legion. In addition to <em>Hayes, Johnson, </em>and the Maryland cases, see <em>Keegan v. United States, </em>385 F. 2d 260 (9th Cir.); <em>Gonzales v. State, </em>429 S.W.2d 882 (Tex.) ; <em>State v. McKnight, </em>243 A. 2d 240 (N. J.) ; <em>State v. Wright, 444 P. 2d </em>912 <em>(Ore.); State v. Matt, </em>444 P. 2d 914 (Ore.) ; <em>Brisbon v. State, </em>201 So. 2d 832 (Fla.) ; <em>State v.

State, </em>204 So. 2d 836 (Ala.). Compare <em>Sullins v. United States, </em>389 F. 2d 985 (10th Cir.), and <em>People v. Anonymous, </em>294 N.Y.S. 2d 248 (N. Y.).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>In the present case, appellant admitted in effect that he understood that he had a right to have a lawyer but that he didn\u2019t ask for one because he thought \u201cany time would do.\u201d And while he also admitted that he was told he had a right to remain silent, he stated that he did not know what that meant, although he admitted telling Sergeant Myers that he said he understood his <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Sergeant Myers testified that from appellant\u2019s demeanor and responses to his questions, he realized that he was not of average intelligence. The record reveals a patient and painstaking effort on the part of Sergeant Myers to outline in a clear conversational tone the four-fold <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and also reveals that before questioning the appellant he asked him certain questions, including \u201c[A]re you willing to make a voluntary statement after being advised of your rights?\u201d and \u201cDo' you understand that by making this statement that you are waiving the right you have not to talk to us, and to have a lawyer present?\u201d Unfortunately, the testimony does not reveal what, if any, response appellant made to these specific questions. We think at the minimum, however, that there was evidence that appellant said he understood his rights and was afforded an opportunity to exercise them. Appellant was sixty-two years of age and had an I.Q. of 83-87, and while Dr. Bosnia testified that appellant did not understand the warnings, the trial judge, having had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, particularly including the appellant, and observing their demeanor, concluded that appellant did in fact understand the warnings; that he was not of such low intelligence that he didn\u2019t understand what was told to him by Sergeant Myers in \u201cnormal simple English\u201d and that, in making the statement, he fully understood his rights. There was no allegation of mistreatment by the police and no lengthy interrogation, the confession being given soon after interrogation was initiated. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court erred in rejecting Dr. Bosnia\u2019s testimony and concluding that appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. See Maryland Rule 1086. And while we have not considered appellant\u2019s express waiver of his constitutional rights contained in his written statement as substantive evidence of waiver (the statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>not introduced into evidence until after the issue had been decided by the trial judge), it does tend to show in explicit terms the existence of the waiver that we have found implicit on the facts and circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Brown v.
