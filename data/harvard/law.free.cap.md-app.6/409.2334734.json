S. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">In <em>Hall v. State, </em>233 Md. 378, 382 the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">\u201cThat the police may fingerprint one held in proper custody is no longer open to question. Many jurisdictions have so held in the face of objections under both the Fourth and Fifth Amendment provisions of the Federal Constitution. It has been the law of this State since 1909 when we decided <em>Downs v. Swann, </em>11 Md. 53 * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410A\">*410A</page-number>The appellant in <em>Hall </em>did not challenge this nor does the appellant here; it is still the law of this State. See <em>Hall v. Warden, </em>244 Md. <em>731.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In the instant case there was evidence on the issue of the legality of the arrest from which the lower court could properly find that the police had received a report of the crimes and a description of the felons. One of the officers receiving the report, leaving two officers to continue the investigation at the scene, left to search for the participants. He shortly returned and said he saw youths answering the description of the perpetrators in a bowling alley. He and Corporal Yorke Flynn went to the bowling alley. Flynn looked them over and accosted them, told them that a crime had been committed, that the clothing they wore answered the general description of the perpetrators and asked if they would come back to the scene. \u201cBut I advised them they didn\u2019t have to if they didn\u2019t want to. * * * If it is found that you are not involved you would be free to go if you want. As a matter of fact, you can go now if you wish * * * They agreed to go back with me. Of course they were not under arrest. I didn\u2019t search them or handcuff them or anything. They followed me out to the car. As we were walking out to the car I dropped back a little bit and as I did so July came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>up beside me and he dropped a gun on the ground. It was found to be a little starting gun, starting German gun.\u201d The officer recovered the gun and arrested July, the appellant. We state that Flynn arrested the appellant because we think it clear that from this point the appellant was under arrest. Flynn testified that the appellant got in the car, that had the appellant or his companion asked to get out of the car after the gun was dropped he would not have let them out and that the appellant was under arrest \u201cafter he dropped the gun\u201d. He did not tell him that he was then under arrest \u201cbut if he had wanted to go after he dropped the gun I wouldn\u2019t have let him go\u201d. He took them back to the scene of the crime, Detective James Fitzpatrick arrived and Flynn turned them over to him. Flynn then went into the house and later took them to the police station. Apparently Detective Fitzpatrick was not then aware of what had occurred in the presence of Flynn. He testified that he arrested them, under the impression that the appellant had not been arrested. He said, however, that the gun \u201cwas turned over to me that had been dropped by the Defendant Harold July\u201d. That Flynn did not tell the appellant he was under arrest at the time the gun was dropped was not material nor was the fact that Fitzpatrick may have again \u201carrested\u201d him. There is no formal ritual which must be observed to constitute an arrest. The appellant\u2019s liberty was restrained from the moment he dropped the gun and he was thereafter in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The rule is that a warrantless arrest is valid where an officer has probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor has been or is being committed in his presence or view, and that the arrestee is the misdemeanant. <em>Salmon v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 513, 522. Carrying a concealed weapon is a misdemeanor. Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36. When the appellant dropped the weapon, which had been unobserved by the officer until it was dropped, he had probable cause to believe that the appellant, in the officer\u2019s presence had been carrying it concealed. Thus the arrest was valid. <em>Ramsey v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 563; <em>Crosby v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 578. The arrest being valid, the appellant was in lawful custody at the time of the taking of his fingerprints, and they were properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We think it advisable to note that the Federal Constitution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination offers no protection against compulsion to submit to fingerprinting. It protects a person only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature. Compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of \u201creal or physical evidence\u201d does not violate it. Fingerprinting, photographing, measurements, speaking or writing for identification, appearing in court, assuming a stance, walking or making a particular gesture, for example, are \u201creal or physical evidence.\u201d <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U. S. 757, 760-765. Nor do we think that fingerprinting of an accused is <em>per se </em>a denial of due process of law. Even the obtaining of evidence by intrusions in the human body, as by the withdrawal of blood, (the obtaining of fingerprints is no such intrusion) when done by acceptable means and under proper circumstances, does not offend that \u201csense of justice\u201d of which the Supreme Court spoke in <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U. S. 165. <em>Breithaupt v. Abram, </em>352 U. S. 432. In <em>Schmerber, </em>at 760, the Court said that <em>Breithaup </em>\u201crequires the rejection of petitioner\u2019s due process argument.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We also point out that we do not reach the precise question of whether the taking of fingerprints of a suspect or accused is a search and seizure within the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. In <em>Hall v. State, supra, </em>at 382, the Court stated that if fingerprints were obtained when a person was illegally held, \u201c [t] his would raise a serious question as to whether the fingerprints were * * * illegal fruit inadmissible under the principles enumerated in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643,\u201d but it did not decide the question. In <em>Schmerber v. California, supra, </em>the Court made clear that \u201ccompulsory administration of a blood test * * * plainly involves the broadly conceived reach of a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment * * * Such testing procedures plainly constitute searches of \u2018persons\u2019, and depend antecedently upon seizures of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u2018persons\u2019 within the meaning of that Amendment.\u201d 384 U. S. 767. But bloodletting involves an intrusion into the human body-while fingerprinting does not. We do not think that the holding in <em>Schmerber </em>or its rationale compels a finding that fingerprinting is a search and seizure under the constitution. See <em>Simms v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 160, 172, note 12. Federal and state cases in other jurisdictions have not clearly decided the issue although the great majority hold that if the arrest was legal fingerprinting is proper. Generally the rationale of the opinions is that there is a general right of the authorities charged with the enforcement of the criminal law to employ fingerprinting as an appropriate means to identify criminals and to detect crime, which is consistent with the rationale of <em>Downs v. Swann, supra. </em>See <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>55 F. 2d 67 (2nd cir.); <em>United States v. Krapf, </em>285 F. 2d 647 (3rd cir.); <em>United States v. Iacullo, </em>226 F. 2d 788 (7th cir.); <em>Napolitano v. United States, </em>340 F. 2d 313 (1st cir.) ; <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>356 F. 2d 216 (2nd cir.) ; <em>Gentile v. Florida, </em>190 So. 2d 200 (Florida), cf. <em>Bynum v. United States, </em>262 F. 2d 465 (D.C.cir.). And see the case note entitled \u201cExcluding from Evidence Fingerprints Taken After an Unlawful Arrest\u201d, 69 Yale L. J. 432 (1960). We shall decide the question when it is squarely before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-15\">. The Juvenile Court waived jurisdiction on the burglary charge. The appellant was indicted with three other youths for the rape and with one other for the burglary. He was tried alone on the consolidated charges by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410A\">*410A</page-number>A motion to suppress evidence on the ground of an illegal arrest w-as made, heard and denied prior to trial. It did not expressly designate the fingerprints taken from the appellant; it alleged, among other things, that the arrest was illegal and that \u201ccertain incriminating items were illegally taken from the person of the defendant.\u201d Although Md. Rule 729f provides that if such motion is denied the objection of the accused to the evidence sought .to be suppressed shall be preserved on appeal even though no further objection be made to the introduction of such evidence at the trial, it appears from the record that counsel for the appellant here specifically stated \u201cno objection\u201d when the card containing the rolled fingerprints of the appellant was admitted in evidence at the trial. Objection to the evidence now challenged thus appears to have been waived in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\">. In <em>Hall v. Warden, </em>244 Md. 731 one of the contentions in the post conviction petition was that the admission of his fingerprints was a violation of due process of law. The Court considered it as finally litigated on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
