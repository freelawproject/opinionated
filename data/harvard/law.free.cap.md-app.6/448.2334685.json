Burch, Attorney General, Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>and <em>Vincent J. Femia, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b469-8\">Morton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYc\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The appellant, Gordon Lee Richardson, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of rape, committing a perverted sex act and burglary. He was sentenced by Judge Ralph W. Powers to serve twenty years on the rape conviction, five years on the perverted sex act conviction and twenty years on the burglary conviction, the latter two sentences to run concurrently with the sentence for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The victim, who was twenty-four years of age, unmarried and living alone in an apartment dwelling, testified that shortly prior to 6:00 a.m. on December 16, 1967, she awakened to find a man in her room, whom she identified at the trial as the appellant. She immediately screamed. He then approached her, placed his hand over her mouth and \u201cstarted pulling down my pajama bottoms, and I started fighting him and he hit me several times.\u201d He then got on the bed, placed his mouth \u201cin my vagina\u201d whereupon the victim hit the appellant on his head with a bowling tenpin which she had beside her bed. According to the victim, \u201cI started screaming because I realized I didn\u2019t knock him out and I was scared.\u201d The appellant then \u201cgot up and went to the bathroom and got a towel and was washing his head with it because it was bleeding. And he came back and I was trying to talk him into leaving * * He then went to the front door \u201cand I thought he was leaving, and then he said, \u2018Oh, no.\u2019 And then he came back.\u201d In response to the question what happened then, the victim replied: \u201cHe raped me.\u201d Thereafter the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>lant left the apartment and the victim ran to the next door apartment and reported what had occurred to her neighbor. The victim further testified that entrance to her apartment was gained through a window, the front door being locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">A police officer testified that earlier that morning, between 4:00 a.m. and 4:15 a.m., he observed the appellant \u201ctiptoeing away from a lighted bathroom window\u201d of a building in the vicinity of the apartment occupied by the victim; that he took him into custody and was driving him to the police station in a police car when he decided to release the appellant because he was not certain what charge to place against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">A police Sergeant testified, out of the presence of the jury, that at 1:00 p.m. on December 16, 1967, he went to the appellant's home; advised him that he was under arrest for rape and burglary; placed handcuffs upon him; and escorted him to the police cruiser. There he read to the appellant from a card (which was introduced in evidence)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the so-called <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The Sergeant stated that after reading the \u201cidentification side\u201d of the card to the appellant, he started reading the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>other side (waiver) and \u201cas I came to the point, \u2018Do you understand and know what you are doing?\u2019 instead of answering in the affirmative or the negative he said, T did not rape that girl. She gave in to me voluntarily.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Sergeant stated that about forty minutes later, after the appellant had been taken to the police station:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\u201cI again read the card to him. He repeated\u2014I said, \u2018Do you understand your rights and what I have just explained to you ?\u2019 And he said he did. I said, \u2018Are you willing to make a statement without a lawyer present at this time?\u2019 And he said, T do want to have an attorney appointed to me.\u2019 However \u2014\u25a0 he didn\u2019t say however. He said, \u2018I do want an attorney, but my story will be the same. I did not rape the girl.\u2019 And then he reiterated what he told me previously.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">As indicated above, the foregoing testimony was given out of the presence of the jury and the trial judge, after hearing extended argument, concluded that \u201cthere is no indication that the statement made was anything other than entirely voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In this appeal, the appellant first contends that it was error to admit the statement since \u201cthere was no showing by the State that prior to his making said statement he was advised that he was entitled to have an attorney appointed for him if he could not afford one.\u201d He apparently bases this argument on the fact that the <em>\u201cMiranda </em>card\u201d which was introduced into evidence, without objection, was not sent to this Court with the record of the proceedings below. However, the record has been properly corrected; the card is now a part of the record before us; and it is clear that the card, which was read to the appellant on two separate occasions, contained the warning: \u201cIf you cannot afford a lawyer one will be appointed for you before a statement is taken if you wish.\u201d It is apparent, therefore, that the complaint of the appellant in this respect is without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">It is next contended that the appellant\u2019s statement was erroneously admitted because \u201cthere was no showing by the State that prior to his making said statement he had waived his constitutional rights against self-incrimination and his right to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tained or appointed counsel.\u201d He points to the language of Chief Justice Warren in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, to the effect that \u201ca heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d And he argues that under the mandate of <em>Miranda </em>the relinquishment of the privilege \u201ccannot be presumed from the mere silence of the defendant after being warned of his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">This argument overlooks the fact, however, that the entire thrust of <em>Miranda </em>was directed toward custodial interrogations. It was stated: \u201cWe deal with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation * * *. By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d It was further held that \u201cvolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\u201d In the case at bar, there can be no question that the appellant was in police custody at the time the statement was given; but it is equally clear that the statement was not the result of \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers * * On each occasion that the appellant gave the statement, it occurred at a time when the police officer was reading the warnings to him from the card. It is apparent that the appellant simply interrupted the officer and \u201cblurted out\u201d or \u201cvolunteered\u201d the statement. The officer had not asked him any questions concerning the crimes for which he was arrested; interrogation, in the sense contemplated by <em>Miranda, </em>had not begun. Thus, we find that the argument advanced by the appellant concerning waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination is not well taken in view of the factual setting in which he gave the statement. See <em>Bazzell v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 194; <em>King v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 652; <em>Howell v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 337; <em>Campbell v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 448; <em>Carwell v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 45, 50; <em>Gaudio and Bucci v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 469. Cf. <em>Hale v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 326 (where the so-called <em>Miranda </em>card was not offered in evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Finally, the appellant contends that the lower court erred in not granting his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of burglary because the State failed to prove that the alleged breaking and entering occurred in the nighttime. In the record before us, the appellant made a motion for a judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case which motion was denied by the trial judge. Although the appellant did not take the stand and no witnesses were called on his behalf, he did introduce into evidence as a part of his defense, after the motion had been denied, a photograph depicting his physical condition on the day of his arrest and he also introduced into evidence the hospital record showing the treatment he received on the day of the crime. By going forward with the evidence in this fashion, he thereby withdrew his previous motion for judgment of acquittal. See Md. Rule 755 b. The appellant failed to renew his motion at the end of the entire case and, because this was a jury case, his failure to make-the motion precludes this Court from reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Jason v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">.
