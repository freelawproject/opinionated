H. Meloy, sitting without a jury, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. He was sentenced to five years under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">The appellant contends upon this appeal that the evidence did not show a receiving, that it did not show the requisite guilty knowledge, and that it was insufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">From the evidence at trial it could be found that Attila K. Sztanko owned a 1966 Chevrolet Corvette convertible, which was stolen sometime during the night of June 11, 1968. On the afternoon of June 12, 1968, the appellant was arrested while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>driving an automobile, in the trunk of which the engine taken from Mr. Sztanko\u2019s Corvette was being carried. Upon the request of the arresting officer, appellant returned to the place where he claimed to have bought the engine, a dirt road in Prince George\u2019s County, and the officer found the Corvette, stripped of its engine, a short distance away from the scene of the alleged sale. The appellant testified that on the evening of June 11, 1968 he received a telephone call from Francis West, who stated that he had obtained an engine of the type the appellant had been wanting to purchase. The appellant, who lived in Washington, D. C., drove to a dirt road coming off the paved portion of Gardner Road, in a rural section of Prince George\u2019s County. Upon arriving at the dirt road, the appellant noticed a 1961 black Chevrolet \u201csitting there waiting for us.\u201d One of the occupants of the Chevrolet was Richard Brainer, who offered to sell appellant a 327 cubic inch Corvette engine. After some argument about the price, the appellant agreed to Brainer\u2019s original price of $175. The engine was then transferred from the trunk of the Chevrolet to the trunk of the car appellant was driving. Brainer then gave appellant \u201ca little extra stuff,\u201d consisting of \u201ca radiator, and I can\u2019t think what else.\u201d In response to the question, \u201cIf you go to a junkyard and try to get a 327 [engine] how much do you think they are going to charge you for it?\u201d, appellant replied, \u201cTwo hundred fifty dollars, three hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Mr. Sztanko had earlier testified that the value of the engine was about $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">A co-defendant with appellant testified and substantially corroborated appellant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case, but this motion was automatically withdrawn, Maryland Rule 7551), when appellant offered evidence in his own behalf after denial of the motion. The motion was renewed at the end of the entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The appellant complains that the State offered no evidence of the existence of parties other than the appellant and his co-defendant and that the trial judge was therefore in error in finding that the appellant was a receiver rather than the thief. The short answer to this contention is that the appellant himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>testified that he bought the engine from one Richard Brainer, which suffices to show that appellant was a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Appellant also complains that it was not proven that he had the requisite guilty knowledge that the engine was stolen property, see <em>Kincer v. </em>State, 5 Md. App. 80, 82 (1968), and that the evidence as a whole did not sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">It is not necessary that the knowledge of the receiver that the property was stolen be direct or actual. Such knowledge may be found in a rational inference deduced from circumstantial evidence when such proof indicates that the receiver knew or could reasonably have suspected that the property in his possession was stolen. <em>Kincer v. State, supra </em>at 86. Possession of stolen property by one charged with unlawfully receiving it, although not sufficient to show guilty knowledge, is a strong circumstance to be considered with all other evidence of guilty knowledge. <em>Kincer v. State, supra </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The fact--of appellant\u2019s possession, coupled with his understanding of how diminutive the price was compared even to junkyard prices and viewed in the light of the surroundings in which the sale was transacted would, we think, support a rational inference that the appellant knew or could reasonably have suspected that the engine was stolen. We cannot say that the trial judge was clearly erroneous in drawing such an inference. Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">As noted above, appellant generally attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. The elements of the crime of receiving stolen property as stated in <em>Kincer v. State, supra </em>at 82, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">(1) The property must be received; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">(2) it must, at the time of its receipt, be stolen property ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">(3) the receiver mtist have guilty knowledge that it is stolen property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-12\">(4) his intent in receiving it must be fraudulent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Elements (1) and (3) have been disposed of above, while element (2) was clearly proven by the testimony of the owner, Mr. Sztanko, and the investigating officer, Trooper Frederick E. Davis. With respect to element (4), the fraudulent intent in receiving the stolen property, the intention need not be <em>lucri </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>causa, </em>but one merely hostile to the title of the true owner, <em>Kincer v. State, supra. </em>The other three elements of the crime being proved, the fraudulent intent was patent. The appellant, after obtaining possession of the engine, was carrying it away in the trunk of the car he was driving and there is no indication or suggestion that this possession and asportation was other than hostile to Mr. Sztanko\u2019s interest in the engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We think that the findings of the lower court on the evidence were not clearly erroneous and affirm the judgment. Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
