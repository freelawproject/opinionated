Brannan, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Samuel A.

On the first indictment he was convicted of larceny and burglary and on the second indictment of breaking with intent to steal. He was sentenced to be committed to the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction for five years on each conviction, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">In this appeal it is contended that the appellant\u2019s confession was not voluntarily given and that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">The record indicates that a seventeen-year-old boy observed two individuals, whom he could not identify, come from a wooded area about 9:00 p.m. on the evening of December 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>1967, carrying a TV set and sundry household articles which they cached behind a tree and then departed from the area. Shortly thereafter he saw a light blue 1965 Chevrolet park under a street light from which the same two individuals alighted, picked up the articles, placed them in the car and drove away. The young boy jotted the license tag number on a match cover and called the police. The automobile was found to be registered in the name of the appellant\u2019s wife. There was also testimony that two houses in the area had been broken into while the occupants were away on extended visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The appellant was arrested on January 8, 1968, and taken to police headquarters about midnight. Sergeant Zombro of the Baltimore County Police Department testified that Corporal Bedsloe (who did not testify) advised the appellant of his constitutional rights by reading to him from a card (presumably a so-called \u201cMiranda card\u201d), \u201cwhich he said he understood, and wished not to be interrogated at that time.\u201d The next morning at 8:00 a.m. the appellant again declined to make a statement. Approximately three hours later, Sergeant Zombro took lunch to the appellant in his cell and, according to the Sergeairt\u2019s testimony, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cA We got to talking, and a statement was made that since it was only he and I there, that this could not be used in court. He admitted to that he did break into the two homes that he is charged with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Q THE COURT: Who said it could not be used in court ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">A THE WITNESS: The defendant stated that since only he and I were there, since it was not part of the interrogation, since he\u2019d waived, stated he did not wish to be interrogated, that it couldn\u2019t be used at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">\u201cQ What was your conversation with him at the time that you brought him his lunch ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">MR. BROWN: I am going to object again, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">THE COURT: I will overrule it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">MR. BROWN: Argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">A THE WITNESS : It was just\u2014we just got to talking about the offenses. He was saying that, talking about the three charges we had on him, which one was an attempted B and E. He told me that, since only he and T were there, that he did break into the two places that we actually had him charged with B and E, but he did not do the attempted breaking and entering. That was the extent of it, right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">Q THE COURT: Was that in response to any question which you put to him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">A THE WITNESS : No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Q THE COURT: You mean he volunteered that, and said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll tell you this, because I know it can\u2019t be used in court\u2019 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">A THE WITNESS: Yes, sir, because there was only he and I there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">THE COURT: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">On cross-examination, the following occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">\u201cQ Did you go back there for any express purpose other than taking lunch hack ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-13\">A No. It was general, general conversation that was started, but it was nothing along the lines of interrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-14\">Q Did you start any general conversation with him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-15\">A I can\u2019t remember how it got started, if I started it or if the defendant started it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-16\">Q In other words, out of a clear blue sky he made this statement ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-17\">A Just through general conversation. We might have been talking about anything. I\u2019ve known Jerry in the past. I really don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-18\">MR. BROWN : No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-19\">THE COURT: Thank you, Sergeant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-20\">MR. BROWN: T am going to renew my objection, for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-21\">TEIE COURT: You move to strike, and the motion is overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The appellant first contends that it was error to permit Sergeant Zombro to testify concerning the reading of the Miranda warnings by Corporal Bedsloe, who did not testify, since such testimony by Sergeant Zombro was hearsay and, therefore, inadmissible. This being so, it is argued, the posture of the case is such that no Miranda warnings were given to the appellant. It is also contended that in any event it is clear that the appellant misunderstood his rights and, therefore, did not knowingly and intelligently waive his privilege against self-incrimination as required by the holding in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In <em>Miranda </em>the strictures enunciated are directed toward <em>interrogation </em>by the police. As stated by Chief Justice Warren (at p. 339) : \u201cMore specifically, we deal with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation * * He explains: \u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning <em>initiated </em>by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody * * (Emphasis added.) It must be recognized that Miranda does not proscribe the use of all statements or confessions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explicated by the Chief Justice (p. 478) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cIn dealing with statements obtained <em>through interrogation, </em>we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible. Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. The fundamental import of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, <em>but whether he can be interrogated. </em>There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, [footnote omitted] or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We think it is clear in the case at bar that the lower court was of the opinion, and we cannot disagree, that the statement given by the appellant to Sergeant Zombro was not elicited or induced as a result of interrogation by the Sergeant but was freely and voluntarily given by the appellant without any of the coercive factors which may normally be involved in a custodial interrogation. Here the appellant on two separate occasions declined to give a statement and no interrogation ensued. The trial judge, obviously, gave credence to Sergeant Zombro\u2019s version that the statement was given in the course of a \u201cgeneral conversation\u201d and that \u201cit was nothing along the lines of interrogation.\u201d Assessing the credibility of the witnesses is, of course, peculiarly the function of the trial judge. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 191, 197; <em>Gunther v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 181, 185. We find, therefore, that the statement here given was not the product of police interrogation but was freely and voluntarily given. Under the circumstances, its admission was not in violation of any of the mandates of <em>Miranda, supra. </em>Thus, we do not reach, and accordingly, need not treat the hearsay and waiver obj ections raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Finally, it is contended that the confession of the appellant is the only evidence to sustain his conviction and that a \u201cconfession of guilt by a person accused of crime uncorroborated by other evidence is not sufficient to warrant conviction.\u201d This, however, is not the law. It is well settled that if the <em>corpus delicti </em>is proved, and here there is no question concerning its proof, a confession, uncorroborated by other evidence, is sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>sustain a conviction. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>238 Md. 140, 144; <em>Whitmen v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 127, 130. As stated in 2 Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Evidence </em>(12th Ed.) 134: \u201cThe criminal agency of the defendant may be shown by his confession alone provided there is adequate corroboration of the <em>corpus delicti.\u201d </em>See also 7 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>(3rd Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 2070-2073.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Accordingly, we find no merit in the appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his convictions. See Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. See <em>Morgan v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 440, 442 (\u201cIndeed, <em>Miranda </em>is essentially limited to prohibiting evidence of oral or written statements <em>stemming </em>from custodial interrogation * * *.\u201d); <em>Clarke v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 447 (routine questions as to address, etc., held to have been made in custody but the interrogation was not the type proscribed by Miranda,); <em>Carwell v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 45 (voluntar y \u201cblurt\u201d immediately after arrest held admissible); <em>Young v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 286 (statement made while in custody was volunteered); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 448 (incriminating statement made after arrest and while in custody, was not in response to an interrogation within meaning of <em>Miranda); Brown v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 261 (\u201cblurt\u201d held admissible).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
