The Department of Public Welfare on March 14, 1945, filed herein a report and recommendation, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b47-4\" pgmap=\"47\">\u201cHaving been presented with a claim for damages to an automobile filed by the above claimant, the Department of Public Welfare, pursuant to Section 372a of the Charities Act relating to claims for damages by inmates of charitable institutions, has investigated the allegations set forth and reports as follows:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b47-5\" pgmap=\"47\">From, the information thus obtained it appears\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b47-6\" pgmap=\"47\">1.

Brandon, Director. \u25a0</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b48-16\" pgmap=\"48\">The record consists of the following:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b48-17\" pgmap=\"48\">Statement of Claim.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b48-18\" pgmap=\"48\">Stipulation of Facts.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b48-19\" pgmap=\"48\">Statement, Brief and Argument by the Attorney General on behalf of Respondent.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b48-20\" pgmap=\"48\">Waiver of Statement, Brief and Argument by Claimant. Departmental Report.</blockquote> <p id=\"b48-21\" pgmap=\"48(30) 49(54)\">From the report of the Department of Public Welfare it appears that the automobile belonging to claimant was subject to a lien given on November 11, 1940 to the Sycamore Finance Company in the sum of Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) at which tim\u00e9 the automobile was purchased by claimant. It does not appear from the record that this lien of $750.00 has been paid or otherwise satisfied, and we must assume that it remains a valid lien for such sum.</p> <p id=\"b49-3\" pgmap=\"49\">This claim is based entirely upon estimates necessary to repair the damaged automobile and, while these estimates appear to be reasonable, no award can be made until the repairs are actually made and paid for, or a release of the said lien is obtained. Until such release is obtained, the Sycamore Finance Company could very well be an \u201cinjured party\u201d and entitled to share to the extent of its interest in any award which might be made herein.</p> <p id=\"b49-4\" pgmap=\"49\">For the reason stated, an award must be denied, and an order is entered herein giving claimant sixty (60) days to present such additional evidence as indicated herein to be required. In the event of claimant\u2019s failure to so produce such additional evidence, the claim will stand dismissed as \u00f3f the date of this order.</p> <p id=\"b49-5\" pgmap=\"49\">(No. 3904</p> <p id=\"Ao\" pgmap=\"49\">Claimant awarded $808.27.)</p> <p id=\"b49-6\" pgmap=\"49\">Supplemental Opinion filed November 13, 1945.</p> <author id=\"b49-7\" pgmap=\"49\">Fisher, C. J.</author> <p id=\"b49-8\" pgmap=\"49\">Subsequent to our original Opinion filed herein at the September 1945 term of this Court claimant, in accordance with leave granted, has filed additional evidence which we indicated was required before the rights of the parties could be determined.</p> <p id=\"b49-9\" pgmap=\"49(24) 50(23)\">The record now consists of the following': Statement of Claim, Report and Recommendation of the Department of Public Welfare, Statement, Brief and Argument on behalf of Respondent, Receipt for payment in full of lien to Sycamore Finance Company, Paid Voucher for repairs, and Stipulation of Facts.</p> <p id=\"b50-3\" pgmap=\"50\">The facts in this claim are fully set forth in our original Opinion.</p> <p id=\"b50-4\" pgmap=\"50\">The Department of Public Welfare, in accordance with Chapter 23 of Section 372(a) Illinois Revised Statutes 1943, made an investigation of this claim and found the facts as alleged by claimant to be true. The Department found the damages to claimant\u2019s car were caused by inmates who had escaped from the Illinois State Training School for Boys at St. Charles, Illinois, which is a state charitable institution.</p> <p id=\"b50-5\" pgmap=\"50\">The Attorney General, in a brief and argument filed herein, concludes that \u201cThe report of the Department and the sworn statement of the claimant are in complete agreement as to the facts, and the Department has recommended that an award be made. The charges for the damage done to the automobile in the possession of the claimant are itemized fully and appear to be reasonable in every respect. As the procedure outlined by the statute has been followed in detail and there is no disagreement as to the facts, it appears that the claimant is entitled to an award in the amount of $808.27.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b50-6\" pgmap=\"50\">An award is entered in favor of claimant, ERNEST C. CARLS, in the sum of Eight Hundred Eight and 27/100 Dollars ($808.27).</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
