Because this court has previously sustained the deportation order, we find that we are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">On January 25, 1975, Mondragon, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for fourteen years, left this country to visit a relative in Juarez, Mexico. The following day, Mondragon and his relative were apprehended as they attempted to cross the border at El Paso, under circumstances indicating that he was aiding her illegal entry. The Immigration and Naturalization Service prevented Mondragon from reentering the United States pending an exclusion hearing on charges of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(31).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before the completion of the exclusion proceedings, Mondragon reentered the United States without submitting to inspection and returned to his home in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In October 1976, an immigration judge found that Mondragon had reentered illegally and ordered him deported, granting voluntary departure. Mondragon unsuccessfully appealed this decision and subsequently moved to reopen, arguing that the Board of Immigration Appeals should consider his application for a waiver of exclusion under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board denied this motion and, in April 1978, issued a deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Mondragon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court, claiming that the deportation order was unlawful because he had been improperly prevented from entering the United States after the El Paso crossing incident. Mon-dragon also sought review of the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. The district court denied relief, and this court affirmed in <em>Mondragon v. Ilchert, </em>No. 78-3051 (9th Cir. Jan. 25, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Following the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition, Mondragon filed a motion for reconsideration with the Board. This motion was based upon a claim that Mondragon had not raised in any previous administrative or judicial proceedings: because Mondragon had not \u201centered\u201d the United States within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was not deportable. Mondragon urged the Board to apply the rule of <em>Rosenberg v. Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963), arguing that because his excursion into Mexico was not \u201cmeaningfully interruptive\u201d of his permanent residence, his return to the United States was not an \u201centry.\u201d The Board denied the motion to reconsider, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">We find that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) bars review of the Board\u2019s refusal to reopen. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">\u201c(c) An order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>trative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or if he has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order. Every petition for review or for habeas corpus shall state whether the validity of the order has been upheld in any prior judicial proceeding, and, if so, the nature and date thereof, and the court in which such proceeding took place. No petition for review or for habeas corpus shall be entertained if the validity of the order has been previously determined in any civil or criminal proceeding, unless the petition presents grounds which the court finds could not have been presented in such prior proceeding, or the court finds that the remedy provided by such prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Mondragon contends that, despite this court\u2019s previous consideration of the deportation order in <em>Mondragon v. Ilchert, </em>the second sentence of \u00a7 1105a(c) does not preclude review of the refusal to reconsider because the basis of his motion to reconsider could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceedings. Specifically, Mondragon contends that because he had not raised the <em>Fleuti </em>issue in immigration proceedings before filing his habeas action, the district court would have found a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and refused to consider the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">This analysis is flawed. The grounds for Mondragon\u2019s motion to reconsider could have been presented in prior judicial proceedings. The factual and legal bases of the <em>Fleuti </em>claim existed before the first deportation hearing, before Mondragon filed his habeas action. He could have raised the issue in his habeas corpus petition if he had raised it previously before the Board. He could, and should, have done so before going into court.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Were we to adopt Mondragon\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1105a(c), we would be inviting alien petitioners to withhold colorable defenses to deportation and to then file successive appeals from denials of motions for discretionary relief, claiming an inability to raise certain issues in prior judicial proceedings because of a \u201cfailure to exhaust.\u201d This result would be directly contrary to the congressional intent in enacting \u00a7 1105a(c) of \u201cforbidding repeated judicial review of an order on grounds which could have been effectively raised in the initial judicial review proceeding.\u201d <em>Yamada v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>384 F.2d 214, 218 (9th Cir. 1967). <em>See Cheng Fan Kwok v. Immigration Serv., </em>392 U.S. 206, 214-16, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 1975-76, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968); <em>Acevedo v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>538 F.2d 918 (2nd Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Mondragon\u2019s failure to raise the <em>Fleuti </em>issue in a timely manner is perhaps unfortunate. That failure does not, however, warrant construing \u00a7 1105a(c) in a manner which would thwart its essential purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(31) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the following classes of aliens shall be ineligible to receive visas and shall be excluded from admission into the United States: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201c(31) Any alien who at any time shall have, knowingly and for gain, encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-10\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201c(c) Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (l)-(25), (30), and (31) of subsection (a) of this section.:\u2019</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-17\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-18\">\"(a) Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-19\">\u201c(2) entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General or is in the United States in violation of this chapter or in violation of any other law of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\">. This policy of limiting piecemeal litigation is reflected in regulations governing motions for reopening or reconsideration of immigration decisions. See, e. <em>g., </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.22 (providing that motion to reopen shall not be granted unless \u201cevidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented\u201d at a prior hearing).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
