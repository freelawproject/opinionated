Takahashi, and her employer\u2019s compensation carrier, Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., in connection with the settlement of a third party action under Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) \u00a7 386-8. The carrier contends that the district court improperly calculated the employer\u2019s proportionate share of attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">For job-related injuries, Mrs. Takahashi received a workers\u2019 compensation award of $40,906.93, to be paid over an extended period of time. She then commenced and settled a third party action, under HRS \u00a7 386-8, against Loomis Armored Car Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">HRS \u00a7 386-8 provides that if a job-related injury gives rise to tort liability in a party other than the employer or a fellow employee, the injured employee, receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, may bring an action against that third party. Under the statute, if the injured employee prevails in the third party action, the employer, or the employer\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, must be reimbursed for any benefits paid under a workers\u2019 compensation award. Mrs. Takahashi settled her third party claim against Loomis Armored Car Service for $85,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From the proceeds of that settlement, appellant, the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, was reimbursed for the $13,662.87 in workers\u2019 compensation payments it had already made to Mrs. Takahashi before the settlement. The settlement also relieved the carrier of liability for any further payments under the $40,906.93 workers\u2019 compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">Under \u00a7 386-8, when an employee, such as Mrs. Takahashi, prosecutes a third party action, she is entitled to deduct from the employer\u2019s share of the benefits recovered a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, based on the \u201cservices rendered by the employee\u2019s attorney in effecting recovery both for the benefit of the employee and the employer.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, the district court ruled that, for purposes of \u00a7 386-8, the \u201cbenefit\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>rendered to the employer by settlement of the third party action was reimbursement for amounts already paid under the workers\u2019 compensation award, plus relief from having to make any further payments under that award. In other words, the district court found that the benefit to the employer was $40,906.93, the full amount of its liability under the workers\u2019 compensation award. Since the parties had fixed the attorney\u2019s fees at one-third of the $85,000 settlement figure, the court determined that the employer\u2019s proportionate share of these fees would be one-third of the total workers\u2019 compensation award of $40,906.93, or $13,635.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Appellant contends that the employer\u2019s share of the attorney\u2019s fees should be limited to an amount proportionate to the payments it had actually made to Mrs. Takaha-shi before the third party settlement, i. e., one-third of $13,662.87, rather than one-third of the total workers\u2019 compensation award of $40,906.93. Appellee argues that since, in addition to reimbursement for payments already made, the employer also ben-efitted from the settlement by being relieved of its liability to make further payments under the workers\u2019 compensation award, the employer\u2019s share of the attorney\u2019s fees should be based on the total benefit the employer received,</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In this diversity action, the court must apply the substantive law of the forum state, Hawaii. <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). In the absence of controlling forum state law, a federal court sitting in diversity must use its own best judgment in predicting how the state\u2019s highest court would decide the case. <em>See Amfac Mortgage Corp. v. Arizona Mall of Tempe, Inc., </em>583 F.2d 426, 434-435 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Robinson v. United States, </em>518 F.2d 1105, 1108 (9th Cir. 1975). In so doing, a federal court may be aided by looking to well-reasoned decisions from other jurisdictions. <em>See </em>C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 271 n. 32 (3d ed. 1976); lA-Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 110.309[2] (2d ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We will defer to the district court\u2019s construction of the law of the state in which the district court sits. <em>Holcomb Construction Co. v. Armstrong, </em>590 F.2d 811, 813 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>American Timber and Trading Co. v. First National Bank of Oregon, </em>511 F.2d 980, 983 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 921, 95 S.Ct. 1588, 43 L.Ed.2d 789 (1975). The district court\u2019s determination, particularly where there has been no clear state court exposition of a controlling principle, will be accepted on review unless shown to be \u201cclearly wrong.\u201d <em>Gee v. Tenneco, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 857, 861 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>American Timber and Trading Co. v. First National Bank of Oregon, </em>511 F.2d at 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Although Hawaii has no case law interpreting the phrase \u201cbenefit of . . . the employer\u201d in HRS \u00a7 386-8, courts in several states having similar statutes have construed the term to include the benefit to the employer, or its insurance carrier, in being relieved from liability for future expenditures. For example, the Supreme Court of New Jersey has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">[T]he assessment against the employer for its pro rata share of the attorney\u2019s fee in the third party tort recovery [is] . measured by \u201chis total compensation liability under the act, however much the obligation may remain unfulfilled at the time of the third party recovery, rather than the compensation payments then actually made to the workfer].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-11\"><em>Teller v. Major Sales, Inc., </em>64 N.J. 143, 313 A.2d 205, 207 (N.J.1974) (quoting <em>Dante v. Gotelli, </em>17 N.J. 254, 111 A.2d 267, 268 (N.J. 1955)). <em>Accord, Schalk v. Michigan Sewer Construction Co., </em>62 Mich.App. 658, 233 N.W.2d 825, 827 (Ct.App.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">The rationale underlying this rule is well stated in <em>Cronen v. Wegdahl Cooperative Elevator Assoc., </em>278 N.W.2d 102, 105 (Minn. 1979): \u201cTo hold otherwise would encourage claimants to delay settlements until virtually all workers\u2019 compensation benefits had been paid.\u201d We therefore find that the district court was not clearly wrong in requiring appellant to pay a share of attorney's fees proportionate to the total amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits it would have had to pay but for the settlement of the third party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The only remaining issue on this appeal is appellee\u2019s assertion that she has a right to reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending this appeal. HRS \u00a7 [431-455] provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">Where an insurer has contested its liability under a policy and is ordered by the courts to pay benefits <em>under the policy, </em>the policyholder . . . shall be awarded, in addition to the benefits under the policy, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees together with the costs of suit. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Under this statute a policy holder\u2019s right to reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees is limited to situations where a court has ordered an insurer to pay benefits <em>under a policy. </em>Appellant was ordered to pay its proportionate share of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to HRS \u00a7 386-8, not pursuant to a policy. Our research discloses no contractual or statutory basis under Hawaiian law for awarding attorney\u2019s fees incurred in bringing this appeal. Accordingly, the request for such fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\">. HRS \u00a7 386-8 provides that a release or settlement of any third party claim will not be valid without the written consent of both the employer and the employee. The employer\u2019s insurance company consented to the settlement on the employer\u2019s behalf on February 22, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-14\">. HRS \u00a7 386-8 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-15\">If the action is prosecuted by the employee alone, the employee shall be entitled to apply out of the amount of the judgment for damages, or settlement in case the action is compromised before judgment, the reasonable litigation expenses incurred in preparation and prosecution of such action, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee which shall be based solely upon the services rendered by the employee\u2019s attorney in effecting recovery both for the benefit of the employee and the employer. After the payment of such expenses and attorney\u2019s fee there shall be applied out of the amount of the judgment or settlement proceeds, the amount of the employer\u2019s expenditure for compensation, less his share of such expenses and attorney\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
