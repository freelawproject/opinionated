We find that the bankruptcy court properly acted within its summary jurisdiction in sustaining the trustee\u2019s action and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Select-A-Seat engaged in the development and marketing of computer software packages which facilitated remote outlet sales of tickets for athletic and entertainment events. On November 10, 1976, Select-A-Seat, through Lee R. Delay, its president, entered into a \u201cWorldwide Licensing Agreement\u201d with F\u00e9nix, a company Mr. Delay also controlled. Under this agreement, F\u00e9nix received exclusive rights to use and license Select-A-Seat\u2019s software packages in all but five areas of the world which had been previously allocated to Select-A-Seat subsidiaries and others. As part of the agreement, Select-A-Seat also agreed not to provide the software to other parties for an initial period of ten years, and for five optional extensions of five years each. The agreement also provided warranties of title and of continued fitness of purpose. F\u00e9nix agreed to pay Select-A-Seat $140,000 down plus five percent of its annual net income from use of the software licenses. Select-A-Seat subsequently transferred the software packages with service manuals to F\u00e9-nix, and F\u00e9nix paid the $140,000 flat fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">On December 3, 1976, petitioning creditors initiated an involuntary Chapter X proceeding against Select-A-Seat. The proceeding was later converted by stipulation to a Chapter XI proceeding and, on May 24, 1977, was converted back to a Chapter X proceeding. On May 19, 1977, while Select-A-Seat was still the object of Chapter XI proceedings, Warren Silver, the corporation\u2019s receiver (now trustee), filed a motion pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 11-53 for rejection of the corporation\u2019s contract with F\u00e9nix.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court, after finding that it had summary jurisdiction to consider the trustee\u2019? motion under \u00a7 116(1) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 516(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that the agreement between F\u00e9nix and Select-A-Seat was a burdensome executory contract within the meaning of that section and granted the trustee\u2019s motion. The bankruptcy court further found that F\u00e9nix, as a creditor of Select-A-Seat, could file a proof of claim for damages, if any, resulting from rejection of the contract under \u00a7 202 of the old Bankruptcy Act. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 602.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>quently affirmed the bankruptcy judge\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">F\u00e9nix raises three principal arguments on appeal. First, the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to consider the trustee\u2019s motion because the agreement between Select-A-Seat and F\u00e9nix was not an \u201cexecutory contract\u201d within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 516. Second, under the licensing agreement, F\u00e9nix had acquired a property interest in the software packages which the bankruptcy court could not recover through an exercise of summary jurisdiction. Finally, even if the licensing agreement was executory, the bankruptcy court erred in permitting its rejection because the contract was not burdensome to the bankrupt\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">A bankruptcy court may, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 516, reject \u201cexecutory contracts of the debtor . . . upon notice to the parties to such contracts and to such other parties in interest as the judge may designate.\u201d The term \u201cexecutory contract\u201d is defined neither in \u00a7 516 nor in Bankruptcy Rules 10-606 and 11-53. However, case law and commentary discussing the trustee\u2019s power to reject under the old Bankruptcy Act defined executory contracts as those \u201cunder which the obligations of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing the performance of the other.\u201d <em>See Jenson v. Continental Financial Corp., </em>591 F.2d 477, 481 (8th Cir. 1979); Countryman, \u201cExecutory Contracts in Bankruptcy: Part I\u201d, 57 Minn.L.Rev. 439, 460 (1973). <em>Cf. </em>2 L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 365.02 (15th ed. 1979) (referring to meaning of executory contract in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">We adopt this definition and find that it applies to the contract at issue here. F\u00e9nix argues that the contract was no longer executory because it had received license rights to the software packages upon payment of the initial $140,000 fee. However, payment of the $140,000 did not represent full consideration for Select-A-Seat\u2019s performance. F\u00e9nix was also obligated to pay Select-A-Seat five percent of its annual net return from use of the software. If F\u00e9nix failed to make these annual payments, that failure would constitute a material breach of the contract, justifying revocation of the exclusive license. Conversely, the agreement was executory from Select-A-Seat\u2019s perspective. Because of the exclusive nature of the license which F\u00e9nix received, Select-A-Seat was under a continuing obligation not to sell its software packages to other parties. Violation of this obligation would be a material breach of the licensing agreement. <em>Cf. In re American Magnesium Co., </em>488 F.2d 147, 152 (5th Cir. 1974) (agreement to refrain from action is executory). The licensing agreement was executory; accordingly, the bankruptcy court properly considered the trustee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">F\u00e9nix next contends that the bankruptcy court, by granting the trustee\u2019s motion, acted to set \u00e1side a transfer of property, thereby exceeding its summary jurisdiction. The essence of Fenix\u2019s argument is that the exclusive licensing rights, once transferred, became intangible property in Fenix\u2019s possession. Rejection of the licensing agreement, F\u00e9nix reasons, allows Select-A-Seat to sell the computer packages to other licensees, depriving F\u00e9nix of its exclusive property interests. F\u00e9nix argues that the bankruptcy court could not summarily recover this property; any adjudication affecting the exclusivity of the license must be plenary. <em>See Cline v. Kaplan, </em>323 U.S. 97, 98-99, 65 S.Ct. 155, 156, 89 L.Ed. 97 (1944); <em>In re American National Trust, </em>426 F.2d 1059, 1065 (7th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">We find these arguments unpersuasive. The trustee did not seek to recover the tangible property transferred to F\u00e9nix, the software packages and accompanying service manuals. Nor did the trustee attempt to revoke Fenix\u2019s license; F\u00e9nix may still use and sell the computer materials it received from Select-A-Seat. The trustee merely sought to reject the executory portions of the contract, the continuing warranty and exclusive dealing obligations. These obligations are analogous to executo-ry covenants in leases to provide heat or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>electricity; the lease (here, the license) cannot be summarily terminated, but rejection can cancel covenants requiring future performances by the debtor. <em>See 2 </em>L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy 11365.09 (15th ed. 1979). If F\u00e9nix has been injured by the rejection of the executory portions of the licensing agreement, it may file a claim for its damages as a creditor of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">F\u00e9nix finally contends that the bankruptcy court erred in permitting rejection of the licensing agreement because the contract was not burdensome to the bankrupt estate. The bankruptcy court specifically found that the licensing agreement was burdensome, and the district court affirmed this finding. From our review of the record, we cannot characterize the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding as clearly erroneous. Rules Bankr.Proc.
