JOHNSON, Jr., Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b672-25\">This is an appeal by the United States from the dismissal of its complaint against the Marion County school district and school board, the members of the school board, and the school district superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-26\">When reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a motion to dismiss, the allegations of the complaint are to be taken as true. No citation of authority is necessary to sustain this basic proposition. Thus, from the allegations of the government\u2019s complaint, the defendants have followed and continue to follow a policy of racial discrimination against blacks in the assignment of students in the Marion County public schools.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As further appears, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>defendants, in exchange for the substantial amount of financial assistance the school district receives from the federal government each year, furnished assurances to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) that in operating the school district they would comply with Title YI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and thus, not discriminate on the basis of race, color or national origin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no question but that the discriminatory practices engaged in by the defendants, as the United States alleges in its complaint, constitute violations of these assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The United States sought redress in the form of a court order compelling specific performance of the assurances by the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court held that the United States had no authority to maintain such a suit and for this reason dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We reverse. It is settled law that the United States has authority to fix the terms and conditions upon which its money' allotments to state and other governmental entities should be disbursed. <em>Lau v. Nichols, </em>414 U.S. 563, 569, 94 S.Ct. 786, 789, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974); <em>King v. Smith, </em>392 U.S. 309, 333, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 2141, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968); <em>Ivanhoe Irrigation District v.

As the Supreme Court has long recognized, the United States may attach conditions to a grant of federal assistance, the recipient of the grant is obligated to perform the conditions, and the United States has an inherent right to sue for enforcement of the recipient\u2019s obligation in court. <em>E. g., Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 148, 151, 76 S.Ct. 219, 221, 100 L.Ed. 149 (1956); <em>United States v. San Francisco, </em>310 U.S. 16, 31, 60 S.Ct. 749, 757, 84 L.Ed. 1050 (1940); <em>Cotton v.

Philadelphia General Hospital, </em>428 F.Supp. 809 (E.D.Pa.1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The basis of the district court\u2019s decision not to recognize the United States\u2019 right to sue on its contract in this case was the court\u2019s conclusion that Congress has deliberately nullified the right where, as here, the contractual obligations the United States seeks to enforce are assurances of nondiscrimination in the operation of public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">This conclusion was mistaken. As noted, it is well established that the government\u2019s right to sue to enforce its contracts exists as a matter of federal common law, without necessity of a statute. <em>E. g., United States v. Tingey, </em>30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 115, 127-28, 8 L.Ed. 66 (1831) (Story, J.) (calling the right \u201can incident to the general right of sovereignty\u201d). <em>See United States v. Kearns, </em>595 F.2d 729, 732 (D.C.Cir. 1978); Hart &amp; Wechsler\u2019s <em>The Federal Courts and The Federal System </em>1301-02 (2d ed. 1973) (citing cases). Congress may nullify the right, but, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, courts are entitled to conclude that Congress has done so only if the evidence of Congress\u2019 intent is extremely, even unmistakably, clear. <em>See, e. g., United States v. United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 272, 67 S.Ct. 677, 686, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947) (\u201cold and well-known rule that statutes which in general terms divest pre-ex-isting rights or privileges will not be applied to the sovereign without express words to that effect\u2019\u2019).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Contrary to the determination of the district court, and to the arguments of the defendants on appeal, there is no persuasive, much less unmistakable, evidence that Congress intended to eradicate or even restrict the United States\u2019 right to sue to enforce contractual assurances of nondiscrimination in the operation of public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">It is true, as the district court found, that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 the legislative expression on which the defendants and the district court place principal reliance \u2014 expressly establishes a number of alternative means by which the government may act to eliminate discrimination in the operation of federally-funded public schools. These include, as the district court noted, (1) informal administrative efforts to achieve voluntary compliance with Title Vi\u2019s prohibition of discrimination in the operation of programs receiving federal as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>sistance,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) formal administrative fund termination proceedings under Title VI,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (3) suits by the Attorney General under Title IV in response to private complaints,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (4) intervention by the Attorney General under Title IX in pending privat\u00e9 suits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, as noted above, it would be error for a court to <em>presume, </em>as apparently did the district court, that these other means were intended to be exclusive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It would also be error for a court to conclude from a study of the Act and its legislative history that such an intent should be inferred. The Civil Rights Act nowhere states that the above-enumerated remedies are to be the exclusive means for eliminating discrimination in the operation of public schools. To the contrary, the statute clearly provides that other means of action, even if not mentioned in the Act, are to be preserved. Title VI of the Act, the particular title with which the defendants assured HEW they would comply and which assurances the United States seeks to enforce here, <em>see </em>notes 2 &amp; 3, <em>supra, </em>states that compliance with the Title may be effected \u201c(1) by the termination of or refusal to grant or continue assistance . . ., or (2) by any other means authorized by law . \u00a7 602, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-l. Title XI, containing the Act\u2019s \u201cmiscellaneous provisions,\u201d states even more clearly that: \u201cNothing in this act shall be construed to deny, impair, or otherwise affect any right or authority of the Attorney General or of the United States or any agency or officer thereof under existing laws to institute or intervene in any action or proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 1103, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000h-3. This stated intent to preserve other means of action which were not expressly set out in the Act is not contradicted by the Act\u2019s legislative history; it is corroborated. Indeed, the record of the floor debates prior to the Act\u2019s passage indicates that it was Congress\u2019 specific understanding that the \u201cany other means authorized by law\u201d language in Title VI quoted above included government suits to enforce contractual assurances of the kind filed by the United States here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> HEW issued regulations so interpreting the Act shortly after its passage. 29 Fed.Reg. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>16, 301 (1964), <em>codified at 45 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 80.-8(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that, contrary to the defendants\u2019 contentions, the remedies for school discrimination expressly authorized by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to be exclusive or to restrict the United States\u2019 right to sue to enforce contractual assurances of compliance with Title VI.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6z\">The defendants rely in the alternative on the Eagleton-Biden Amendment to HEW\u2019s 1978 appropriations act. The amendment essentially prevents HEW from requiring \u201cthe transportation of any student to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>school other than the school nearest the student\u2019s home.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> According to the defendants, the amendment also nullifies the Attorney General\u2019s right to sue to enforce contractual assurances of nondiscrimination in the operation of public schools where, as here, the relief sought involves the transportation of students to schools other than those nearest their homes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">A review of the amendment and its legislative history suggests no such interpretation. Nothing in the language of the amendment precludes the United States from seeking transportation relief in a federal court suit to enforce contractual assurances of nondiscriminatory school operation. Nor is any such limitation indicated by the amendment\u2019s legislative history. What the legislative history establishes is simply that Congress intended to prevent the HEW bureaucracy from acting solely on its own authority in <em>administrative </em>proceedings to coerce local school districts into adopting busing plans.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Congress fully intended that the federal courts would retain their authority to mandate busing, and that they would be able to do so in response to suits such as this one brought by the United States, on referral from HEW, to enforce a school district\u2019s Title VI contractual assurances of nondiscrimination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">The contrary interpretation of the amendment suggested by the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>would call into question not the authority of the United States to bring this suit, but rather the constitutionality of the Eagleton-Biden Amendment itself.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The United States, in seeking to enforce the defendants\u2019 contractual assurances of compliance with Title VI, is simply seeking to enforce the Constitution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is well established that the United States is constitutionally prohibited from providing financial assistance to school districts engaged in discrimination violative of the Constitution. <em>See, e. g., Norwood v. Harrison, </em>413 U.S. 455, 467, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 2811, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973); <em>Cooper v. Aaron, </em>358 U.S. 1, 19, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 1410, 3 L.Ed.2d 5 (1958); <em>Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 499-500, 74 S.Ct. 693, 694-95, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the United States with no means to challenge the discriminatory practices of the defendants, as alleged here, and no choice other than to continue funding those practices, the district court decision would force the United States to so violate the Constitution.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The facial constitutionality of the Eagleton-Biden Amendment was recently challenged on this general theory, viz., that the amendment impermissibly burdens the government\u2019s constitutional obligation to assure that schools receiving federal support do not discriminate. <em>See Brown v. Califano, </em>455 F.Supp. 837, 842-43 (D.D.C. 1978). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court decision rejecting the challenge, holding that even though the amendment curtails HEW\u2019s ability to terminate funding to discriminatory school programs, it leaves intact a number of other means by which the government may be able to effectively ensure that the discriminatory practices in those programs are enjoined. <em>Brown v. Califano, </em>627 F.2d 1221, (D.C.Cir. 1980). As the District of Columbia Circuit correctly held, one such means is a suit by the United States to enforce contractual nondiscrimination assurances such as the suit filed by the United States here. At 1232 &amp; n.67.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The United States\u2019 contract rights aside, it has also been suggested that the United States is entitled to seek the relief requested 'here (1) because it enjoys an implied right of action under Title VI. <em>see, e. g., Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 191, 204, 88 S.Ct. 379, 387, 19 L.Ed.2d 407 (1967) (implying a right of action to the United States under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and (2) because it has inherent authority to sue to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see, e. g., United States v. City of Jackson, </em>318 F.2d 1, 14 (5th Cir. 1963) <em>and </em>Judge Brown\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>United States v. Mississippi, </em>229 F.Supp. 925, 975-76 (S.D.Miss. 1964). [The majority position from which Judge Brown dissented was later reversed on appeal by the Supreme Court. <em>See Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>ed States v. Mississippi, </em>380 U.S. 128, 85 S.Ct. 808, 13 L.Ed.2d 717 (1965).]<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because of our understanding of the enforceability of the United States\u2019 contract rights, we find it unnecessary to pass on the question of the capacity of the United States to sue on these alternative grounds. <em>See, e. g., United States v. City of Jackson, </em>320 F.2d 870, 872-73 (5th Cir. 1963) (oh petition for rehearing) (Ainsworth, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The defendants\u2019 additional arguments notwithstanding,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we conclude that the United States is entitled to sue to enforce contractual assurances of compliance with Title Vi\u2019s prohibition against discrimination in the operation of federally-funded schools, and that the United States is entitled to whatever relief is necessary to enforce such assurances, including \u201ctransportation relief.\u201d The decision of the district court to dismiss the United States\u2019 complaint was error.

The <em>Harrison County </em>case stemmed from a federal grant to Harrison County, Mississippi, for the construction of a seawall and sand beach along the county\u2019s coastline to prevent hurricane damage. The grant was conditioned on the county\u2019s agreement that it would assure perpetual public use of the beach. When use of the beach was later discriminatorily denied to members of the public, the United States brought suit for specific performance of the agreement. This court granted the requested relief, holding that \u201cthe obligation of Harrison County as assumed in its contract with the United States is inescapable and must be enforced.\u201d 399 F.2d at 490. <em>See also </em>414 F.2d 784 at 784-85 (5th Cir.)

The <em>County School Board </em>case involved a federal grant to the Prince George County, Virginia, school board for the construction of school facilities. In exchange for the grant, the school board furnished an assurance to the United States that the school facilities would be available to \u2018federally-connected\u2019 children (dependents of military and civilian personnel stationed at a local United States military base) on the same terms, in accordance with the laws of the state, as they are available to other children. Despite the fact that the relevant state statute 'excluded race as a criterion for student assignment, the school board assigned the federally-connected children using that criterion. The United States brought suit for an order compelling specific performance of the school board\u2019s assurance. The district court held that the United States had authority to so sue and granted the requested relief. <em>See </em>221 F.Supp. at 103-05. <em>Accord United States v. Sumter County School District, supra, </em>232 F.Supp. at 949-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The <em>Halderman, Mattson </em>and <em>Solomon </em>cases each involved suits against state officials for the relief of alleged violations of constitutional rights in the operation of state mental retardation facilities. The suits in <em>Mattson </em>and <em>Solomon </em>were filed by the United States, and the government alleged as authority for the suits only its interest in seeing to the enforcement of the laws and Constitution of the United States, <em>Cf. </em>U.S.Const. art. II, \u00a7 3 (President \u201cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u201d). Although these allegations were found to be insufficient and the complaints dismissed, each court indicated that the United States might well have been entitled to seek its requested relief in a contract suit to enforce assurances the defendants had made to the United States in exchange for federal grants. <em>United States v. Mattson, </em>600 F.2d at 1229 n.6; <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>563 F.2d at 1125; <em>id. </em>at 1129 (Butz-ner, J., concurring). The <em>Halderman </em>case arose as a class action filed by a resident of a Pennsylvania state mental retardation facility. In holding that the district court acted correctly in allowing the United States to intervene as a plaintiff and seek injunctive relief, one of the issues on appeal, the court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atr-dedup-1\">[T]here is extensive federal legislation directed toward the well-being of the mentally retarded. . . . Large amounts of federal funds flow to Pennsylvania from the federal government, and the United States is vitally interested in the enforcement of the conditions on which- those grants are made. One such condition is compliance with governing federal law. Had the United States sought to do so, it could have brought suit to enforce the conditions attached to its grants. Clearly, then, the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting intervention under Rule 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">612 F.2d at 92 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Drennon v.

Like <em>County School Board, supra, </em>and <em>Sumter County School District, supra, Madison </em>involved a number of suits filed by the United States for specific performance of certain contractual assurances made by local school boards to the United States in exchange for school construction funds. In <em>Madison, </em>the government\u2019s complaints were dismissed, not because the court found that the United States has no authority to sue to enforce contractual assurances of nondiscrimination, but rather because the court found it clear that the school boards had made no such assurances. <em>See </em>326 F.2d at 239 (\u201cNo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>one would be so rash as to claim that a local school board in either of the \u2018hard core\u2019 States of Alabama or Mississippi would intentionally enter into a contract which it understood to provide for even partial desegregation of the races in the public schools under its jurisdiction.

They find support for their conclusion that Congress intended to prohibit the United States from bringing suits to enforce Title VI contractual assurances (1) in the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s rejection of an original subcommittee draft of the Title that provided for enforcement through administrative fund termination proceedings, <em>civil actions to enforce regulations or agreements entered into under the Title, </em>and any other means authorized by law; (2) in the rejection by the full House of an amendment to the Title that would have eliminated all administrative means for enforcement in favor of <em>exclusive </em>reliance on contract suits, and (3) in statements by some of the Title\u2019s sponsors that one of the alternatives to administrative termination of funds was government litigation under Title IV. As for (1), the reported rewording of the Title by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>House Judiciary Committee hardly compels the defendants\u2019 inference that the committee and Congress intended to prohibit government suits to enforce Title VI contractual assurances. Although the purpose of the revision is unclear, it seems highly unlikely that it would have been meant to have such an effect. It also seems unlikely that it would have been understood by Congress to have such an effect. As for (2) and (3), as explained above, the fact that Congress intended to authorize a number of means of obtaining compliance with Title VI other than contract enforcement actions cannot be said to indicate that Congress intended to prohibit such actions as a means of obtaining compliance. This is especially so given the permissive language of the Act. <em>Compare, </em>e. <em>g., </em>Age Discrimination Act of 1975, \u00a7 305, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6104(e) (\u201cprovisions of this section shall be the <em>exclusive </em>remedy for the enforcement of \u2022 the provisions of this chapter\u201d) (emphasis added) [amended 1978].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b677-5\">. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.8(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u00a7 80.8 <em>Procedure for effecting compliance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">(a) <em>General. </em>If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this regulation, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law.

This contention, like the defendants\u2019 Eagleton-Biden argument, ignores the clear intent of Congress. The Equal Educational Opportunities Act does provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adq-dedup-0\">No court, department, or agency of the United States shall, pursuant to section 1713 of this title [listing priority of remedies for \u201ca denial of equal educational opportunity or a denial of the equal protection of the laws\u201d], order the implementation of a plan that would require the transportation of any student to a school other than the school closest or next closest to his place of residence which provides the appropriate grade level and type of education for such student.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\u00a7 215(a), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1714(a). However, the act also provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">the provisions of this chapter are not intended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the United States to enforce fully the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">\u00a7 203(b), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(b). As Congress and the courts have understood, the United States, in asking courts to compel defendants to perform contractual assurances of compliance with Title VI, is simply asking courts to enforce the requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Title Vi\u2019s standard is that of the Constitution. <em>See </em>note 20, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">It may be noted that, like the Eagleton-Biden Amendment, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act\u2019s \u2018anti-busing\u2019 provision, otherwise known as the Esch Amendment, does serve as a constraint on extrajudicial administrative agency action.

According to the government, \u201c[t]he Attorney General under 20 U.S.C. 1706 may bring suit on behalf of an individual denied an \u2018equal educational opportunity,\u2019 but the relief available, particularly as relates to transportation of students, may be somewhat limited.\u201d <em>See e. g., United States v. School District, </em>577 F.2d 1339, 1343-46 (6th Cir. 1978) (actions by Attorney General under Equal Educational Opportunities Act may not include Fourteenth Amendment claims). <em>See also United States v. Hinds County School Board, </em>560 F.2d 619, 623-24 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\">. <em>See generally </em>Note on the Implication of Rights of Action by the United States, Hart &amp; Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and The Federal System 1301-09 (2d ed. 1973); Note, Nonstatu-tory Executive Authority to Bring Suit, 85 Harv.L.Rev. 1566, 1567-68 (1972) (citing cases in which Supreme Court has upheld \u201cright of the Attorney General to institute actions in the name of the United States in order to effectuate a congressionally established scheme\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\">. <em>Cf.

In <em>Debs, </em>the Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">Every government, entrusted by the very terms of its being with powers and duties to be exercised and discharged for the general wdlfare, has a right to apply to its own courts for any proper assistance in the exercise of the one and the discharge of the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">158 U.S. at 584, 15 S.Ct. at 906. <em>See </em>Notes cited in note 24, <em>supra; </em>Note, Protecting the Public Interest: Nonstatutory Suits by the United States, 89 Yale L.J. 118 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b681-14\">. In support of their position the defendants advance a number of additional arguments based on the wording or changes in wording of the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 and the Revenue Sharing Act of 1972. For example, the Revenue Sharing Act originally provided that, when the Secretary of the Treasury was unable to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act\u2019s antidiscrimination provisions, the Secretary was authorized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-16\">(1) to refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted; (2) to exercise the powers and functions provided by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; or (3) to take such other action as may be provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1242(b) (1972). According to the defendants, \u201cthis was an unmistakable indication of congressional understanding\u201d that Title VI was not to be enforced by government suits to enforce contractual assurances or by other government civil actions. We cannot agree. These additional arguments of the defendants have no merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
