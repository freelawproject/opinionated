HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Peter Richard Phillips died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident. His survivors sued both the driver [Carner] and the driver\u2019s employer, appellee Unijax, Inc., for wrongful death. The action originated in Alabama Circuit Court. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, as amended, identically charged each defendant with \u201cnegligently\u201d and \u201cwantonly\u201d injuring the deceased. Some three years into the litigation, plaintiffs successfully moved that separate trials be had against the two defendants. Ala.R.Civ.P. 42(b). Unijax then sought to remove the case to the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">As grounds for removal, Unijax asserted that the state court\u2019s order granting separate trials created \u201cseparate and independent . . . causefs] of action,\u201d 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1441(c) (West 1973), of which complete diversity existed between plaintiffs and Unijax. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(a) (West 1966). The district court apparently agreed, noting that the cause was properly removed \u201cafter severance [sic] of the claims against the two defendants.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Unijax, Inc., </em>462 F.Supp. 942, 943 (S.D.Ala. 1978). The court then entered summary judgment for Unijax, holding in substance that plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits estopped them, under Alabama law, from suing in tort. <em>Id. </em>at 946. Because the district court plainly lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">This lawsuit arose out of a single automobile accident. Carner and Unijax were charged with identical tortious acts, their alleged liability differing only in that Unijax\u2019s was vicarious.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It would be difficult to imagine a case further without 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1441(c) (West 1973), which allows removal only of \u201cseparate and independent claim[s] or cause[s] of action, which would be removable if sued upon alone, [but are] joined with one or more otherwise non-removable claims or causes of action.\u201d Here, as in American Fire <em>&amp; Casualty Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Finn, </em>341 U.S. 6, 71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702 (1951), \u201c[t]he facts in each portion of the complaint involve [Carner], the damage comes from a single incident. The allegations in which [Carner] is a defendant involve substantially the same facts and transactions as do the allegations in the first portion of the complaint against [Uni-jax] . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 71 S.Ct. at 541. <em>See Paxton v. Weaver, </em>553 F.2d 936, 938-40 (5th Cir. 1977). It follows that \u00a7 1441(c) did not authorize removal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On appeal, Unijax urges that plaintiffs\u2019 claims against it were also removable under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1441(a) (West 1973). Unijax\u2019s theory is that plaintiffs\u2019 motion for separate trials resulted in two independent lawsuits, of which Unijax\u2019s was removable under the rule of <em>Weems v. Louis Dreyfus Corp., </em>380 F.2d 545 (5th Cir. 1967). <em>Weems </em>reaffirmed the so-called \u201cvoluntary-involuntary rule,\u201d <em>see American Car &amp; Foundry Co. v. Kettelhake, </em>236 U.S. 311, 35 S.Ct. 355, 59 L.Ed. 594 (1915), under which cases, not originally removable, may become so by the voluntary (but not the involuntary) dismissal of those defendants whose presence precluded removal. <em>Weems, </em>380 F.2d at 547-49. <em>See also Self v. General Motors Corp., </em>588 F.2d 655 (9th Cir. 1978). Although, in this case, the nondiverse Carner obviously was not \u201cdismissed,\u201d Ala.R. Civ.P. 41(a), Unijax argues that the order granting separate trials effected the practical equivalent result, /. e., an independent lawsuit between completely diverse parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">If the state trial court had severed plaintiffs\u2019 claims, Ala.R.Civ.P. 21, thereby creating two separate lawsuits, Unijax\u2019s argument might have merit. But that is not what happened. The state court ordered separate trials, Ala.R.Civ.P. 42(b), which is not the same thing. Under Alabama law, the distinction exists and is significant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Separate trials will usually result in one judgment, but severed claims become entirely independent actions to be tried, and judgment entered thereon, independently. Unfortunately this distinction, clear enough in theory, is often obscured in practice since at times the courts talk of \u2018separate trial\u2019 and \u2018severance\u2019 interchangeably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\"><em>Key v. Robert M. Duke Insurance Agency, </em>340 So.2d 781, 783 (Ala.1976), quoting 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2387 (1971). <em>See Seybold v. Magnolia Land Co., </em>372 So.2d 865 (Ala. 1979); <em>Walker County Petroleum Council, Inc. v. Walker County, </em>368 So.2d 862 (Ala. 1979); <em>Robinson v. Computer Servicenters, Inc., </em>360 So.2d 299 (Ala.1978). Here, plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Carner were removed to the district court along with those against Unijax.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carner actively participated in discovery and made pretrial motions. The district court assigned a single case number. The record, in short, reflects the lack of substance, as well as the lack of form, behind Unijax\u2019s supposedly independent lawsuit. The state court order granting separate trials did not ameliorate the lack of diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Unijax finally argues that plaintiffs\u2019 joinder of Carner was \u201cfraudulent,\u201d for diversity purposes, because they had no \u201carguably reasonable basis\u201d for recovery against him. <em>Tedder v. F.M.C. Corp., </em>590 F.2d 115, 117 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam). Unijax overstates the weakness of plaintiffs\u2019 case. Unijax contends, and the district court apparently held, that plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, without more, \u201cestops\u201d them from denying that the deceased\u2019s injuries occurred in the course of employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This per se approach, of course, completely \u201cignores the constituent elements of estoppel,\u201d <em>Ivey v. Dixon Investment Co., </em>283 Ala. 590, 219 So.2d 639, 643 (1969), besides being, at best, an extension of Alabama law. <em>Cf. National Cast Iron Pipe Co. v. Higginbotham, </em>216 Ala. 129, 112 So. 734 (1927) (although plaintiff had ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>cepted workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, court considered merits of claim that plaintiff was not covered by compensation act and thus entitled to sue in tort). Carner\u2019s joinder was in no way \u201cfraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The cause is REVERSED with directions that it be REMANDED to the appropriate Alabama Circuit Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-13\">. Unijax contends that plaintiffs\u2019 action against Carner arises under a different statute, <em>viz., </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 25-5-11 (a) (1977), than does their action against it. Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-410 (1977). Assuming its relevance, this contention is wrong. <em>See Alabama Power Co. v. White, </em>377 So.2d 930, 933 (Ala. 1979); <em>Nicholson v. Lockwood Greene Engineers, Inc., </em>278 Ala. 497, 179 So.2d 76, 78 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. The district court ultimately remanded the claims against Carner, apparently pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1441(c) (West 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-12\">. If Phillips died in the course of his employment, suit against Carner would apparently be impossible. <em>See Slagle </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>370 So.2d 947 (Ala. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
