They deal with somewhat complicated problems concerning HEW Regulation 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979), which allows public disclosure of a financial report, called a Provider Cost Report, which is required to be filed by Medicare providers operating under financial reimbursement through the Federal Medicare Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-23\">Plaintiffs, Parkridge Hospital (Parkridge) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Diplomat Lakewood, Inc., (Diplomat) in Lakewood, Ohio, are, respectively, a hospital and a nursing home which provide health care services to patients for which they receive reimbursement under Medicare. The Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 1395f(b) (1976), allows payment to providers for such services to qualified patients for the lesser of \u201cthe reasonable cost of such services\u201d or \u201cthe customary charges with respect to such services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-24\">In order to receive reimbursement under the appropriate formula, providers of care such as Parkridge and Diplomat are required to file annual Provider Cost Reports. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.406, 405.435 (1977). These Provider Cost Reports are filed with designated \u201cfiscal intermediaries.\u201d In the instance of Parkridge, the fiscal intermediary is defendant Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee; in the instance of Diplomat, it is defendant Blue Cross of Northeast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Ohio. In each of these cases the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has intervened as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The disputed regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.-435 (1979), allows the Secretary to disclose the Provider Cost Reports when a written request for disclosure is made. Such requests have been filed as to both Park-ridge\u2019s and Diplomat\u2019s Provider Cost Reports and the Secretary has given notice that the disclosure requests will be granted. Both Parkridge and Diplomat in widely separated District Courts filed complaints which have resulted in injunctive relief restraining disclosure. It is from these injunctions that appellant Secretary appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">These appeals present the same two controlling legal issues: 1) is a regulation issued by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979)) which allows disclosure to the public upon written request of Provider Cost Reports \u201cauthorized by law\u201d?; and 2) if so, is the regulation nonetheless invalid as an abuse of the Secretary\u2019s discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The arguments of the opposing parties are closely balanced. Appellant Secretary relies upon authorization for the regulation which he claims to find in the Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(a) (1976), in the \u201chousekeeping statute\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 (1976), and in the agency\u2019s adherence to formal rulemaking <em>(see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976)) in the adoption of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.-435 (1979). On the abuse of discretion issue, the Secretary offers the rationale that the regulation is well within his discretion because of the need for public participation in keeping honest the use by providers of nearly seven billion dollars of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Appellees mount a multifaceted attack upon the regulation claiming that as private entrepreneurs they will be seriously damaged by public disclosure of their Provider Cost Reports. They claim that other nursing homes and hospitals will have access to the Provider Cost Reports and can thereupon make use of their financial data to deduce operating methods and practices which the competitors can then copy. They assert that such disclosure violates exemption clauses of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), (4) (1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and is prohibited by the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">This case would be much more difficult to decide but for the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Chrysler Corporation v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). This opinion, issued after both District Court decisions which we now review, has dealt extensively and authoritatively with several of the more difficult questions presented to the District Judges below. In the first instance, <em>Chrysler </em>establishes that the plaintiffs in this case cannot rely upon the exemption sections of the Freedom of Information Act as \u25a0providing a cause of action to enjoin the disclosure of exempted information. The Freedom of Information Act, the Court held, \u201cis exclusively a disclosure statute.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corporation v. Brown, supra </em>at 292, 99 S.Ct. at 1712, 1713.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">In <em>Chrysler, </em>Mr. Justice Rehnquist said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao0\">\u201cChrysler contends that the nine exemptions in general, and Exemption 4 in particular, reflect a sensitivity to the privacy interests of private individuals and nongovernmental entities. That contention may be conceded without inexorably requiring the conclusion that the exemptions impose affirmative duties on an agency to withhold information sought. In fact, that conclusion is not supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>by the language, logic, or history of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\"># * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">\u201cThe Act is an attempt to meet the demand for open government while preserving workable confidentiality in governmental decision-making. Congress appreciated that, with the expanding sphere of governmental regulation and enterprise, much of the information within Government files has been submitted by private entities seeking Government contracts or responding to unconditional reporting obligations imposed by law. There was sentiment that Government agencies should have the latitude, in certain circumstances, to afford the confidentiality desired by these submitters. But the congressional concern was with the <em>agency\u2019s </em>need or preference for confidentiality; <em>the FOIA by itself protects the submitters\u2019 interest in confidentiality only to the\u25a0 extent that this interest is endorsed by the agency collecting the information.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">Enlarged access to governmental information undoubtedly cuts against the privacy concerns of nongovernmental entities, and as a matter of policy some balancing and accommodation may well be desirable. <em>We simply hold here that Congress did not design the FOIA exemptions to be mandatory bars to disclosure.\u201d Id. </em>at 292-293, 99 S.Ct. at 1712, 1713. (Emphasis added). (Footnotes omitted). The Court concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201cCongress did not limit an agency\u2019s discretion to disclose information when it enacted the FOIA. It necessarily follows that the Act does not afford Chrysler any right to enjoin agency disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">\u00edd. at 294, 99 S.Ct. at 1714.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Secondly, <em>Chrysler </em>holds that a criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 (1976),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> relied upon by plaintiffs, which generally forbids the disclosure of governmental information \u201cunless authorized by law\u201d is applicable to cases like our instant case. <em>(See </em>discussion in <em>Chrysler, supra </em>at 299-301, 99 S.Ct. at 1716-1717.) On this score the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1BK\">\u201c\u00a7 1905 does address formal agency action and that the appropriate inquiry is whether OFCCP\u2019s regulations provide the \u2018authoriz[ation] by law\u2019 required by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 99 S.Ct. at 1717.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">Thirdly, the <em>Chrysler </em>opinion discusses the standards for determining whether or not a disclosure regulation has been \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d The regulation must be one which is \u201csubstantive\u201d in character. The <em>Chrysler </em>opinion defines a substantive regulation as one \u201caffecting individual rights and obligations.\u201d <em>Chrysler, supra </em>at 302, 99 S.Ct. at 1718. We believe that the facts of this case, as well as the statutory language involved, serve to make clear that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979) does concern individual rights and obligations and is substantive in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">In order to be \u201cauthorized by law\u201d the regulation must also be promulgated in accordance with the formal rulemaking requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976). It is clear that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979) was the product of formal rulemaking. <em>See </em>40 Fed.Reg. 27,648-27,651 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">Over and above these requirements, in order for the regulation to have \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>\u2018force and effect of law,\u2019 \u201d it is necessary to establish a \u201cnexus between the regulations and some delegation of the requisite legislative authority by Congress.\u201d <em>Chrysler, supra </em>at 304, 99 S.Ct. at 1719.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">None of these standards had been as specifically delineated by the Supreme Court at the time the District Judges who decided these two cases below were grappling with them. As far as statutory interpretation is concerned, we believe that <em>Chrysler </em>has left for this court only the question of whether or not the disclosure regulation adopted by the Secretary was \u201cauthorized by law\u201d within the meaning of the language just quoted above. It is to this question that we now turn in search of the meaning of the word \u201cnexus\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The first dictionary definition of the word \u201cnexus\u201d is \u201cconnection.\u201d Such connection cannot readily be found in the \u201chousekeeping statute\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 (1976), relied on in part by the Secretary. We do, however, find specific connection between the disclosure regulation and that portion of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(a) (1976) which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">\u00a7 1306. Disclosure of information in possession of agency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">(a) No disclosure of any return or portion of a return (including information returns and other written statements) filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under title VIII of the Social Security Act or under subchapter E of chapter 1 or subchapter A of chapter 9 of the Internal Revenue Code [of 1939], or under regulations made under authority thereof, which has been transmitted to the Secretary by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, or of any file, record, report, or other paper, or any information, obtained at any time by the Secretary or by any officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in the course of discharging the duties of the Secretary under this Act, and no disclosure of any such file, record, report, or other paper, or information, obtained at any time by any person from the Secretary or from any officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, shall be made <em>except as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe </em>and except as provided in part D of title IV of this Act [42 USCS \u00a7\u00a7 651-660], Any person who shall violate any provision of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(a) (1972). (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">The <em>Chrysler </em>opinion gives us two definitions which we assume describe the reach of the term \u201cnexus.\u201d The first describes chiefly what <em>is </em>required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-12\">\u201cThe pertinent inquiry is whether under any of the arguable <em>statutory </em>grants of authority the OFCCP disclosure regulations relied on by the respondents are reasonably within the contemplation of that grant of authority. We think that it is clear that when it enacted these statutes, Congress was not concerned with public-disclosure of trade secrets or confidential business information, and, unless we were to hold that any federal statute that implies some authority to collect information must grant <em>legislative </em>authority to disclose that information to the public, it is simply not possible to find in these statutes a delegation of the disclosure authority asserted by the respondents here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-13\"><em>Chrysler, supra </em>at 306, 99 S.Ct. at 1720. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">The second describes principally what <em>is not </em>required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-15\">\u201cThis is not to say that any grant of legislative authority to a federal agency by Congress must be specific before regulations promulgated pursuant to them can be binding on courts in a manner akin to statutes. What is important is that the reviewing court reasonably be able to conclude that the grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a8n-dedup-0\"><em>Chrysler, supra </em>at 308, 99 S.Ct. at 1721.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0j\">We notice first in these sentences that the Secretary in this case, in contrast to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><em>Chrysler </em>facts, was not required to rely for disclosure authority upon a statute which merely provided him authority \u201cto collect information.\u201d Section 1306(a), in applicable part, reads, \u201cno disclosure . . . shall be made except as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.\u201d As noted above, we read this language quoted from 42. U.S.C. \u00a7 1306 as giving a broad grant of authority to the Secretary specifically to enact regulations providing <em>for release of information </em>filed with the agency, at least when such disclosure serves the purposes described in the Medicare statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Concerning the purpose of the disputed regulation, the Secretary has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">\u201cThe current decision to make the entire cost report available to the public is due in part to our conviction that the reimbursement of provider costs under Medicare, the amount of which is determined through analysis of cost report data, is a public business and, as such, the records involved in the process of implementing this part of the Medicare program are really public records. Providers participating in the Medicare program received a total of $6,821,463,000 for fiscal year 1973. Since such a considerable amount of public funds is invested in these hospitals the right of the public to assure themselves that these funds are being properly paid would seem evident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX-\">The commitment of the Congress to provide the public with access to information about the quality of health care services rendered by providers in the Medicare program was reflected in section 299D of the 1972 Amendments (P.L. 92-603). That provision required that survey reports be made available so that the public could be aware of the existence or absence of deficiencies. Disclosure of cost report information could also help serve this goal by giving the public knowledge of the financial commitment of providers to certain departments or services, as well as the financial stability of the provider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Medicare fraud on the part of unscrupulous providers has placed a heavy burden on the federal courts. The responsibility of the Secretary for maintaining the integrity of the agency in making payments of nearly seven billion dollars to thousands of providers scattered throughout the nation for care of literally millions of the most helpless of our citizens is staggering.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">When an agency of government is directly empowered by Congress to disclose information by regulation and does so in accordance with formal rulemaking with the avowed purpose of promoting honest handling and employment of nearly seven billion dollars allocated by Congress to help the aged, the disabled and the ill, we believe that there is a \u201cnexus\u201d between the statutory authorization and the disclosure regulation. We therefore hold that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979) is \u201cauthorized by law\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">In what we have said above, we have considered all of the case law written on this issue since the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Chrysler </em>opinion. <em>Chrysler Corporation v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). While we have recognized that the issue is not beyond argument, we believe that the views of Judge Munson in <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Health Center v. Blue Cross of Central New York, </em>affirmed by the Second Circuit, 614 F.2d 1290 (2d Cir. 1979), represent a better analysis than does Judge Will\u2019s contrary views skillfully expressed in <em>Hospital Affiliates International, Inc. v. Califano, </em>No. 77C3088, (N.D.Ill., Sept. 28, 1979) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">We also accept the Second Circuit\u2019s rationale rejecting the D.C. District Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Washington Hospital Center v. Mutual of Omaha, </em>No. 78 \u2014 2485 (D.C.D.C., May 16, 1979 and June 25, 1979) (unpublished). We are in agreement with the Second Circuit\u2019s conclusion that Congress\u2019 refusal to adopt an amendment in 1972 proposed by Senator Ribicoff which would have <em>required </em>disclosure of the Provider Cost Reports does not mean that Congress intended to prohibit disclosure. Like the Second Circuit, \u201cwe agree with Judge Mun-son that the congressional, refusal to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>disclosure indicates not an intention to prohibit disclosure, but rather an intention to leave that decision to the discretion of HEW. The agency exercised that discretion affirmatively in promulgating its regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435.\u201d <em>Id </em>Finally, we note that the Fifth Circuit has indicated general support for the views expressed in this opinion. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Inc. v. Harris, </em>604 F.2d 407 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">As to the second stated question concerning whether 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979) is arbitrary and capricious, we believe that most of what has been said so far argues for a negative answer. Whatever the merits of the Secretary\u2019s case, however, we do not wish to ignore the importance of appellees\u2019 claims of competitive disadvantage resulting to them from the public disclosure through Provider Cost Reports. There are three possible answers, however, to these claims. First, these providers are not required by law to furnish care which is subject to government reimbursement. If they operated on only private funds, their entrepreneurial privacy would remain intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Second, if they wish to serve Medicare supported patients, they can offset any competitive disadvantage by seeking disclosure of their competitors\u2019 Provider Cost Reports. Third, if there is some residual resulting competitive disadvantage, in this court\u2019s view it is enormously outweighed by the public advantage of having such huge amounts of public funds expended under public gaze.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">For these reasons we hold that the Secretary\u2019s actions in issuing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 and in releasing appellee nursing home\u2019s Provider Cost Reports thereunder are not arbitrary and capricious, or otherwise in violation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The judgments previously entered in these cases in the District Courts concerned are vacated and the cases are remanded for the entry of orders dismissing the complaints.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\">. In the instant case, plaintiffs principally rely on Exemptions 3 and 4, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8h\">\u201c(b) [FOIA] does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-11\">(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-17\">(4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3), (4) (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\">. \u00a7 1905.
