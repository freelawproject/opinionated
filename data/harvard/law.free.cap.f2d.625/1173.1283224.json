Notice of this appeal was filed (March 31,1980) more than six months after the entry of final judgment in the court below (September 11, 1979), but within sixty days of the court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial (February 5, 1980). That motion was not served until October 15, 1979 \u2014 thirty-four days after the entry of final judgment, and twenty-three days beyond the ten day delay allowable for such motions. For reasons to be stated, although a <em>timely </em>motion for a new trial will prevent the running of the sixty day delay period for appeal, an <em>untimely </em>motion will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>The appellant brought this action for judicial review of the final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services denying her claim for social security disability benefits. On September 11, 1979, the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas entered its final judgment granting the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On October 18, 1979, i the appellant filed a \u201cMotion for Rehearing\u201d (new trial), asking the district court to set aside its judgment and upon reconsideration to deny the summary judgment and remand the case to the Secretary for a new hearing. On February 5, 1980, the district court denied the appellant\u2019s motion, and the appellant filed notice of her appeal on March 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">In civil cases in which the United States or an officer thereof is a party, notice of appeal must be filed within sixty days of the date of entry of the judgment appealed from. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1). The delay period for appeal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Illinois Department of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 561, 54 L.Ed.2d 521, <em>rehearing denied, </em>434 U.S. 1089, 98 S.Ct. 1286, 55 L.Ed.2d 795 (1978); <em>Edwards v. Joyner, </em>566 F.2d 960, 961 (5th Cir. 1978). It is, however, tolled by the timely filing of a motion pursuant to Rule 52(b) (to amend or make additional findings of fact and to amend the judgment accordingly), or to Rule 59 (for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and it commences anew from the denial of such motion. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">As a general rule, the untimely filing of such motions will not toll the running of the delay period for appeal. <em>Browder v. Director, Illinois Department of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. at 264-65, 98 S.Ct. at 561; <em>Martin v. Wainwright, </em>469 F.2d 1072, 1073 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert denied, </em>411 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 1538,36 L.Ed.2d 199 (1973). However, an exception to this rule has been recognized allowing an appeals court to assume jurisdiction of an untimely appeal when there is a showing of \u201cunique circumstances\u201d that would render it unfair to dismiss the appeal. <em>Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., </em>371 U.S. 215, 217, 83 S.Ct. 283, 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1962); <em>Chipser v. Kohlmeyer &amp; Co., </em>600 F.2d 1061, 1063 (5th Cir. 1979). <em>See Eady v. Foerder, </em>381 F.2d 980 (7th Cir. 1967); 4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure; \u2014 Civil \u00a7 1168 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establish a strict ten day delay period for the serving of motions under Rule 52 and Rule 59(b) and (e). Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b), 59(b) &amp; (e). These periods, too, are jurisdictional, <em>see Martin v. Wainwright, </em>469 F.2d at 1073, and cannot be extended in the discretion of the district court. Fed.R. Civ.P. 6(b). As Wright &amp; Miller point out, however, the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine has been used by circuit courts of appeal to temper the strict requirements of Rule 6(b), and to allow untimely appeal, when the appellant has reasonably relied upon a district court\u2019s erroneous extension of the time allowed for filing Rule 52 or Rule 59 motions, or its entertaining of such motions despite their untimeliness. 4 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">In the instant case, the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was served some thirty-four days after the entry of final judgment in the district court \u2014 well beyond the ten day period provided in Rule 59. Thus, it must be held to have been untimely and insufficient to have interrupted the running of the sixty day delay period for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">Application of the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine would be particularly inappropriate with regard to this appellant. Having waited, with no apparent good reason, for more than three times the allowable delay period before serving her motion for a new trial, and having faced the appellee\u2019s objection to the untimeliness of her motion (an objection raised within the sixty day period allowed for appeal), she was clearly on notice that her motion was not timely and that the delay period for appeal had not been interrupted, and any reliance she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>might have placed on the district court\u2019s entertaining of her motion can hardly be characterized as reasonable. 4 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1168, at 641 &amp; n. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Since the applicable delay period has run, this court is without jurisdiction to hear this appeal and must therefore dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
