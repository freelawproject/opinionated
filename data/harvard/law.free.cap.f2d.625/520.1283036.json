Kirksey, </em>585 F.2d 708 (5th Cir. 1978). We instructed the district court to \u201capply the precepts set forth by this court sitting en banc in <em>Zimmer v. McKeithen, </em>485 F.2d 1297 (5th Cir. 1973) (en banc), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, </em>424 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (1976).\" <em>Id., </em>at 712. The district court has made its <em>Zimmer </em>findings; meanwhile, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Mobile, Ala. v. </em>Bolden,- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), has cast some doubt on the continued vitality of the <em>Zimmer </em>rationale, as explicated in <em>Nevett v. Sides, </em>571 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S.-, 100 S.Ct. 2916, 65 L.Ed.2d-(1980) <em>(Nevett II), </em>as the appropriate approach to be taken, in this circuit, in analyzing the evidence in voter-dilution cases to determine whether purposeful discrimination has occurred within the meaning of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Accordingly, we remand the case once again to enable the district court to reexamine the evidence, and its findings, in the light of <em>City of Mobile, Ala. v. Bolden, supra, </em>and to entertain any application plaintiffs may care to make to present further evidence on their claim that the at-large method of electing the county commissioners is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The district court shall accomplish the proceedings on remand within 30 days of receipt of the mandate, which shall issue forthwith. We continue to retain jurisdiction over the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
