Soo Line\u2019s application sought the abandonment of 50 miles of branch line located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that public convenience and necessity required abandonment of approximately 20 miles of the line but required continued operation on the balance of the line. Division 1 of the ICC affirmed and adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings with slight modification. No. AB-57 (Sub-No. 7), <em>Soo Line Railroad Company-Abandonment Between Baraga (Baraga County) and Calument and Lake Linden (Houghton County), Michigan, </em>decided June 7, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">The ICC found that even if Soo Line\u2019s avoidable annual loss on the branch line was $123,400, as claimed by the railroad, full abandonment would not be authorized based on the \u201csevere impact\u201d to the area. Division 1 also noted that this burden was being placed on \u201ca successful and financially sound railroad.\u201d However, the Commission in considering the burden placed on Soo Line specifically refused to consider \u201cvaluation of [the line\u2019s] assets\u201d (opportunity costs) and \u201cevidence relating to reproduction costs.\u201d Consideration of opportunity costs would, according to Soo Line, double the avoidable annual loss incurred by it in the operation of this branch line.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Recently, this court held in <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad v. United States, </em>625 F.2d 178 (8th Cir. 1980) that the ICC should consider \u201copportunity costs\u201d and should use replacement value rather than book value when evaluating abandonment applications. Therefore, we remand this case to Division 1 of the ICC for reconsideration consistent with this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
