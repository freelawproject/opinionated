JOHNSON, Jr. and HENDERSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b642-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">In this case involving a two-count conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and importation, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 952(a), defendant challenges first, the admission for impeachment purposes of illegally obtained statements; second, a jury instruction on deliberate ignorance; and third, the sufficiency of the evidence. Concluding these contentions lack merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">Defendant arrived at the Miami International Airport on a flight from Calle, Colombia, South America. A customs inspector noticed that the sides of one of defendant\u2019s two suitcases, which contained men\u2019s clothing, a poncho,- blankets and coffee, were unusually thick. Customs agents drilled holes in the walls of the suitcases, and found cocaine hidden in a formica compartment behind the suitcases\u2019 lining.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-18\">Defendant, a Colombian who had lived in the United States for nine years, testified he traveled to Colombia to visit his ailing grandmother. While there, he met Juan Torres, an acquaintance from Miami, who sold defendant the two suitcases. Torres, defendant testified, had asked defendant to bring coffee, blankets and ponchos to Torres\u2019 family in the United States. Defendant testified he was unaware the suitcases contained cocaine, and that nothing about the bags raised any suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-19\">First, defendant challenges the introduction by the Government of certain statements made by him to a DEA agent shortly after his arrest. The district court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>previously granted a motion to suppress the statements as having been obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. After defendant testified, however, the court allowed the statements to be introduced on rebuttal. The statements conflicted with defendant\u2019s trial testimony regarding the details of his agreement with Torres and tended to impeach his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Since the filing of defendant\u2019s brief, the Supreme Court, overruling the prior precedent in this Circuit, <em>United States v. Havens, </em>592 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1979), has held that a defendant\u2019s credibility may be impeached by a prior conflicting statement, even though the statement could not be used to establish the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">[A] defendant\u2019s statements made in response to proper cross-examination reasonably suggested by the defendant\u2019s direct examination are subject to otherwise proper impeachment by the government, albeit by evidence that has been illegally obtained that is inadmissible on the government\u2019s direct case, or otherwise, as substantive evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>United States v. </em>Havens,-U. S. -, -, 100 S.Ct. 1912, 1917, 64 L.Ed.2d 559, 566 (1980). The questions which elicited defendant\u2019s responses here during cross-examination were within the confines of his direct testimony. Use of the suppressed statements for impeachment purposes was proper. The district court, moreover, gave an appropriate limiting instruction. Reversal is not warranted on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Second, defendant challenges the district court\u2019s so-called \u201cdeliberate avoidance of positive knowledge\u201d charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">A defendant who has knowledge that he possesses a controlled substance may have the state of mind necessary for conviction even if he does not know what controlled substance he possesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">The Defendant has testified he had no knowledge. Now, in this connection bear in mind that one may not willfully and intentionally remain ignorant of a fact important and material to his conduct, in order to escape the consequences of the criminal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-13\">If you find from all of the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the De-, fendant believed that he had cocaine or a controlled substance and deliberately and consciously tried to avoid learning that there was cocaine or a controlled substance in the suitcase he was carrying in order to be able to say, should he be apprehended, that he did not know, you may treat this deliberate avoidance of positive knowledge as the equivalent of knowledge, unless you find that the Defendant actually believed that he was not carrying cocaine or a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_Z\">In other words, you may find the Defendant acted knowingly if you find that either he actually knew he had cocaine or that he deliberately closed his eyes to what he had every reason to believe was the fact. I should like to emphasize, ladies and gentlemen, that the requisite knowledge cannot be established by demonstrating merely intelligence or even foolishness on the part of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">Conceding the instruction is appropriate .under certain circumstances, defendant argues the charge here was improper because the facts do not support a finding that defendant had the knowledge necessary to trigger a finding of a purposeful attempt to avoid learning what was contained in the two suitcases. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">The facts here presented a sufficient predicate to allow the jury to consider whether defendant either knew or had consciously avoided learning that the suitcases contained a controlled substance. Defendant\u2019s complicated explanation of why he did not possess luggage of his own, the lengths to which Torres had gone to assist him in obtaining the luggage in question, the lack of explicit arrangements for the delivery of the ponchos, blankets and coffee, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>with defendant\u2019s differing versions of the acquisition and planned disposition of the suitcase, was a sufficient' basis on which to allow the jury to consider either actual knowledge or deliberate ignorance thereof. Defendant\u2019s testimony about how he came into possession of the suitcases in which the cocaine was carefully concealed certainly pointed in the direction of deliberate ignorance. <em>United States v. Batencort, </em>592 F.2d 916, 917-18 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In a similar context, we have previously held that a \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d instruction was sufficient to apprise the jury of the knowledge component of the charge if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A59\">(1) he knew he was importing cocaine or a controlled substance, or (2) he believed he was importing a controlled substance and through willful blindness failed to confirm that belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>United States v. Restrepo-Granda, </em>575 F.2d 524, 529 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 935, 99 S.Ct. 331, 58 L.Ed.2d 332 (1978). The jury here was entitled to fit defendant\u2019s testimony into the second category. The charge was properly balanced and was not error. <em>See generally </em>R. Perkins, Criminal Law 776-77 (2d ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Finally, defendant questions the sufficiency of the evidence. The jury was free to resolve any credibility choices against defendant, especially considering the inconsistencies between defendant\u2019s trial testimony and his post-arrest statements. Considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the Government, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction on both counts. <em>See United States v. Sindin, </em>620 F.2d 87, 90-91 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
