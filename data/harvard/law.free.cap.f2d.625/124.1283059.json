These claims arise from money which plaintiffs Tucker and St. John at different times paid to one, Daniel L. Firestone, under contract by which Firestone was to furnish them Kodak films, supplies and sales materials. Plaintiffs admit that Firestone never said he was an agent for Kodak in plaintiffs\u2019 transactions with him and that the contracts contained no references to Kodak except to the extent of describing the materials to be furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">These two suits were continued against Kodak after both plaintiffs had settled their fraud claims against Daniel L. Firestone. In a thorough review of the undisputed facts disclosed by the depositions and exhibits, Judge Duncan granted summary judgment holding that \u201cKodak had engaged in no act which would allow a reasonably prudent man to conclude that Firestone had the authority to act on behalf of Kodak. Moreover, neither is Kodak estopped from denying any allegation of Firestone\u2019s agency.\u201d He also held that the record discloses that Kodak had exercised \u201cdue diligence\u201d in relation to making it known that Firestone was not a Kodak agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">For these reasons and others set forth in the opinion and orders of District Judge Robert Duncan filed October 27,1977 in the Tucker case and November 21, 1977, and September 14,1978 in the St. John case, the summary judgments in both cases are hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
