Kenneth Robertson was injured in January, 1969 in the course of his employment. His employer, Todd Shipyards, voluntarily paid $24,275 compensation for temporary total disability from the date of injury until October, 1976. Todd Shipyards then ceased making these voluntary payments because it had exceeded the statutory maximum of $24,000 for temporary total disability incurred prior to the 1972 amendments to the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robertson then filed a claim seeking compensation for permanent total disability. A formal hearing, as provided in \u00a7 19 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919, was held on November 18, 1976. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Robertson was permanently totally disabled as of October 28, 1976, the date on which Todd Shipyards had terminated payments. The ALJ awarded compensation accordingly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ordered that Todd pay Robertson\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Robertson sought reconsideration, arguing that his disability had commenced much earlier than October, 1976. The ALJ law judge thereafter amended his decision and order to show that Robertson\u2019s disability commenced on September 30,1976, the date on which the $24,000 statutory maximum had been reached. The remaining $275 was credited against the award for permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The determination of the date of permanent total disability was critical, since \u00a7 10(h) of the Act, a provision added by the 1972 amendments, entitles a claimant who was permanently disabled prior to the date of the amendments to an initial adjustment in the applicable compensation rate and to annual adjustments in compensation. Robertson therefore appealed to the BRB, claiming that the ALJ\u2019s determination of the date of Robertson\u2019s disability was arbitrary and erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Robertson and the Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, filed a joint stipulation to the BRB in which they agreed that the ALJ had erred and that Robertson was permanently totally disabled prior to the enactment of the 1972 amendments. They requested that the judge\u2019s amended order be vacated and the case remanded for entry of an order finding that Robertson\u2019s disability occurred prior to the enactment of the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">The BRB declined to accept the stipulations, denied the motion to remand, and required Robertson to file a brief on the merits of his case. In its decision, the BRB explained that it is not empowered to reweigh the evidence and cannot review an ALJ\u2019s findings of fact without being briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">On the basis of briefs filed by both parties, the BRB concluded that the ALJ\u2019s finding was erroneous,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and modified it to find that Robertson\u2019s permanent total disability commenced prior to the enactment of the 1972 amendments. The Director\u2019s response brief had concurred on this point, but the Director had opposed Robertson\u2019s request that his attorney\u2019s fee on appeal to the BRB be paid from the special fund. The BRB concluded that the fee was to be paid from the fund because burdening the claimant with his attorney\u2019s fee would violate the purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">The Director appeals the fee award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">Ordinarily, our standard of review in BRB cases is quite limited: we must affirm unless the BRB\u2019s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole or is contrary to applicable law. <em>Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Co., </em>330 U.S. 469, 478, 67 S.Ct. 801, 806, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947); <em>Cordero v. Triple A Machine Shop, </em>580 F.2d 1331, 1333 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 911, 99 S.Ct. 1223, 59 L.Ed.2d 459 (1979). While we may undertake a more searching review where, as here, the Director opposes the BRB\u2019s decision, <em>Director, etc. v. National Van Lines, Inc., </em>613 F.2d 972, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1979), we find it unnecessary to do so in this case because the BRB\u2019s decision is clearly contrary to applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">It is well established under the American Rule that a party may not generally recover attorney\u2019s fees absent statutory authorization or a contract providing for an award. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 257, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1621, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>Reiser v. Del Monte Properties Co., </em>605 F.2d 1135, 1137 (9th Cir. 1979). In the instant case, the statute does not provide for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>payment of counsel fees from the fund and there is no applicable contract. Nor does this case fall within one of the established exceptions to the American Rule. Consequently, the BRB erred as a matter of law in ordering the payment of counsel fees from the fund, and we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s assertions, the Act does not provide for the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees to all successful claimants. Section 28 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> limits the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to those cases in which the employer or carrier disputes the existence or extent of an obligation to pay compensation. It is the employer or carrier who must pay the claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee in those cases, and not the special fund. Section 44(j) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(j), provides that the proceeds of the fund shall be available for (1) payment of the initial and subsequent annual adjustments in compensation for total and permanent disability or death which occurred prior to the effective date of the 1972 amendments, (2) payment of additional compensation for injury increasing disability, assistance for employees undergoing vocational rehabilitation and payment for medical treatment where the employer defaults, (3) reimbursement to the Treasury, and (4) defraying the expenses of medical examinations. It does not provide for the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress clearly recognized that the responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>for fees would occasionally fall on claimants, since it provided that approved<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> attorneys\u2019 fees, \u201c. . .in cases in which the obligation to pay the fee is upon the claimant, may be made a lien upon the compensation due under an award . . . \u00a7 28(c) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(c). Thus, although the intent of Congress in passing the Act was to aid* longshoremen, <em>Reed v. S.S. Yaka, </em>373 U.S. 410, 415, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 1353, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963), Congress did not intend that aid to extend to the payment of attorneys' fees in other than limited circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Moreover, this court has previously recognized the limitations on counsel fee awards under \u00a7 28. In <em>Portland Stevedoring Co. v. Director, </em>552 F.2d 293 (9th Cir. 1977), we reversed the BRB\u2019s order for fees on appeal against the employer when the BRB\u2019s order had not established the existence or extent of the employer\u2019s liability. We held that \u00a7 28 \u201c. . . provides for direct payment of attorney\u2019s fees by an employer only when a claim involving the existence or extent of liability is resisted by an employer and is subsequently successfully prosecuted by claimant\u2019s attorney.\u201d <em>Id. at 294. </em>Similarly, in <em>National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. U.S. Dept. of Labor, </em>606 F.2d 875 (9th Cir. 1979), we held that Congress intended to limit liability for counsel fees to cases in which the parties disagreed on the existence or extent of liability. <em>Id. </em>at 882. The case before us simply did not involve such a dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The claimant also points to \u00a7 44(j)(2) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(j)(2), in support of his contention that awarding him his attorney\u2019s fee from the special fund is not repugnant to the purposes of the fund. His reliance on that provision is misplaced. That subsection, in part, provides that the proceeds of the fund shall be available for payments under \u00a7 39(c) of the Act. Section 39(c)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 939(c)(1), grants the Secretary of Labor discretion to provide \u201clegal assistance in processing a claim.\u201d Robertson, however, is not requesting assistance <em>in processing his claim ; </em>rather, he is requesting an award for fees after he has himself obtained legal assistance and has fully processed his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">This interpretation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the language of \u00a7 39(c)(1) is supported by the legislative history of the 1972 amendments, which indicates that Congress intended the provision to empower the Secretary to provide legal <em>counsel </em>in needy cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-15\">The bill also makes legal assistance in processing the claim for benefits under this Act available in needy cases upon request subject to the Secretary\u2019s discretion. It is the committee\u2019s desire that the Secretary construe this provision as liberally as possible so as to provide any work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>er in need of legal assistance such counsel</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">H.R.Rep. No. 92-1441, <em>supra </em>at 13, reprinted in [1972] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4698, 4710 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, the Act does not provide for' the payment of attorney\u2019s fees from the special fund, and the American Rule therefore operates to preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees from the fund in the usual case. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 247, 95 S.Ct. at 1616. Several exceptions to the American Rule have developed, however, based on the \u201cequitable powers of the court ... to award attorneys\u2019 fees when \u2018overriding considerations of justice seem to compel such a result\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Reiser v. Del Monte Properties Co., supra, </em>605 F.2d at 1137, <em>citing Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>386 U.S. 714, 718, 87 S.Ct. 1404, 1407, 18 L.Ed.2d 475 (1967). Exceptions have been established for cases in which the claimant\u2019s action results in a substantial benefit to others or in the creation or recovery of a fund in which others were \u2022 interested, where the losing party has acted in bad faith, or where the defendant in a contempt action has wilfully violated a court order. <em>Reiser v. Del Monte Properties Co., supra, </em>605 F.2d at 1137-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Robertson appears to claim that he is entitled to counsel fees under the \u201cbad faith\u201d exception. He argues that the BRB precluded an early resolution of the controversy by requiring briefing rather than relying on the stipulation by Robertson and the Director, thereby forcing him to incur further fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">This argument must fail. The \u201cbad faith\u201d exception provides for the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees when the losing party has acted vexatiously or oppressively, and the rationale underlying the exception is therefore punitive. <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 5, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 1946, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973); <em>Reiser </em>v. <em>Del Monte Properties Co., supra, </em>605 F.2d at 1137. There is simply no reason for punitive action here. Even if there were any evidence of bad faith on the part of the BRB in requiring briefing, the BRB is not Robertson\u2019s opponent here, as the BRB would not be the losing party were we to sustain the award of fees from the special fund. <em>See Hall v. Cole, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 5, 93 S.Ct. at 1946; <em>Union Bank v. Winnebago, </em>528 F.2d 95, 99 (9th Cir. 1975). Robertson\u2019s adversary in this litigation is the Director, and there is no evidence in the record of any vexatious conduct on the Director\u2019s part; on the contrary, the Director supported Robertson\u2019s contention that the ALJ\u2019s decision was arbitrary and erroneous. Similarly, there is no evidence in the record to support an argument that the Director\u2019s position in this lawsuit was undertaken in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Furthermore, even if we were to countenance a transfer of motive from the BRB to the Director, there is no evidence in the record to support a finding of bad faith on the part of the BRB. Most obviously, it was. the BRB which awarded Robertson his attorney\u2019s fee. Additionally, there is no evidence that the BRB acted in bad faith in requiring briefing by the claimant. The BRB refused to review the ALJ\u2019s findings without being briefed because it was precluded from doing so under applicable regulations. These regulations provide that the Board cannot engage in a de <em>novo </em>review of a case before it, but must affirm if the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.301 (1979).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ther regulations provide that a notice of appeal must be filed with the BRB, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.201, followed by a petition for review containing \u201ca statement indicating the specific contentions of the petitioner and describing with particularity the substantial questions of law or fact to be raised by the appeal.\u201d 20 C.F.R \u00a7 802.210. A brief or other statement is to accompany such a petition for review. <em>Id. </em>These regulations apply to all appeals, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.101,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the BRB was therefore merely following applicable regulations in denying the Director\u2019s motion to vacate the finding of the ALJ based on the submission of a stipulation. Whatever we may think of the efficiency of these procedures as applied in this case, the BRB\u2019s adherence to them can in no way support a finding of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Robertson would have us create a new exception to the American Rule to allow the fee award to stand. He relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., supra, </em>in which the Court held that exceptions have been sustained where compelled by \u201coverriding considerations of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>386 U.S. at 718, 87 S.Ct. at 1407. Robertson correctly points out that exceptions have not been developed in the context of statutory causes of action for which the legislature has prescribed intricate remedies, <em>id. </em>at 719, 87 S.Ct. at 1407,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and adds that the remedies available under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act are not at all complex. We are unconvinced, however, that the mere fact the Robertson\u2019s statutory remedies are not complex compels us to create a new exception to the American Rule. This case simply fails to present the kind of circumstances which would prompt us to forge such an exception. <em>See Locklin v. Day-Glo Color Corp. </em>468 F.2d 1359, 1361 (9th Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">While we recognize that the policy of the Act is to aid longshoremen and harbor workers,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we have noted that Congress provided for the payment of counsel fees in certain situations and we therefore infer that Congress concluded that those fee provisions adequately protect workers covered by the Act. Essentially, Robertson\u2019s complaint is that it is unfair to burden him with the costs of his appeal to the BRB; as such, he is merely restating the frequently repeated criticism of the American Rule. Of course, as the Supreme Court reiterated in <em>F.D. Rich Co. v. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 131, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2166, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974), we are not free to rewrite the American Rule in the face of this criticism. See <em>id. </em>at 128-129, 94 S.Ct. at 2164-2165. The <em>Rich </em>case involved a claim under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270a <em>et seq. </em>Although that statute provides that claimants should receive \u201csums justly due,\u201d 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270b, the Supreme Court held that counsel fees were not recoverable by claimants unless they present a case which falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the American Rule. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 94 S.Ct. at 2164. The fact that Miller Act claimants would not be made whole unless fee-shifting were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>permitted was not persuasive to the Court, as that is simply the consequence of adherence to the American Rule. The Court was unwilling to \u201csubstantially undercut the apr plication of the American Rule\u201d in Miller Act commercial litigation, <em>id. </em>at 131, 94 S.Ct. at 2166, and we are similarly unwilling to undercut the Rule\u2019s application in Longshoremen\u2019s Act litigation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">We therefore grant the petition for review and reverse the order of the Benefits Review Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-11\">.

Several circuits have held the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund liable for attorney\u2019s fees incurred by claimants of black lung benefits whose last coal mine employment terminated prior to 1970. <em>See Director, etc. v. Black Diamond Coal Co., </em>598 F.2d 945 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Director, etc. v. Leckie Smokeless Coal Co., </em>598 F.2d 881 (4th Cir. 1979); <em>Director, etc. v.

The statute which created that fund, the Federal Coal Mine Health &amp; Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq., was amended in 1978, and \u00a7 28(a) of the Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a), <em>(see </em>footnote 3, supra), was incorporated by reference. A separate section was added, however, providing that references to the <em>employer </em>in the Longshoremen\u2019s Act are to be considered to refer to the <em>trustees </em>of the black lung fund. Those circuits which have considered the issue have held that these provisions constitute specific statutory authorization for the award of counsel fees from the fund. Since the trustees of the black lung fund are substituted for the employers in \u00a7 28(a) of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, the black lung fund is liable for counsel fees if the conditions precedent to liability set out in \u00a7 28(a), <em>i. e., </em>the employer controverts the existence of extent or liability and the claimant utilizes an attorney in the successful prosecution of his claim, are satisfied.

We are mindful of our duty to construe this provision and all other provisions of the Act liberally in light of the Act\u2019s purpose. <em>See id.; Reed v. S.S. Yaka, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 415, 83 S.Ct. at 1353. We cannot, however, disregard the plain meaning of the statute or its legislative history, nor may we create rights not given or implied by the terms of the Act. <em>See Maryland Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. v. Jenkins, </em>594 F.2d 404, 406 (4th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b943-10\">. The claimant also points to the discretionary use of proceeds by the Secretary provided by \u00a7 39(c)(2) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 939(c)(2). That section, however, concerns rehabilitation services only and is therefore inapplicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b943-11\">. The BRB incorrectly relied on the case of <em>South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, </em>104 F.2d 522 (7th Cir. 1939), <em>aff'd, </em>309 U.S. 251, 60 S.Ct. 544, 84 L.Ed. 732 (1940), for the proposition that it could not reweigh the evidence in the record. That case held that the <em>court </em>could not reweigh the evidence but was restricted to a review of the record for substantial evidence supporting the decision of the ALJ. <em>Id. </em>at 528. This error does not affect our result, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>since BRB regulations provide for the same restricted review by the BRB as is required of the courts by the <em>South Chicago Coal </em>case. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record which would support an inference that the BRB\u2019s reliance on the case was in bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.219 allows the BRB to set up informal procedures to be followed by a party to an appeal who is not represented by counsel. Since Robertson was represented by an attorney at all relevant times, this section is irrelevant to our discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b944-8\">. In <em>Fieischmann, </em>the Court held that courts may not award counsel fees in trademark cases brought under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127, and cited the \u201cmeticulously detailed\u201d remedies available to a plaintiff who proves that his valid trademark has been infringed. <em>Id. </em>386 U.S. at 719, 87 S.Ct. at 1407.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b944-12\">. We are further restrained from forging a new exception by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Alyeska, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 262, 95 S.Ct. at 1624: \u201c.
