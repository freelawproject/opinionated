The district court, 437 F.Supp. 628, held that because Fireman\u2019s Fund would recover from the settlement an amount equal to the benefits it paid Brown under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, it should pay a portion of the attorney fees incurred by Brown in obtaining the settlement. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-19\">On March 24, 1973 Felix Brown, an employee of Western Stevedoring and Terminal Corporation, was injured while working as a longshoreman on board the vessel <em>Indian Mail. </em>The District Court for the District of Oregon determined that 80% of the injury was caused by the vessel owner\u2019s negligence and 20% was caused by Western\u2019s negligence. Brown and the vessel owner settled the action for $65,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-20\">Between the date of the injury and the date of the settlement, Fireman\u2019s Fund (Western\u2019s insurer for benefits under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act) paid Brown $23,311.72 for lost wages and medical expenses. Because Fireman\u2019s Fund did not consent to Brown\u2019s third party settlement, it was not liable to Brown for any future benefits and its lien against Brown\u2019s settlement was fixed at $23,311.72. Brown claimed, and the district court held, that Fireman\u2019s Fund should pay a pro-rata share of the attorney\u2019s fees he incurred in obtaining the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that a vessel owner can be sued for the injury of a longshoreman by either the longshoreman or, if the longshoreman fails to bring suit within six months after a compensation award has been filed, by the longshoreman\u2019s employer. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b). When an employer brings suit, the Act states that the employer is to retain from any settlement an amount equal to the expenses incurred in obtaining the recovery, including attorney\u2019s fees, in addition to all benefits paid to the injured longshoreman. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(e). The Act is silent, however, on who should pay the attorney\u2019s fees incurred when an injured longshoreman recovers an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The Supreme Court resolved this issue in <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>445 U.S. 74, 100 S.Ct. 925, 63 L.Ed.2d 215 (1980). There, an injured longshoreman settled a personal injury claim against a vessel owner for $60,000. Liberty Mutual requested that its $17,152.83 compensation lien be paid in full out of Bloomer\u2019s recovery. Bloomer argued, however, that Liberty Mutual should pay a proportionate share of his attorney\u2019s fees. The Supreme Court held that Bloomer could not recover a portion of the attorney\u2019s fees and that Liberty Mutual could recover its compensation lien in full. The court concluded that Congress could not have intended a distribution scheme which differed substantially from that set forth in section 33(e) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(e), which allows an employer to recover its compensation lien in full in addition to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees when it brings a third party suit on behalf of an injured longshoreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Prior to <em>Bloomer v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., supra, </em>we adopted the pro-rata rule which was properly applied by the district court. <em>Bachtel v. Mammoth Bulk Carriers, Ltd., </em>605 F.2d 438 (9th Cir. 1979). <em>Bachtel </em>is now overruled insofar as it conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bloomer, supra. </em>We reverse and remand for application of the rule announced in <em>Bloomer v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
