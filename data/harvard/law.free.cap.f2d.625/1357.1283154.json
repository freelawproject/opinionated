The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> issued the injunction on the ground that UTU was engaged in secondary picketing outlawed by the Railway Labor Act. The principal issues on appeal are (1) whether the district court had jurisdiction to issue the injunction, and, if so, (2) whether issuing the injunction was an abuse of discretion. A threshold issue is whether the appeal is moot inasmuch as the strike underlying the picketing has ended. We reach the merits and affirm the action of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">Appellee AD&amp;N sought injunctive relief when UTU, on strike against the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad Company (hereinafter Rock Island), began to picket AD&amp;N and induce its employees to leave their jobs. This picketing was in response to AD&amp;N\u2019s use of managerial personnel to move the freight of an affiliated railroad in Rock Island\u2019s railroad yard at Fordyce, Arkansas. AD&amp;N has about seventy-five employees, some of whom belong to UTU. But, at the time the picketing occurred, UTU and AD&amp;N had no dispute over the pay or working conditions of AD&amp;N employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">The material facts are not in dispute. AD&amp;N is owned by the Georgia-Pacific Company, which makes wood-based products. AD&amp;N operates on about forty miles of track between the Arkansas towns of Monticelli and Crosset. AD&amp;N serves several customers along this route. Its principal customers are the Georgia-Pacific processing plants around Crosset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">About fifty miles from Crosset is For-dyce, where Georgia-Pacific owns and operates both a mill and a one-engine, two-man railroad, the Fordyce &amp; Princeton Railway Company (F&amp;P). F&amp;P leases freight cars from other railroads and transports them over the half-mile track between the mill and the railroad yard at Fordyce. During the relevant period, this yard was owned by Rock Island, which leased facilities to F&amp;P and to the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company (hereinafter Cotton Belt). By a trackage agreement, Rock Island permitted F&amp;P and Cotton Belt to use specified Rock Island track \u201cfor the purpose of effecting interchange with each other.\u201d UTU was not a signatory to this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-13\">Before the Rock Island strike, F&amp;P would deliver carloads of processed wood to the Fordyce yard and take empty cars back to the mill. Rock Island or Cotton Belt employees would deliver empty cars to the yard. Rock Island employees would pick up loaded cars to be routed via Rock Island, Cotton Belt employees would pick up cars to be routed via Cotton Belt. About 150 cars were interchanged each day in the Fordyce yard, with F&amp;P\u2019s interchanges accounting for about fifteen to twenty of that number.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-14\">In late August of 1979, UTU, after exhausting conciliation proceedings required by the Railway Labor Act, began a lawful strike against Rock Island and posted pickets at Rock Island\u2019s Fordyce depot. This depot was beside the Rock Island track that linked F&amp;P with the Cotton Belt and Rock Island lines. Although not themselves on strike, Cotton belt employees refused to cross UTU\u2019s picket line to interchange cars between Cotton Belt and F&amp;P. F&amp;P's employees similarly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-15\">In response to this development, AD&amp;N and F&amp;P \u2014 which had common management \u2014 dispatched three or four AD&amp;N officers from Crosset to move the F&amp;P freight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From August 31 to September 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>AD&amp;N officers operated the F&amp;P locomotive to move cars over the Rock Island track specified in the Rock Island-Cotton Belt-F&amp;P trackage agreement. Sometimes, because of congestion on this track, the AD&amp;N officers used Rock Island\u2019s main track to effect the interchange. The officers also transferred to Cotton Belt some cars that would have been carried by Rock Island in the absence of a strike. The officers did not advance Rock Island freight cars for the benefit of any other Rock Island customer; their aim was to maintain F&amp;P\u2019s rail service for Georgia-Pacific\u2019s For-dyce mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\">After recognizing that the workers crossing picket lines at Fordyce were AD&amp;N personnel, UTU sent members to picket the AD&amp;N line near Crosset. At 6:45 p. m. on September 5, UTU members bearing picket signs accosted an AD&amp;N train leaving Cros-set. AD&amp;N employees responded by abandoning the train. At 11:30 p. m. additional UTU pickets appeared at the main entrance of Georgia-Pacific\u2019s Crosset plant complex. The effect of these picket lines was that about sixty of AD&amp;N\u2019s seventy-five employees chose to stay off the job. The remaining employees, supplemented by management personnel, could perform no more than twenty-five percent of AD&amp;N\u2019s regular rail service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">Continual use of the AD&amp;N line was critical to operation of Georgia-Pacific\u2019s Cros-set plants. Each day, AD&amp;N brought in seventy carloads of raw materials to Cros-set and carried out a like amount of finished product. No alternative form of shipment was reasonably available. Because the Crosset plants had few storage facilities, a one or two-day delay in either outgoing or incoming rail shipments would force the plants to shut down. In that event, about 3,000 employees would be out of work. The district court found that trade and public revenues in the surrounding areas would suffer by the loss of millions of dollars per month in wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-8\">On September 6, the day after UTU\u2019s picketing against AD&amp;N began, AD&amp;N posted a $25,000 indemnity bond and secured a temporary restraining order against the picketing. This order remained in effect until September 14, when it was superseded by the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction. In issuing the injunction, the court held that AD&amp;N had met its two-fold burden of establishing the potential for irreparable harm absent immediate injunc-tive relief and a likelihood of success on the merits. As to the latter, the court ruled that UTU\u2019s secondary picketing against AD&amp;N was prohibited by the Railway Labor Act and not protected by the anti-in-junctive provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Important to both rulings was the court\u2019s finding that there was no \u201csubstantial alignment\u201d between AD&amp;N and Rock Island: the court found that AD&amp;N and F&amp;P were only continuing their rail service for Georgia-Pacific, not aiding Rock Island in the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">II. Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-10\">Federal jurisdiction extends only to actual cases and controversies, U.S.Const. art. 3, \u00a7 2, and the case or controversy \u201cmust exist at stages of appellate * * * review, and not simply at the date the action is initiated.\u201d <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 125, 93 S.Ct. 705, 712, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). <em>See SEC v. Medical Committee for Human Rights, </em>404 U.S. 403, 405-07, 92 S.Ct. 577, 579-580, 30 L.Ed.2d 560 (1972). Noting that the UTU-Rock Island strike ended while this appeal was pending, AD&amp;N contends that the termination of the strike deprived UTU of any present interest in the outcome on appeal and argues that UTU\u2019s appeal should therefore be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">We cannot agree. As the party seeking extraordinary injunctive relief, AD&amp;N was required to post a bond to indemnify UTU for any loss UTU might sustain as a result of being wrongfully en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>joined or restrained. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(c). Because UTU has a continuing monetary stake in demonstrating that injunc-tive relief should not have been issued, its appeal is not moot. <em>See Liner v. Jafco, Inc., </em>375 U.S. 301, 305-06, 84 S.Ct. 391, 394-395, 11 L.Ed.2d 347 (1964); <em>Associated General Contractors v. International Union of Operating Engineers Twin City Local No. 49, </em>519 F.2d 269, 271-72 (8th Cir. 1975). <em>See generally American Bible Society v. Blount, </em>446 F.2d 588, 594-96 (3d Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">III. Jurisdiction to Issue Injunctive Relief</p>\n<p id=\"aej-dedup-0\">UTU attacks the district court\u2019s jurisdiction on two alternative grounds. First, UTU contends that this case involved or arose out of a \u201clabor dispute\u201d \u2014 either between UTU and Rock Island or between UTU and AD&amp;N \u2014 within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-115. Accepting that contention would mean that the district court was affirmatively deprived of any jurisdiction it otherwise might have had to issue injunc-tive relief. Second, UTU contends that, even should Norris-LaGuardia not apply, AD&amp;N had no federal right of action for injunctive relief. We reject both contentions and conclude the district court had jurisdiction to issue an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">A. <em>Effect of the Anti-Injunction Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">The Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932 generally removes the jurisdiction of federal courts to issue injunctive relief in \u201cany case involving or growing out of any labor dispute,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. Injunctive relief against secondary picketing in such a case is either absolutely barred, <em>see 29 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a), (e) &amp; (i), or is available only under special circumstances which were not shown here, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107,108. Applicability of the Act\u2019s anti-injunction proscription therefore depends solely on whether this was a case involving or arising out of a labor dispute within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-10\">Section 13(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c), defines \u201clabor dispute\u201d as \u201cany controversy\u201d concerning either \u201cterms or conditions of employment\u201d or \u201crepresentation\u201d of persons in negotiating \u201cterms or conditions of employment.\u201d A \u201cltjbor dispute\u201d exists under section 13(c) \u201cregardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.\u201d The \u201clabor dispute\u201d in this case was that which existed between UTU and Rock Island. We reject UTU\u2019s contention that another \u201clabor dispute\u201d existed between it and AD&amp;N. UTU\u2019s only asserted dispute with AD&amp;N was over the latter\u2019s use of managerial personnel to move F&amp;P freight over Rock Island track in Fordyce. This controversy concerned neither the representation of AD&amp;N employees nor their terms or conditions of employment. <em>Cf. Milk Wagon Drivers\u2019 Union, Local 753 v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., </em>311 U.S. 91, 96-97, 61 S.Ct. 122, 124-25, 85 L.Ed. 63 (1940) (\u201clabor dispute\u201d exists between non-struck employer and picketing union where picketing is aimed at compelling employer\u2019s employees to join union for purpose of improving their pay and working conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-11\">Application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act thus depends on whether this case \u201cinvolves or arises out of\u201d the only possibly relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>labor dispute \u2014 that between UTU and Rock Island. Section 13(a) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIV2\">(a) A case shall be held to involve or to grow out of a labor dispute when the case involves persons who are engaged in the same industry, trade, craft, or occupation; or have direct or indirect interests therein; or who are employees of the same employer; or who are members of the same or an affiliated organization of employers or employees; whether such dispute is (1) between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employees or associations of employees; (2) between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employers or associations of employers; or (3) between one or more employees or associations of employees and one or more employees or associations of employees; or when the case involves any conflicting or competing interests in a \u201clabor dispute\u201d (as defined in this section) of \u201cpersons participating or interested\u201d therein (as defined in this section).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1427-4\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a). UTU contends we should read this expansive language literally and rule that the present case is a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute on the basis that UTU and AD&amp;N \u201care engaged in the same industry * * * or have a direct or indirect interests therein.\u201d Most courts considering the scope of section 13(a), however, have not relied on a literal reading. Instead, these courts have come to results in accord with the following test: when a non-struck employer seeks to have a union\u2019s activities enjoined by a federal court the case involves or grows out of a labor dispute \u2014 and thus the Norris-LaGuardia anti-injunction provisions apply \u2014 only when the offending activity is furthering the union\u2019s economic interest in a labor dispute. <em>E. g., Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, </em>362 F.2d 649, 654-55 (5th Cir.), <em>aff\u2019d by an equally divided court, </em>385 U.S. 20, 87 S.Ct. 226, 17 L.Ed.2d 20 (1966) (labor dispute involved; secondary picketing not enjoinable where union \u201cattempts to bring secondary pressure upon the employer with whom its primary dispute exists by means of [picketing] secondary employer, who has aligned himself with the primary employer in some substantial manner\u201d); <em>Lakefront Dock &amp; Railroad Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>ILA, </em>333 F.2d 549, 553 (6th Cir. 1962) (labor dispute not involved; sympathy strike enjoinable where longshoremen\u2019s union honoring picket line of seafarers\u2019 union claims no economic interest in dispute between picketing seafarers\u2019 union and owner of ship berthed at longshoremen\u2019s dock); <em>Amalgamated Association of Street Employees v.

Moreover, both parties must possess the required interest. Otherwise no relationship to a labor dispute would exist between the two.\u201d); <em>Gomez v. United Office &amp; Professional Workers Local 16, </em>73 F.Supp. 679, 681-82 (D.D.C.1947) (labor dispute not involved; picketing of plaintiff dance studio enjoinable where plaintiff has \u201cno financial interest in and does not exercise control over\u201d struck dance studio and where union has no interest in representing plaintiff\u2019s employees); <em>Donnelly Garment Co. v. ILG-WU, </em>20 F.Supp. 767, 770-72 (W.D.Mo.1937) (nonsensical result of reading section 13(a) literally means that it must be read in conjunction with section 13(c)\u2019s definition of \u201clabor dispute\u201d). <em>See In re Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, </em>605 F.2d 1073, 1075 (8th Cir. 1979) (absent findings of economic relationship between picketed non-struck railroad terminal and struck railroad, there was no basis for determining whether district court was entitled to grant relief for the terminal under the Norris-LaGuardia Act). <em>See also Columbia River Packers Association, Inc. v. Hinton, </em>315 U.S. 143, 146-47, 62 S.Ct. 520, 522, 86 L.Ed. 750 (1942) (suit by fish processor against independent fishermen\u2019s association not a case involving a labor dispute because case did not involve a controversy upon which the employer-employee relationship had a bearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">Under this \u201ceconomic self-interest test,\u201d the subject matter of the present case \u2014 the picketing of AD&amp;N \u2014 would involve or arise out of the UTU-Rock Island labor dispute if AD&amp;N were \u201csubstantially aligned\u201d with Rock Island. <em>See, e. g., Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., supra. </em>In <em>Atlantic Coast Line </em>the employer seeking injunctive relief against the picketing was a railroad terminal which was substantially aligned with the struck employer, a railroad, in the sense that the railroad had a one-quarter ownership interest in the terminal and received services from the terminal that <em>\u201cin fact </em>constitute))!] an integral part of [the struck railroad\u2019s] day-to-day operations.\u201d 362 F.2d at 651. A different situation prevailed here. There was substantial evidence for the district court to find that the secondary employer here \u2014 AD&amp;N\u2014did not provide the primary employer \u2014 Rock Island \u2014 with essential services or facilities. AD&amp;N personnel did little more than help F&amp;P exercise its contractual right to interchange Fordyce yard cars in order to continue rail service for its own customer, the Georgia-Pacific mill at Fordyce. Any Rock Island cars moved by AD&amp;N personnel were moved for F&amp;P\u2019s benefit, not Rock Island\u2019s. UTU has failed to show that AD&amp;N performed essential services for Rock Island,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that AD&amp;N aided Rock Island through a strike insurance plan,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>AD&amp;N and Rock Island otherwise had any significant commonality of interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In short, the evidence before the district court was that AD&amp;N was not Rock Island\u2019s ally in the struggle between UTU and Rock Island.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because UTU has failed to establish a substantial connection between its labor dispute and its picketing of the premises of AD&amp;N, the \u201ceconomic self-interest test\u201d mandates the conclusion that the picketing did not grow out of the labor dispute and therefore was not protected by the Norris-LaGuardia Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See generally In re Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, supra, </em>605 F.2d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">UTU would have us avoid this result by rejecting the economic self-interest test in favor of a literal application of section 13(a). UTU argues the narrower scope circumscribed by the self-interest test is invalid in light of the express language and historical purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. We disagree. Although the plain language of a statute is often controlling, it is impermissible to follow a literal reading that engenders absurd consequences where there is an alternative interpretation that reasonably effects the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>284 U.S. 167, 175, 52 S.Ct. 65, 68, 76 L.Ed. 224 (1931). Absurd consequences and a reasonable alternative are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">Read as a verbal formula, without regard to its background and to the rest of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, section 13(a) would operate to bar injunctive relief in any case involving persons with direct or indirect interests in the same industry, trade, craft, or occupation, regardless of whether any of these persons has an interest in a labor dispute. Consider, for example, a diversity case in which plaintiff seeks specific performance of a contract to sell real property. If both plaintiff and defendant belong to the same industry, trade, craft, or occupation, or have direct or indirect interests therein, a literal construction of section 13(a) would operate to deprive the federal courts of injunctive jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The obvious lesson is that one cannot make sense of section 13(a) simply by focusing on the character of the parties; one must also consider the subject matter of the dispute. The Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>recognized as much in declining to follow a strict, technical construction of section 13(a) in cases that did not in fact involve a section 13(c) labor dispute, even though the cases plainly did involve adversaries with interests in the same industry. <em>E. g., American Medical Association </em>v. <em>United States, </em>317 U.S. 519, 534-36, 63 S.Ct. 326, 331-332, 87 L.Ed. 434 (1943); <em>Columbia River Packers Association, Inc. v. Hinton, supra, </em>315 U.S. at 146-47, 62 S.Ct. at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">The background of the Norris-LaGuardia Act indicates its intended scope. The House report advocating passage of the Norris-LaGuardia anti-injunction provisions explains that their purpose was \u201cto protect the rights of labor in the same manner the Congress intended when it enacted the Clayton Act * * H.R.Rep.No.669, 72d Cong. 1st Sess. 3 (1932). Section 20 of the Clayton Act provides that \u201cin any case between an employer and employees * * involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions or employment,\u201d a federal court may not enjoin persons from \u201cceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 52. In a series of cases, and particularly in <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, </em>254 U.S. 443, 41 S.Ct. 172, 65 L.Ed. 349 (1921), the Supreme Court interpreted section 20 to encompass only those cases in which the adversaries had an employer-employee relationship.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This interpretation ignored a union\u2019s interest in protecting its wage levels by seeking to represent all employees in the same industry in order to eliminate the competitive edge of non-union employers over union employers. Justice Brand\u00e9is dissented from the Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of section 20 because he believed the section \u201cdeclare[s] the right of industrial combatants to push their struggle to the limits of the justification of self-interest * * <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, supra, </em>254 U.S. at 488, 41 S.Ct. at 184 (dissenting opinion). It was to overturn the <em>Duplex </em>doctrine that the Norris-LaGuardia\u2019s anti-injunction provisions were passed. H.R.Rep.No.669, 72 Cong., 1st Sess. 7-8 (1932). <em>See </em>F. Frankfurter &amp; N. Greene, The Labor Injunction 165-176, 216 (1930); C. Gregory, Labor and the Law, 193-94 (2d ed. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">Read in light of this background, it is reasonable to conclude that section 13(a) was meant to preclude injunctive interference with bargaining or organizing on an industry-wide or craft-wide basis. It was not meant to extend an anti-injunctive shield for union activities beyond the place where the union\u2019s interests in a labor dispute cease. As one commentator explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8_\">* * * In this definition of labor disputes and of cases arising out of labor disputes, Congress gave complete recognition to certain theretofore proscribed stranger activities of unions in fulfillment of their heartfelt need to organize entire industries so that, by standardizing employment conditions throughout such industries, they could eliminate the competitive hazard to already established standards in existing unionized units of such industries, presented by the undercutting effects of nonunion wage and labor standard differentials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-12\">As far as the federal courts were concerned, this act was Congress\u2019 green light to nation-wide union organizational campaigns, both for the purpose of securing the closed shop in individual units where a union was already established, and for unionizing all units throughout an entire industry \u2014 the so-called \u201cuniversal closed shop.\u201d It is as if Congress had said in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>\u201cThis you may do, using the techniques we have suggested, as long as you can show that your union economic program, conceived as <em>you </em>and not anyone else sees it, is affected by the existing employment conditions in the units of the industry with which you are concerned. We have instructed the judges to withhold the use of the injunction against your self-help coercive activities directed along these lines. From now on it is up to you union people to promote your own economic interests, as you see them, within the area of conflict we have defined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsZ\">Gregory, <em>supra, </em>at 190, 192. But it remains that \u201cparticipants in a labor dispute must be able to show an economic interest at stake in order to invoke the protection of the act at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See generally id. </em>at 158-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\">We thus conclude that the economic self-interest test reasonably defines the scope of the Norris-LaGuardia Act\u2019s anti-injunction provisions. The district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that UTU demonstrated no economic interest in pressuring AD&amp;N to cease helping F&amp;P service its customer-owner Georgia-Pacific. Because AD&amp;N and the struck Rock Island Railroad were not \u201csubstantially aligned,\u201d UTU\u2019s picketing of AD&amp;N was not within the permissible area of economic conflict and thus was not protected by the NorrisLaGuardia Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-7\">B. <em>Basis for Federal Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALR\">Having determined that the Norris-La-Guardia Act did not negate federal injunctive jurisdiction in this case, we address UTU\u2019s argument that federal law provided no basis for that jurisdiction. AD&amp;N did not plead diversity of citizenship, but asserts that federal jurisdiction existed under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-188, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\u2014 27, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The district court, relying on <em>Terminal Railroad Association v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, supra, </em>458 F.Supp. at 106, issued its injunction on the ground that secondary picketing is unlawful under the RLA. Intimations that secondary picketing under certain circumstances may be proscribed by the RLA also appear in <em>In re Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, </em>605 F.2d 1073, 1075 (8th Cir. 1979), and <em>Chicago &amp; Illinois Midland Railway v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, </em>315 F.2d 771, 775 (7th Cir.), <em>vacated as moot, </em>375 U.S. 18, 84 S.Ct. 61, 11 L.Ed.2d 39 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">We hesitate to endorse the district court\u2019s reliance on the RLA because the rationale for invoking the RLA to enjoin the picketing involved in this case is not clear.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The National Labor Relations Act specifies that certain forms of secondary pressure by unions are enjoinable, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4), but the RLA refers expressly neither to secondary activities nor to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>junctions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We do not doubt that secondary picketing may tend to subvert a general goal of the RLA \u2014 the avoidance of \u201cany interruption * * * to the operation of any carrier * * *.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a(l). But the RLA\u2019s means of achieving this goal lies chiefly if not solely in the duties and procedures it creates \u201cfor the prompt and orderly settlement\u201d of labor \u201cdisputes.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a(4), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\"><em>It </em>is true that federal courts have issued injunctions under the RLA to compel labor disputants to observe their duty to bargain over differences in good faith,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Chicago &amp; North Western Railway </em>v. <em>United Transportation Union, </em>402 U.S. 570, 578-81, 91 S.Ct. 1731, 1735-1737, 29 L.Ed.2d 187 (1971); to submit \u201cminor disputes\u201d to binding arbitration, <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Indiana Railroad, </em>353 U.S. 30, 39-42, 77 S.Ct. 635, 639-641, 1 L.Ed.2d 622 (1957); and to refrain from unilateral action in \u201cmajor disputes\u201d while compulsory bargaining procedures are pending, <em>Detroit &amp; Toledo Shore Line Railroad v. United Transportation Union, </em>396 U.S. 142, 149-53, 90 S.Ct. 294, 298-301, 24 L.Ed.2d 325 (1969). The rationale for these injunctions, however, is not that the RLA outlaws specified forms of unilateral action but that an injunction is necessary to preserve the integrity of the RLA\u2019s system of orderly settlement procedures. <em>See International Association of Machinists v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>304 F.2d 206, 211 (8th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">Thus, unless we are to hold that the RLA flatly prohibits certain forms of secondary activity \u2014 a point we do not reach\u2014 the RLA justified an injunction in this case only if an injunction was necessary to promote or protect the RLA dispute settlement process. That process is relevant, obviously, only if there is a negotiable dispute within the contemplation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-11\">Courts have characterized disputes under the RLA as either \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cminor.\u201d Negotiation over major disputes concerns changes in \u201crates of pay, rules, or working conditions,\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a(4), and thus looks to the formation of collective bargaining agreements. Minor disputes concern \u201cinterpretation or application of [existing] agreements,\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a(5), and thus involve the assertion of vested rights. <em>See Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway v. Burley, </em>325 U.S. 711, 723-24, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 1289-1290, 89 L.Ed. 1886 (1945). The first step toward settlement of either kind of dispute is negotiation and conference between the parties. Thereafter, procedures for major and minor disputes diverge. In a major dispute, either party may invoke the conciliation process administered by the National Mediation Board. If mediation fails and if the parties do not agree to binding arbitration, then either party may resort to unilateral action unless the Mediation Board and the President of the United States decide the dispute should be made subject to the investigation of an emergency board. <em>See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>394 U.S. 369, 378, 89 S.Ct. 1109, 1115, 22 L.Ed.2d 344 (1969). In a minor dispute, completion of the negotiation and conference step permits either party to invoke the arbitration of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, whose decision is \u201cfinal and binding\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 (First) (m). <em>See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen </em>v. <em>Chicago River &amp; Indiana Railroad, supra, </em>353 U.S. at 33-34, 77 S.Ct. at 636-637.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>This statutory background illuminates AD&amp;N\u2019s claim for injunctive relief under the RLA. UTU did not attempt to resolve its differences with AD&amp;N through the RLA\u2019s administrative processes but instead resorted to picketing, without notice to AD&amp;N. Although UTU had already exhausted RLA settlement procedures in its major dispute with Rock Island, AD&amp;N argues UTU was also required to confer with AD&amp;N or at least give notice of its intention to picket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-4\">The difficulty with this argument is that the duties and procedures of the RLA are meaningful only in the presence of an RLA dispute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A controversy between striking employees and a non-struck employer is neither a major nor a minor dispute, for it concerns neither the formation or alteration of a collective bargaining agreement nor the interpretation or application of an existing agreement: no collective bargaining contract exists or can exist between the striking employees and the non-struck employer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Resort to the RLA settlement process would have been futile, for there was no bargaining agreement to reach.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">The RLA does recognize the possibility of a third kind of dispute \u2014 \u201c[a]ny other dispute,\u201d neither major nor minor \u2014 which may be referred by either party to the Mediation Board if the dispute is \u201cnot adjusted in conference between the parties or where conferences are refused.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 155 (First) (b). It is not at all clear, however, that this vaguely defined third category of disputes would encompass controversies between striking employees and non-struck employers, for the jurisdiction of the Mediation Board may well extend only to employer-employee disputes, <em>see </em>Note, <em>Judicial Approaches to Secondary Boycotts Under the Railway Labor Act, </em>42 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 928, 933-34 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-9\">Although a more thorough examination of the RLA and other sources of labor law might well reveal a basis for federal injunctive jurisdiction<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it is not necessary to dwell further on the RLA here inasmuch as a line of authority supports AD&amp;N\u2019s alternative argument that the district court had injunctive jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Federal district courts have \u201coriginal jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce * * *.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337. Federal jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act exists where the remedy sought is inferable from the Act or hinges on an interpretation of it. <em>Garrett v. Time-D.C., Inc., </em>502 F.2d 627, 629 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-10\">The Interstate Commerce Act requires common carriers subject to its juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>diction to provide \u201csafe and adequate\u201d transportation service \u201con reasonable request.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 lllol(a) (recodifying 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(1), (4)).

Although not clearly forbidden by the RLA, it was not endorsed, either.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nor, as we have held, was the picketing protected from federal injunctive jurisdiction by the Norris-LaGuardia Act. For that reason <em>Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Chicago &amp; North Western R. Co., </em>362 U.S. 330, 80 S.Ct. 761, 4 L.Ed.2d 774 (1960) is inapposite. The Court in <em>Railroad Telegraphers </em>indicated that labor injunction plaintiffs cannot rely on non-labor legislation to remove the strictures of the NorrisLaGuardia Act. <em>Id. </em>at 339 n.15, 80 S.Ct. at 766. <em>Accord, Lee Way Motor Freight, Inc. v.

Here, however, the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not apply, and injunctive jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act remains intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-7\">IV. Irreparable Injury</p>\n<p id=\"avx-dedup-0\">It remains to consider whether the district court, possessing injunctive jurisdiction, abused its discretion in issuing injunctive relief. Given that AD&amp;N has made its case on the merits, the focus now is on a balancing of harms. UTU argues AD&amp;N failed to show a potential irreparable injury such as would justify injunctive relief because the harmful effects alleged were the ordinary incidents of peaceful picketing. We disagree. AD&amp;N\u2019s potential harm in the absence of injunctive relief transcended the ordinary in that the district court found that three quarters of AD&amp;N\u2019s operation would be shut down by UTU\u2019s picketing. <em>See Wilson v. Milk Drivers &amp; Dairy Employees Local 471, </em>491 F.2d 200, 206 (8th Cir. 1974). Moreover, as noted above, claims could have been filed against AD&amp;N for failure to fulfill its statutory duty as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>carrier. Any counteracting harm to UTU\u2019s interest in its labor dispute with Rock Island was negligible in light of the district court\u2019s finding that AD&amp;N and Rock Island were not substantially aligned. The district court also properly considered that the public interest weighed heavily against UTU inasmuch as its unprivileged picketing would have shut down Georgia-Pacific plants employing three thousand workers. <em>See Minnesota Bearing Co. v. White Motor Corp., </em>470 F.2d 1323, 1326 (8th Cir. 1973). Under these circumstances we cannot say the grant of injunctive relief was an abuse of discretion. See <em>Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 931-32, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 2567-2568, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); <em>Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, Inc. v.

Relying on Justice Brand\u00e9is\u2019 dissent in <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. </em>v. <em>Deering, </em>254 U.S. 443, 482, 41 S.Ct. 172, 182, 65 L.Ed. 349 (1921), they explain that section 13 \u201cpermits the collaboration of efforts between unions whom substantial interests make natural allies. It withholds immunity from the chancellor\u2019s decree at a point where combination aims to include unions that have no economic bond but only a sympathetic interest.\u201d F. Frankfurter &amp; N. Greene, The Labor Injunction, 217 (1930).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">.

The National Labor Relations Act\u2019s ban on secondary activities applies only to the activities of \u201clabor organizations\u201d which the Act defines as a representative of \u201cemployees,\u201d and excludes from its definition of employees those employees covered by the RLA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 152(3), (5), 158(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1432-8\">. RLA \u00a7 2 (First), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, provides: It shall be the duty of all carriers * * * and employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, and to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interrpution to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">. AD&amp;N cites several cases for the proposition that strikes by RLA unions over non-bar-gainable issues may be enjoined. <em>E. g., Illinois Cent. R.R. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, </em>443 F.2d 136, 144 (7th Cir. 1971). Each case cited, however, involved a dispute between a RLA union and the employer of the union\u2019s members and can be explained on the basis that the union failed to abide by its duty to bargain in good faith, see note 19 <em>supra, </em>or to observe the procedural formalities established by RLA \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 155 and 156. The absence of an employer-employee dispute renders those duties inapposite here. <em>But see McGuinn, supra </em>note 17, at 66-67 &amp; n. 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">. AD&amp;N did not attempt to enjoin the work stoppage of its own employees on the basis that it had a negotiable RLA dispute with them. AD&amp;N therefore cannot rely on cases such as <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Inti, </em>442 F.2d 246, 248-49 (8th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 871, 92 S.Ct. 70, 30 L.Ed.2d 116 (1971) (where bargaining contract arguably prohibits union-authorized sympathy strike, strike may be enjoined pending arbitration of the \u201cminor dispute\u201d over contract\u2019s meaning).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1433-12\">. A further difficulty is that AD&amp;N did not attempt to invoke RLA procedures, <em>see Manion v. Kansas City Terminal Ry., </em>353 U.S. 927, 927, 77 S.Ct. 706, 1 L.Ed.2d 722 (1957), although UTU\u2019s unilateral action may have excused AD&amp;N of this usual requirement, <em>see Chicago &amp; Ill. Midland Ry. v. Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen, </em>315 F.2d 771, 775 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1433-13\">. <em>See, e. g., McGuinn, supra </em>note 17, at 66-67 &amp; n.73 (suggesting reliance on 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 155 (First) (b) or the \u201cgood faith bargaining\u201d requirement of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(1); Recent Developments, <em>supra </em>note 17, 68 Mich.L.Rev. at 346 (suggesting development of federal common law to govern secondary activity by RLA unions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">. A judicial damage remedy against carriers was once expressly provided for in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9. These provisions were largely repealed in the Revised Interstate Commerce Act, Pub.L.No.95-473, \u00a7 4(b), (2), 92 Stat. 1466-70 (1978). This Act was meant to effect no substantive change, however, and it was expressly contemplated that private parties could invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1337 to seek remedies inferable from the duties imposed by the Act. H.R.Rep.No.95-1395, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 3009, 3016.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1434-8\">. \u201c[T]he Act is wholly inexplicit as to the scope of allowable self-help.\u201d <em>Brotherhood of R.R.
