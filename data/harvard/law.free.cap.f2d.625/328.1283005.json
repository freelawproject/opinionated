The district court denied the challenge to the timeliness of the government\u2019s action, correctly holding that under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6503(b) and <em>McAuley v. United States, </em>525 F.2d 1108 (9th Cir. 1975), the taxpayers\u2019 bankruptcy had the effect of suspending the running of the six-year statute of limitations period for one year, thereby making this action timely. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Section 6503(b) suspends the running of the six-year limitations period provided in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6503(a) when \u201cthe assets of the taxpayer are in the control or custody of the court . . . and for six months thereafter.\u201d In <em>McAuley v. United States, supra, </em>this court held that a bankruptcy court has custody or control of the taxpayer\u2019s assets for purposes of section 6503(b) from the beginning of bankruptcy until six months after the first creditors\u2019 meeting. That is, suspension lasts \u201cuntil six months after the date of the first creditors\u2019 meeting, and for an additional six months thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1114. Thus, under the basic holding of <em>McAuley, </em>the government\u2019s action was timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The appellants, however, argue that their bankruptcy was for purposes of suspending limitations a \u201cno-asset\u201d bankruptcy since most of the assets were exempt. In footnote 7 of the <em>McAuley </em>case, 525 F.2d at 1114 n.7, this court suggested that section 6503(b) does not suspend the statute of limitations period during a \u201cno-asset\u201d bankruptcy. The district court in the instant case expressly rejected appellants\u2019 contention because the language used by this court in <em>McAuley </em>was clear that a \u201cno-asset\u201d bankruptcy means what it says: there must be no assets, be they exempt or nonexempt. The district court correctly limited the dictum in footnote 7 in <em>McAuley </em>to bankruptcies without any assets whatsoever. To extend that footnote to include exempt-asset bankruptcies would introduce the very factual questions that Congress and this court have sought to avoid. <em>McAu-ley v. United States, supra, </em>525 F.2d at 1112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The district court also ruled that under section 17(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Act the taxpayers\u2019 bankruptcy did not discharge the pre-bankruptcy liens for taxes that became due and owing more than three years before bankruptcy. Section 17(a)(1) provides: \u201c[A] discharge in bankruptcy shall not release or affect any tax lien.\u201d Since the government filed tax liens for all the tax years in dispute, appellants' tax liabilities, insofar as they could be satisfied from proceeds of preexisting liens, were nondischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
