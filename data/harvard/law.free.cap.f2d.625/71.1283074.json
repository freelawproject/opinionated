While so engaged he fell into the Mississippi River and drowned as he attempted to board a vessel owned by the defendant, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. His widow, the appellant, brought an action seeking a judgment under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq. Negligence of the defendant was alleged. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>filed a demand for a jury trial which, on motion of the defendant was stricken. This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In support of her demand for a jury trial Mrs. Russell relies upon the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers Compensation Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contending that it created a new and independent cause of action for negligence against persons other than the compensation employer. From such premise it is urged that an action \u201carises under\u201d Section 905(b) and that federal jurisdiction is conferred by 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1331<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u00a7 1337.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Established principles require the rejection of Mrs. Russell\u2019s demand for a jury trial as well as her contention that Section 905(b) creates a new cause of action governed by the rules of civil procedure rather than those prevailing in admiralty. The Gay<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> case decided that the land based substantive negligence principles apply in maritime tort actions. In <em>Parker v. South Louisiana Contractors, Inc., </em>5th Cir. 1976, 537 F.2d 113, cert. denied, 430 U.S. 906, 97 S.Ct. 1175, 51 L.Ed.2d 582, it was held that Section 905(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201cEliminates only an injured worker\u2019s right to bring actions against third parties based on unseaworthiness, and preserves his right under prior law to recover for third party negligence . . [T]he relevant legislative history . leaves little doubt that Congress did not intend section 905(b) to create a new or broader cause of action in admiralty . . ..\u201d 537 F.2d at 117.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">It was decided that because Section 905(b) did not create a new negligence cause of action but merely preserved an injured worker\u2019s right to recover damages from third parties in accordance with nonstatuto-ry negligence principles, it could not serve as the basis for jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C.A. Section 1337. Just as Section 905(b) cannot provide a jurisdictional base under Section 1337, it cannot so serve under Section 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">Jurisdiction of the claim of Mrs. Russell is based upon general maritime law. This being so, there is no right to a trial by jury. <em>William P. Brooks Construction Co., Inc. v. Guthrie, </em>5th Cir. 1980, 614 F.2d 509. The jury demand was properly stricken. The order of the district court striking the jury demand is</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. In the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel, then such person, or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages by reason thereof, may bring an action against such vessel as a third party in accordance with the provisions of section 933 of this title, and the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages directly or indirectly and any agreements or warranties to the contrary shall be void.
