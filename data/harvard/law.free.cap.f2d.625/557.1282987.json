This latter condition prevents Amber from being able to empty her bladder voluntarily. As a result, Amber must be catheterized every three to four hours in order to function normally without the danger of developing chronic kidney infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">In 1979, Amber became eligible for participation in the early childhood development program provided by defendant Irving Independent School District (\u201cthe school district\u201d). After a series of meetings with Amber\u2019s mother, the school district\u2019s Admission, Review and Dismissal Committee developed an Individualized Education Plan (\u201cIEP\u201d) for Amber as required by the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (\u201cthe EAHCA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(a)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IEP stipulates that phys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ical and speech therapy is to be provided to Amber. However, the IEP fails to specify the provision of any services to Amber that may be necessary due to her neurogenic bladder. More particularly, the IEP fails to specify that Clean Intermittent Catheteri-zation (CIC) will be administered to Amber during the school day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the fruitless pursuit of the state remedies required by the EAHCA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Amber\u2019s parents, plaintiffs, sued in district court in accordance with 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They contend that because the IEP contains no provision for CIC, the school district has violated the EAHCA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(1), by failing to provide a free appropriate public education to Amber.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They also contend that the school district has violated section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, (\u201csection 504\u201d), as <em>amended, </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The case reaches us from the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction to require the school district to provide CIC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For the reasons detailed below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">I. <em>The EAHCA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 773 (1975), was sparked by an \u201c[ijncreased awareness of the educational needs of handicapped children and landmark court decisions establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the right to education for handicapped children . . . S.Rep.No.168, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>[1975] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 1425,1429. The Congress found that handicapped children were receiving inadequate services, were not being properly identified and evaluated, and were being subjected to unnecessary exclusion from the regular educational environment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To remedy this situation, Congress increased educational grants to participating states to enable them to meet the unique needs of handicapped children, <em>see id. </em>at 7-9, [1975] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 1431-33, strengthened procedures to enable parents of handicapped children to advocate more forcefully the rights of their handicapped children, <em>see id. </em>at 9, [1975] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 1433, adopted judicially imposed due process requirements that ensure the proper identification and evaluation of handicapped children, <em>see id. </em>at 26-30, [1975] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 1450-52, and stipulated that handicapped children were to be integrated into the regular classrooms to the maximum extent appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 33-34, [1975] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 1457-58; S.Conf.Rep.No.455, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 30, <em>reprinted in </em>[1975] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 1480,1483. In reference to the last objective, the Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">The Conferees point out that while instruction may take place in such locations as classrooms, the child\u2019s home, or hospitals and institutions, the delivery of such instruction must take place in a manner consistent with the requirements of law which provide that to the maximum extent appropriate handicapped children must be educated with children who are not handicapped, and that handicapped children should be placed in special classes, separate schooling, or any other educational environment only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and supportive services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJI\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">To ensure the provision of proper services, Congress mandated that recipients of federal funds must assure \u201call handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education,\u201d 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1412(1) (West 1978), which consists of special education and related services. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1401(18).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The battle lines in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>have been drawn on the issue whether the provision of CIC to Amber, a handicapped child within the meaning of the EAHCA, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1401(1),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is a related service.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The district court held that CIC is not. It observed that there are only two categories of related services: (1) transportation required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education, and (2) developmental, corrective, and supportive services necessary to assist a handicapped to benefit from special education. It properly concluded that CIC is not transportation and that CIC is neither developmental nor corrective. The district court noted that \u201cCIC is supportive of Amber\u2019s education in the sense that it is required at sufficiently frequent intervals that her education and CIC must proceed apace,\u201d and that \u201c[o]ne can argue that read literally, every necessary life support system must be furnished.\u201d Nevertheless, the district court concluded that there was \u201cno congressional intent to sweep broadly in its usage of the word \u2018related.\u2019 \u201d The court thus held that \u201cto be related in the statutory sense the service requirement must arise from the effort to educate. There is a difference between maintenance of life systems and enhancing a handicapped person\u2019s ability to learn. The CIC is essential to Amber\u2019s life but once that life maintenance service is provided, it is unrelated to her learning skills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The district court further observed that the regulations implementing the EAHCA<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> construe related services to include \u201cschool health services,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which are defined as \u201cservices provided by a qualified school nurse or other qualified person.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.l3(b)(10) (1979). Despite the fact that CIC comports with this definition of school health services, the district court held that school health services, to be a class of related services, must, like all categories of related services, arise from the effort to educate in order to fit within the statutory definition. Hence, CIC did not fit the bill. We find that the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">As the district court correctly observed, CIC falls within a literal interpretation of the statutory definition of related services. Quite simply put, without the provision of CIC, Amber cannot benefit from the special education to which she is entitled, for, without CIC, she cannot be present in the classroom at all. Thus, CIC is a supportive service required to assist Amber to benefit from her special education.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Nevertheless, the district court felt compelled to limit the literal words of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(17) because it perceived a need to circumscribe the scope of related services lest \u201cevery necessary life support system . be furnished.\u201d This perception, however, ignored the fact that the EAHCA contains its own limitations on the type of life support services that must be provided as related services. First, in order to be entitled to any related services at all, a child must be handicapped so as to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>special education. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.l4 (1979) (comment one); <em>see </em>20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1401(1) (reprinted at note 11 <em>supra). </em>Second, the life support service must be necessary to aid a handicapped child to benefit from the special education to be provided. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1401(17). Thus, a life support service would not be a related service if it did not have to be provided during school hours, but instead could be performed at some other time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Third, in order to be a related service, the life support service must be one which a nurse or other qualified person can perform. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.l3(b)(10) (1979). Excluded from the term \u201crelated services\u201d are those health-related activities which must be performed by a licensed physician that are not provided \u201cto determine a child\u2019s medically related handicapping condition which results in the child\u2019s need for special education and related services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 121a.l3(4).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, even under a literal interpretation of the statutory definition, the types of life support services needed by a child which can be related services are limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Moreover, the district court\u2019s deviation from the literal words of the statute ignored a mandate contained in the EAHCA which is additional to the congressional requirement that states furnish each handir capped child a free appropriate public education consisting of special education and related services. The language of 20 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1412(5) (West 1978) is quite unequivocal: <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">In order to qualify for assistance under this subchapter in any fiscal year, a State shall demonstrate to the Commissioner that the following conditions are met: (5) The State has established . procedures to assure that, to the maximum extent appropriate, handicapped children, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not handicapped, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of handicapped children from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Construing the term \u201crelated services\u201d to exclude services like CIC, necessary to keep a handicapped child in the classroom, would completely eviscerate this mandate. This we cannot do. In light of this categorical congressional judgment that handicapped children should be educated in the regular classrooms to the maximum extent appropriate, and given the existence of limitations in the statute which circumscribe the types of life support systems which must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>provided as related services, we hold that the words \u201csupportive services ... as may be required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education\u201d must be read literally to include the provision of CIC to Amber Tatro.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\n<em>II. Section 504</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The district court gave plaintiff\u2019s claim under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> rather short shrift. The gravamen of its holding is that section 504 does not require the school district to provide CIC to Amber because \u201c[p]laintiffs cannot convert a statute prohibiting discrimination in certain governmental programs to a statute requiring, in essence, the setting up of governmental health care for people seeking to participate in such programs.\u201d This conclusion is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In <em>Camenisch v. University of Texas, </em>616 F.2d 127 (5th Cir. 1980), plaintiff, a deaf graduate student at the University of Texas, brought suit against the University because of its refusal to provide him with sign language interpreter services, an aid which he claimed was necessary for his participation in the University\u2019s programs. We affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction requiring the University to provide interpreter services. We held that the failure to provide interpreter services amounted to the exclusion of plaintiff from the University\u2019s programs and hence violated section 504. <em>See id. </em>at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">Analogously, Amber has been excluded from the school district\u2019s programs by the district\u2019s refusal to provide CIC. Without the provision of CIC to Amber, she will be unable to participate in the preschool programs of' the school district. Such exclusion is expressly condemned by section 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Defendants contend that <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979), dictates the contrary result. This assertion is incorrect. As we observed in <em>Camenisch, supra, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Southeastern Community College </em>says only that Section 504 does not require a school to provide services to a handicapped individual for a program for which the individual\u2019s handicap precludes him from ever realizing the principal benefits of the training.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133. Thus, like <em>Camenisch, </em>this case is distinguishable from <em>Southeastern Community College </em>because, with the provision of CIC, Amber will be able to perform well' in school and thus realize the principal benefits of the school district\u2019s program.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>school district\u2019s failure to provide CIC therefore violates section 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">VACATED and REMANDED for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\">. We caution that we recite the \u201cfacts\u201d here only to place the case in context and that we really have no facts to speak of. Following a conference between the parties and the district court, the court invited stipulated facts. Plaintiffs submitted their proposed stipulation; defendants failed to respond. Instead of compelling such a response or making its own findings, the district court issued a memorandum opinion denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Thus, we have no findings upon which to rely for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Obviously, the preferable course would have been for the district court to find facts so that its disposition of plaintiffs\u2019 motion would be more fully amenable to appellate review. Nevertheless, we are not powerless on this appeal. Since the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction rested on its legal interpretation of the Acts under consideration, we can review the district court\u2019s legal conclusion. Furthermore, in order to provide meaningful guidance to the district court for its consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 motion on remand, we shall assume that the facts, which we detail in this opinion and base on plaintiffs\u2019 proposal, are true. On remand, of course, the district court should make the appropriate findings. If the district court finds the facts to be different from those we state, it must then determine whether these factual deviations are material so as to alter the conclusion we reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">Additionally, since the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion on the ground that there was no likelihood of success on the merits, we shall discuss only that factor for a preliminary injunction. On remand, the* district court should consider the other relevant criteria, to-wit, the irreparable harm to plaintiffs from failure to issue the injunction, the harm to the defendant from issuance of the injunction, and the public interest. <em>See Canal Authority v. Callaway, </em>489 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1974). For its consideration of these factors, we direct the district court\u2019s particular attention to our recent decision in <em>Camenisch v. University of Texas, </em>616 F.2d 127 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-17\">. 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1414(a)(5) (West 1978), provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-18\">(a) A local educational agency or an intermediate educational unit which desires to receive payments under section 1411(d) of this title for any fiscal year shall submit an application to the appropriate State educational agency.

The definitions of the terms \u201cfree appropriate public education,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services\u201d are reprinted at note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">. 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1401(1) (West 1978) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">The term \u201chandicapped children\u201d means mentally retarded, hard of hearing, deaf, speech impaired, visually handicapped, seriously emotionally disturbed, orthopedically \u25a0 impaired, or other health impaired children, or children with specific learning disabilities, who by reason thereof require special education and related services.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">. These regulations are contained at 45 C.F.R. part 121al979). They were drafted by the Office of Education of the former Department of Health Education and Welfare whose functions have since been transferred to the newly-created Department of Education. <em>See </em>Pub.L.No. 96-88 \u00a7 601, 93 Stat. 696 (October 17, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b626-12\">. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.l3(a) (1979) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">As used in this part, the term \u201crelated services\u201d means transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education, and includes speech pathology and audiology, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, early identification and assessment of disabilities in children, counseling services, and medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes. The term also includes school health services, social work services in schools, and parent counseling and training.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. For example, suppose that a child required an insulin injection once a day to maintain his life. Since the injection could be administered at night after school, it would not be a supportive service required to assist the child to benefit from special education. Thus, it would not be a related service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">. The exclusion of medical services not performed for diagnostic and evaluation purposes derives from the definition of related services. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1401(17) (West 1978). Given this exclusion, HEW quite properly eliminated such health-related services from the definition of related services contained in the regulations. Concomitantly, since there is no blanket exclusion from supportive services for all health-related services, the inclusion of health-related services that are not performed by a physician and are \u201crequired to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education,\u201d <em>id., </em>is quite proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b627-11\">. Equally categorical is 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1414(a)(l)(C)(iv) (West 1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">A local educational agency or an intermediate educational unit which desires to receive payments under section 1411(d) of this title for any fiscal year shall submit an application to the appropriate State educational agency. Such application shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">(1) provide satisfactory assurance that payments under this subchapter will be used for excess costs directly attributable to programs which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">(C) establish a goal of providing full educational opportunities to all handicapped children, including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">(iv) to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with the provisions of section 1412(5)(B) of this title, the provision of special services to enable such children to participate in regular educational programs</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. Our holding that these words should be read literally, subject only to the limitations, contained in the statute, which we have discussed, is supported by the statute\u2019s enumeration of physical and occupational therapy, and recreation as examples of related services. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1401(17) (West 1978). We fail to see how these services \u201carise from the effort to educate\u201d any more than CIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In view of our holding that CIC is a related service, we need not address the issue whether 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1414(a)(l)(C)(iv) (West 1978), by its use of the term \u201csupplementary aids and services,\u201d contemplates the provision of services additional to \u201crelated services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\">. Section 504 is reproduced at note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\">. We by no means intend to intimate that every type of service, necessary to prevent the exclusion of an otherwise qualified handicapped person from a program, must be provided. First, section 504 does not require \u201csubstantial adjustments in existing programs beyond those necessary to eliminate discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals . .\u201d <em>Southeastern Community College, supra, </em>99 S.Ct. at 2369. Thus, the College was not required to eliminate certain required courses or to provide individual supervision by faculty members whenever respondent, a deaf nursing student, would attend patients directly. <em>See id, </em>99 S.Ct. at 2368. This result obtained because \u201c[wjhatever benefits respondent might realize from such a course of study, she would not receive even a rough equivalent of the training a nursing program normally gives.\u201d <em>Id., </em>99 S.Ct. at 2369. In contrast, like the plaintiff in <em>Camenisch, supra, </em>who will receive the principal benefits of the University\u2019s program once a deaf interpreter is provided, Amber will realize the principal benefits of the school district\u2019s program once CIC is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">Second, <em>Southeastern Community College </em>possibly indicates that section 504 does not require the provision of services that would impose \u201cundue financial and administrative burdens\u201d upon the recipient. <em>See Southeastern Community College, supra, </em>99 S.Ct. at 2370. Thus, for example, section 504 may not require the school district to provide a very expensive procedure like kidney dialysis to a child who needs such a service during the school day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>However, CIC does not appear to approach an undue financial and administrative burden. It can be performed in five minutes by anyone who has received thirty minutes of training. This burden appears to be a far cry from being \u201cundue.\u201d Of course, since we have no findings upon which to rely, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>we leave this determination to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
