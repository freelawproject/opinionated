This injury entitled him to state workers\u2019 compensation payments which were awarded beginning September 8, 1969. Subsequently, Freeman was awarded Title II Social Security disability benefits <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on a finding that he was disabled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Freeman filed an application for black lung benefits on April 30, 1970. Three years later, he was found to be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis (black lung) and was awarded benefits under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-20\">Though at first blush it would seem that plaintiff has received everything he asked for and thus odd that he is a plaintiff at all, let alone a prevailing plaintiff, the arithmetic of the situation shows that this is not the case. Freeman\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation payments\" were $203.60 per month. His Social Security payments would have been $348.90 per month had he not received state workers\u2019 compensation. Because of a statutory deduction<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>benefits from Social Security payments, however, he actually received $226.90 per month from Social Security. Likewise, had Freeman not been receiving workers\u2019 compensation, his black lung benefits would have been $252.80 per month. Again, because of a statutory offset<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against workers\u2019 compensation, he actually received $49.20 in black lung benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">In total, he received $479.70 per month through the three programs. Freeman is in court because had he not been awarded state workers\u2019 compensation payments, he would have received $601.70 per month through Social Security and Black Lung benefits. He contends that the $122.00 per month less that he received under the three programs compared to what he would have received under the two federal programs is an unconstitutional penalty for the exercise of his right to pursue state workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court avoided the constitutional issue and held simply that the \u201cdouble offset\u201d procedure followed by HEW had an effect contrary to Congressional intent. We agree, making it unnecessary to reach the constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">It is important at the outset to clarify what is at issue and what is not. Freeman does not argue that the offset provisions of the Social Security Act are unconstitutional, <em>Richardson v. Belcher, </em>404 U.S. 78, 92 S.Ct. 254, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971), nor does he argue that the offset provisions of the Black Lung Act are unconstitutional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, Freeman concedes that <em>if </em>a \u201cdouble offset\u201d was intended, the Secretary correctly calculated the offset under each program. Freeman\u2019s sole argument is that the effect of the \u201cdouble offset\u201d is contrary to the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-16\">To determine whether or not the cumulative effect of the two offsets is inconsistent with Congressional intent, we must first determine what the goals of Congress were in implementing these two federal programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-17\">\n<em>Social Security Disability Insurance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-18\">Social Security was first proposed by President Roosevelt as part of the New Deal legislative reform. As initially instituted, the Social Security Act of 1935 contained no provisions for disability insurance. It did, however, provide old age and unemployment insurance which, as a general rule, the states were not providing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-19\">In 1956 the Social Security Act was expanded to include monthly benefits for disabled wage earners.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As enacted in 1956, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>there was a full offset of workers\u2019 compensation payments against Social Security disability benefits. 70 Stat. 816 (1956). \u201cIt is self-evident that the offset reflected a judgment by Congress that the workmen\u2019s compensation and disability insurance programs in certain instances served a common purpose, and that the workmen\u2019s compensation programs should take precedence in the area of overlap.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Belcher, </em>404 U.S. at 82, 92 S.Cfc at 257. The offset provision was repealed in 1958, 72 Stat. 1025 (1958), but was reinstituted in 1965 in a slightly different form, 79 Stat. 406 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">The reinstitution of the offset was triggered by data submitted to legislative committees which showed that in the majority of the states, the typical worker who was receiving workers\u2019 compensation and federal disability benefits actually received more in benefits than his pre-disability take-home pay. <em>Hearings on H.R. 6675 Before the Senate Comm, on Finance, </em>89th Cong., 1st Sess. 151 (1965). This was thought to cause two evils: first, it reduced a worker\u2019s incentive to return to the work place and hence impeded rehabilitative efforts; and second, it created fears that the duplication of benefits would lead to an erosion of state workers\u2019 compensation programs. <em>Hearings on H.R. 6675 Before the Senate Comm, on Finance, </em>89th Cong., 1st Sess. 252, 259, 366, 540, 738-40, 892-97, 949-54, 990 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">Section 424a of title 42 was then enacted to deal with the problem. As is relevant here, it requires an offset of Social Security disability payments against workers\u2019 compensation so that the total benefits received by the worker under the two programs do not exceed 80% of his pre-disability income. Social Security disability payments, then, supplement state workers\u2019 compensation only when the workers\u2019 compensation payments are less' than 80% of the worker\u2019s pre-disability income. This eradicated the problem of a worker being financially better off disabled than if he or she returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">It did not, however, <em>require </em>a worker to apply for state workers\u2019 compensation and thus did not insure that the state programs were primarily liable for such payments. However, because Social Security disability payments are less than 80% of a workers\u2019 pre-disability income, the system which resulted after the 1965 amendment did encourage workers to pursue state workers\u2019 compensation as well as federal Social Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">\n<em>Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-12\">The general purpose of Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act (\u201cthe Black Lung Benefits Act\u201d) is set out in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a) (1976). There Congress stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-13\">Congress finds and declares that there are a significant number of coal miners living today who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in one or more of the Nation\u2019s coal mines; . . . and that few States provide benefits for death or disability due to this disease . . . . It is, therefore, the purpose of this subchapter to provide benefits, in cooperation with the States, to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis . .. ; and to ensure that in the future adequate benefits are provided to coal miners and their dependents in the event of their death or total disability due to pneumoco-niosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1370-17\">Through a complex statutory scheme,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Black Lung Benefits Act seeks to compensate workers totally disabled by black lung. Recognizing that few states provided workers\u2019 compensation for disability resulting from this condition, the federal government undertook to be responsible for claims filed between September 20, 1969, and June 30,1973. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> June 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>1973, through December 31, 1973, was set up as a transitional period. Initially, the federal government, through the Department of Labor, would determine eligibility for benefits of miners who filed claims during that period, and would pay the claims for those six months. On January 1, 1974, responsibility for the payment of such claims shifted to the responsible operator. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(a)(5) (1976). Claims filed after December 31, 1973, are paid through state workers\u2019 compensation plans if the State has developed a plan which meets the approval of the Secretary of Labor. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 931 (1976). If there is no approved state workers\u2019 compensation plan, such claims are processed by the Secretary of Labor and paid by the operator. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">The statutory scheme, then, provides that the federal government shall have the responsibility for payment of benefits to the backlog of miners who are black lung victims. By putting subsequent responsibility directly on the coal mine operators in the absence of a state plan of compensation, the statute encourages the operators to lobby their state legislators for adequate workers\u2019 compensation plans in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">More important for our inquiry, however, is the fact that the statute <em>requires </em>a claimant whose claim will be paid by the federal government<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to pursue state workers\u2019 compensation prior to or contemporaneously with the pursuit of federal benefits if the worker would possibly be entitled to state benefits based on the black lung disability. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(c) (1976). If the worker is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation, there is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of black lung benefits based on benefits received from the state.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is a clear legislative desire, therefore, for state workers\u2019 compensation programs to be the primary provider of disability payments and for the federal government to be responsible only if the state program is not adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\"><em>Does the \u201cDouble Offset\" Contravene Congressional Intent </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-11\">The Secretary argues that the basic purpose of both federal programs is income replacement and that a prime Congressional goal in both programs is to avoid over-replacement of the disabled worker\u2019s prior income. She asserts that under the factual situation in this case the goal of not over-replacing income can only be met through the \u201cdouble offset.\u201d The Secretary concedes that another interest of Congress is to insure that state workers\u2019 compensation programs are the primary providers and to insure that the federal government is involved only when state programs are not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">We agree that the programs have twin goals and that, as far as possible, the law should be interpreted to carry out these goals. In this instance, however, both goals cannot be achieved. In essence, then, we are seeking to determine the intent of Congress as applied to a factual situation which obviously it did not foresee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">Only one other circuit has addressed this issue. On October 26, 1979, in an unpublished opinion, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the decision of the district court in <em>Boyd v. Califano, </em>479 F.Supp. 846 (W.D.Va.1978). <em>Boyd </em>held that each individual offset clearly reflected Congressional intent in this area, and that therefore the effect of the double offset is of no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">Although Fourth Circuit cases are not binding on this court, they are persuasive. We are reluctant, therefore, to reject the precedent of the <em>Boyd </em>case and thus place miners in this area in a better position relative to benefits than their brethren to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>the north. We are compelled to do so, however, because we feel the <em>Boyd </em>courts failed to explain adequately why Congress would intentionally <em>discourage </em>miners who are entitled to Social Security disability benefits, black lung benefits, and workers\u2019 compensation benefits for ailments other than black lung<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> from pursuing state workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">It is undeniable that the effect of the double offset is to discourage a miner from pursuing workers\u2019 compensation, and thus to encourage the miners to rely exclusively on the federal government for compensation. This result is clearly at odds with a prime Congressional intent of making state workers\u2019 compensation the program to which citizens should turn first for disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Moreover, we cannot say that permitting only one offset and not permitting the other in cases where a miner is entitled to benefits from all three programs necessarily runs counter to Congressional intent. It is true that if either the Social Security offset or the black lung offset is not made, the miner may receive more than 100% replacement of his pre-disability income. We recognize that ordinarily a greater than 100% replacement of income runs contrary to Congressional intent. It is not clear, however, that Congress intended 100% of pre-disability income to be the absolute maximum a worker could recover if he is drawing federal benefits. In fact, several aspects of the law suggest that such an absolute ceiling on federal benefits 'was not the Congressional intent. Before the 1972 amendments there was an offset of black lung benefits against Social Security disability payments. That was deleted by a 1972 amendment making it clear that black lung benefits are not to be considered workers\u2019 compensation for purposes of Social Security. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b) (1976). Thus, Congress did away with a provision which had an ultimate effect (decreased benefits) similar to the double offset being considered today and which had the effect of constructing a ceiling on federal benefits of 80% of the worker\u2019s pre-disability income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">In light of that amendment we cannot say a ceiling on federal benefits was a paramount Congressional intent in setting up these programs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As discussed above, however, Congress has clearly exhibited an intent to encourage primary reliance on state compensation programs. Because the double offset runs absolutely counter to. the latter intent, and the intent to limit benefits to less than the worker\u2019s pre-disability income is not as obvious as the Secretary represents, we hold the double offset contravenes Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">Deciding that the double offset has an effect contrary to Congressional intent does not end our inquiry, but rather presents us with the problem of determining how .to apply the statutes so they do not have an effect which runs counter to Congressional intent. The district court resolved the issue by deciding that state workers\u2019 compensation benefits should be offset against the first federal benefit awarded. This solution was explained as \u201cadministratively simple to apply\u201d and as consistent with the 1978 amendments to the Black Lung Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">Our problem with the district court solution is that it does more than correct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>found inconsistency between the laws and Congress\u2019 intent. Congress obviously did not intend the intersection of the programs to discourage a worker from applying for state workers\u2019 compensation. Thus, to correct the effect of the double offset and to allow the programs to operate in concert consistently with Congressional intent, the Secretary should be able to offset Social Security and black lung benefits against workers\u2019 compensation, but the total offset shall not exceed 100% of the miner\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">We AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE AND REMAND IN PART for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">.
