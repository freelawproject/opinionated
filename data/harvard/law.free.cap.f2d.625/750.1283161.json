Judge Joiner held on uncontested facts that defendant\u2019s motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5) should be granted since appellant\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim under which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-24\">Essentially, plaintiff asserted that he was subjected to three days of \u201ctop-lock\u201d isolation as a penalty for failing to stop playing cards when ordered to do so by a corrections officer at the State Prison of Southern Michigan. His complaint sought $50.00 of compensatory damages for each day of confinement to his cell. He also sought punitive damages of $150,000 against the corrections officer who brought the charge and the hearing officer who found him guilty of disobeying a direct order and ordered the penalty of three days of \u201ctop-lock\u201d confinement with credit for the three days already served.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-25\">We believe that the holding of <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) serves to bar any cause of action for plaintiff in relation to his due process claims pertaining to the hearing officer. Further, the three days separation of plaintiff from the prison population and its normal privileges while re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>stricted to his own cell, do not present a federal constitutional issue. See <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) and <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
