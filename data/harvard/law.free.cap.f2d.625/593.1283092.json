Respondent opposes the Board's petition for enforcement of its order by contending that the Board\u2019s findings of unfair labor practices \u2014 illegal acts which include fifteen discriminatory discharges, one discriminatory reduction of working hours, unilateral wage increases during contractual negotiations which had yet to reach an impasse, numerous instances of interrogation and threats regarding union activity, threats of plant closure should the union be elected, prohibitions against the wearing of union insignia, and numerous occasions of surveillance\u2014 are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We have canvassed all portions of this massive record which are relevant to the unfair labor practices before us, and we conclude that none of the Board\u2019s credibility determinations attacked by respondent is either inherently unreasonable or self-contradictory. <em>See, e. g., NLRB v. Randle-Eastern Ambulance Service, Inc., </em>584 F.2d 720, 730 (5th Cir. 1978). In short, our review of the record has led to our unwavering conviction that the Board\u2019s findings of unfair labor practices are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. With particular regard to the eight truck drivers discharged due to their purported uninsurability, we rely on the Board\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion reported at 241 N.L.R.B. No. 24 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Accordingly, the petition for enforcement is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
