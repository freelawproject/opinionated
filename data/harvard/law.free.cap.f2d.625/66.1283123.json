We hold that it is sufficient, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-22\">Upon arrival at Miami International Airport from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, on May 3, 1979, Elbert Grayson was found to have concealed on his person four packages containing 413.1 grams of dilute cocaine hydrochloride. This amount is the equivalent of 304.77 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-23\">Grayson was convicted on both counts of a two-count indictment charging importation of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He was sentenced to concurrent terms of two years imprisonment on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-24\">Intent to distribute a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 may be inferred solely from possession of a large amount of the substance. <em>United States v. Vomero, </em>567 F.2d 1315 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>469 F.2d 973 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Mather, </em>465 F.2d 1035 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1085, 93 S.Ct. 685, 34 L.Ed.2d 672 (1972). In <em>United States v. Mather </em>we found the defendant\u2019s possession of 197.75 grams of cocaine, without more, to be sufficient to support the inference that distribution was intended. Cf. <em>Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970); <em>United States v. Olvera, </em>523 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>1252 (5th Cir. 1975). (In these cases, the amount of cocaine, less than one gram and two grams, was too small to infer intent to distribute.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Because we find the cocaine found in Grayson\u2019s possession to be of sufficient quantity to support an inference of intent to distribute, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
