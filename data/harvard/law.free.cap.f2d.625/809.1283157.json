Hanson, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b874-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Petitioner appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of petitioner\u2019s requested ha-beas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">Petitioner primarily advances two arguments on appeal: (1) unlawful extradition and (2) deprivation of right to counsel through the admission of testimony by a state witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">Petitioner was arrested in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1968, on state charges of vagrancy and public intoxication. He waived extradition and voluntarily returned with officials to Arkansas when he was told that he was wanted in Arkansas only for parole violation and assault with intent' to kill. Upon returning, petitioner was charged with first degree murder. Petitioner is now serving a life sentence for that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">Petitioner argues that he was lured into the state of Arkansas by fraud and deceit and that the murder charge was pending against him at the time of the extradition request. Petitioner contends that this fraud voids the subsequent conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">Even assuming petitioner\u2019s alleged facts to be true, he is still not entitled to habeas relief. <em>Frisbie v. Collins, </em>342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S.Ct. 509, 511, 96 L.Ed.2d 541 (1952) (\u201cthe power of a court to try a person for a crime is not impaired by the fact that he was brought within the court\u2019s jurisdiction by reason of a \u2018forcible abduction.\u2019 \u2019\u2019); <em>Konigsberg v. Ciccone, </em>417 F.2d 161, 164 and 164 n. 1 (8th Cir. 1969), <em>cert denied, </em>397 U.S. 963, 90 S.Ct. 996, 25 L.Ed.2d 255 (1970); <em>Hunt v. Eyman, </em>405 F.2d 384 (9th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 1020, 89 S.Ct. 1644, 23 L.Ed.2d 46 (1969) (improper extradition does not entitle appellant to a writ of habeas corpus).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-20\">There is also a dispute over testimony by the state\u2019s chief witness, police offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>cer Tudor, who testified that petitioner had made an oral confession to him after being fully advised of his <em>\u201cMiranda </em>\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Petitioner makes some rather novel arguments in regard to this testimony, and concludes by alleging that there was a violation of appellant\u2019s right to counsel through the introduction of \u201cimpressions\u201d of an alleged unwritten statement made while appellant was without an attorney during custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">While the testimony of Tudor and the testimony of petitioner conflict, the only issue is one of credibility. There was no error in allowing the testimony. See, <em>Mosby v. State, </em>489 S.W.2d 799, 801 (Ark.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">We have reviewed all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and find no error by the district court. The district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-13\">. The Honorable Oren Harris, Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, conducted a hearing which included the testimony of petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-14\">. Petitioner also contends in his pro se brief that (1) he was not advised of his rights before or during interrogation; (2) the prosecutor failed to disclose all evidence to the jury in regard to petitioner\u2019s alleged confession; (3) petitioner was denied a copy of the transcript of a previous trial that resulted in a mistrial and (4) the district court erred in not requiring a record of sufficient completeness from the state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-22\">. There is a basis in the record from which one may conclude that petitioner confessed to the crime after he returned to Arkansas and that this confession was the basis for the charges being filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
