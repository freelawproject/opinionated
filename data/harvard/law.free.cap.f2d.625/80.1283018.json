The victim of the beating sued a number of defendants, including the local union and the international union. The district court found every defendant liable and assessed damages totalling over $850,000. We find that all but one defendant is liable, but substantially reduce the damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">Local 18 of the International Union of Operating Engineers includes virtually the entire state of Ohio and a small portion of the state of Kentucky. Local 18 has over 16,000 members who operate various types of construction equipment such as bulldozers and cranes. The local union is divided into six districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-19\">This case concerns events which occurred in District Two of Local 18. District two encompasses fifteen counties in northwest Ohio. Its headquarters is in Toledo. Since October of 1968, the appointed district representative who runs District Two has been John Frank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Frank\u2019s leadership was strongly opposed by a group of dissidents led by four brothers \u2014 John, Ervin, Walter and William Shimman. Mr. Frank was not the first union official opposed by the dissidents. The Shimmans were long-time union members who had a history of opposing the incumbent leadership. The dissidents claimed that the local union leaders behaved dictatorially. They thought that the membership needed protection from arbitrary behavior by union leaders, particularly district representatives.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-20\">The dissidents tangled often with the established leadership. In 1959, John Shim-man filed suit under \u00a7 101 of the then recently passed Landrum-Griffin Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He claimed that the local union had arbitrarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>refused to hold union meetings and that the local union leadership was conducting union affairs without regard for the wishes of the membership. After the suit was filed, the union resumed conducting open meetings. The case was eventually dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Throughout the 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s, various dissidents ran for union office. At different times, John, Walter and Ervin Shimman ran for and served on the Executive Board of Local 18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dissidents enjoyed some success in elections where only Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>trict Two members voted. Dissidents enjoyed no success in state-wide elections where all of Local 18\u2019s membership voted. The reason for this was that most dissident activities were centered in District Two, where the Shimmans lived and had support. Not surprisingly, the dissidents\u2019 chief antagonist was the man who was in charge of District Two, John Frank. Frank presided at district union meetings, oversaw the union\u2019s job referral system and otherwise conducted local union business at the district level. Frank\u2019s formal title was district representative. He was appointed, not elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Statewide, Local 18\u2019s chief executive officer is the Business Manager. The business manager\u2019s job is to direct and conduct all of the business of Local 18.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among other duties, the Business Manager appoints district representatives like John Frank.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> John Possehl is the Business Manager of Local 18. He, more than anyone else, ran Local 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In the 1971 local union election, William Shimman ran against John Possehl for the position of Business Manager. Dissident Glenn Oberle ran against John Frank for Vice-President. Both lost the election on a statewide basis, but did very well within District Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Union elections were also held in the summer of 1972. Again, dissident Glenn Oberle ran against John Frank for Vice-President. Again Oberle lost, although he gained more votes than Frank did within district two. William Shimman also ran against John Possehl for Business Manager, but again lost. However, Walter Shimman and fellow dissident Raymond Rojek were elected to serve as two of the District\u2019s three representatives on Local 18\u2019s execu--tive board.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> James Grothaus, a supporter of John Frank, was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The above background facts are undisputed. Most of the facts surrounding the event which led to this suit are also undisputed. District Representative John Frank was conducting a regularly scheduled District Two union meeting in Toledo, Ohio on September 11, 1972. Dissident union member Ervin Shimman was sitting in his seat taking notes. James Grothaus, a union member who supported the incumbent leadership, reached over Ervin Shimman\u2019s shoulder and snatched the .notes. Grothaus darted away to his seat .with the notes. Just as Grothaus was sitting down, John Shimman, Ervin\u2019s brother, reached over Grothaus\u2019 shoulder in an effort to retrieve the notes. Grothaus turned and knocked John Shimman to the ground. John Shim-man was then surrounded by bystanders. Terry Grothaus, the son of James Grothaus, kicked John Shimman in the head several times before being pulled away.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">John Shimman then filed the instant suit. He claimed that the beating he received was administered because of his dissident activities. He asserted that the beating violated his rights under \u00a7 101 of the Land-rum-Griffin Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, he added a pendant claim under Ohio state law for assault and battery and a claim alleging a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) and \u00a7 1986 because of a conspiracy to violate his civil rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>civil rights claim, but upheld liability under the Landrum-Griffin and assault and battery claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The district court ruled for the plaintiff in all significant respects. The court concluded that the beating had the purpose and effect of intimidating the dissidents. The court held that the beating had the obvious result of infringing on plaintiff John Shim-man\u2019s rights, protected under \u00a7 101 of the Landrum-Griffin Act. Further, the court concluded that the beating constituted an assault and battery under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The court found that James and Terry Grothaus were active participants in the beating. They were assessed $75,000 -and $25,000 punitive damages respectively. The court also found that John Frank had instigated and conspired to arrange the beating. He was assessed $75,000 in punitive damages. The court further found that Local 18 Business Manager John Possehl had sent Frank to suppress the dissidents. Accordingly, the court found Local 18 vicariously liable and assessed punitive damages at $250,000. On an identical theory, the court found the International Union liable and assessed $250,000 punitive damages against it. In addition, all defendants were held jointly and severally liable for $107,067.99 compensatory damages and $75,000 attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The court\u2019s key findings regarding the beating were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Although there was much evidence that the defendant John Frank had used his powers as business manager to keep himself in office by punishing those opposed to him, apparently the defeat of James Grothaus and the election of Raymond Rojek and Walter Shimman in 197[2] was more than usually galling to him. The evidence establishes quite clearly that this was because he had been appointed Business Manager of District 2 for the purpose of ending the division among the membership by eliminating the leaders of the dissidents, and was failing to do so. Some of the dissidents had scored against the defendant Frank and Local 18 before the National Labor Relations Board, and against James Gro-thaus in an assault and battery case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">The evidence establishes beyond any doubt that at a meeting early in September, 1972, the defendant Frank stated that Raymond Rojek needed a fist in his mouth, but that the blood should flow in the streets and not in the Union Hall. Thus the stage was set for the events which occurred at the general membership meeting of District 2 that was held on September 11, 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">Most of the evidence at the trial was concerned with the events of the September 11,1972 meeting. While the evidence was not without conflict as to details, those conflicts were of the kind which always occur when a number of different witnesses are describing the same occurrence. Absence of such conflicts normally indicates a fabricated story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">The principal actors in the meeting that night were the plaintiff, his brother, Ervin, and the individual defendants John Frank, James Grothaus, and his son, Terry Grothaus. The presence of the two Grothauses strengthens the conclusion that drastic means were to be resorted to in order to break the growing power of the dissident members. Neither of them had been working as an operating engineer for a long time. James Grothaus had gone into business for himself the .previous December. (He was still so engaged at the time of trial, and had not worked as an operating engineer since December, 1971.) Terry Grothaus had been severely wounded while a member of the United States Marine Corps in Viet Nam. As a consequence, he was on sick leave from his employment as a factory worker at Champion Spark Plug, where he had been employed since August, 1971. His last work as an operating engineer had been for a brief period shortly after his discharge from the military. He had never attended a Union meeting until the previous meeting on September 5, 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">The defendant Frank was in charge of the meeting, and set the tone by reporting the election results and denouncing in scatological terms the two members who had defeated candidates he favored. There were other indications that something out of the ordinary was going to happen, for the seating of those attending was unusual. The normal seating arrangements find the members of the dissident group sitting on the east side of the hall, with the organization leadership sitting on the west side. On September 11, the two Grothauses and some of their friends, including two who rarely, if ever, attended meetings, seated themselves on the east side of the hall, in proximity to the plaintiff and his brother Ervin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">The meeting was well along toward its close, and Ervin Shimman, who was located in his usual place, beside the drinking fountain was addressing the chair when James Grothaus came up behind him, stamped his feet, and shouted. Shimman, naturally, was startled. James Grothaus, with mock solicitude, said \u201cDid I scare you, Erv? I was only going for a drink of water.\u201d Instead of rebuking Grothaus for the interruption, the defendant Frank, in unbelievably crude and vulgar language, referred to Ervin Shimman\u2019s being startled. The episode provoked laughter, and Shimman took his seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">Ervin Shimman was taking notes in a small notebook, which he was accustomed to do. Although the Union had no rule forbidding this, and James Grothaus was well aware of that fact, he was accus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tomed to threaten note-takers that he would take their notes from them. He did this at the September 5, 1972 meeting, and was told that he had no right to do so. Nevertheless, on this occasion, after he had gotten his drink, and was returning, rapidly to his seat, he reached over Ervin Shimman\u2019s shoulder and snatched his notebook, continuing with unbroken pace to his seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">The plaintiff had been seated behind James Grothaus. Terry Grothaus was seated in the chair next to his father, James Grothaus. As James Grothaus was resuming his seat, the plaintiff attempted to reach over his shoulder and recover his brother\u2019s notebook. James Grothaus arose and made a complete turn around to his left, in the process striking plaintiff in the chest or stomach with his arm. The plaintiff doubled up and fell or was thrown against Terry Grothaus. Terry Grothaus pushed plaintiff to the floor, and kicked him several times in the head as plaintiff lay prone, attempting to cover his head with his hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">The whole episode occurred very quickly, as if it had been well planned. People sitting nearby pulled Terry Grothaus away, and James Grothaus told him to get out, which he did immediately. James Grothaus turned the stolen notebook over to one of his friends, who after-wards destroyed it. The police and an ambulance were called, and plaintiff was taken to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">Thereafter, Ray Rojek resigned from his office. The plaintiff has not attended any more union meetings, nor has Glenn Oberle, who had run against the defendant Frank in the 1972 election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">On appeal, the defendants have challenged every finding of fact and conclusion of law made by the district court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We will examine their claims <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">I. COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">The beating at the Union Hall on September 11, 1972, was also the subject of federal criminal proceedings. John Frank, Terry Grothaus and James Grothaus were charged with violating John Shimman\u2019s rights under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 530,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>counterpart to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412. Since both sides waived a jury trial, the cases came to trial before the court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court severed the case against John Frank. At the conclusion of the government\u2019s case against Terry and James Grothaus, the court dismissed the charges, concluding that no violation of \u00a7 530 had taken place. The government subsequently dropped criminal charges against John Frank.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The demise of criminal proceedings resulting from the September 11, 1972 beating has carried over to this case, which is a civil counterpart to the government action. The reason is that defendants argue that collateral estoppel should apply to bar John Shimman\u2019s civil suit. Defendants particularly point out that the district judge handling the criminal case stated in open court as he dismissed the action against the Gro-thaus\u2019 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">\u201c.. . . there is not one bit of evidence that any threats were used or any force or violence was used to keep Mr. John Shimman from attending a membership meeting, from expressing any views, arguments, or opinions, or expressing his views upon any business properly before the meeting. . . . This is merely an assault and battery case over which this court has no jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">We cannot agree with the defendants\u2019 claims. Collateral estoppel and res judicata are judicially established doctrines which bar litigating issues which have been litigated once already. The doctrines are based on an overall fairness rationale and are not to be \u201crigidly applied.\u201d <em>Tipler v. E. duPont de Nemours and Co., </em>443 F.2d 125, 128 (6th Cir. 1971). <em>See Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979); <em>United States v. La Fatch, </em>565 F.2d 81 (6th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 971, 98 S.Ct. 1611, 56 L.Ed.2d 62 (1978). Under established law, collateral estoppel cannot be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">It has been long established that an acquittal in a criminal prosecution does not bar a subsequent civil suit. There are several reasons for this. The principal reason is that the burden of proof in a criminal proceeding is far higher than that in a civil proceeding \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt as opposed to a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, the dismissal of criminal charges cannot operate to collaterally estop a civil proceeding. <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938) <em>distinguishing Coffey v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 427, 6 S.Ct. 432, 29 L.Ed. 681 (1886). See <em>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 93 S.Ct. 489, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972); <em>United States v. National Association of Real Estate Boards, </em>339 U.S. 485, 70 S.Ct. 711, 94 L.Ed. 1007 (1950); <em>Stone v. United States, </em>167 U.S. 178, 17 S.Ct. 778, 42 L.Ed. 127 (1897); <em>United States v. Burkhart, </em>501 F.2d 993 (6th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 946, 95 S.Ct. 1326, 43 L.Ed.2d 424 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Second, in this case, different parties are involved in the respective proceedings. In the criminal proceeding, the plaintiff was the United States. In this civil proceeding, the plaintiff is John C. Shimman. It has also long been the law that the doctrine of collateral estoppel only applies against a party to the first action. <em>Blonder-Tongue v. Univ. of Ill. Foundation, </em>402 U.S. 313, 329, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 1443, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971); <em>Humphreys v. Tann, </em>487 F.2d 666 (6th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 956, 94 S.Ct. 1970, 40 L.Ed.2d 307 (1974). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Park Lane Hosiery v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979) does not change this fundamental rule. <em>Park Lane Hosiery </em>holds that where it would be fair to do so, a different plaintiff may apply collateral estoppel against a defendant who has lost a previous suit involving the same issues. However, in this case, as in <em>Humphreys v. Tann, supra, </em>defendants are trying to apply collateral estoppel against a non-party to the first action. It would be unfair to bar the claim of a civil litigant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>simply because the government lost a related criminal case against the same defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Defendants\u2019 emphasis on the statements made in open court by the judge at the criminal trial is misplaced. The judge found \u201cnot one bit of evidence\u201d that John Shimman\u2019s \u00a7 101 free speech and assembly rights were violated. However, the court also stated its concern that a federal crime was being charged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We also note that the evidence presented at the criminal trial was spartan compared with that presented in the civil case before us.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We finally note that double jeopardy principles prevented the government from appealing the adverse verdict in the criminal proceeding. There was no way to get appellate review of the judge\u2019s decision. The facts of this case thus illustrate the reasonableness of established authority which makes collateral estoppel inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Liability of the Individual Defendants under the Landrum-Griffin Act</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">A. General Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On appeal, the defendants have attacked the district court\u2019s findings of fact as unsupported by the record. Defendants admit that John Shimman was beaten at the September 11, 1972 union meeting, but claim that the beating was an isolated, spontaneous incident of short duration. Defendants argue that neither John Shimman, his brothers, nor any of the dissidents has ever been refused the right to attend or speak at union meetings or to exercise any \u201cunion democracy\u201d right conferred by \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The record does contain much evidence that John Shimman and his fellow dissidents were never prevented from attending union meetings, from voting in union elections, or from openly exercising their free speech rights. Indeed, John Shimman testified directly that this was so.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">The defendants did not forcibly eject the dissidents from union meetings. Nor did the defendants physically prevent the dissidents from speaking out, nominating candidates or otherwise participating in union business. Defendants couple these facts with the argument that the beating of John Shimman was a spontaneous, unpredictable occurrence to reach the conclusion that no \u00a7 101 violation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">There is evidence in the record supporting defendants' argument. The fact that the dissidents have long existed and remained active in the union indicates that they were vigorously exercising their rights. Further, to many if not most of the 80 or so' union members who attended the meeting on September 11, 1972, the scuffle between John Shimman and James and Terry Grothaus did appear to be spontaneous and unexpected.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">Unfortunately for the defendants, the district court did not agree with their theory of the beating. The court thought that the September 1972 incident was far more than a simple altercation between union members. The court concluded that the beating of John Shimman was part of a scheme directed by John Frank to intimidate the dissidents and cower them into silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">We do not doubt that a deliberate attack on a union member can amount to a violation of \u00a7 101. In fact, there are few more direct ways of chilling the exercise of a union member\u2019s Landrum-Griffin Act rights than by beating him up.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>issue here is whether the record supports the district court\u2019s determination that the beating was deliberately administered in order to teach the dissidents a lesson. An isolated fight between two union members has nothing to do with the Landrum-Griffin Act. A beating designed to punish dissidents violates the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Of course, under F.R.Civ.Pro. 52, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the district court. We can only reverse findings of fact if we are convinced that they are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">B. Liability of John Frank and James and Terry Grothaus</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that John Frank, James Grothaus and Terry Grothaus conspired to intimidate the dissidents is not clearly erroneous. Nor can we overturn the court\u2019s conclusion that the beating of John Shimman was at the very least a foreseeable result of events which Frank and the Grothauses deliberately set in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">It is not disputed that John Shimman and his brothers were the leaders of a long established group of dissidents in District Two. The hostile relationship between the dissidents and the entrenched leadership, that of John Frank, is a matter of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">In January of 1972, dissident Walter Shimman filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Local 18. He charged that the local had discriminated against him in job referrals and had threatened him and fellow dissidents with reprisals because of the dissidents\u2019 opposition to the established leadership. Dissident Glenn Oberle filed similar charges in April of 1972. The charges were consolidated and a hearing was held before an NLRB Administrative Law Judge in July of 1972. In an exhaustive opinion, the ALJ found that John Frank threatened to retaliate against the dissidents on numerous occasions in 1971 because of their anti-incumbent activities. He also found that Frank carried out his threats by denying Walter Shimman and Glenn Oberle job referrals to which they were entitled. The NLRB adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings and this court enforced the Board\u2019s order. <em>International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 18, AFL-CIO, </em>205 NLRB 146 (1973), <em>enforced, </em>500 F.2d 48 (6th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Much of the testimony which was presented to the ALJ was repeated in the trial below. This testimony supports the NLRB\u2019s finding that John Frank discrimi-natorily refused to permit dissidents Walter Shimman and Glenn Oberle to work because they ran for union offices in opposition to the incumbent leadership in 1971 and engaged in other intra-union political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The antagonism between John Frank and the dissidents cannot be questioned. In the words of one witness, the dissidents were a thorn in John Frank\u2019s side. The district court found that when threats and job reprisals did not succeed in intimidating the dissidents, that Frank turned to violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We find extensive evidence in the record to support this finding. Former union member Barney McCoy testified that John Frank asked him to be one of \u201ca half-dozen good men to straighten some of these people out\u201d \u2014 \u201cpeople like Jack [John] Shim-man, Bill [William] Shimman and Bud [Glenn] Oberle.\u201d McCoy had no doubt what John Frank meant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">The substance was that he wanted whatever it took to get them out of the hall. Now, when you talk to this man when he makes a statement of that nature you know what it takes. The word murder wasn\u2019t in there, but you had a good idea \u201cwhatever it took\u201d means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1m\">McCoy testified that Frank promised that \u201ceverything will be taken care of,\u201d including attorneys\u2019 fees should any of the men be caught. Frank mentioned two other \u201cgood men\u201d to McCoy in the conversation: Kenneth Delaney and James Grothaus. Mr. Delaney was held in contempt of court for refusing to testify in the trial below. James Grothaus was one of the men who struck John Shimman on September 11, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In July of 1972, testimony was being taken before the NLRB\u2019s Administrative Law Judge on Glenn Oberle\u2019s and Walter Shim-man\u2019s charges of discriminatory job referrals. At a union meeting during this time, John Frank verbally attacked Glenn Oberle for going to the NLRB. Ken Delaney and James Grothaus joined Frank in ridiculing dissident Oberle.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The dissidents usually took notes at union meetings. John Frank was strongly opposed to this practice. He ran the meetings and much of what he said was being taken down. During the NLRB hearing in July of 1972, dissident notes proved useful in refreshing the dissidents\u2019 recollections. With the help of the notes, the dissidents were able to testify with precision regarding John Frank's conduct. At an August, 1972 Advisory Board<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> meeting of District Two, the note-taking issue was brought up. This was the first such meeting since the NLRB hearings. Two dissidents testified at trial that James Grothaus stated at the advisory board meeting that no one taking notes was going to leave the meeting with the notes. John Frank stated that the dissidents were permitted to take notes, but that disciplinary proceedings might be invoked.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In August of 1972, union election results concerning the 1972 elections were published. As previously mentioned, the dissidents had fielded many candidates for a variety of union offices. William Shimman had run against John Possehl for Business Manager of Local 18. Glenn Oberle had run against John Frank for Vice-President of Local 18. These were \u201cstatewide\u201d officers, voted on by the full membership of the local. In addition, the dissidents ran for offices within the district. Dissidents Ray Rojek and Walter Shimman ran for the position of district representative to the local\u2019s execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tive board.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, Walter Shimman ran for a seat on the district advisory board.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The dissidents did not succeed in the statewide elections for union office, but made a good showing within District Two. In fact, Glenn Oberle collected more votes within the district than John Frank did for the Vice-President\u2019s spot. Moreover, the dissidents were very successful in the district level elections. Ray Rojek and Walter Shimman were elected as district representatives to the local\u2019s executive board. James Grothaus, who also ran for that office, was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">On September 5, 1972, another district advisory board meeting took place. This was the first union meeting of any kind since the election results had been announced. John Frank presided at this meeting. He was not pleased with the dissidents\u2019 partial election successes. The district court credited testimony that John Frank stated at the meeting that dissident Ray Rojek needed a fist in his mouth, and that blood should flow in the streets, although not in the union hall. In addition, there was testimony that James Grothaus sat between dissidents Walter Shimman and Ray Rojek at the meeting and engaged in a tug of war with Mr. Rojek over the latter\u2019s briefcase. The district court reasonably found that the words and conduct of both Mr. Frank and Mr. Grothaus were threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The regular membership meeting of District 2 took place on September 11, 1972. This was the meeting at which John Shim-man was beaten. Since the meeting was attended by over 80 union members, there is extensive testimony in the record as to what occurred. There are, of course, many minor variances in the testimony. The district court\u2019s view of the testimony, reproduced above, is a fair and reasonable account of what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Upon review of the record, we are convinced that the district court could have credited dissident testimony that the seating arrangement at the meeting was unusual in that Frank\u2019s supporters were seated in areas normally occupied by dissidents. The court could have reasonably inferred that Frank\u2019s verbal attacks on the dissidents during the meeting and his refusal to keep the meeting under control was part of a scheme to physically attack one of the dissidents. The court could have also inferred the existence of a conspiracy from Frank\u2019s open approval of James Grothaus\u2019 conduct when Grothaus threateningly rushed Ervin Shimman prior to getting a drink of water and stealing Shimman\u2019s notebook.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">There is additional evidence from which the court could have inferred that the beating of John Shimman was not spontaneous. James Grothaus was self-employed. He had not worked as an operating engineer since December, 1971. His son, Terry Gro-thaus, worked for the Champion Spark Plug Company and had not worked as an operating engineer since 1970. Two friends of James Grothaus, Gary Agler and Albert Dawes were unknown to anyone else. The only union meetings ever attended by Terry Grothaus, Agler, or Dawes were the September 5, 1972, advisory board meeting where the dissidents were threatened and the September 11, 1972, general meeting where John Shimman was beaten up. The district court was not bound to accept Terry Grothaus, Agler\u2019s and Dawes\u2019 conflicting explanations as to why they picked those particular meetings to attend. Nor was the district court bound to accept James Gro-thaus\u2019 testimony that he never actually struck John Shimman, or Terry Grothaus\u2019 testimony, that he kicked John Shimman on the floor because Shimman had struck him while trying to retrieve the notes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We note that James Grothaus and Terry Gro-thaus weighed over 220 pounds each. John and Ervin Shimman were estimated to weigh about 170 pounds each.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>We reiterate that the incident in question here was not a spat among old friends. It was the culmination of years of antagonism. For example, there was testimony that John Frank continually threatened and verbally abused the dissidents.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The evidence outlined above supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants resorted to violence after their other efforts to silence the dissidents had failed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">As the district court noted, most of the facts in this case were not disputed. It is true that the defendants disclaimed liability and denied making some of the more egregious statements attributed to them. However, their credibility was for the fact-finder to determine. Ultimately, this case hinges on the reasonableness of the inferences drawn by the district court. Upon careful review of the record, we find the court\u2019s inferences reasonable and well-supported. John Shimman was beaten by thugs acting at the direction of John Frank because of Shimman\u2019s dissident activities.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">III. LIABILITY OF THE DEFENDANT UNIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The district court found the International Union of Operating Engineers and the local union, Local 18, liable for the assault on John Shimman. The court premised liability against both the local and the international on two theories: (1) express authorization; 2) carelessness in the selection of agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Specifically, the court found culpability because of the conduct of John Possehl, who was a Vice-President of the International Union and also Business Manager of the local. The court found that Possehl was warned of Frank\u2019s threats and conduct, but failed to remove Frank or otherwise eliminate problems between him and the dissidents. In addition, the court stated that it had \u201cno doubt that both Local 18 and the International Union had determined that it would be necessary to use physical violence to beat the members of District Two into submission, and the named individual defendants [Frank, James Grothaus, Terry Grothaus] were the agents selected for the purpose.\u201d The district court\u2019s explanation of why the local and international unions should be liable is not very helpful. Instead of remanding for more specific analysis, however, we have carefully examined the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Unions, like corporations or other artificial entities, can act only through their agents. Under general principles of agency, a union can be liable if its officers and agents actively participate in unlawful conduct. <em>Morrissey v. National Maritime Unions of America, </em>544 F.2d 19, 25 (2d Cir. 1976) (Landrum-Griffin Act); <em>Riverside Coal Co. v. U.M.W., </em>410 F.2d 267, 270-72 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 846, 90 S.Ct. 89, 24 L.Ed.2d 95 (1969) (Taft-Hartley Act). Most such situations arise in the case of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>illegal strike. Whether the union is liable for damages resulting from an illegal strike depends on the conduct of its officials in differing fact situations. <em>See Koehring Co. v. United Steelworkers, </em>616 F.2d 919 (6th Cir. 1980); <em>Buckeye Power, Inc. v. Utility Workers Union of America, </em>607 F.2d 695 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>Southern Ohio Coal Co. v. U.M.W., </em>551 F.2d 695 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 876, 98 S.Ct. 227, 54 L.Ed.2d 155; <em>Riverton Coal Co. v. U.M.W., </em>453 F.2d 1035 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>407 U.S. 915, 92 S.Ct. 2439, 32 L.Ed.2d 690 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The rule of law remains, however, that a union \u201cmay only be held responsible for the authorized or ratified actions of its officers and agents.\u201d <em>North American Coal Co. v. U.M.W., </em>497 F.2d 459, 466-67 (6th Cir. 1974) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">This same rule of law applies in situations where both a local and an international union are sued. The fact that an officer of the local union may have transgressed does not mean that the International is liable.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Supreme Court first outlined this principle in <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co., </em>259 U.S. 344, 395, 42 S.Ct. 570, 577-578, 66 L.Ed. 975 (1921) <em>opinion after remand, </em>268 U.S. 295, 45 S.Ct. 551, 69 L.Ed. 963 (1923) when discussing the liability of the parent United Mine Worker\u2019s Union for strike-related violence at the local level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">A corporation is responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course of its business, and this principle is enforced against the contention that torts are <em>ultra vires </em>of the corporation. But it must be shown that it is in the business of the corporation. Surely no stricter rule can be enforced against an unincorporated organization like this. Here it is not a question of contract, or of holding out an appearance of authority on which some third person acts. It is a mere question of actual agency, which the constitutions of the two bodies settle conclusively. If the International body had interfered or if it had assumed liability by ratification, different questions would have arisen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Plaintiff contends that the <em>Coronado </em>rule applies only in strike situations and evinces a higher standard for liability than would ordinarily apply. Plaintiff argues that this higher standard is the one codified in \u00a7 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> applicable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>labor-strike situations only. Plaintiff is wrong, <em>Coronado </em>simply states the common law agency rule of respondeat superior, as applied to a labor union generally. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Carbon Fuel Co. v. United Mine Workers, </em>444 U.S. 212, 100 S.Ct. 410, 62 L.Ed.2d 394 (1979) demonstrates this. There, the Court found no basis for holding an international union liable for a strike \u201cnot authorized, participated in, or ratified by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. The Court made clear that this standard was that of common law agency, as codified by Congress in \u00a7 301(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(e) <em>id. </em>The Court also made clear that this was the standard originally used in <em>Coronado.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The question which remains, then, is whether either Local 18 or the parent International Union of Operating Engineers could be liable under the above agency standard for the beating of John Shimman.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">A. Liability of Local 18</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We see ample evidence in the record supporting a finding of liability against Local 18. The conduct of John Frank and John Possehl is the basis for this liability. Frank, of course, was the appointed head of district two as well as Vice-President of the local. Possehl was the Business Manager of the local.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Much of the evidence in the record regarding John Frank\u2019s conduct has already been outlined above. There is more. Ervin Shimman testified that he had a lengthy telephone conversation with John Frank on October 14,1971. Ervin Shimman testified that during this conversation Frank made numerous threats, including \u201cif you don\u2019t go along with me, you are my enemy , and I destroy all my enemies.\u201d Frank also stated: \u201cI am the hatchetman from Cleveland. I come here to chop heads and you are one of the heads I am going to chop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">The next day, Ervin Shimman spoke with John Possehl and informed him of John Frank\u2019s threats. Possehl did intercede with Frank and arranged for Ervin Shimman to get a job referral to which he was clearly entitled. At about this time, John Frank was denying work assignments to Glenn Oberle and Walter Shimman.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Walter Shimman complained to John Possehl about this, but received no satisfaction. Walter Shimman testified that he outlined Frank\u2019s conduct to John Possehl and requested Pos-sehl to remove Frank from the district before there was trouble. Possehl\u2019s response was \u201cno, I sent him here for a job and he is going to do it. I know there is trouble in this district and I know it is in the office.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> On September 16, 1971, Glenn Ob-erle wrote to John Possehl, also outlining John Frank\u2019s conduct. Possehl sent back a non-committal letter but apparently took no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>action. The testimony regarding John Pos-sehl is unrefuted.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The plaintiff argues, and the district court apparently found, that Possehl sent Frank to suppress the long-time dissidents in District Two. It is clear that Possehl failed to act when informed of John Frank\u2019s abusive conduct.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Although there is no direct evidence in the record of open antagonism between Possehl and the dissidents, it is obvious that their interests were opposed. Possehl, as Business Manager of Local 18, was a key official opposed by the dissidents. Indeed, they ran candidates against him. Possehl essentially did nothing when he received notice of John Frank\u2019s illegal and highhanded conduct. Possehl at the very least had an obligation to see to it that his subordinate, John Frank, did not flout the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The conduct of Frank and Possehl, in our opinion, justifies finding Local 18 liable. Frank was the district representative who ran District Two on behalf of Local 18. His long-term anti-dissident conduct was within the scope of his authority. Frank\u2019s conduct in instigating the beating of John Shimman is imputable to the local union. The local\u2019s liability also stems from Business Manager John Possehl\u2019s inaction despite continuing anti-dissident conduct by John Frank.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">B. Liability of the International Union</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">While we affirm the finding of liability against the local union, we see no basis for the district court\u2019s finding of liability against the International. Throughout its opinion, the district court referred to both unions as if though they were one and the same. They are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The International Union is a separate body from the local. The acts of the local and its agents cannot automatically be imputed to the International. This is clear from the International Union of Operating Engineers\u2019 Constitution which defines the relationship between the International and its affiliated locals. Under the constitution, local unions govern themselves and transact business on their own behalf.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Local unions can call strikes on their own, except when a collective bargaining agreement is in existence or when the local union desires the International\u2019s help with strike benefits.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Local unions elect their own officers, pass their own by-laws, transact business and discipline members.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Plaintiff argues that the local is an agent of the International because of the International\u2019s retention of substantial regulatory and supervisory powers.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This ig-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u00f1ores the local\u2019s substantial autonomy in handling its own affairs. The local is simply not an arm of the International for all purposes.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The dispute over which this case is about was a local matter. The record shows that dissident activities were directed to correct certain abuses of power by local union leaders, notably at the district level. According to the dissidents, the local union leadership did whatever it could to keep itself in power and reward its friends. The International Constitution left the running of day to day local affairs to locally elected union representatives (such as John Possehl) and their appointees (such as John Frank). The wrongful conduct of these local union leaders cannot be imputed to the International, absent proof of actual International participation or ratification. Any other holding would render the International Union of Operating Engineers liable for any misconduct of locally elected union officials. We decline to so expand union liability concepts.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Under some circumstances, a local union\u2019s officers or agents can be deemed to act on behalf of the International. We do not see how this can be true when dealing with a local controversy between locally elected union officials and a minority of the local membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In the alternative, plaintiff argues that John Possehl\u2019s conduct must be deemed to be that of the International. This is because Possehl was one of eleven general Vice-Presidents of the International, in addition to being Business Manager of the local. We do not agree. It is clear that any wrongful conduct by John Possehl was done in his capacity as Business Manager of Local 18. The fact that he was also an International Vice-President is, on these facts, irrelevant. It is an established principle of agency law that if an agent serves two masters, his conduct may be on behalf of one, the other, neither, or both masters, depending on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In this case, the fact that John Possehl was an International Vice-President was a coincidence. It was in his capacity as elected Business Manager of Local 18 that Pos-sehl appointed John Frank to run District Two. The only reason why the dissidents had any dealings with Possehl at all was because Possehl was the business manager of the Local. In fact, dissident correspondence to Possehl always addressed him in his capacity as Business Manager and not as an International Vice-President. There is simply no evidence that anything Possehl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>did or did not do vis-a-vis the dissidents was done on behalf of the International.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Aside from John Possehl, there exists no connection between the International and the beating of John Shimman. John Frank was not an officer or employee of the International, nor was there any evidence that he ever acted on behalf of the International. The same thing is true of James and Terry Grothaus. Nor is there any evidence that the International ratified the beating or any of John Frank\u2019s anti-dissident activities. Under the International Constitution, only the general president or the general executive board could do that. Simply stated, there is no proof that anyone acting on behalf of the International in any way encouraged, participated in or ratified the beating of John Frank.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Plaintiff makes one final argument. He claims that the International was under a duty to oversee and correct the anti-dissident abuses which were going on within Local 18. He finds this duty in the Landrum-Griffin Act,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> in the common law,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and in the International\u2019s Constitution.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Once again, plaintiff points his finger at John Possehl and accuses him of breaching these duties in his capacity as an International Vice-President.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">We reject this argument. It is an attempt to find an international union vicariously liable for mere inaction on the part of its officers.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In the collective bargaining area, Congress favors arbitration and conciliation. Congress does not favor strikes which breach collective bargaining agreements. Yet, even if an illegal strike takes place, an international union is not liable if it fails to take steps to end the strike, so long as the union does not authorize, encourage or ratify the strike. <em>Carbon Fuel Co., supra; North America Coal Co., supra. </em>We think that the same law should apply here. An international union which does not authorize, encourage or ratify \u00a7 101 violations should not be held liable for them. Otherwise, International Unions could be destroyed by liability findings based on a hindsight analysis of what they should have done. Like the Supreme Court in <em>Carbon Fuel Co., </em>we will not imply an obligation to act from alleged general duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">IV. DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">A. Actual Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The district court awarded John Shim-man $107,067.99 compensatory damages. Of this amount, $32,067.99 was for medical bills and lost wages and $75,000 was for pain and suffering. The medical bills to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>taled just over $8,000. No one disputes them. The lost wage award of $24,058.19 is challenged on appeal. The district court did not state how it computed this amount. An examination of days and hours of work lost for the years 1972-74, however, reveals that the court\u2019s finding is reasonable. Plaintiff presented evidence that he missed 488 hours of work m 1972, 608 hours in 1973 and 280 hours in 1974 due to hospitalization and illness resulting from his injuries. Even including this lost time, John Shim-man worked less than average hours in each of the years in question. Accordingly, additional sums were added to compensate him for his below average earnings. True, this latter computation is open to some doubt because it assumes that all of John Shim-man\u2019s below average working hours from 1972-1974 were due only to the beating and not to any other cause. However, there was uncontradicted medical testimony in support of this proposition. In addition, the total lost wage is reasonable if one compares John Shimman\u2019s 1970-1972 pre-beat-ing earnings with his 1972-1974 post-beating earnings. The difference is about $25,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Defendants also attack the $75,000 pain and suffering award as excessive. They emphasize that John Shimman suffered no organic injury except a small cut on the back of his hand while he protected his head from Terry Grothaus\u2019 kicks. It is true that x-rays and lab tests were negative and that John Shimman required no surgery. There was, however, extensive evidence presented that John Shimman suffered very real psychiatric problems because of the beating. Doctors who treated John Shimman immediately after the beating diagnosed him as suffering from a cerebral concussion. He complained of pain, dizziness, loss of memory. Doctors and nurses noted that he was nauseous, restless, afraid and occasionally spoke incoherently. For the next two years, plaintiff suffered from anxiety, tension and depression. He was hospitalized several times and given both electroshock and insulin shock treatments. He has continued to receive psychotherapy and medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Defendants presented no medical evidence in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s extensive presentation. Defendants did suggest that perhaps the plaintiff was malingering or exaggerating his injuries. However, they presented no evidence to this effect. The plaintiff\u2019s doctors testified that he was not faking. The plaintiff underwent extensive therapy and continues to take medication. Still, he tried to, and did work after the beating, albeit fewer hours than before. There is no evidence of malingering in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Defendants also suggest that plaintiff\u2019s difficulties stemmed from his personality structure and not from the beating. It is true that the psychiatric testimony labeled plaintiff\u2019s personality structure as passive-aggressive. All that this means, however, is that the plaintiff\u2019s personality may have made it difficult for him to bounce back from the physical and emotional trauma of the beating. However, the <em>cause </em>of plaintiff\u2019s anxiety, depression, etc., was the beating. Defendants must take their victim as they find him. Prosser, Law of Torts, 261-62 (4th ed. 1971); Restatement 2d of Torts \u00a7 461 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Given the uncontradicted medical testimony, we do not find excessive the district court\u2019s award of $75,000 for pain and suffering. The award was within the bounds of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">B. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The district court awarded plaintiff $75,-000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. The parties have stipulated that the amount was reasonable. The only question is whether they should have been awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Attorney\u2019s fees are allowed in \u00a7 412 suits brought to vindicate \u00a7 101 rights. <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 14, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 1950, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973). This is true under two theories: 1) when defendants act maliciously, in bad faith; 2) where plaintiffs\u2019 action has resulted in a common benefit. <em>Hall v. Cole, supra. </em>Attorneys\u2019 fees are also allowed in assault and battery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>cases under Ohio law. <em>Gates v. City of Toledo, </em>57 Ohio St. 105, 111, 48 N.E. 500 (1897). The district court found that the defendants had acted in bad faith and awarded attorney\u2019s fees on that rationale. The district court also thought that Frank and the Grothaus\u2019 had lied at trial. As we have previously stated, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that John Frank encouraged or directed the Grothaus\u2019 beating of John Shimman. We think that this finding warrants the award of attorneys\u2019 fees because of defendants\u2019 malicious conduct. We do not need to discuss the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">V. PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"AFx5\">The district court awarded a total of $675,000 in punitive damages \u2014 $250,000 against the International, $250,000 against Local 18, $75,000 against John Frank, $75,-000 against James Grothaus and $25,000 against Terry Grothaus. Because of our previous finding that the International Union could not be liable, the punitive damage award against it cannot stand. The question is whether the remaining punitive damages awards can stand. Punitive damages, where legally appropriate, should be awarded to punish but not to destroy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">As a threshold matter, the defendants argue that punitive damages are unavailable under \u00a7 101. This issue is uncertain in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. Foust, </em>442 U.S. 42, 99 S.Ct. 2121, 60 L.Ed.2d 698 (1979). There, the Court ruled that punitive damages could not be awarded against a union which breached its duty of fair representation under the Taft-Hartley Act. The Court specifically left open the issue of the availability of punitive damages under \u00a7 101. <em>Id. </em>at 2125 n. 9. Four members of the Court who disagreed with the majority\u2019s <em>per se </em>rule, however, noted that the rationale for the majority\u2019s opinion also extended to \u00a7 412 suits. <em>Id. </em>at 2125.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The courts of appeals are unanimous on the issue, however. In <em>Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Boilermakers v. Braswell, </em>388 F.2d 193 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>391 U.S. 935, 88 S.Ct. 1848, 20 L.Ed.2d 854 (1968) Judge Wisdom wrote that punitive damages are allowable on a showing of \u201cactual malice or reckless or wanton indifference\u201d by a union for the rights of its members. <em>Id. </em>at 199. That holding has been endorsed by the second and ninth circuits. <em>Morrisey v. National Maritime Union, </em>544 F.2d 19 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Cooke v. Orange Belt District Council, </em>529 F.2d 815 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">This court, in <em>McCraw v. United Association of Journeymen &amp; App. of Plumbing, </em>341 F.2d 705, 706-07 (6th Cir. 1965) strongly suggested that punitive damages were unavailable under \u00a7 101.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>McGraw, </em>however, has been subject to severe criticism by other courts. <em>See Feltington v. Moving Picture Machine Operators, </em>605 F.2d 1251, 1257-1258 n. 4 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>Simmons v. Avisco Local 713, </em>350 F.2d 1012, 1018 (4th Cir. 1965). <em>See also Hildebrand v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>607 F.2d 705, 707, 708 n. 4 (6th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">We need not address <em>McGraw\u2019s </em>present viability. The reason is that the underlying conduct complained of was an assault and battery under Ohio law. Punitive damages are clearly available under this pendant state claim, which is coextensive with the \u00a7 101 claim.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Indeed, punitive damages in such situations have become \u201ccommon-place.\u201d <em>Ranells v. City of Cleveland, </em>41 Ohio St.2d 1, 321 N.E.2d 885, 887 n. 2 (1975). The question remains whether the punitive damages awards were excessive<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and whether punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>should have been awarded against all defendants. We are, of course, aware that punitive damages awards are not favored by the law and are awarded only where willful and wanton conduct occurs. <em>Marr </em>v. <em>Rife, </em>503 F.2d 735 (6th Cir. 1973). We are also aware that under Ohio law there need not be \u201cany mathematical relationship between the actual and punitive damages in a particular case.\u201d <em>Wood v. Stark Tri-County Building Trades Council, </em>473 F.2d 272, 274 (6th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The punitive damages awarded here were, in some respects, excessive. Although we appreciate the district court\u2019s outrage at defendants\u2019 conduct, the truth is that this suit only seeks redress of one of dissident\u2019s wrongs. It is true that the incumbent leadership\u2019s earlier conduct against various dissidents can and should be taken into account in determining punitive damages. This earlier conduct demonstrates the malicious motivation behind the beating of John Shimman.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> However, the earlier conduct cannot itself be a basis for recovery. Indeed, most of the other clashes between John Frank, <em>et a 1. </em>and the dissidents did not involve John Shimman, they involved his brothers and other dissidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We also conclude that we should direct a remission of punitive damages on this appeal instead of remanding for a recomputation. In two recent cases, this court has recalculated damages on appeal instead of remanding. <em>Clissold v. St. Louis-S.F.Ry. Co., </em>600 F.2d 35 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>Drayton v. Jiffee Chemical Corp., </em>591 F.2d 352 (6th Cir. 1978). Each of these cases was decided over strong dissent. As Judge Engel emphasized in <em>Drayton, supra, </em>\u201cwhere, in a bench trial, an award of damages is found to be excessive, the preferred course is to refer the case back to the court which originally tried it for reconsideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Nonetheless, as in <em>Drayton, supra, </em>we find this case appropriate for direct remission here. This case has been in the courts for over six years. Both sides deserve a final adjudication. The only damages we remit are punitive damages. We are in as good a position as the district court on this issue. We fully accept the court\u2019s finding of heinous behaviour. The data concerning the defendants\u2019 financial status is plain on the record. Thus, we need not weigh conflicting testimony. <em>See Guzman v. Western State Bank of Devils Lake, </em>540 F.2d 948, 954 (8th Cir. 1976) (remission of punitive damages); <em>Texas Co. v. R. O\u2019Brien &amp; Co., </em>242 F.2d 526, 529 (1st Cir. 1957) (remission of damages where record below is undisputed). <em>Cf. Petition of United States Steel Corp., </em>479 F.2d 489 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 859, 94 S.Ct. 71,</p>\n<p id=\"AKb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>38 L.Ed.2d 110 (1973) (remission of damages \u00e1fter district court failed to recalculate damages properly on initial remand.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">A. John Frank</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">John Frank, of course, was the dissidents\u2019 main antagonist. The evidence supports the district court\u2019s determination that Frank instigated the beating of John Shim-man. The district court assessed punitive damages at $75,000. John Frank\u2019s income in 1973, 1974 and 1975 was $22,106.00, $22,-447.00 and $26,763.00 respectively. His net worth in 1975 was $28,000. We think that John Frank\u2019s conduct warrants imposition of punitive damages. We think that $75,-000 is excessive. Given his financial situation, we believe that $20,000 is the maximum sum which should be awarded as a deterrent measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">8. James Grothaus</p>\n<p id=\"ang-dedup-0\">James Grothaus knocked John Shimman to the floor. The district court also found that Grothaus was a ringleader in the plan to beat a dissident. The record supports this finding. The district court assessed punitive damages at $75,000. James Gro-thaus\u2019 income in 1972, 1973 and 1975 was $20,410.94, $27,454.64 and $43,601.00 respectively. His net worth in 1975 was $23,-675.00. We also think that $75,000 is excessive. We believe that $20,000 is the maximum deterrent sum which should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">C. Terry Grothaus</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Terry Grothaus kicked John Shimman several times after Shimman had been knocked to the floor. The district court assessed punitive damages at $25,000. Terry Grothaus is a Vietnam veteran who suffered from epilepsy from head wounds. As a result he receives a government pension of $4,272.00 per year. In 1973, 1974 and 1975, Terry Grothaus earned $11,095.00, $9,468.00 and $10,414.00 respectively. These sums were in addition to his pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Terry Grothaus\u2019 conduct in kicking a defenseless man while he lay on the floor justifies an award of punitive damages. However, given his limited financial means, we think that $5,000 will accomplish the deterrent effect sought by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">D. Local 18</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">Perhaps the most difficult judgment to be made concerns the liability of Local 18 for punitive damages. We have previously detailed the evidence which renders Local 18 liable for the conduct of John Possehl and John Frank. Local 18\u2019s assets are over $2,500,000. Thus, unlike the case of the individual defendants, this award is not, on its face, excessive. However, the ones who will end up paying for the punitive damages award are the union members. For this reason, courts should be slow to award huge punitive damages awards against unions.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>See Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Elect. Workers v. Foust, supra. </em>The district court assessed punitive damages at $250,000. Keeping in mind the trial court\u2019s generous award of actual damages \u2014 which is likely to be collected from Local 18 \u2014 we think that the punitive damages award, while warranted, is excessive. The sum of $100,000 should prove adequate to deter wrongdoing by local unions in Local 18\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">In conclusion, we reverse the finding of liability against the International Union and remand with directions to dismiss. We affirm the judgment of liability against all other defendants. We affirm the award of $107,873.99 actual damages, assessed jointly and severally against all defendants. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>also affirm the award of $75,000 in attorney\u2019s fees against all defendants. We modify the award of punitive damages against Terry Grothaus from $25,000 to $5,000. We modify the award of punitive damages against James Grothaus from $75,000 to $20,000. We modify the award of punitive damages against John Frank from $75,000 to $20,000. We modify the award of punitive damages against Local 18 from $250,-000 to $100,000. As modified, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Each side will bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-12\">.

We note that the various causes of action alleged by plaintiff are coextensive. That is, the rights protected under the Landrum-Griffin Act, the Civil Rights Act and Ohio tort law are, in this case, one and the same. The reason is that liability is predicated on the beating John Shimman received. Depending on the motivation for the beating, it could constitute a violation of the Landrum-Griffin Act or the Civil Rights Act as well as being a common-law tort. However, for purposes of damages, it makes no difference on what theory liability is based. The beating is the basis for the damages award under all theories. <em>See U.M.W. v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 721-29, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1136, 1140, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Because of this, we need not reach the issue raised in plaintiffs cross-appeal of the district court\u2019s determination that he could not maintain an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983(3) and \u00a7 1986. Even if the plaintiff could also bring suit under these Civil Rights statutes, his recovery would not be affected. <em>Compare Mor-rissey v.

The function of the district advisory board is not clear from the record but it appears to be very limited. The board is composed of elected union members representing a broad variety of work interests. Local 18 Bylaws Art. XXIV Sec. 1. The advisory board\u2019s role is akin to that of the district membership meeting \u2014 to make recommendations to the Local, discuss matters of general interest and to preliminarily inquire into misconduct charges filed against a union member.

Ervin Shimman testified that at a May, 1972 advisory board meeting, James Grothaus threatened him, saying \u201cYou little cheap m______some-day I\u2019m going to get those notes from you.\u201d Ervin Shimman also testified that at a regular union meeting in the summer of 1972, John Frank threatened him about his notetaking. John Frank denied that he was concerned about dissident notetaking. However, the district court concluded otherwise and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting its finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">.

There was testimony that John Frank routinely made verbal attacks on the dissidents at union meetings. Ervin Shimman testified that John Frank told him on several occasions that he (Frank) was giving to starve him and the other dissidents out. Similarly, there was testimony that Frank often stated that he was going to \u201cget\u201d the dissidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">. Under long-established principles of tort law, the defendants\u2019 conduct also constituted an assault and battery under Ohio law. The district court properly found liability under this theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">. As the district court noted, John Shimman was clearly not a designated target to be beaten. The defendants had no way of knowing that John Shimman would immediately respond as he did to the seizure of his brother\u2019s notes. Rather, James Grothaus\u2019s rushing at Ervin Shimman and subsequent theft of his notes was itself an intimidatory practice. Gro-thaus was seeking to intimidate the dissidents and set up a confrontation with them. As indicated, the district court concluded that Gro-thaus had planned for violence that night. We cannot overturn this inference. Even if we could, the record clearly shows that violence was a logical result of the confrontation. Similarly, even if John Frank had no specific advance knowledge of what James Grothaus was going to do at the meeting, there is ample evidence to support a finding of liability. Much evidence supports the inference that Frank instigated and supported Grothaus in his anti-dissident \u201ccampaign.\u201d Even if Grothaus went a bit further than Frank anticipated, Frank is still liable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">.

Walter Shimman also testified that Possehl said he did not think that John Frank\u2019s conduct was right and he (Possehl) would look into it. However, so far as the record shows, Possehl did nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">Later on, in April of 1972, Walter Shimman complained once again to John Possehl about John Frank. Frank was discriminating against Walter Shimman\u2019s son in job referrals. Pos-sehl promised to intercede, but did not. The discrimination stopped after Walter Shimman called Local 18\u2019s counsel and threatened legal proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. John Possehl is a mysterious figure in this litigation. He was not sued individually. Yet his conduct was the basis for the International\u2019s liability and a partial basis for the local\u2019s liability. No one took his deposition. He did not testify at trial. The record does not even show how long he has been Business Manager of local 18, although it appears that he held that post since at least 1959.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. It is stretching things a bit to say that Pos-sehl sent Frank to silence the dissidents. This is especially true since Frank was first appointed district representative for district two in 1968. The beating took place in 1972. On the other hand, there was apparently continual friction between Frank and the dissidents from the time Frank first arrived. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Frank turned to violence after other methods failed is a permissible inference given evidence of escalating conflict over the years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">.

This provision requires that the President of the International approve in writing all local union employment contracts.

The problem is that this provision was never literally interpreted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the International. The International required that it approve only written employment contracts of specific duration. That way, a local union leader could not lock the local union into a long-term employment contract.

That case found extensive control by the International over the Local. However, there is language in that case which suggests that extensive restrictions on local union autonomy contained in the International Constitution can make the local an agent of the International for all purposes. We have problems with this broad view. The International Constitution must be assessed when determining agency questions and its provisions are entitled to some weight. <em>See Local Union 984 v.

It should not be excessive, nor activated by passion and prejudice. It rests in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the sound discretion of the fact-finders, and should be determined from all the evidence in the case. Devitt &amp; Blackmar\u2019s <em>Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, </em>Vol. 2, Page 253, states that the amount of punitive damages \u201cmust be fixed with calm discretion and sound reason, and must never be awarded, or fixed in amount, because of any sympathy, or bias or prejudice with respect to any party to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">While the plaintiff in argument has laid emphasis on the necessity of making punitive damages large enough in amount to be really painful to entities which possess great wealth, and this Court has been using the terms \u201cpunitive damages\u201d and \u201csmart money,\u201d it must not be overlooked that the basic reason for any use of punishment by our system of justice is not merely to cause the wrongdoer to suffer, but to deter wrongdoing; \u201cto serve as an example or warning to others not to engage in such conduct\u201d Devitt &amp; Blackmar, <em>op. cit. </em>P. 202; \u201cto make an</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">example not only for the private good of the plaintiff, but for the public good, for the purpose of teaching other persons not to do likewise.\u201d 2 OJI 597, <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 259.29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">It is also necessary to remember that if punishment is to deter the one punished, it must not be so severe that the memory of the wrongdoing will be blotted out by resentment over the pain of the punishment. Awards of millions against anyone no matter how wealthy, tend to raise in the minds of both the wrongdoer and the public the thought, not of deterrence, but that what is being done is being done because of what the wrongdoer is, rather than what he did.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\">.
