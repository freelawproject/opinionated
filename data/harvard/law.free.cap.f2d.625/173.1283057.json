We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-24\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-25\">In 1976 appellants were charged with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1972)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396h(b)(l) (1972) (amended 1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The indictments of the individual appellants alleged in summary that Dolitsky provided drugs and other pharmaceutical supplies to nursing homes owned by the individual defendants, that Dolitsky paid monthly \u201cfees\u201d to the defendants \u201cfor the opportunity to provide drugs and pharmaceutical services,\u201d that the fees were paid through \u201cMulticare Management Co.\u201d (MMC), were described as \u201cfees for consulting services,\u201d and were distributed by MMC to the nursing home owners in amounts totalling over $42,000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The information filed against Royal Fonta-na Nursing Center charged it with soliciting and receiving bribes and kickbacks from Glick Drug Company in connection with Glick\u2019s furnishing of drugs and pharmaceutical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In late 1976 and early 1977 appellants plead guilty and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment or probation and fined substantial sums. The sentences have been served, the periods of probation have expired, and the fines have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In May and June of 1979 appellants filed motions in the District Court, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) (1976),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for Writs of Error Coram Nobis, based on assertions that the indictments failed to state an offense cognizable under either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396h(b)(l). Appellants relied on <em>United States v. Zacher </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>586 F.2d 912 (2d Cir. 1978) and <em>United States v. </em>Porter,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 591 F.2d 1048 (5th Cir. 1979). On September 27, 1979, District Judge John Powers Crowley denied the Royal Fontana motion, and on November 13,1979, District Judge Frank J. McGarr denied the Ruttenberg, et al. motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The dispositive issue is whether the indictments and information filed against appellants failed to charge a crime under the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Having plead guilty, appellants have admitted the allegations in the indictments and information and have waived all non-jurisdictional defects therein other than sufficiency. <em>United States v. Michigan Carton Co., </em>552 F.2d 198, 202 (7th Cir. 1977). Thus the issue here is solely whether the indictments and information sufficiently allege the crimes of offering and receiving a kickback under \u00a7 1396h(b)(l). <em>United States v. Hancock, </em>604 F.2d 999, 1001 (7th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Appellants say, \u201cIn both <em>Zacher </em>and <em>Porter, </em>the government paid only the amounts it had fixed for the services or supplies provided, no false bills were submitted, no public officials were bribed or otherwise involved, and no statute or regulation required the doctors or nursing home owners to deal with different laboratories or pharmacies or to use different services or supplies than they did,\u201d and that the same is true here. In so saying, appellants misconstrue their position. Nothing in the present indictments and information, or in the statute, refers in any manner to govern-mentally fixed prices, or false bills, or public officials, or requirements for dealing with multiple suppliers, nor are any of those elements established as facts on the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A defendant who has plead guilty may not \u201ctranscend the four-corners of the indictment in order to demonstrate its insufficiency.\u201d <em>United States v. Di Fonzo, </em>603 F.2d 1260, 1263 (7th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Thus it cannot be contested that the indictments and information sufficiently alleged kickbacks. The indictments state that Dolitsky \u201cwould and did pay a monthly kickback or bribe to [MMC] for the opportunity to provide drugs and pharmaceutical services to patients at [several nursing homes owned by appellants] . . . \u201d and that MMC distributed the sums paid to those nursing homes, the payments being disguised as debts owed by MMC. The information charged \u201cRoyal Fontana Nursing Center, Inc. . . . did solicit and receive a kickback and bribe from Glick Drug Company in the amount of $3.00 per month for each public aid patient. . .\u201d Appellants\u2019 arguments reduce to an assertion that their admitted actions did not constitute a kickback under the statute. For that purpose, defendants compare their actions with the definition of \u201ckickback\u201d set forth in Porter: \u201cthe secret return to an <em>earlier possessor </em>of part of a sum received.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1054 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Whatever may be said of that definition, or of the <em>ratio decidendi </em>in <em>Zacher </em>and <em>Porter, </em>the decision and opinion of this court in <em>Hancock </em>is controlling in this case. In <em>Hancock </em>the defendants plead guilty to one count of an indictment charging violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395nn(b)(l)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 1396h(b)(l) (1972) (amended 1977). Defendants had been paid what they called \u201chandling fees\u201d for referring blood and tissue specimens to the fee-paying laboratory. This court distinguished <em>Zacher, </em>where non-corrupt payments were found, saying \u201cIn the present case, however, the indictments do allege corrupt payments which were admitted by defendants\u2019 pleas.\u201d The <em>Porter </em>definition of \u201ckickback\u201d was rejected by this court, which adopted as its definition: \u201c \u2018a percentage payment . . . for granting assistance by one in a position to open up or control a source of income,\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1966),\u201d 604 F.2d at 1002. An argument that \u00a7 1396h(b)(l) was unconstitutionally vague was rejected, because the statute gives fair notice that defendants\u2019 conduct was illegal. <em>Id. </em>Viewing the term \u201ckickback\u201d as a commonly understood term encompassing payment for a corrupt purpose, this court held that \u00a7 1396h(b)(l) did not omit intent as an element of the crime. To the extent that <em>Porter </em>reflected views in conflict with those in <em>Hancock, </em>this court expressly declined to adopt the former. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Appellants say <em>Hancock </em>is not controlling because the fee agreement in <em>Hancock </em>raised costs to the Medicare system, . whereas the government\u2019s election to fix the price of drugs and pharmaceuticals precludes that result here. Though the argument, albeit outside the four corners of the indictment/information, may be considered as related to an interpretation of kickback, it does not aid appellants. The government disputes the existence of increased costs in <em>Hancock, </em>where, as here, no increased costs were alleged. Appellants rely on this statement by the court in <em>Hancock: </em>\u201c[T]he element of corruption is found in this allegation that the defendants received payments in return for their decision to send specimens to Chem-Tech. The potential for increased costs to the Medicare-Medicaid system is plain, where payments for the exercise of such judgments are added to the legitimate costs of the transaction.\u201d <em>United States v. Hancock, </em>604 F.2d at 1001. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Whether costs were directly and immediately increased by those particular payments, however, is irrelevant. The <em>potential </em>for increased costs if such \u201cfee\u201d agreements become an established and accepted method of business is clearly an evil with which the court was concerned and one Congress sought to avoid in enacting \u00a7 1396h(b)(l). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We think the term \u201ckickback,\u201d though apparently originating in the vernacular, was fully understood by the public and the Congress, when the statute was enacted, to mean the transfer back to one having control of the original payment, and that a resulting increase in total cost to the government was not only known to be less common but considered irrelevant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In arguing that the payments here were not of \u201cfederal funds\u201d but merely gifts by a grateful Dolitsky from his profits, the individual appellants misread the statute, which describes only the payment <em>to Dolitsky </em>as \u201cout of Federal funds.\u201d Nothing in the statute requires that a kickback be made of funds to which the payor would not be entitled. Payment of a kickback to those in control of federal funds is all that is required, and such payment meets the <em>Zacher </em>definition of corrupt payment as one \u201cin violation of the duty imposed by Congress on providers of services to use federal funds only for intended purposes and only in the approved manner.\u201d Returning and receiving a portion of federal funds \u201cfor the opportunity to provide drugs and pharmaceutical services\u201d is not a use of federal funds in an approved manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Appellants then say the <em>Hancock </em>indictments contained more detailed allegations of corrupt payments. The present indictments, however, alleged that payments were made \u201cfor the opportunity to provide drugs and pharmaceutical services\u201d and the information alleged that the nursing center \u201csolicited and received\u201d a kickback in connection with the furnishing of drugs to it. By pleading guilty, appellants admitted to all the elements charged, including the element of corrupt payments. Further, the corruption here was the receipt of kickbacks for \u201cthe opportunity to provide drugs and pharmaceutical services,\u201d a corruption no less than that present in the receipt of kickbacks for \u201creferring Medicare and Medicaid recipients\u2019 blood and tissue specimens\u201d in <em>Hancock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">We have not been shown, nor do we see, any reason for revising the views expressed in <em>Hancock, </em>or for modifying the definition of \u201ckickback\u201d there set forth. Accordingly, the decision denying the requested writs is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-13\">. \u00a7 1341.

In <em>Zacher, </em>a nursing home operator who took from his patients $4.00 per day more than the maximum paid by Medicaid was tried and convicted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396h(b) (1972) of taking bribes. The court of appeals defined bribe and kickback as involving \u201ca corrupt payment or receipt of payment in violation of the duty imposed by Congress on providers of services to use federal funds only for intended purposes and only in the approved manner.\u201d <em>United States v. Zacher, </em>586 F.2d at 916. Viewing the payments to defendant as indistinguishable from payments by patients over and above those paid by private insurance companies, the court found no corruption or breach of duty and reversed the conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b239-17\">. In <em>Porter, </em>defendants were tried and convicted of receiving kickbacks or bribes under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395nn(b)(l). Defendants referred blood samples to a laboratory for testing and were paid for the referral a fee, called by the defendants a \u201chandling fee.\u201d The court reversed, finding no basis in law for characterizing those payments as bribes and defining a kickback as the \u201creturn to an <em>earlier possessor </em>of part of a sum received,\u201d <em>United States v. Porter, </em>591 F.2d at 1054 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b239-18\">. The sole basis for allegations of fixed prices and no increased cost to the government lies in comments of counsel at a pre-sentence hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">. No source for this definition is cited in <em>Porter. </em>Because actual <em>possession </em>of government funds, as distinguished from power to direct their payment, rarely if ever resides in those charged with the conduct of government programs, a literal interpretation of the <em>Porter </em>definition of \u201ckickback\u201d would appear to nullify \u00a7 1396h(b)(l) in most cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. The operative language of \u00a7 1395 at the time of indictment read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">\u00a7 1395nn.

Though we are concerned with the law, not the ethics of the medical profession, <em>United States v. Porter, </em>591 F.2d at 1058, it should be noted that the law does not make increased cost to the government the sole criterion of corruption. In prohibiting \u201ckickbacks,\u201d Congress need not have spelled out the obvious truisms that, while unnecessary expenditure of money earned and contributed by taxpaying fellow citizens may exacerbate the result of the crime, kickback schemes can freeze competing suppliers from the system, can mask the possibility of government price reductions, can misdirect program funds, and, when proportional, can erect strong temptations to order more drugs and supplies than needed. Nor need Congress have spelled out duties, beyond the duty of avoiding receipt and payment of kickbacks. A compassionate people have established and paid for a program of care for the aged among them. Nothing in that program gave to its empowered and privileged conductors carte blanche to manipulate within its fixed costs, as defendants apparently recognized in mislabeling (\u201cfees for consulting services\u201d) the payments and in funneling the payments through MMC.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
