(Burkart) filed suit in the court below seeking declaratory and injunc-tive relief prohibiting an attempted inspection of its Cairo, Illinois facility by a compliance officer of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In an order entered July 9,1979, the district court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted OSHA\u2019s motions for summary judgment and to compel compliance with the inspection warrant issued to the compliance officer, and held plaintiff in civil contempt for failure to comply with the warrant. Burkart appeals from this order on several grounds. First, Burkart contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in applying a relaxed probable cause standard in a case in which traditional, criminal probable cause should have been required. Second, Burkart argues that regardless of the appropriate probable cause standard, the warrant in this ease was not properly issued because the facts offered by OSHA in support of its warrant application fail to satisfy even the relaxed standard applied by the district court. Finally, Bur-kart asserts that even if probable cause did exist for issuance of a warrant, the warrant issued here is invalid because overbroad in scope. We conclude that the district court applied the proper probable cause standard, that this standard was satisfied and the warrant properly issued, and that the warrant is not overbroad in scope. Accordingly we affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">On May 26, 1978, an OSHA, compliance officer appeared at plaintiff\u2019s Cairo, Illinois facility for the purpose of conducting an inspection of the premises to insure compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-78. Plaintiff refused to permit the inspection because the officer did not have a warrant. On August 2, 1978, the officer went before a United States Magistrate with an application for an inspection warrant. The sworn application stated that OSHA had received, on February 9 and March 13, 1978, complaints from two employees of Burkart. The complaints had described specific unsafe and unhealthful conditions at plaintiff\u2019s facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the basis of this information, OSHA had determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe violations of the Act existed at that facility and therefore sought a warrant to inspect the premises to uncover these and other violations. The Magistrate found that probable cause existed and accordingly issued the requested warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">Plaintiff filed this action the following day, August 3, 1978, and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement of the warrant. That prohibition was extended during the proceedings below. In the district court, plaintiff argued that while a relaxed probable cause standard is appropriate when a warrant is sought for an inspection to be conducted pursuant to a reasonable legislative or administrative plan, inspections induced by employee complaints must be judged according to the criminal probable cause standard. According to plaintiff, OSHA\u2019s warrant application fell far short of meeting this standard. Alternatively, plaintiff argued that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>relaxed, administrative probable cause was all OSHA need show in this case, such a showing had not been made as illustrated by OSHA\u2019s failure to satisfy even the minimal requirements of reasonableness and informant reliability established by the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1). Finally, plaintiff argued that the warrant, even if properly issued, was overbroad in scope because it authorized an inspection of the entire premises when the probable cause, if any, related to limited portions of Burkart\u2019s facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">The district court initially agreed with Burkart. In an order entered January 8, 1979, the court enjoined execution of the warrant because the warrant application failed to show that the proposed inspection was pursuant to a reasonable administrative or legislative plan and failed to give any indication of the reliability of the employee-informants. OSHA filed a motion to amend this judgment in light of our decision of January 2,1979 in <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co, </em>589 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 884, 100 S.Ct. 174, 62 L.Ed.2d 113 (1979). The district court granted the motion and found that, under <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, </em>the warrant application need not demonstrate the reliability of the informant. On this basis it ruled that its initial order had been in error in imposing such a requirement and accordingly found the warrant supported by probable cause. Burkart appeals from this order, raising the arguments described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">Section 8(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorizes the Secretary of Labor to enter and inspect workplaces in order to carry out the purposes of the Act. Although section 8(a) itself does not indicate whether warrants are necessary for such inspections, after <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978), it is clear that a nonconsensual OSHA inspection may be conducted pursuant to section 8(a) only if a warrant is first obtained. Such a warrant is to issue only upon a showing of some degree of probable cause; precisely what degree is required in particular cases has been the topic of much <em>post-Barlow\u2019s </em>litigation and is- the issue before us in this case. See, e. g., <em>The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v. Marshall, </em>610 F.2d 1128, 1130 (3d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-11\">In <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that there are two alternative methods by which probable cause for an OSHA inspection may be established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-12\">Whether the Secretary proceeds to secure a warrant or other process, with or without prior notice, his entitlement to inspect will not depend on his demonstrating probable cause to believe that conditions in violation of OSHA exist on the premises. Probable cause in the criminal law sense is not required. For purposes of an administrative search such as this, probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant may be based not only on specific evidence of an existing violation but also on a showing that \u201creasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular [establishment].\u201d <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. [523], at 538, 87 S.Ct. [1727], at 1736 [15 L.Ed.2d 930.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A035\">436 U.S. at 320-21, 98 S.Ct. at 1824 [footnote omitted]. The parties agree, for purposes of this appeal, that under <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>when a warrant is sought for an inspection to be conducted pursuant to a legislative or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>administrative plan, probable cause is to be judged according to the relaxed or flexible standard of administrative probable cause establish in <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967) and <em>See </em>v. <em>City of Seattle, </em>387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967). Burkart argues, however, that application of this standard is inappropriate where the warrant is sought on the basis of \u201cspecific evidence of an existing violation,\u201d such as the employee complaints in this case. Because of the particularized suspicion, individualized focus and greater potential for harassment in the employee complaint situation, Burkart asserts that traditional criminal probable cause should be required to justify issuance of a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-4\">This court addressed and rejected precisely this contention in <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>589 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 884, 100 S.Ct. 174, 62 L.Ed.2d 113 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, </em>the employer argued that the <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>language quoted above should be interpreted to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-5\">that when a warrant is applied for on the basis of an employee complaint, the general standard of probable cause applied in criminal matters is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1338. This court disagreed with that argument, placing great weight upon the specific statement of the <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>Court that \u201c[pjrobable cause in the criminal law sense is not required.\u201d <em>Barlow\u2019s, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 1824, quoted in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1338.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also relied upon the Supreme Court\u2019s citation of <em>See </em>and <em>Camara </em>to find that administrative probable cause is the proper standard in employee complaint cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATl\">Because of the aforementioned quote from <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>negating the requirement of probable cause in the criminal sense and because the OSHA inspections involved in these appeals are similar to those in <em>Camara </em>and <em>See, </em>the less stringent probable cause test must be applied here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">589 F.2d at 1339. Thus, the position of this court in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>was that flexible, administrative probable cause, as established in <em>Camara </em>and <em>See, </em>is the appropriate standard for issuance of a warrant for an OSHA inspection whether the warrant is sought on the basis of an administrative plan or employee complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">Plaintiff urges that we reject this position in this case, arguing that it is based on a misinterpretation of the <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>opinion and that the \u201cbetter reasoned view\u201d counsels adherence to traditional probable cause for all but administrative plan inspections. Plaintiff contends that <em>Michigan v. Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978), demonstrates that the administrative probable cause standard is to apply only when a warrant is sought pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>an administrative plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s assertion, <em>Tyler </em>supports precisely the position taken by this court in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett. </em>The <em>Tyler </em>Court summarized its ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-4\">In summation, we hold that an entry to fight a fire requires no warrant, and that once in the building, officials may remain there for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of the blaze. Thereafter, additional entries to investigate the cause of the fire must be made pursuant to the warrant procedures governing administrative searches. See <em>Camara, </em>387 U.S., at 534-539, 87 S.Ct., at 1739-1740; <em>See v. Seattle, </em>387 U.S., at 544-545, 87 S.Ct., at 1733-1736; <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., ante, </em>[436 U.S.] at 320-321, 98 S.Ct., at 1824-1825. Evidence of arson discovered in the course of such investigations is admissible at trial, but if the investigating officials find probable cause to believe that arson has occurred and require further access to gather evidence for a possible prosecution, they may obtain a warrant only upon a traditional showing of probable cause applicable to searches for evidence of crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">436 U.S. at 511-12, 98 S.Ct. at 1951 [citation omitted]. Administrative probable cause is sufficient, under <em>Tyler, </em>even where officials conduct an inspection which is individualized in focus and in response to a particular event \u2014 there, a fire on the premises to be inspected. Criminal probable cause is required only when the investigation changes from purely administrative to criminal in nature. In this OSHA inspection case, unlike <em>Tyler, </em>there was no possibility of criminal action. <em>Tyler </em>therefore permits the issuance of a warrant upon a showing of administrative, rather than criminal, probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-12\">Neither <em>Tyler </em>nor the other authorities cited by plaintiff support its position in this case. Our research indicates that virtually every federal court to consider the issue has concluded that criminal probable cause is not required for issuance of a warrant for an OSHA inspection based on employee complaints.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We, therefore, adhere to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>view that <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>properly interpreted <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>and we will continue to permit issuance of warrants in employee complaint cases upon a showing of administrative probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">Having concluded that the district court properly applied the administrative probable cause standard in this case, we need not decide whether the evidence offered in support of the warrant application satisfies the more stringent criminal probable cause standard. Burkart argues, however, that the evidence is insufficient to establish even administrative probable cause. It is to this argument that we now direct our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">The administrative probable cause standard requires that any inspection be reasonable: the public interest in the inspection must outweigh the invasion of privacy which the inspection entails. See Camara <em>v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 536-39, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1734-36, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967); <em>Marshall v. North American Car Co., </em>476 F.Supp. 698, 703 (M.D.Pa.1979). In determining whether this standard was satisfied in this ease, we may consider only the evidence before the Magistrate at the time of application for the inspection warrant. See <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1342. Where a warrant application is based upon an employee complaint, it is not absolutely necessary that the complaint itself be provided to the Magistrate. <em>North American Car, supra, </em>476 F.Supp. at 704. However, a conclusory statement in the application that employee complaints have been received by OSHA, without more, is insufficient to establish probable cause. <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Marshall, </em>592 F.2d 373, 378 (7th Cir. 1979). The application must at least inform the Magistrate of the substance of the employee complaints, so that the Magistrate may exercise independent judgment as to whether an inspection is justified, rather than acting as a mere rubber stamp validating the decision already reached by the Secretary. <em>Weyerhaeuser Co., supra, </em>592 F.2d at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-9\">The only information before the Magistrate in this case was the sworn warrant application submitted by the OSHA compliance officer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The application stated that OSHA had received complaints from two employees of Burkart. It described the specific unsafe and unhealthful working conditions alleged in the complaints and noted that the complaints asserted that these conditions posed a threat of serious physical harm to Burkart\u2019s employees. The application then stated that OSHA had determined from this information, that reasonable grounds existed to believe that violations of the Act or regulations issued thereunder would be found on Burkart\u2019s premises. Plaintiff\u2019s Appendix at 1-2. While the application is far from a model of specificity and clarity, we believe the district court properly concluded that the information contained in it is adequate to establish the requisite degree of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">Plaintiff attacks the district court\u2019s conclusion because, although the warrant application is supported by the oath of the compliance officer, the allegations on which the finding of probable cause is based \u2014 the allegations contained in the employee complaints \u2014 are not so supported. Brief of Plaintiff at 14-17. In the context of an administrative probable cause determination, however, the oath of the compliance officer is entitled to greater weight than plaintiff seems willing to accord it. In <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>the employer attempted to challenge the warrant applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>tion by obtaining from OSHA discovery of information regarding the employee complaint. This court rejected that attempt in part because of the significance attached to the compliance officer\u2019s oath:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-4\">[T]he warrant application, which referred to an \u201cemployee complaint,\u201d incorporated the sworn affidavit of an OSHA compliance officer. The district judge could correctly assume, therefore, that the information contained therein was true and correct. Because this information was adequate on its face to establish probable cause there was no need to pursue further discovery .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">589 F.2d at 1340. The oath of the compliance officer provided sufficient support for the warrant application in this case; it was not necessary that the complaining employees swear to the truth of their statements as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">This argument of Burkart\u2019s is part of a more general attack on warrant applications based upon statements of \u201cinformants\u201d not brought before the issuing Magistrate. Plaintiff would require some corroboration or other evidence that a complaining employee is credible and reliable and his complaint accurate. This court has already held, however, that because administrative rather than criminal probable cause is the appropriate standard, such a showing is not required in the context of OSHA inspections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-7\"><em>Camara </em>and <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>do not require that the warrant application set forth the underlying circumstances demonstrating the basis for the conclusion reached by the complainant, or that the underlying circumstances demonstrate a reason to believe that the complainant is a credible person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-10\"><em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1339. See also <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Marshall, </em>592 F.2d 373, 377 (7th Cir. 1979). Burkart, in essence, objects to the failure of the warrant application to demonstrate the underlying factual basis for the complainants\u2019 allegations. Under <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, </em>however, the Magistrate need not be presented with enough evidence to allow him to verify or reevaluate the observations of the employee-informants. 589 F.2d at 1339. The application in this case presented to the Magistrate the substance of the complaints received by OSHA,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in sufficient detail for the Magistrate to evaluate OSHA\u2019s decision to conduct an inspection based on these complaints. It thus provided \u201cspecific evidence of an existing violation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-11\">The affidavit established particularized probable cause because it provided the magistrate with the underlying factual data giving rise to the <em>compliance officer\u2019s belief </em>that a violation existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-12\"><em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of Marsan Co., </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1557, 1559 (N.D.Ind.1979) [citation omitted] [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">Plaintiff also argues that the warrant application is fatally deficient in terms of detail and specificity. In support of this contention, plaintiff cites cases holding inadequate to establish administrative probable cause applications which state only that a complaint has been received giving OSHA reason to believe an inspection is necessary. See, e. g., <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Marshall, </em>452 F.Supp. 1375, 1379-80 (E.D.Wis.1978), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number><em>aff\u2019d, </em>592 F.2d 373, 378 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>437 F.Supp. 533, 536 (E.D.Wis.1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>587 F.2d 12, 13 (7th Cir. 1978). These cases, however, do not advance the inquiry in this case. The warrant application at issue here' went beyond the conclusory statement that complaints had been received: it described the contents of the complaints. As this court stated in <em>Weyerhaeuser, supra, </em>only a \u201cfew additional facts\u201d need be added to a conclu-sory application to \u201csatisfy the \u2018specific evidence\u2019 manner of establishing probable cause.\u201d 592 F.2d at 378 [footnote omitted]. The application before us contains more than a \u201cfew additional facts\u201d and is not properly compared to the boilerplate applications presented in <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>and <em>Northwest Airlines. </em>On the contrary, it is comparable in terms of specificity and detail to the warrant applications upheld in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1339<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <em>Marsan Co., supra, </em>7 OSHC (BNA) at 1559.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">Plaintiff raises two other objections to the issuance of the inspection warrant in this case. Burkart seems to argue that the warrant is invalid because it is based upon employee complaints which are not in writing and signed by the complainant<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as provided in section 8(f)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 8(f)(1) does not, however, prescribe minimum requirements for acceptance of an employee complaint by OSHA. Rather, it identifies a particular set of circumstances under which OSHA must inspect in response to an employee complaint. We can find no indication in the Act or in judicial interpretations of section 8(f)(1) that OSHA may not determine that an inspection is justified on the basis of an informal employee complaint. Indeed, one court has noted that OSHA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3jW\">is required to investigate all complaints whether formal (signed by someone) or anonymous (from a confidential informant, so to speak).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\"><em>Dravo Corp. v. Marshall, </em>5 OSHC (BNA) 2057, 2059 (W.D.Pa.1977), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>578 F.2d 1373 (3d Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While we need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>not decide whether OSHA must inspect in response to all complaints, we can find no basis for holding that only those complaints which comply with section 8(f)(1) may form the basis for an OSHA inspection. In light of this lack of support, Burkart\u2019s section 8(f)(1) argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">Finally, Burkart asserts that the warrant application fails to satisfy the <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>requirement of \u201cspecific evidence of an <em>existing </em>violation,\u201d 436 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 1824 [emphasis added], because the information contained in it is stale. The employee complaints here were received by OSHA approximately six months and five months prior to issuance of the warrant. The district court took note of this lapse of time but concluded that it did not render the information stale because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">the nature of the alleged violations are such that the Magistrate could reasonably conclude that the conditions as yet remained unabated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\"><em>Burkart-Randall Div. of Textron, Inc. v. Marshall, </em>No. 78-4286 (S.D.I11. July 9,1979), memo. op. at 3. Burkart challenges this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">In <em>In the Matter of the Inspection of Central Mine Equipment Co., </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1185 (E.D.Mo.), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1907 (8th Cir. 1979), a warrant for an OSHA inspection was upheld despite the fact that it was based on information at least eight months old. <em>Id. </em>at 1189. The district court there held that although an eight month time lapse would make stale information offered in support of a criminal warrant, it would not do so for purposes of an OSHA warrant where \u201cit is reasonable to believe that the violations of the health and safety standards yet remain on the subject premises.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In this case, the conditions alleged in the employee complaints are not of a type that will likely disappear through mere passage of time; affirmative action to correct them appears necessary. We therefore agree with the district court that the nature of the alleged conditions makes reasonable the conclusion that violations of the Act remained on Burkart\u2019s premises at the time of the warrant application. The information contained in the application is thus not stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">We have reviewed the information presented to the Magistrate and have carefully considered Burkart\u2019s arguments challenging the sufficiency of that information to support a finding of administrative probable cause. We find that under the standards set out in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>the warrant application</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-12\">afforded the magistrate sufficient factual data to conclude that a search was reasonable and that a warrant should issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akl-dedup-0\">589 F.2d at 1339. Accordingly, we hold that the warrant authorizing an OSHA inspection of Burkart\u2019s Cairo facility was properly issued by the Magistrate after a finding of administrative probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-14\">Burkart\u2019s final argument is that even if probable cause to issue an inspection warrant was shown in this case, the warrant which in fact was issued is invalid because it authorizes an overly broad inspection. The warrant authorized an inspection not limited to the areas identified in the employee complaints but rather extending to Burkart\u2019s entire Cairo, Illinois facility. Burkart contends that the overly broad warrant permits OSHA to search areas of the facility for which no probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>cause has been shown, in clear violation of Fourth Amendment principles. Such a general inspection is, according to Burkart, impermissible where probable cause is established, as in this case, by specific evidence of hazardous or unhealthy conditions within an employer\u2019s facility. In addition, a general inspection based upon employee complaints is said to violate section 8(f)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">There is substantial judicial support for Burkart\u2019s Fourth Amendment argument. Although no federal court of appeals has yet expressly ruled on the issue,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> many of the district courts which have confronted it have concluded that inspection warrants issued in response to specific employee complaints must be limited in scope, if possible, to the subject matter of the complaints. See, e. g., <em>Marshall v. North American Car Co., </em>476 FlSupp. 698, 706-07 (M.D.Pa.1979); <em>Marshall v. Trinity Industries, Inc., </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1851, 1854 (W.D.Okl.1979); <em>In the Matter of the Inspection of: Central Mine Equipment Co., </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1185, 1189-90 (E.D.Mo.), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1907 (8th Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These courts acknowledge, however, that a general inspection of an employer\u2019s entire workplace will usually be permissible where probable cause is established by a reasonable legislative or administrative plan. See <em>North American Car, supra, </em>476 F.Supp. at 706; <em>Trinity Industries, supra, </em>7 OSHC (BNA) at 1854; <em>Central Mine Equipment, supra, </em>7 OSHC (BNA) at 1190 n. 7. The theory underlying these cases appears to be that the scope of an inspection must not exceed the scope of the evidence used to establish probable cause to conduct the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">A number of district courts have adopted the contrary position, holding that once probable cause is established on the basis of an employee complaint, OSHA may inspect the entire premises of the subject employer. See, e. g., <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of Marsan Co., </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1557, 1559 (N.D.Ind.1979); <em>Dravo Corp. v. Marshall, </em>5 OSHC (BNA) 2057, 2060 (W.D. Pa.1977), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>578 F.2d 1373 (3d Cir. 1978); <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>5 OSHC (BNA) 1375, 1375-76 (N.D.I11.1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>589 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 884, 100 S.Ct. 174, 62 L.Ed.2d 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>(1979).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These courts maintain that an inspection limited to the substance of the employee complaints will not advance the broad remedial purposes of the Act because employers will be able to present \u201csanitized\u201d areas to OSHA inspectors while concealing violations of the Act elsewhere on the premises. <em>Marsan Co., supra, </em>7 OSHC (BNA) at 1559. The requirement that nonconsensual inspections be conducted pursuant to warrants issued upon probable cause protects against possible \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d by OSHA inspectors and adequately safeguards employers\u2019 interests. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>5 OSHC (BNA) at 1375. Furthermore, considerations of administrative efficiency and of minimizing disruptions of employers\u2019 operations indicate that a general inspection may be preferable to a number of separate, limited inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Our examination of these competing positions and of the policies underlying the Act and the warrant requirement convinces us that the better view is that which permits, absent extraordinary circumstances, general inspections in response to employee complaints.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have already held that because administrative plan inspections, by their nature, are not susceptible to scope limitations, general inspections are permissible in that context. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1343. A general inspection is thus permissible in a situation where there is no specific reason to suspect that a <em>particular </em>facility may be housing violations of the Act. It would be anomalous to permit general inspections in this context and yet hold that only a limited inspection may be conducted where there is particularized probable cause to believe that violations will be found in the specific facility to be inspected. The fact that the specific nature of employee complaints will often make scope limitations possible, does not make them necessary or advisable. Indeed, one court has found that because employee complaints are often limited in scope, general inspections are preferred in such cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-8\">The fact that the warrant involved in the case at bar is based on specific employee complaints favors a broad, rather than narrow, application of the Secretary\u2019s authority, since an employee is normally familiar with limited areas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-9\"><em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Wisconsin Steel, </em>No. 79 C 4284 (N.D.I11. Dec. 28, 1979), memo. op. at 2-3.,</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-10\">The ultimate requirement of the Fourth Amendment is that any proposed search or inspection be reasonable. See <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 539, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). The factors which convinced us in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>that it is reasonable to conduct a general inspection of a facility selected for scrutiny under an administrative plan operate at least as strongly in the context of employee complaint inspections.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>ute which the inspections are intended to implement is a broad remedial measure designed to ensure that employees are provided with safe workplaces. In the employee complaint situation, there is probable cause to believe that a particular workplace is not entirely safe. The purpose of the Act is best served in such a case by inspecting the entire facility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-4\">[Restriction of the scope of the inspection would frustrate the purposes of OSHA. If the compliance officers are not permitted to conduct thorough inspections, then there would be a severe danger of employers being able to present a special \u201csanitized\u201d area to the official, while concealing real violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APUT\"><em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Chicago Magnet Wire Corp., </em>5 OSHC (BNA) 2024, 2025 (N.D.I11.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">Balanced against the implementation of the statute\u2019s purpose is the employer\u2019s interest in avoiding invasion of its privacy and disruption of its operations. See <em>In the Matter of Worksite Inspection of Quality Products, Inc., </em>6 OSHC (BNA) 1663, 1666-67 (D.R.I.1978), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>592 F.2d 611 (1st Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That interest, however, is adequately protected by the requirement that a nonconsensual inspection be conducted only pursuant to a warrant issued by a neutral Magistrate after a showing of probable cause. The warrant requirement ensures that OSHA inspectors do not conduct mere \u201cfishing expeditions,\u201d <em>Chicago Magnet Wire, supra, </em>5 OSHC (BNA) at 2025, and apprises the employer of the inspection\u2019s scope, a function emphasized by the Supreme Court in <em>Barlow\u2019s, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 323, 98 S.Ct. at 1825, and this court in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1343.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The interposition of a neutral Magistrate between inspectors and employers guarantees that inspectors will not exercise unbridled discretion as to when and where to inspect and provides assurances to employers that the inspection is authorized by statute, is permissible under the Constitution, and will be conducted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner. Furthermore, to require that OSHA demonstrate probable cause as to every part of the employer\u2019s facility</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-8\">would render meaningless the Supreme Court pronouncement in <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>that the Secret\u00e1ry\u2019s \u201centitlement to inspect will not depend on his demonstrating probable cause to believe that conditions in violation of OSHA exist on the premises,\u201d 436 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 1824, and would defeat the federal interest in providing workers with safe working places.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anz\"><em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-9\">We hold, therefore, that where probable cause to conduct as OSHA inspection is established on the basis of employee complaints, the inspection need not be limited in scope to the substance of those complaints. In light of the broad remedial purposes of the Act, the strong federal interest in em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>ployee health and safety, and the protections provided by the warrant requirement, it will generally be reasonable in such a case to conduct an OSHA inspection of the entire workplace identified in the complaints. There may be cases in which extraordinary circumstances would render such an inspection unreasonably broad, but this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">[\u00b6] In addition to its Fourth Amendment argument, Burkart contends that the Act itself, in section 8(f)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1), prohibits general inspections in response to employee complaints. Section 8(f)(1) requires that, in response to certain employee complaints, OSHA conduct a \u201cspecial inspection in accordance with the provisions of this section . . . 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1). Plaintiff argues, in effect, that \u201cspecial inspection\u201d means \u201climited inspection.\u201d We cannot accept this interpretation. As noted in Part III, <em>supra, </em>we do not read section 8(f)(1) as a limitation upon the Secretary's ability to inspect; rather, we read it as a description of particular circumstances under which the Secretary must inspect. Similarly, nothing in the Act indicates that \u201cspecial\u201d means \u201climited.\u201d Indeed, section 8(f)(1) states that the inspection shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 8. The only part of section 8 which arguably pertains to the scope of inspections is section 8(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a)(2), which authorizes inspection of an employer\u2019s entire workplace. *In addition, the Secretary\u2019s own regulation implementing section 8 of the Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj1\">Inspections under this section shall not be limited to matters referred to in the [employee] complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1903.11(b). This interpretation of the Act is entitled to deference from the courts and will be given controlling weight as long as it is a reasonable, even if not the most reasonable, construction of the statute. See <em>The Budd Co. v. O.S.H.R.C., </em>513 F.2d 201, 204-05 (3d Cir. 1975). See also <em>Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, </em>445 U.S. 1, 11, 100 S.Ct. 883, 890, 63 L.Ed.2d 154 (1980). This regulation is a reasonable construction of the statute. Accordingly, we hold that section 8(f)(1) of the Act does not require that OSHA conduct inspections in response to employee complaints limited in scope to the substance of the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">We have carefully considered all of plaintiff\u2019s arguments on this appeal and find them without merit.

In another case, <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Berwick Forge &amp; Fabricating Co., </em>474 F.Supp. 104 (M.D.Pa.1979), the court permitted a general inspection in response to employee complaints but suggested that, had there been fewer alleged violations and a less extensive record of past violations, it would have limited the scope of the inspection. <em>Id. </em>at 113. Nonetheless, only fifteen'per cent of the facility was implicated in the complaints and a general inspection was still permitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">. At least one commentator concurs in this result, finding that the position taken by the district court in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>represents the \u201cbetter view.\u201d See Rothstein, <em>OSHA Inspections A\u00f1er Marshall v.

A number of courts have cited this portion of the <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>opinion as support for their conclusion that general inspections ar\u00e9 permissible in response to employee complaints. See, e. g., <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Wisconsin Steel, </em>No. 79 C 4284 (N.D.I11. Dec. 28, 1979); <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of Marsan Co., </em>7 OSHC (BNA) 1557 (N.D.Ind.1979). In fact, one of the cases this court cited in support of its finding in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>that a general inspection is permissible pursuant to an administrative plan, was a case upholding such inspections in response to employee complaints. See <em>Dravo Corp. v. Marshall, </em>5 OSHC (BNA) 2057 (W.D.Pa.1977), <em>affd mem., </em>578 F.2d 1373 (3d Cir. 1978), cited in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>In addition, in <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>this court had before it the precise issue now raised by Burkart. One of the orders on appeal in that case authorized a general inspection in response to an employee complaint. The employer argued in its brief on appeal that the inspection should be limited in scope to the substance of the complaint. See Appellant\u2019s Supplemental Brief, <em>In the Matter of: Establishment Inspection of: Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>589 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir. 1979), at 27-30. Although we did not discuss this argument in the portion of the opinion addressing employee complaint inspections, we did affirm the district court\u2019s order in all respects. Thus, the argument now advanced by Burkart has been presented to this court before and has been rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">. As was emphasized by the district court in <em>Quality Products, supra, </em>the employer\u2019s interest in the privacy of the workplace is \u201cminimal,\u201d and not of substantial importance in the face of \u201cthe important social interest in protecting the safety of those workers who have been voluntarily admitted to the premises . . 6 OSHC (BNA) at 1667.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">. Indeed, in his dissent in <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>Justice Stevens observed that the warrant requirement established by the Supreme Court in that case did not purport to limit the scope of inspections more strictly than the Act itself did in section 8(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a)(2). As Justice Stevens read the majority opinion, the warrant was intended simply to apprise the employer of the inspection\u2019s scope, not to limit it. <em>Barlow\u2019s, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 335-36, 98 S.Ct. at 1832 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1390-12\">FAIRCHILD, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AzxH\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-13\">I join in parts I, II and III of Judge Sprecher\u2019s opinion. As to the principles which should govern determination of the scope of a search, however, I find much that is persuasive in Judge Wood\u2019s dissent. I particularly share the view that this question ordinarily should be identified and presented to the magistrate in the application for the warrant, with whatever other information might be relevant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the specific facts of this case, however, the locations and types of hazards named in the employee complaints seem to be sufficiently diffuse to sustain the magistrate\u2019s determination that a search of the entire workplace was reasonable. For that reason I join in the decision to affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1390-8\">. See <em>also </em>Note, <em>Administrative Inspections Under the Fourth Amendment, </em>15 Colum. J. L. &amp; Soc. Prob. 61, 95 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1390-14\">HARLINGTON WOOD, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-15\">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) received two complaints from employees of appellant Burk-art-Randall Division of Textron, Inc. (Burk-art-Randall). The substance of those complaints as summarized in the warrant application presented to the magistrate was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aovh\">[t]hat various hygiene hazards existed in the press department; that the rest rooms were in poor repair because there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>was [sic] sewer gases leaking from broken plumbing and this compounded by very poor ventilation; that the eating areas were unsanitary; that there were inadequate fire escapes near the production line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">The application further recited that based on the two complaints, OSHA had determined that there were \u201creasonable grounds to believe that such violations exist.\u201d Although the application effectively concedes that probable cause exists only as to the matters asserted in the complaint, OSHA sought and secured a warrant authorizing an inspection covering \u201cnot only violations and dangers alleged in the complaints, but the entire establishment of the employer.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the extent the warrant authorized inspection in areas of Burkart-Randall\u2019s facility for which there was no showing of any likelihood that violations existed, it contravenes the fourth amendment to the Constitution. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">Since the warrant application presented to the magistrate in this case contains no information concerning the layout or predominant use of the Burkart-Randall facility the magistrate was not in a position to consider the likelihood that violations existed in areas not mentioned in the employee complaints. I find it difficult to fathom how, absent this information, the magistrate and now this court can reach the conclusion that the inspection was reasonable. We are left in the dark along with the magistrate on such basic questions as, for example, whether the press department occupies a single small room or is the facility\u2019s predominant work area; whether the facility is composed of one or more buildings, and- if the latter, whether the complaints deal with conditions in each building. Without answers to such questions, the magistrate had no basis upon which to evaluate the likelihood that violations existed in other areas. In the extreme he may have authorized a search of a mammoth multi-building facility based on two very limited employee complaints. We do not know on the record before us nor did the magistrate know on the record before him. Approval of a general search warrant on such sparse information is indeed approval of general warrants in every conceivable case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">This court recently addressed an over-breadth challenge to a general warrant secured pursuant to a neutral administrative plan. <em>In the Matter of Establishment Inspection of Gilbert &amp; Bennett Manufacturing Co., </em>589 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 884, 100 S.Ct. 174, 62 L.Ed.2d 113 (1979). In approving the general warrant, we noted that \u201c[b]ecause the exact location of violations cannot be known prior to entering the establishment, a narrow, restricted warrant would severely defeat the purposes of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343. We were concerned that employers might maintain sanitized areas for inspection while concealing serious violations. <em>Id. </em>The same considerations do not apply where the specific complaints inform OSHA of the precise location of likely violations. OSHA remains free to protect against selective sanitization by inspecting at another time pursuant to a reasonable administrative plan. The balance between the employer\u2019s privacy interest and OSHA\u2019s statutory mandate is thus preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>It is not anomalous to permit general inspections where probable cause is supplied by a neutral plan but to limit inspections where probable cause is supplied by particularized employee complaints. Rather, the dichotomy is merely a recognition of the notion inherent in the fourth amendment that the scope of a warrant shall be tailored to the showing of probable cause. Underlying <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett </em>is <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978), which established that the flexible probable cause standards of <em>See v. City of Seattle, </em>387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967), and <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967), are satisfied by the promulgation of a neutral administrative inspection plan. The adoption of an administrative plan presupposes some general finding and determination of necessity to inspect within a particular industry, which serves as a basis for a general warrant. Specific employee complaints, on the other hand, may certainly, as here, supply a sufficient level of cause as to the subjects of those complaints. They may also provide sufficient cause for areas proximate in space and quality to the subjects of the complaint. Furthermore, where complaints are of such quality or in such quantity to indicate a reasonable likelihood that violations exist throughout a facility, a general warrant may be appropriate. In other cases, where the quality or quantity of complaints indicates a reasonable likelihood that violations exist in other specific areas of a facility, a warrant tailored to cover those areas in addition to the areas complained of may be appropriate. But where, as here, the magistrate lacks specific information regarding plant layout and the relation of that layout to the complaints, issuance of a general warrant to inspect all areas is unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional. Such issuance implies that the magistrate found sufficient cause in areas of which he had no knowledge. Consideration of the statute\u2019s remedial purpose and of administrative convenience, while certainly substantial, cannot supply probable cause, even under the most flexible standard, where it does not otherwise exist. The employee complaints that initiated this general warrant mentioned only unsanitary rest rooms, eating areas, and inadequate fire escapes \u2014 all in the press department. I believe the absolute constitutional limit of the warrant in this case, if it is to be broadened beyond the press department, would be to authorize inspection only of facilities similar to those set forth in the employee complaints, <em>i. e., </em>rest rooms, eating areas, and areas relating to fire safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">I therefore would reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and dissolve the warrant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">. The warrant issued by the magistrate reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-7\">YOU ARE AUTHORIZED to enter the above described premises during regular working hours or at other reasonable times, and to inspect and investigate in a reasonable manner. and to a reasonable extent (including but not limited to the taking of photographs and samples, and the questioning privately any owner, operator, agent, employer or employee of the establishment), the workplace or environment where work is performed by employees of the employer and all pertinent conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, equipment, materials, and all other things therein (including records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities) bearing on whether this employer is furnishing to its employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical injuries to its employees, and whether this employer is complying with the occupational safety and health standards promulgated under the Act and the rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to the Act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
