Porta Systems Corporation, the employer, manufactures, sells, and distributes electronics and related products from its plant in Syosset, Long Island, where it employed approximately 160 to 170 production employees in January, 1977. At that time, one supervisor, Robert Dietz, had approximately 100 employees and four so-called \u201cleadpersons\u201d under his supervision, and another, Harry Taylor, had between 30 and 90 employees and one \u201cleadperson\u201d under his supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">A critical question in the case is whether these leadpersons were \u201csupervisors\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(H).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This question is critical because several of the violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1) that were found by the Administrative Law Judge and sustained by the Board itself were based on acts by the leadpersons\u2014 warnings and threats, surveillance, participation in the preparation and circulation of an anti-union petition, and coercive interrogation of employees by pinning \u201cvote no\u201d buttons on them. The company is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>responsible for these acts if the leadpersons involved were \u201csupervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We are also presented with the question whether there is substantial evidence to support the finding that company Chief Executive Officer DeLuca created the impression, two weeks before the election was scheduled to take place, that an impending suspension of routine wage increases would be the fault of the union. Finally, there is a question whether the company violated \u00a7 8(a)(1), (3) of the Act by adopting and maintaining a ten-percent absentee discharge rule and discharging both pro-union and anti-union employees pursuant to that rule, while refusing to reinstate employees either because of their union activity or in order to discourage union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">I. <em>Leadpersons as Supervisors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">There was substantial evidence of the following facts in the record. Leadpersons make work assignments to employees and see to it that the work is performed within a certain period of time. They also select employees to work overtime and in doing so consider the individual employee\u2019s capability. They train new employees. They have some authority to maintain plant discipline and they check for lateness and absenteeism, asking employees for explanations. They also criticize the performance of employees working with them and advise such employees\u2019 foremen. They also have keys to the plant. At the same time, the lead-persons spend much of their time working on the line, and their pay is not substantially greater than that of the other employees. They work a 40-hour week, punch the clock as the rest of the workers do, and are paid time and one-half for overtime. They do not have authority to hire or fire or to transfer a fellow worker from one job to another, nor do they attend the production meetings that are attended by foremen, members of the engineering staff, and officers of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The Administrative Law Judge found that each of the leadpersons in question responsibly directs the work of the employees assigned to her, effectively recommends wage increases for the employees, disciplines them, and assigns them work \u201call in a manner requiring the exercise of independent judgment.\u201d He noted that his findings were \u201cconsistent with\u201d the responsibilities as outlined in prehearing affidavits executed by the four leadpersons. He also discredited the subsequent testimony of the leadpersons disavowing those affidavits, because he found the witnesses \u201cevasive, argumentative and entirely unconvincing in their demeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Preliminarily, we note that the Board\u2019s findings in this area are entitled to \u201cspecial weight,\u201d <em>Amalgamated Local Union 355 v. NLRB, </em>481 F.2d 996, 999-1000 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1002 (1973), in light of the Board\u2019s expertise \u201cin evaluating actual power distributions which exist within an enterprise,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>405 F.2d 1169, 1172 (2d Cir. 1968). Yet, in <em>NLRB v. Monroe Tube Co., </em>545 F.2d 1320, 1324-25 (2d Cir. 1976), despite the fact that the night foreman in question was responsible for eight people on the night shift and there was frequently no one of higher authority when he was there, and despite the facts that he was empowered to move employees from job to job when necessary, earned thirty percent more than the other employees in the shift, and was regarded by the night shift employees as their supervisor, this court reversed a Board determination that he was a supervisor. The court\u2019s holding was based on the fact that the night foreman did not attend weekly management meetings, he did not have an office or desk of his own, his instructions as to work priorities and scheduling were received from his foreman, and emergency personnel situations had to be reported to the latter. The court said that \u201chis exercise of authority was of a strictly routine nature pursuant to [his foreman\u2019s] directions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">So the question turns ultimately on whether the powers of the leadpersons are exercised independently and in the interest of management thereby denoting a supervisory rank, or are exercised in a merely routine or clerical way. <em>See generally </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>NLRB v. Monroe Tube co., </em>supra; <em>NLRB v. Big Ben Department Stores, Inc., </em>396 F.2d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 1968). Senator Flanders, who offered the final amendment that became Section 2(11), noted in the <em>Congressional Record </em>that \u201cunder some modern management methods, the supervisor might be deprived of authority for most of the functions enumerated and still have a large responsibility for the exercise of personal judgment.\u201d 93 Cong.Rec. 4677 (1947). A person \u201ccharged with the responsible direction of his department and the men under him,\u201d determining \u201cunder general orders which jobs shall be undertaken next and who shall do it,\u201d giving instructions for its proper performance and training in the performance of unfamiliar tasks, is above the grade of \u201c \u2018straw bosses, lead men, setup men and other minor supervisory employees\u2019 \u201d and has supervisory power. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">While the question is a very close one, judged by these standards, the finding of the ALJ that the leadpersons here were supervisors is supported by substantial evidence. A careful perusal of the record indicates that the findings are based upon testimony by the leadpersons and other employees, even though some of the former later disavowed affidavits given to Board counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">II. <em>The CEO\u2019s Speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The evidence that the Chief Executive Officer attempted to create the impression that a withholding of wage increases would be the fault of the union is quite thin indeed, but nevertheless also sufficient to support the findings. The election was scheduled for February 25, 1977, and he gave a speech to three separate groups of employees on February 11, reading from a prepared text to the first two groups, but admittedly varying the prepared text in the third speech. He did not, however, admit making the impromptu statement, testified to by a single employee, that there could be no wage increases \u201cbecause of the union being on the scene\u201d or until after \u201cthe election came through for or against the union.\u201d He only recalled stating to the employees that the company \u201ccould not come out with a benefit program . because of the [possibility of] litigation surrounding the current situation,\u201d and insisted that his \u201ccurrent situation\u201d remark was not referring to the union election campaign. The CEO\u2019s version is lent some support by the uncontroverted evidence in the record that no suspension of wage increases actually took place. But the ALJ found a violation, basing his finding as much on DeLuca\u2019s inability to remember and somewhat equivocal testimony as on the testimony of the single employee who described the speech but testified to two different versions of it. As we have said, the evidence is thin, but it is nevertheless . substantial enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">III. <em>The Ten-Percent Absentee Discharge Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The question under \u00a7 8(a)(3) is, of course, whether the employer has \u201cby discrimination in regard to . tenure of employment . . . encouragefd] or discourage[d] membership in any labor organization.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). More specifically, the issue here is the support in the record for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the discharges of January 26, 1977 were not made solely for legitimate economic reasons, but because the company had an intent to discourage union activities by the employees. <em>See NLRB v. Advanced Business Forms Corp., </em>474 F.2d 457, 463-64 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>NLRB v. Long Island Airport Limousine Service Corp., </em>468 F.2d 292, 295 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Prior to January 26, 1977, the employer had no standard policy with respect to the number of absences that would result in a discharge. Instead, the supervisors exercised their own judgment on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, discharging those employees with an absentee rate considered unacceptable. On January 24 or 25, the employer held a management personnel meeting at which absenteeism, lateness, productivity, and employee drinking were discussed. The two foremen present, Taylor and Dietz, picked out those employee attendance sheets that indicated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>large number of absences. The company vice president then did some rough calculations and concluded that the percentage of absences for this group of nine employees was about ten, while some other employees had absentee rates that were slightly less. Following a conversation about the industry\u2019s acceptable rate of absenteeism, which is four percent, a decision was made to establish a discharge rule and to \u201cdouble and then some\u2019\u2019 the industry average to ten percent for this company.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The company contends that the development of this new absentee policy was occasioned by the need to cut the absentee rate in order to meet a newly issued winter production schedule and the two foremen as well as the personnel manager testified to that effect. Yet, the new production schedule was passed out in the third or fourth week of December, according to one witness, and in early January, according to the other, while the meeting was not held until January 24 or 25. This was one factor prompting the ALJ to discredit the testimony asserting that the new rule was created in order to meet the newly issued production schedule. In addition, absenteeism historically had been a continuing plant problem. And the company controller offered an entirely different explanation of the rule. He testified that, before the advent of union activity, the company\u2019s practice was to discharge employees whenever their absentee records became too serious, but that the company halted this practice in mid-November, 1976 after the union began organizing, because it was uncertain of its rights. Thereafter, he said, the company was advised by counsel that it could continue to do business normally, so a meeting was called to evaluate the entire employee complement with its backlog of absenteeism problems. This testimony was obviously different from that of the supervisors and personnel manager. It is somewhat unconvincing in itself because, as the ALJ pointed out, the company did not revert to its normal practice of <em>ad hoc </em>discharges; it inaugurated an across-the-board discharge policy based solely on absentee percentages.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Three known and active union adherents, Christina Smith Porter, Christopher Porter, and Timothy Bradeen were discharged on January 26, along with six employees not known as active union supporters. One of the latter group was hired back on the basis of her statement that she had been ill. But one union adherent, Bradeen, was disparately treated in that he, too, had been ill on at least five occasions and these illnesses had been reported by his mother. With these five days excluded, his absentee rate was only eight percent, but in his case no consideration was given to illness excuses. In the cas\u00e9 of Christopher Porter, the rough calculations were based on the assumption that he had been employed for 100 days, but in fact he had been employed for 110 days, so that his ten percent rate of absence should have been reduced to nine percent and he should not have been discharged. Other employees with nine percent absentee rates were not, in fact, terminated. Thus, the disparate treatment received by union adherent Bradeen and the inaccurate calculation of union adherent Porter\u2019s rate of absenteeism lend considerable support to the ALJ findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">That the discharge rule was considered in company circles to have anti-union consequences and motivation is further demonstrated by some other evidence credited by the ALJ. There was testimony that, when supervisor Gutbrod learned in June, 1977 that employee Jones was going to the Labor Board, Gutbrod threatened to punish Jones by informing him that sooner or later, he would be on the \u201cten percent absentee list,\u201d /. e., fired. Thus, the ALJ based his view that the discharge rule was intentionally discriminatory both on \u201cthe genesis of the rule . . . as an effort to chill unionism\u201d and on \u201cthe implicit admission of Gut-brod to Jones . . . that this was the purpose of the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The company contends, of course, that these employees were discharged for legitimate business reasons, but its discriminatory application of the rule cuts the other way. This was the biggest discharge of employees on one day in the company\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>history. While it was by no means equal to the \u201cpower display in the form of a mass lay-off\u201d in <em>Majestic Molded Products, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>330 F.2d 603, 606 (2d Cir. 1964), the company did promulgate a new rule that resulted in the immediate discharge of nine employees, including three of the union\u2019s most active supporters, just one month before the Board\u2019s scheduled election. It is not necessarily dispositive here that six employees whose union sentiments were not known were discharged at the time, since that could be considered an attempt to appear consistent with the pretext for discharging the three known union adherents. <em>See NLRB v. Dorn\u2019s Transportation Co., </em>405 F.2d 706, 713 (2d Cir. 1969). Moreover, there is no indication that any of these employees were given prior warnings that their continued absenteeism might result in discharge and, as we said in <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>242 F.2d 497, 502 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 829, 78 S.Ct. 40, 2 L.Ed.2d 41 (1957), the \u201cabruptness of a discharge and its timing are persuasive evidence as to motivation.\" Of course, our enforcement of the Board\u2019s order does not preclude the company from adopting an absenteeism rule under circumstances that do not indicate a violation of the Act.

This expectation will never be realized, however, until the Board becomes consistent in its application of the standards' of supervisory status contained in section 2(11). One need only contrast the Board\u2019s decisions in cases where the acts of an employee may be attributed to management as an unfair labor practice with its decisions in cases where the employee\u2019s activities may subject the employee himself to management sanctions to realize that consistency of application does not typify the Board\u2019s record to date. When the Board\u2019s decisions in bargaining unit cases are thrown into the hopper, inconsistency becomes even more apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">So that this opinion will not be unduly prolonged, many of the cases in which judicial review was sought have been listed in an appendix. A comparison of the decisions in the three areas covered will demonstrate the dissimilarities in the Board\u2019s approach and the manner in which the Board shifts emphasis among the indicia of supervisory status depending, to some extent at least, upon the purpose for which its appraisal is being made. This result-oriented method of fact-finding should come to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The Board is obligated to administer the Labor Management Relations Act fairly and rationally and to act as an impartial and neutral referee, guarding the right of both employer and employee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It should not act arbitrarily, nor \u201ctreat similar situations in dissimilar ways.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After thirty-three years of Board review, the time has come for sufficient certainty to be brought into the interpretation of sections 2(3) and 2(11) so that those for whom these sections have meaning need no longer act at their peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Because the Board\u2019s decision in the instant case is clearly inconsistent with its holdings in a number of prior cases,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and because I find no substantial evidence in the record as a whole establishing that the lead persons were part of management with real power to act in the interest of their employer,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which holds to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">I concur in that portion of the majority opinion which upholds the Board\u2019s finding relative to the threatened withholding of wage increases and the improperly motivated discharge of workers under the ten percent absenteeism rule. I find absolutely no basis, however, for the Board\u2019s mandatory order that respondent Porta Systems must rescind its ten percent absenteeism discharge rule and may no longer enforce it. If any wrong resulted from the original enactment of the rule, it will be corrected by the rehiring order. After such correction, the continued existence and enforcement of the rule is a simple management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>decision with which the Board should have no concern.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">ATTRIBUTED UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"><em>NLRB v.
