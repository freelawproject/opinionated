Ulano, </em>9 Cir., 614 F.2d 1257 (1980), we reserved decision on Ulano\u2019s argument that the special parole term portion of his sentence, for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, was unlawful, noting that the issue was pending before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in <em>Bifulco v. United </em>States,-U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d - (1980), has held that a special parole term is not authorized for violation of this statute, and is subject to attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-26\">The motion of Ulano <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for recall of the mandate is granted. The petition for rehearing is granted.
