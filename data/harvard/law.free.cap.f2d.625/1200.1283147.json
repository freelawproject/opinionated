Rutledge asserts that legal advice concerning his speedy trial and conflict of interest claims was so grossly erroneous that it amounted to an unconstitutional deprivation of his right to counsel. A plea based on such assistance, he claims, could not be deemed knowing and willing. Rutledge also contends on appeal that the district court reviewing these habeas corpus claims erroneously denied relief without reviewing the entire record or holding an evidentiary hearing, or giving him timely opportunity to respond to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation to the court. Finding no reversible error in Rutledge\u2019s claims, we affirm. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-17\">Because the procedural rules we must consider are exacting, we review in detail the events preceding Rutledge\u2019s plea. The day following his arrest on March 18, 1975, Rutledge was charged by information with a robbery offense. On March 22, a public defender was appointed to represent Rutledge, but was forced to withdraw on March 28 due to a conflict of interest which arose from representing Rutledge and a eodefendant. Other counsel appointed by the state court on April 3 was forced to withdraw on April 14 due to yet another conflict of interest. That same day, the court appointed as counsel Mr. Robert A. Harper, who remained with Rutledge through the course of his plea and subsequent state court appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-18\">Trial was set for June 16, 1975, well within the 180 day limit set for felony trials by Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.191.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Four days before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>the scheduled trial date, however, defense counsel filed a motion to continue, asserting that the state\u2019s dereliction in response to discovery requests had left him inadequate time to prepare. The motion was granted the same day. Trial was rescheduled for October 23, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">On July 7, defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss Rutledge\u2019s indictment, arguing that Rutledge had been denied a fair trial because one of his previous lawyers had been representing both him and a co-defendant at the time the co-defendant decided to make a statement inculpating Rutledge. This motion the trial court denied on July 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">On October 17, 1975, shortly before the trial\u2019s rescheduled date, defense counsel filed a motion for discharge, alleging that Rutledge had been deprived of a speedy trial, in contravention of Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.191. Deeming the earlier motion for continuance a complete waiver of the fixed time limitations for speedy trial, the court denied the motion for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Taken as true for the purpose of habeas corpus review, the petition\u2019s allegations establish that Rutledge\u2019s counsel then informed him that he could plead nolo conten-dere and still preserve as viable issues for appeal both the speedy trial and conflict of interest claims. On the strength of this advice, Rutledge did plead nolo contendere on October 23, 1975. Apparently satisfied that the plea was knowledgeable and willing, the trial court accepted the plea and sentenced him to life imprisonment on December 5, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">Rutledge\u2019s appellate efforts in state court met with less success than his trial lawyer\u2019s advice seems to have portended. Exhaustion of his state remedies was complete by 1978, and Rutledge was still in jail. Thereafter he initiated pro se habeas corpus proceedings in United States District Court, challenging the effectiveness of his counsel and the voluntariness of his plea. Rutledge alleged as an essential defect in his legal counseling that his lawyer waived any chance for discharge under the speedy trial rules, yet told him that his speedy trial claim was a viable issue preserved for appeal, along with the conflict of interest claim. Rutledge then asserted that his lawyer should have known that both the speedy trial and conflict of interest claims were without any merit whatsoever. A United States magistrate considered Rutledge\u2019s allegations and an abbreviated record of proceedings. Deeming the petition\u2019s allegations inadequate as a matter of law, the magistrate concluded over Rutledge\u2019s protestations that the trial record did not need to be reviewed in its entirety. The magistrate then recommended denial of the habe-as corpus petition. The following day, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Rutledge\u2019s petition. On motion for rehearing, Rutledge reasserted the need for the court to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>the full record, and also complained that the speed of the district court\u2019s action deprived him of a procedural right to object to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. The district court denied the motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">I. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">Although pre-plea flaws in providing procedural rights to defendants normally are subsumed in a voluntary plea of guilty or nolo contendere, federal courts may review claimed errors if the state provides a mechanism for appellate review. <em>Stanley v. Wainwright, 604 </em>F.2d 379 n.l (5th Cir. 1979). Florida provides appellate review for such errors as could be dispositive of a case. <em>Brown v. State, </em>376 So.2d 382 (Fla. 1979). Because Florida speedy trial rules provide for a defendant\u2019s discharge if his trial is not timely, Rutledge\u2019s plea does not block federal court review. <em>See </em>Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.191.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">Rutledge\u2019s appellate contentions that his counsel was ineffective and his plea involuntary both hinge on his lawyer\u2019s advice concerning Rutledge\u2019s speedy trial and conflict of interest claims. If the lav/yer\u2019s counseling was so patently wrong as to transgress some constitutional minimum of competent legal advice, then clearly the lawyer was so ineffective that Rutledge\u2019s plea based on his advice could not have been knowing and willing. <em>Mason v. Balcom, </em>531 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1976). Conversely, if Rutledge\u2019s trial counsel merely erred strategically, his advice was nonetheless competent and Rutledge\u2019s plea a calculated but voluntary risk. <em>See Coco </em>v. <em>United States, </em>569 F.2d 367, 371 (5th Cir. 1978). To measure the lawyer\u2019s effectiveness, then, we must first ascertain the constitutional minimum of competent advice on speedy trial rights and conflict of interest claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">That minimum level of competence depends to some extent on the clarity of state law. If the law concerning speedy trial rights and conflicts of interest was unambiguous in every applicable aspect, any erroneous advice would have transgressed the minimum effective assistance due Rutledge. \u201c[Cjonstitutionally effective assistance must make an informed evaluation of possible defenses and have a meaningful discussion of the reality of the case with his client. . . .\u201d <em>Dixon v. Balk-com, </em>614 F.2d 1067, 1068 (5th Cir. 1980). Because Florida law provides for unconditional discharge if speedy trial provisions are violated, a failure to advise Rutledge accurately concerning this defense certainly would amount to a constitutional deprivation. If the law pertinent to Rutledge\u2019s case was not clear, however, advice amounting to no more than a mistaken tactical maneuver would not have reached the level of constitutional deprivation. <em>Davis v. Wainwright, </em>547 F.2d 261, 264 (5th Cir. 1977). Federal courts may not even review by habeas corpus petition those tactical errors which, as mere violations of state procedural law, are not of constitutional dimension. <em>Id. </em>We therefore turn to Florida law to determine how clear and sure a procedural path its statutes, rules, and cases provide to protect speedy trial rights and to guard against damaging conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">A. <em>Florida Speedy Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">Proper assessment of the adequacy of Rutledge\u2019s alleged legal counseling requires a brief review of speedy trial law as it stood when he pled nolo contendere on October 23, 1975. By that time, state courts had uniformly acknowledged that by requesting a continuance a defendant waived any right to the state procedural rule\u2019s specific time limitations. <em>See State ex rel Butler v. Cullen, </em>253 So.2d 861, 863 (Fla. 1971). Less obvious were what limits constitutional guarantees placed on speedy trial extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">By the time of Rutledge\u2019s plea, the Supreme Court of Florida had considered in three leading cases how defendant-initiated delays such as continuances affect the operation of speedy trial rules. In each of these three cases, the court propounded a different ultimate limit on extensions of trial dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>In <em>State ex rel. Butler v. Cullen, </em>253 So.2d 861 (Fia. 1971), the court approved a trial court\u2019s denial of discharge to defendants who had obtained a continuance to complete their defense preparations. According to the court, the grant of continuance rendered the procedural deadlines inapplicable, and gave the trial court discretion to set a new date which would serve both the purpose of the continuance and the constitutional guarantee of speedy trial. Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.191(d)(3), however, was found to require trial commencement within ninety days from the filing of a discharge motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">The court in <em>Negron v. State, </em>306 So.2d 104 (Fla. 1974), held that a defendant who after a continuance was continuously available for trial must be discharged if not brought to trial within ninety days of the continuance itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">In <em>Rubiera v. Dade County ex rel. Beni-tez, </em>305 So.2d 161 (Fla. 1974), the court held that unexcused delay other than a continuance extended the speedy trial limit ninety days past the denial of the defendant\u2019s discharge motion, rather than ninety days past its filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">The <em>Rubiera </em>court sought with but limited success to harmonize precedent of both the state supreme court and intermediate appellate courts. Different results in cases without impressive distinguishing features left the law less than clear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, an intermediate appellate decision limiting Rubiera <em>\u2019s </em>reach was announced shortly before Rutledge\u2019s motion for discharge. In <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Yawn, </em>320 So.2d 880 (Fla. 1st D.C.A. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>334 So.2d 609 (1976), the court held that state-induced delay between the defendant\u2019s arrest and much later indictment, as well as the state\u2019s dereliction in discovery response, subjected the defendant to an unfair dilemma shortly before the speedy trial deadline was to pass. The state\u2019s dereliction forced the defendant to choose between conducting discovery in an abbreviated period or forfeiting his right to a speedy trial. The appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of discharge, holding that the egregious delay engendered by the state should not be attributed to the defendant merely because the defendant filed the actual continuance request. Rather, the court held, the continuance should have been attributed to the state, so that the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights would have been preserved. <em>But see Rossenwasser v. Smith, </em>308 So.2d 600 (Fla. 3d D.C.A. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">Faced with these less than clear pronouncements, Rutledge\u2019s trial lawyer was called upon to render counseling based on his best legal judgment. He may well have believed that Rutledge\u2019s case so closely paralleled <em>Yawn </em>as to compel a similar result. Alternatively, he may have thought that <em>Negron </em>should have controlled Rutledge\u2019s case. Had <em>Negron </em>governed, Rutledge would have, gained discharge, since more than ninety days had expired between Rutledge\u2019s continuance and the discharge motion. That state appeals found the lawyer\u2019s judgment erroneous did not render his counseling ineffective. Consequently, Rutledge\u2019s assertion of ineffective counsel is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">B. <em>Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5k\">Rutledge also contends that his lawyer gave ineffective assistance by incorrectly advising him that he had properly preserved for appeal a viable conflict of interest claim. That conflict claim arose from a previous attorney\u2019s joint representation of Rutledge and his co-defendant at the time the co-defendant decided to testify against Rutledge. Taking Rutledge\u2019s allegations as true to test their sufficiency, we will assume that the state courts refused to consider the conflict of interest claim because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>it was not properly preserved for review. We find that Rutledge\u2019s attack on his counseling nonetheless fails to state a claim for habeas corpus relief. While insisting that his lawyer chose the wrong means to assert the conflict of interest claims, he acknowledges that his suggested alternative might have worked no better. Rutledge recognizes as unresolved the problem of possible conflict arising and expiring at a time considerably preceding plea or trial. Such an unresolved area of the law again demanded that Rutledge\u2019s lawyer exercise judgment to determine appropriate means to bring the conflict issue before \u25a0 the court. The success of that exercise in judgment is not open to scrutiny now. <em>See Coco v. United States, </em>569 F.2d at 371. We conclude that Rutledge\u2019s counseling was not ineffective and that consequently his plea was not involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">II. Adequacy <em>of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1q\">Rutledge contends that the district court committed reversible error by denying his petition without reviewing certain parts of the state court record. Essential to adequate consideration of his habeas corpus claims, Rutledge claims, was review of the hearings and denials of his motion to dismiss and his motion for discharge. The district court reviewed only that part of the record dealing with the plea and sentencing proceedings. We nonetheless find that that review was ample, because in this case no factual dispute arises from the parts of the record not reviewed. Rutledge\u2019s only arguments fail as a matter of law, not of fact. His allegations are insufficient to raise an issue of unconstitutionally ineffective legal assistance. <em>See Anderson v. Maggio, 555 </em>F.2d 447, 453 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Cowens v. Wainwright, </em>373 F.2d 34 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 913, 87 S.Ct. 1705, 18 L.Ed.2d 637 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">Because the habeas corpus petition failed to allege facts which, if proved, would have entitled Rutledge to relief, the district court was- not required to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>Easter v. Estelle, </em>609 F.2d 756 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Cronnon v. State, </em>587 F.2d 246, 249 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 1542, 59 L.Ed.2d 792 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">Rutledge further complains that the district judge adopted the magistrate\u2019s report on Rutledge\u2019s petition the day after it was issued, giving him no opportunity to file objections to the report. Rutledge argues that, because his subsequent rehearing petition incorporating those objections did not generate de novo review, he was unlawfully denied an opportunity to respond meaningfully to the magistrate\u2019s report, a right purportedly guaranteed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That section does per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>mit objections to the magistrate\u2019s recommendations, and in most instances that privilege to respond does help to safeguard the judiciary\u2019s factfinding responsibility. <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>609 F.2d 152, 154-55 (5th Cir. 1980). In this ease, however, any error in not reviewing objections before issuing the order adopting the report was harmless. Because none of Rutledge\u2019s arguments arose from a factual dispute, the district judge could assess the merits of the petition from its face. Moreover, the petition for rehearing gave the judge further opportunity to reconsider any legal argument. From these circumstances arose no denial of any right which would merit reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">Because Rutledge\u2019s petition failed to allege facts which, if taken as true, could establish a valid claim of ineffective counsel or inadequate review, the denial of habeas corpus relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-14\">.
