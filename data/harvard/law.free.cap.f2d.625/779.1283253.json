SCHATZ, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-10\">. The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, the Honorable John W. Oliver, District Judge, presiding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b844-7\">ROSS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The appellant, Joseph J. Spero, was convicted by a jury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of one count of conspiring to possess a destructive device not registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, and one count of possession of such a device.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During his trial, the district judge permitted counsel for the United States to cross-examine Spero, over his attorney\u2019s objection, about a 1957 conviction for grand theft. On appeal, Spero claims that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence pertaining to the twenty-two year old conviction because he failed to make an adequate finding that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect, pursuant to Rule 609(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree, and therefore affirm Spero\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">Spero\u2019s theory of the case is founded upon two arguments. First, it is claimed that the evidence of the conviction has no probative value relative to the issues in the case, and that the district court therefore erred in admitting it. Second, it is argued that the district court\u2019s findings were inadequate because they failed <em>specifically and explicitly </em>to weigh the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">It is obvious from our review of the record that these contentions are without merit. The evidence concerning Spero\u2019s prior conviction \u2014 albeit twenty-two years old \u2014 is probative of his credibility as a witness. And considering the importance of the credibility resolutions in this particular appeal, we cannot say that the district court erred in admitting the evidence of the 1957 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">The reasoning behind our conclusion becomes more evident when viewed against the background of Spero\u2019s trial. The government\u2019s case against Spero and his codefendants was based in large part upon the testimony of a government witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Lyle Neal, who had participated in the conspiracy until sometime in May of 1979. At that time, Neal contacted the Missouri Police Department and offered his cooperation in return for immunity from prosecution, inclusion in the Federal Witness Protection Program, and a fairly substantial sum of money. Neal\u2019s testimony at trial linked Spero to the criminal acts alleged in the indictment, and directly contradicted Spe-ro\u2019s testimony on several crucial points. Therefore, it is fair to say that in its final analysis, the jury had to choose between accepting the testimony of Neal or accepting the testimony of Spero.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Prior to defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Neal, government counsel requested a ruling under Rule 609(b) as to the admissibility of Neal\u2019s two felony convictions which had occurred more than ten years before the trial. Judge Oliver, noting the circumstances surrounding the testimony and the importance of Neal\u2019s credibility, permitted broad cross-examination, including questions about the two prior felony convictions. When the government counsel requested similar permission to question Spero about his 1957 conviction, Spero\u2019s counsel objected, and argued that the conviction was too remote in time to be probative. Judge Oliver disagreed, and permitted the issue to be raised on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">This court has noted before that the trial court judge is \u201cbest situated to determine the \u2018interests of justice\u2019 \u201d in considering whether evidence of prior crimes should be admitted at trial, in accordance with the terms of Rule 609(b). <em>United States v. Little, </em>567 F.2d 346, 350 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 1608, 56 L.Ed.2d 60 (1977). And in situations such as this, where the credibility of one witness must be weighed directly against that of another, the probative value of a prior conviction may well be enhanced, rather than diminished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-7\">[W]e note that the admission of Appellant\u2019s criminal record here, along with the criminal record of the complaining witness, was not in a vindictive or \u201ceye for an eye\u201d sense, as Appellant argues. Rather it was received because the case had narrowed to the credibility of two persons \u2014 the accused and his accuser\u2014 and in those circumstances there was greater, not less, compelling reason for exploring all avenues which would shed light on which of the two witnesses was to be believed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-10\"><em>Gordon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 F.2d 936, 941 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1029, 88 S.Ct. 1421, 20 L.Ed.2d 287 (1968). We are therefore unable to conclude that Judge Oliver erred in determining that this evidence was probative and that it should have been admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">Spero also argues that the district court erred in not citing specific and explicit findings to support the admission of the evidence of his prior conviction. Spero contends that such formal findings of fact and conclusions of law are mandated by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Cavender, </em>578 F.2d 528 (4th Cir. 1978). It is true, as Spero suggests, that the <em>Cavender </em>decision requires specific findings of the facts and circumstances which allow the admission of evidence pertaining to a conviction that is more than ten years old. However, we feel that the <em>Cavender </em>decision is in no way binding on this court in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">We note at the outset that although we are not disposed at this time to adopt the requirements set forth in <em>Cavender, </em>there is no need for such a decision in the present appeal. Even assuming, arguendo, that Judge Oliver\u2019s findings are inadequate to support the admission of the evidence in question, any error which might exist in that ruling is purely harmless error. The facts of this appeal provide a stark contrast to those in <em>Cavender, </em>where evidence concerning three convictions which had occurred over ten years before the trial were admitted along with one conviction which was clearly within the ten year time period set out in Rule 609(b). In addition, the court in <em>Cavender </em>determined that the error in the admission of the prior convictions evidence was substantial in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>circumstantial nature of the government\u2019s case and the highly prejudicial nature of a twenty-five year old sodomy conviction and a twenty-one year old probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In the present case, only one felony conviction was brought to the jury\u2019s attention, and the record clearly reflects that Judge Oliver limited the discussion of that conviction to a brief inquiry in which counsel had the opportunity to state or ask \u201cthe date, time, place, and let it go at that.\u201d Counsel for the government scrupulously adhered to the limitations placed on the inquiry by Judge Oliver. In addition, the evidence against Spero in this case was considerably more persuasive than the circumstantial evidence adduced by the government in Ca-<em>vender. </em>Under the circumstances, the prejudice resulting from the admission of the evidence was minimal. Finally, as we indicated previously, the probative value of a prior conviction over ten years old is enhanced when the credibility of one convicted witness is weighed directly against that of another. <em>Gordon v. United States, supra, </em>383 F.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">In conclusion, we agree with counsel for the government that \u201cit is apparent <em>Caven-der </em>was a case of massive and prejudicial overkill, readily distinguishable from the use of one felony with no emotionally prejudicial overtones in the instant situation.\u201d Thus, we hold that any error which might exist in Judge Oliver\u2019s evidentiary ruling is harmless error. <em>See Grant v. White, </em>579 F.2d 48, 49 (8th Cir. 1978) (improper admission of an uncounseled juvenile adjudication was held harmless error in light of other strong evidence of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In light of the foregoing analysis, Spero\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-11\">. Appellant Spero was indicted and tried along with codefendants Conrad E. Metz and Michael W. Cuezze. Count I of the indictment alleged the existence of a conspiracy to possess a destructive device, defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(f), which had not been registered to the defendants in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). Count II alleged the willful and knowing possession of a destructive device in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Spero and Metz were convicted on both counts, and Cuezze was acquitted. Both Spero and Metz appeal their convictions. See <em>United States v. </em>Metz, 625 F.2d 775 (8th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-17\">. Rule 609(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Y\">(b) Time limit \u2014 Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. However, evidence of a conviction more than 10 years old as calculated herein, is not admissible unless the proponent gives to the adverse party sufficient advance written notice of intent to use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to contest the use of such evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
