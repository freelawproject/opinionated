LANIER ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Petitioner, a psychotherapist formerly licensed to practice in Texas, is the defendant in two civil actions filed in the district court of Travis County, Texas, by former patients. Plaintiffs in those lawsuits assert several causes of action which relate to petitioner\u2019s sexual relationships with them during the periods they were his patients. The issue before us concerns certain interrogatories propounded by plaintiffs which petitioner refuses to answer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs obtained an order from the trial judge compelling petitioner to answer the interrogatories, but petitioner refused to comply. Af-. ter a hearing in which petitioner was ordered to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for refusing to answer, the trial judge found him in contempt of court and ordered him confined to jail until such time as he complied with the order directing him to answer the interrogatories or until further order of the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner was released on bail. He then sought a writ of habeas corpus in the Texas Supreme Court and his petition was denied. He thus exhausted his state remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1976). He next sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3) (1976). This petition was also denied and petitioner now seeks our review of the district court\u2019s denial. He asks us to reverse the district court\u2019s order and to order the district court to issue a writ of habeas corpus setting aside and declaring void the state\u2019s order of commitment. The basis for petitioner\u2019s refusal to answer is his claim of a federal constitutional right to privacy which he asserts on his own behalf and on behalf of any patients whose identities would be revealed if he answered the interrogatories. More specifically, he asserts that the psychotherapist/patient relationship falls within the constitutional right of privacy and that this right includes the right to confidentiality as to the fact of treatment as well as to communications between psychotherapist and patient. He argues in addition that the constitutional privacy right protects one from being required to involuntarily disclose the names of those persons with whom he has been sexually intimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Prior to oral argument of his appeal but after the United States District Court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s habeas petition, the Texas legislature passed a privilege statute providing for confidentiality of mental health information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute extends to pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>tients of psychotherapists the privilege to have their identities and communications with psychotherapists remain confidential. Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St. Art. 5561h. The psychotherapist is given the right to assert the privilege on behalf of his patient. The statute contemplates certain exceptions to the privilege, not relevant here, and provides for civil penalties in the event its provisions are violated. Its effective date is August 27, 1979, and it contains a provision that \u201cthe prohibitions of this Act continue to apply to confidential communications or records concerning any patient/client irrespective of when the patient/client received services of a professional.\u201d See \u00a7 2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">After the statute went into effect, petitioner filed a motion in the district court of Travis County to reconsider the disclosure order and the judgment of contempt. His motion alleged that the newly enacted privilege statute applies to exclude from disclosure the information the court had ordered the defendant to produce. Appellant moved the court to rescind its order of contempt. Appellant\u2019s motion is now pending in the Texas state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">The effect of the new privilege statute on the instant case is not clear. It is conceivable that the statute will be interpreted to invalidate the order underlying the contempt order; that is, the Texas state court might find that the privilege operates retroactively to forbid disclosure of the information ordered by the court to be disclosed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Apart from any retroactivity issue, however, the impact of the statute on any action appellant might now take must be considered. It appears that in order for appellant to purge himself of contempt, he must divulge the information the court ordered him to disclose. But such disclosure now will apparently violate the prohibitions of the privilege statute and thus subject appellant to civil liability. The Texas state court may therefore decide that the contempt order cannot stand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">This case falls within the ambit of the Pullman<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> abstention doctrine. <em>Pullman </em>abstention is appropriate \u201c \u2018in cases presenting a federal constitutional issue which might be mooted or presented in a different posture by a state court determination of pertinent state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 </em>U.S. 800, 814, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1244, 47 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>483 (1976) (quoting <em>County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., </em>360 U.S. 185, 189, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 1063, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959)). The prerequisites for <em>Pullman </em>abstention are that \u201c(1) there must be an unsettled issue of state law; and (2) there must be a possibility that the state law determination will moot or present in a different posture the federal constitutional questions raised.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Jackson, </em>617 F.2d 424, 428 (5th Cir. 1980). Like <em>Pullman, </em>this case involves a state statute, interpretation and application of which might obviate the necessity for determining the constitutional issues. In <em>Pullman, </em>plaintiffs challenged a Railroad Commission regulation as unauthorized by Texas statutes and as violative of the federal Constitution. The Supreme Court found abstention appropriate because the issue of whether the relevant statute authorized the challenged regulation might dispose of the controversy, thereby avoiding the constitutional issue. In the instant case, the privilege statute might dispose of the question of whether petitioner must answer interrogatory no. 50. The new statute may operate either to invalidate or to excuse compliance with the order compelling petitioner to answer interrogatory no. 50. In either event, of course, we would not need to reach the important and sensitive constitutional issues raised by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">We cannot state with certainty, however, that the privilege statute will apply to invalidate the state court\u2019s order compelling petitioner to answer interrogatory no. 50 in this ease. The applicability of the statute to pending litigation and the scope<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the privilege are matters which are not clear on the face of the statute and which have not yet been decided by the Texas courts. They are matters which should properly be decided by the Texas court. We need not and do not reach them. Because resolution of these issues in the Texas court is likely to make it unnecessary for us to decide, or may present in a different posture, the important constitutional issues presented in this appeal, we decline to reach the constitutional questions at this time. <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941); <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976); <em>High Ol\u2019 Times v. Busbee, </em>621 F.2d 135 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Palmer v. Jackson, </em>617 F.2d 424 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">We find it particularly appropriate for us to defer decision of these constitutional issues until such time as the state court has resolved the state law issues, in light of the fact that petitioner\u2019s motion seeking a rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ing on the applicability of the new statute to his case is currently pending in the state court. <em>See Harris County Commissioners Court v. Moore, </em>420 U.S. 77, 95 S.Ct. 870, 43 L.Ed.2d 32 (1975); <em>Askew v. Hargrave, </em>401 U.S. 476, 91 S.Ct. 856, 28 L.Ed.2d 196 (1971); <em>Gibson v. Jackson, </em>578 F.2d 1045 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1119, 99 S.Ct. 1028, 59 L.Ed.2d 79 (1979).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Some of the delay typically associated with abstention will thus apparently be avoided here.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">We have determined that abstention is appropriate in light of the newly enacted privilege statute. In order to insure that the Texas state court will be able to address the state law issues, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions that it dismiss petitioner\u2019s petition without prejudice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\">. The same interrogatory was propounded by both plaintiffs in the civil actions against petitioner. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">50.

The court\u2019s order of contempt, based as it was upon petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the earlier discovery order made at the instance and for the benefit of the plaintiffs in the civil action, was clearly an order of civil contempt. <em>See Ex Parte Wolters, </em>64 Tex.Cr.R. 238, 144 S.W. 531, 587-88 (1912).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b719-5\">.

In re </em>Timmons, 607 F.2d 120, 124-25 (5th Cir. 1979) where this court, reviewing a federal district court\u2019s criminal contempt order, observed \u201cAn order of civil contempt cannot stand if the underlying order in which it is based is invalid, for its only purpose is to secure compliance with the order. Once the order is decreed invalid, compliance is no longer required . . . The validity of a criminal contempt conviction resulting from violation of a court order, however, does not turn on the validity of that order, [citations omitted] even if that order is later found to have infringed constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b720-15\">. Under Texas law, impossibility of compliance or inability to comply with the court\u2019s order to purge the contempt may excuse failure to comply. 12 Tex.Jur.2d <em>Contempt </em>\u00a7 52 (1960); <em>Ex Parte Adair, </em>222 S.W.2d 324 (Tex.Civ.App. 1949). We do not address whether exposure to civil liability constitutes impossibility sufficient to excuse compliance. Nor do we answer the question whether an impossibility \u201cdefense\u201d may properly be raised at a motion for reconsideration of the state court\u2019s orders compelling answers to interrogatories and adjudging petitioner in contempt. These are issues for the Texas court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b720-16\">. <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">. We note that the interrogatory consists of five separate but interrelated questions. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Petitioner has refused to answer any of these questions. If the privilege statute applies, it would appear to prevent disclosure of the names of patients and any other information which might lead to disclosure of their identities. It is not clear, however, that the privilege statute would prohibit petitioner from replying to the general question posed or that it would prohibit reply to all of the question\u2019s subparts. The statute might be interpreted to prohibit reply to even the general question on the theory that the contacts described are protected communications between the psychotherapist and the patient. An affirmative answer to the general questions would reveal that such activity had occurred between petitioner and unspecified and uncounted patients. Such a revelation might cause those who knew the identity of one or more of petitioner\u2019s patients to impute to those known patients the activity revealed. We note that the general question posed by interrogatory no. 50, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>seeks a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer to a compound inquiry, <em>i. e., </em>whether appellant engaged in a variety of activity ranging from touching to having sexual intercourse with other patients. A \u201cyes\u201d answer thus would be required even if petitioner merely touched other patients but the inference drawn from a \u201cyes\u201d answer might be that petitioner had sexual intercourse with other patients. Because the answer to the general question might imply that known patients engaged in sexual activity with petitioner, the Texas court might find that the privilege is intended to prevent response to the general inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">If the privilege statute is found to apply to some of the questions but not to all of them, we do not know whether petitioner would persist in his refusal to answer any of the questions posed by interrogatory no. 50. If the state court, in light of the privilege statute, again orders petitioner to answer part or all of interrogatory no. 50 and he again refuses to comply with the state court\u2019s order, then petitioner may bring the appropriate constitutional claims before the federal courts once he has exhausted his state remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">. Although noting that the particular facts faced in <em>Gibson </em>did not present the orthodox abstention situation, this court nevertheless abstained because the probability of avoiding a momentous and difficult federal constitutional question \u2014 not of itself sufficient to justify abstention \u2014 conjoined with considerations of comity, of avoiding piecemeal litigation, and of avoiding a precedent for retarding pending state court litigation to make abstention appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Not only is the instant case within the ambit of orthodox Pullman-type abstention, but the case for abstention is further supported by the presence here of the pending state court litigation bringing into play the additional <em>Gibson </em>factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">. The reason for our dismissal without prejudice is explained by the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Harris County Commissioners Court v. Moore, </em>420 U.S. 77, 88, n.14, 95 S.Ct. 870, 878, 43 L.Ed.2d 32 (1975), \u201c[OJrdinarily the proper course in ordering <em>\u2018Pullman </em>abstention\u2019 is to remand with instructions to retain jurisdiction but to stay the federal suit pending determination of the state law questions in state court. <em>See Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. 241, 244, n.4, 88 S.Ct. 391, 393, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967). The Texas Supreme Court has ruled, however, that it cannot grant declaratory relief under state law if a federal court retains jurisdiction over the federal claim. <em>United Services Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney, </em>Tex., 396 S.W.2d 855 (1965); <em>see Romero v. Coldwell, </em>455 F.2d 1163, 1167 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Barrett v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>444 F.2d 38, 45-46 (5th Cir. 1971).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-20\">The Supreme Court then stated that it dismissed the case \u201cto avoid the possibility that some state law remedies might otherwise be foreclosed to appellees on their return to state court\u201d but observed that \u201cdismissal must not be used as a means to defeat the appellee\u2019s federal claims if and when they return to federal court.\u201d <em>Harris County Commissioners Court v. Moore, </em>420 U.S. at 89, n.14, 95 S.Ct. at 878 (1975). Similarly, we want to make clear that the federal forum will be open in this case if the state forum does not resolve the controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
