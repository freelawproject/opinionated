The suit charged that plaintiff\u2019s superiors at the Knoxville, Tennessee, Post Office had subjected her to a pattern of sex discrimination over a four and one-half year period. After a bench trial, the District Court found in favor of the defendant. Because we believe that the Judicial Code required the District Judge to recuse himself, we vacate and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">The substance of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that, because of her gender, postal officials at the Knoxville branch repeatedly frustrated her attempts to enter the managerial ranks of the Postal Service. She claims that the pattern of sex discrimination revealed itself in the elimination of two management positions to which she had been promoted, and in the rejection of her superior applications for two other supervisory jobs. In addition, she alleges that postal authorities made reprisals against her after she sought administrative redress through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">According to plaintiff, the pattern of sex discrimination became evident in 1973. Postal officials in September of that year abolished the Assistant Station Manager position that she held at the Burlington branch post office. In 1974, the officials rejected her bid for the position of Supervisor, Office and Postal Services, despite her qualifications. Soon after she received the Office and Postal Services job in a settlement of two EEOC claims, the Knoxville postal authorities eliminated the position. Her subsequent application for the job of Area Safety Manager was unsuccessful. Plaintiff claims that a purpose of sex discrimination motivated each employment decision plus numerous minor insults to which she also allegedly was subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">The Knoxville postal officials offered non-discriminatory explanations at trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>According to the officials, a collective bargaining agreement provision that prohibited use of supervisors to handle mails justified the abolition of the Assistant Station Manager position. The defendants explained that they had turned down plaintiff\u2019s bid for the position of Supervisor, Office and Postal Services, because another employee whose actual job had not yet been authorized was slated for the position. The officials attributed their eventual elimination of the Office and Postal Services job to budgetary retrenchment. The rejection of plaintiff\u2019s application for the position of Area Safety Manager, said the officials, was based on merit. Intertwined with each of these explanations was the suggestion that plaintiff\u2019s job performance and attitude at times were disappointing. The officials characterized her reprisal claims as baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The explanations satisfied the District Court, which concluded that in only one instance \u2014 the rejection of her application for Supervisor, Office and Postal Services\u2014 had plaintiff established a prima facie case of sex discrimination. The District Court held that the postal officials adequately had defended their conduct in that instance. The Court thus dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On appeal from the order of dismissal, plaintiff argues that the trial judge should have recused himself or impaneled an advisory jury. She maintains also that she established an unrefuted prima facie case of each instance of alleged discrimination. Finally, plaintiff claims that the District Court improperly required her to prove discriminatory intent in order to meet her initial burden of proof. Because the failure of the District Judge to recuse himself was erroneous and is dispositive of this appeal, we decide only that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">The recusal controversy concerns a remark that the District Judge made at a pre-trial hearing. At the hearing, the District Court grant\u00e9d a motion to dismiss Knoxville Postmaster C. Edwin Graves as a defendant, and to substitute the Postmaster General of the United States in Graves\u2019 place. It was the understanding of the District Court that, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c), the Postmaster General was the only proper defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the District Judge added that \u201cI know Mr. Graves, and he is an honorable man and I know he would never intentionally discriminate against anybody.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no dispute that the remark was made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a motion for recu-sal, which the District Court denied. The District Court construed the motion as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. Section 144 provides in part that \u201c[wjhenever a party . makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge . has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court observed that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>was \u201cconfident of its ability to conduct a fair trial of the merits of this case,\u201d and declined to recuse itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Because plaintiff failed to sign the affidavit, we find no error in the denial of the motion under \u00a7 144 by the District Court. Section 144 expressly requires the \u201cparty\u201d to execute the document. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, not plaintiff, signed and filed the affidavit that accompanied the motion to recuse. The motion to recuse thus was invalid under \u00a7 144 from the time that it was filed. <em>See United States ex rel. Wilson v. Coughlin, </em>472 F.2d 100, 104 (7th Cir. 1973); <em>Giebe v. Pence, </em>431 F.2d 942, 943 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Paschall v. Mayone, </em>454 F.Supp. 1289, 1299-1301 (S.D.N.Y.1978) (affirming denial of \u00a7 144 disqualification motions accompanied only by affidavit of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">The District Judge had an independent duty to recuse himself, however, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 455(a) is a self-executing provision for the disqualification of federal judges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no particular procedure that a party must follow to obtain judicial disqualification under \u00a7 455(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the section sets forth a mandatory guideline that federal judges must observe <em>sua sponte.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">Prior to 1974, \u00a7 455 required disqualification of any judge who was so connected with a party that it was improper, \u201cin his opinion,\u201d for him to preside at the trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The test for disqualification under the former \u00a7 455 was subjective: disqualification was obligatory only when a judge, in examining his own conscience, found bias unavoidable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In close cases, moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>judge had a \u201cduty to sit\u201d in spite of his predilections.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">To promote public confidence in the impartiality of the federal judicial system,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Congress in 1974 shifted the focus of \u00a7 455. \u201cAny . . . judge,\u201d \u00a7 455(a) now provides, \u201cshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No longer is a judge\u2019s introspective estimate of his own ability impartially to hear a case the determinate of disqualification under \u00a7 455.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The standard now is objective.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It asks what a reasonable person knowing all the relevant facts would think about the impartiality of the judge.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f there is a reasonable factual basis for doubting the judge\u2019s impartiality,\u201d the congressional committee reports on the 1974 amendment to \u00a7 455 explain, the judge \u201cshould disqualify himself and let another judge preside over the case,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Even where the question is close, the judge whose impartiality might reasonably be questioned must recuse himself from the trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Under the circumstances of this case, it is clear that a reasonable person would question the impartiality of the District Judge. Postmaster Graves, according to the trial transcript, was intimately connected with most of the personnel decisions of which plaintiff complains. At trial, Graves testified that the 1973 elimination of plaintiff\u2019s Assistant Station Manager position was one of his responsibilities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Likewise, Graves acknowledged that he bore responsibility for the 1974 denial of plaintiff\u2019s application for Supervisor, Office and Postal Services.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Graves also accepted responsibility for the decision to abolish the Office and Postal Services position after plaintiff had attained it in a settlement agreement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> At issue in this sex discrimination suit, therefore, were employment decisions for which Graves was, in part at least, responsible. Once the District Judge expressed his ardent sentiments about Postmaster Graves\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>character, the objective appearance of impartiality vanished.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">We intimate no opinion regarding the actual impartiality of the District Judge. Instead, it is the appearance of impartiality with which we are concerned.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has written, \u201cjustice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Clearly, under \u00a7 455(a), the District Judge had a duty to recuse himself in order to preserve the indispensable semblance of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1976) provides in part that, in civil actions to redress employment discrimination by the federal government, \u201cthe head of the department, agency, or unit, as appropriate, shall be the defendant.\u201d <em>See generally Carver v.
