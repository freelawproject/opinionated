The district court ruled in response to two motions to dismiss brought by CTRPA, which separately raised both standing and abstention issues. In its order of dismissal, the district court relied on the rule that federal courts should, as a matter of discretion, abstain from exercising jurisdiction in eases where the federal constitutional claims that support jurisdiction would be mooted or altered by a state court interpretation of state law. The district court did not reach the question whether the City and councilmembers had standing, although this issue was fully briefed and argued. We do reach the standing question, because we find that standing must be ascertained before a court proceeds to exercise its discretion to abstain. Because we conclude that the City and councilmembers lacked standing, we affirm the dismissal of their action without reaching the abstention questions which would be posed only if jurisdiction were properly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">The CTRPA is a political subdivision of the State of California charged with creating and enforcing plans for land and resource development in the Lake Tahoe region. Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 67040 <em>et seq. </em>(West Supp.1979). The City and councilmembers allege that the land use regulations and regional and transportation plans adopted by the CTRPA are unconstitutional in several respects. Specifically, they allege that these plans and regulations so drastically limit residential development of unsubdivid-ed property in the Tahoe basin, including the City, as to take property without just compensation and arbitrarily discriminate between similarly situated property owners in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. The City and councilmembers further allege viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tions of the right to travel guarantee inherent in the Constitution, and that the CTRPA\u2019s actions conflict with the plans and ordinances of a similar administrative body, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency \u2014 a bi-state agency established by Compact between California and Nevada and approved by Congress \u2014 in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The City alleges that enforcement of the CTRPA regulations has a substantial and injurious effect on its municipal finances and claims standing on this basis. The councilmembers claim standing in that they are required by law to enforce the CTRPA\u2019s regulations, Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 67072, 67102 (West Supp.1979), and yet by voting to enforce these regulations would violate their oaths of office to uphold the U.S. Constitution and expose themselves to civil liability (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) for enforcing an unconstitutional law. Violation of any of the CTRPA\u2019s ordinances is a misdemean- or, Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 67106 (West Supp. 1979), as is a government official\u2019s willful failure to perform his duty, Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 1222 (West 1966).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The councilmembers. thus allege that failure to enforce the CTRPA\u2019s regulations could result in personal criminal liability, plus possible exposure to civil claims for non-enforcement (e. <em>g., </em>mandamus actions authorized by Cal.Code Civ .Pro. \u00a7 1084 <em>et seq. </em>(West 1970)). They argue that their dilemma \u2014 they will be criminally and civilly liable for non-enforcement, and civilly liable for enforcement\u2014 generates standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Standing is a necessary element of federal-court jurisdiction. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2204, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). A threshold question in every federal case is, therefore, whether at least one plaintiff has standing. <em>Construction Indus. Ass\u2019n of Sonoma County v. City of Petaluma, </em>522 F.2d 897, 903 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert denied, </em>424 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 1148, 47 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). Only after a court is satisfied that standing and the other jurisdictional prerequisites are met may it determine, within its discretion, whether to abstain. <em>See Miller-Davis Co. v. Illinois State Toll Highway Auth., </em>567 F.2d 323, 326 (7th Cir. 1977). Although the district court passed over the standing issue we must consider it because it governs our jurisdiction as well. <em>Jenkins v. McKeithen, </em>395 U.S. 411,421, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 1848, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969) (opinion of Marshall, J.). We therefore examine whether the City and councilmembers have standing to bring this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">A. <em>The City\u2019s Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">It is well established that \u201c[pjolitical subdivisions of a state may not challenge the validity of a state statute under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>City of New York v. Richardson, </em>473 F.2d 923, 929 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 950, 93 S.Ct. 3012, 37 L.Ed.2d 1002 (1973). <em>See Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>289 U.S. 36, 40, 53 S.Ct. 431, 432, 77 L.Ed. 1015 (1933); <em>Newark v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 192, 196, 43 S.Ct. 539, 540, 67 L.Ed. 943 (1923); <em>Trenton v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 182, 188, 43 S.Ct. 534, 537, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923); <em>Aguayo v. Richardson, </em>473 F.2d 1090, 1100-01 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1146, 94 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed.2d 101 (1974). This is true whether the defendant is the state itself or another of the state\u2019s political subdivisions. <em>See New Orleans v. New Orleans Water Works Co., </em>142 U.S. 79, 12 S.Ct. 142, 35 L.Ed. 943 (1891); <em>Akron Bd. of Educ. v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>490 F.2d 1285, 1297-98 (6th Cir.) (Weick, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 932, 94 S.Ct. 2644, 41 L.Ed.2d 236 (1974). Thus, the City may not challenge CTRPA\u2019s plans and ordinances on constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because all of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>claims are based on the Constitution, the City\u2019s challenge was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">B. <em>The Councilmembers\u2019 Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The essence of the standing question \u201cis whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues. This inquiry involves both constitutional limitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise. ... In both dimensions it is founded in concern about the proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role of the courts in a democratic society.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 498, 95 S.Ct. at 2205 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">As a constitutional minimum, standing requires that a plaintiff allege</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACX\">\u201csuch a personal stake in the outcome of a controversy\u201d as to warrant <em>his </em>invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court\u2019s remedial powers on his behalf. <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). The Art. Ill judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party, even though the court\u2019s judgment may benefit others collaterally. A federal court\u2019s jurisdiction therefore can be invoked only when the plaintiff himself has suffered \u201csome threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action . . ..\u201d <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 617, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 1148, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). See <em>Data Processing Service </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 151-154, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829-830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 95 S.Ct. at 2205 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original). This constitutional minimum is sometimes described as the requirement that a plaintiff must allege \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d <em>Schiesinger v. Reservists to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208, 218, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 2930, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974); <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 152, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Beyond this \u201cminimum constitutional mandate,\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 499, 95 S.Ct. at 2205, the Supreme Court has developed, as a prudential matter of self-governance, certain \u201cother limits on the class of persons who may invoke the courts\u2019 decisional and remedial powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Precisely which categories of plaintiffs are excluded on constitutional grounds, and which on prudential grounds, however, is not always easy to ascertain. For example, in <em>Schiesinger v. Reservists to Stop the </em>War, <em>supra, </em>the Court held that a plaintiff class lacked standing, as \u201ccitizens,\u201d to challenge the Department of Defense\u2019s policy of permitting Members of Congress to hold posts in the Armed Forces Reserve on the ground that this policy violated the Incompatibility Clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court said that the Secretary\u2019s nonobservance of the Incompatibility Clause \u201cwould adversely affect only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance, and that is an abstract injury.\u201d 418 U.S. at 217, 94 S.Ct. at 2930. In addition, the Court explicitly stated that such an \u201cabstract injury\u201d does not satisfy the Article III \u201ccases or controversies\u201d requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 94 S.Ct. at 2935. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Richardson, supra, </em>418 U.S. 166, 173-78, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 2944-2947, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974), the Court said that a taxpayer\u2019s generalized grievance regarding the CIA\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional failure to issue a public Statement of Accounts and Expenditures pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7 of the Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not \u201cclear the threshold [Article III] hurdle of <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. [186,] 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 [(1962)].\u201d 418 U.S. at 178, 94 S.Ct. at 2947.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\"><em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>was decided the following term. There the Court, citing <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson, </em>included in its list of prudential limitations the rule that standing should be denied when the only \u201casserted harm is a \u2018generalized grievance\u2019 shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens.\u201d 422 U.S. at 499, 95 S.Ct. at 2205. <em>Accord, Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, </em>438 U.S. 59, 80, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since the Court in <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson </em>had explicitly grounded its holdings on Article III, the statements in <em>Warth </em>and <em>Duke Power </em>that plaintiffs who allege \u201cabstract injuries\u201d are barred as a prudential matter are perplexing. We thus admit to some confusion as to whether the \u201cabstract injury\u201d standing bar is constitutional, or instead prudential.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">One further complication adds to the complexity of our review. Until 1968 it was well established that state officials lack a sufficient personal interest in vindicating the Federal Constitution to grant them standing to challenge state statutes on constitutional grounds. <em>Columbus &amp; Green-ville Ry. v. Miller, </em>283 U.S. 96, 99-100, 51 S.Ct. 392, 393-394, 75 L.Ed. 861 (1931); <em>Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, </em>208 U.S. 192, 197-98, 28 S.Ct. 275, 276, 52 L.Ed. 450 (1908); <em>Smith v. Indiana, </em>191 U.S. 138, 148-49, 24 S.Ct. 51, 52, 48 L.Ed.2d 125 (1903); P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, &amp; H. Wechsler, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 182 (2d ed. 1973). For example, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Indiana, supra, </em>a county auditor sued the state of Indiana in state court, alleging that a state property tax statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court stated on appeal from the Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-15\">[T]he jurisdiction of this court . can only be invoked by a party having a personal interest in the litigation. It fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>lows that he cannot sue out a writ of error in behalf of third persons. . It is evident that the auditor had no personal interest in the litigation. He had certain duties as a public officer to perform. The performance of those duties was of no personal benefit to him. Their non-performance was equally so. He neither gained nor lost anything by invoking the advice of the Supreme Court as to the proper action he should take. He was testing the constitutionality of the law purely in the interest of third persons, viz., the taxpayers We think the interest of an appellant in this court should be a personal and not an official interest .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">191 U.S. at 148-49, 24 S.Ct. at 52 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In 1968, however, the Supreme Court, without mention of the <em>Smith v. Indiana, Braxton, </em>or <em>Columbus &amp; Greenville </em>cases, held in a brief footnote that members of a school board had standing to challenge a state statute which they believed to violate the Federal Constitution. <em>Board of Educ. v. Allen, </em>392 U.S. 236, 241 n. 5, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 1925, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1967). <em>Allen </em>was an appeal from a state-court j\u00fcdgment upholding the constitutionality of a statute which required school districts to provide textbooks without charge to school children in both public and private schools. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">Appellees do not challenge the standing of appellants to press their claim in this Court. Appellants have taken an oath to support the United States Constitution. Believing [the challenged statute] to be unconstitutional, they are in the position of having to choose between violating their oath and taking a step \u2014 refusal to comply with [the statute] \u2014 that would be likely to bring their expulsion from office and also a reduction in state funds for their school districts. There can be no doubt that appellants thus have a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome\u201d of this litigation. <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). <em>Id. </em>The quoted footnote comprised the extent of the Court\u2019s discussion of the standing issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">Were <em>Allen </em>the last word from the Supreme Court on standing, we could simply adopt the rationale of the quoted footnote and determine that the councilmembers in the case before us have standing on the basis that they believe that enforcing the CTRPA\u2019s ordinances would violate their oaths of office. Indeed, this is the approach taken by several of our sister circuits. <em>See Regents of the Univ. of Minn. v. NCAA, </em>560 F.2d 352, 363-64 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>434 U.S. 978, 98 S.Ct. 600, 54 L.Ed.2d 472 (1977); <em>Aguayo v. Richardson, supra, </em>473 F.2d at 1100; <em>City of New York v. Richardson, supra, </em>473 F.2d at 933. <em>Contra, Finch v. Mississippi State Medical Ass\u2019n, </em>585 F.2d 765, 773-75 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Athanson v. Grasso, </em>411 F.Supp. 1153, 1156-61 (D.Conn. 1976) (three-judge court). <em>See also Akron Bd. of Educ. v. State Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>490 F.2d at 1289-91 (granting a school board standing to challenge state districting and transfer policies which increased segregation within school board\u2019s district on any of three theories: (1) <em>jus tertii </em>representation of parents and students; (2) the board\u2019s interest in preventing loss of territory and tax dollars; (3) the board members\u2019 desires not to violate their oaths of office and to avoid exposure to civil liability.). But <em>Allen </em>was followed by <em>Schlesinger, Richardson, Warth, </em>and other cases which significantly tightened standing requirements. <em>See, e. g., O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974); <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). Neither the Second nor the Sixth Circuit has had the opportunity to reconsider the impact of <em>Allen </em>since <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson. </em>The sum of recent Supreme Court teachings indicates that the <em>Allen </em>theory of standing, which was itself an abrupt departure from settled precedent, must be carefully considered. We thus proceed to determine what <em>Allen </em>now stands for and to analyze the councilmembers\u2019 standing to bring this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">1. <em>The </em>Allen <em>Theory of Standing (by not enforcing CTRPA regulations).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Since virtually every public official is subject to severe, and generally criminal, sanctions for non-performance of official duties, and also takes an oath of office which requires him or her to uphold the Constitution, the theory announced in <em>Allen </em>would confer standing on any public official who believes that a statute which he or she is charged with enforcing is unconstitutional. Although the councilmembers here urge that they may be exposed to civil liability should they choose to enforce the CTRPA ordinances, <em>Allen </em>does not demand anything more than a forced choice between violation of the oath of office and potential expulsion from office. We begin our analysis by considering whether <em>Allen </em>can properly be considered as binding Supreme Court precedent. We conclude it cannot and therefore that the councilmembers\u2019 desire not to violate their oaths of office does not confer standing. We then discuss whether standing is supplied by the councilmembers\u2019 allegations<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> regarding potential exposure to civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The councilmembers do not seek here to represent the City\u2019s interests; if they did their claims would be barred along with the City\u2019s. Rather, the councilmembers assert that their personal dilemmas generate standing. The fundamental premise of <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson, </em>however, is that a litigant\u2019s standing cannot be based on the \u201cgeneralized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance.\u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists to Stop the War, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 217, 94 S.Ct. at 2930.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">It may be argued that a public official charged with the enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional state law does have a greater and more specific stake in the law\u2019s validity than an ordinary citizen. For example, the councilmembers here must vote whether to enforce the CTRPA ordinances. While the ordinary citizen may remain passive and silent until he or she is actually victimized by an unconstitutional law, officials charged with a law\u2019s enforcement must, on pain of criminal liability, actively execute the law\u2019s commands. It is also true that the class of public officials who might sue on an <em>Allen </em>theory is, relatively speaking, smaller than the class of all citizens. Thus, although each broadening of the courts\u2019 focus brings charges of usurpation of power by the judiciary and \u201cgovernment by injunction,\u201d 418 U.S. at 222, 94 S.Ct. at 2932, standing for these public officials threatens our legitimacy less than would general citizen standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">But the source of the public official\u2019s complaint, like that of the ordinary citizens in <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson, </em>is just abstract outrage at the enactment of an unconstitutional law. Apart from the highly speculative potential exposure to civil liability which we discuss <em>infra, </em>the councilmem-bers will lose nothing by enforcing the CTRPA\u2019s ordinances save an abstract measure of constitutional principle. No consequences, save those of conscience self-imposed by the councilmembers\u2019 personal beliefs, flow from the violation of the oath in performance of a statutory duty. <em>Compare Craig v. Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 194, 97 S.Ct. 451, 455, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976) (vendor who was obliged by challenged statute to heed statutory discrimination against selling beer to males under 21 had standing because of her direct economic injury through the constriction of her buyers\u2019 market); <em>Barrows v. Jackson, </em>346 U.S. 249, 255-56, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 1034-35, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1953) (vendor would suffer \u201cdirect, pocketbook injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Thus, the councilmembers have available a course of action which subjects them to no concrete adverse consequences \u2014 they can enforce the CTRPA ordinances. That an alternative course exists \u2014 not enforcing the statute \u2014 which might result in criminal liability does not transform the councilmem-bers\u2019 abstract disagreement with the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>lature over land use into judicially cognizable concrete injury. The criminal liability might support standing to challenge the relevant criminal statutes, perhaps on the theory that public officials should not be required to act contrary to their constitutional beliefs. But the councilmembers have not shown any concrete personal injury \u2014 criminal liability or otherwise \u2014 that results from the operation of the challenged CTRPA ordinances. The lesson of <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson </em>is that constitutional principle divorced from concrete injury may suffice to generate a spirited legislative or public debate, but will not support a federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This is not to denigrate constitutional principle, nor to urge upon public officials the violation of their consciences. But the difficulty with abstract constitutional grievances is that they lack the specificity and adversarial coloration that transmute vague notions of constitutional principle into \u201c \u2018a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists to Stop the </em>War, <em>supra, </em>418 U.S. at 218, 94 S.Ct. at 2930 (quoting <em>Flast v.

To confer standing on public officials because they wish not to enforce a statute due to private constitutional predilections, or because their decision not to enforce the statute may result in criminal liability, would convert all officials charged with executing statutes into potential litigants, or attorneys general, as to laws within their charge. <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson </em>bar the courthouse door until the victim of a law\u2019s unconstitutional enforcement \u2014 in this case most clearly the landowners\u2014 chooses to knock. We hold, therefore, that the councilmembers\u2019 interest here is \u201cofficial\u201d rather than \u201cpersonal,\u201d and therefore under the traditional rule of <em>Smith v. Indiana, supra, </em>191 U.S. 138, 24 S.Ct. 51, 48 L.Ed. 125 and the more recent prohibitions expressed in <em>Schlesinger </em>and <em>Richardson </em>of standing to assert abstract injuries, the councilmembers\u2019 claim to standing is deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">2. <em>Councilmembers\u2019 Exposure to Civil Liability (by enforcing CTRPA regulations).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Nor does the councilmembers\u2019 alleged exposure to civil liability provide a sufficiently concrete injury. In <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>the Court stated that \u201cThe standing question . . . bears close affinity to questions of ripeness \u2014 whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention . . . .\u201d 422 U.S. at 499 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. at 2205.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">It must be alleged that the plaintiff \u201chas sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury\u201d as the result of the challenged statute or official conduct. <em>Massachusetts v. Mellon, </em>262 U.S. 447, 488 [, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601, 67 L.Ed. 1078] (1923). The injury or threat of injury must be both \u201creal and immediate,\u201d not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u201d <em>Golden v.

Littleton, supra, </em>414 U.S. at 494, 94 S.Ct. at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The exposure to civil liability which the councilmembers contend would be caused by their enforcement of the CTRPA ordinances is wholly speculative. In <em>O\u2019Shea, </em>the plaintiff class claimed that a judge and county magistrate were systematically violating black citizens\u2019 civil rights by discriminatory sentencing, setting of bond, and requiring payment for jury trials. The Court declined to grant an injunction against such activities, emphasizing that only <em>\u201cif </em>[the plaintiffs] proceed to violate an unchallenged law and <em>if </em>they are charged, held to answer, and tried in any proceedings before [the judge and magistrate],\u201d 414 U.S. at 497, 94 S.Ct. at 676 (emphasis in original), would the plaintiffs\u2019 injury materialize. The multiple contingencies precluded standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Similar multiple contingencies are present here. No lawsuit is currently threatened. The facts of this case are unlike <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974), in which the Court granted standing to seek declaratory relief to a plaintiff who was threatened on two occasions with criminal prosecution if he persisted in passing out handbills at a shopping center. In <em>Steffel </em>the plaintiff\u2019s companion at each of three previous efforts to pass out handbills at the shopping center had already been arrested and prosecuted. In the instant case there is no immediate threat of suit nor reason to believe suit is inevitable. Moreover, the exposure in <em>Steffel </em>was to a criminal statute; enforcement of the statute here would expose councilmembers only to potential civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Further, it is by no means clear that an official who personally believes a statute to be unconstitutional, but enforces it anyway, is civilly liable solely on the strength of his subjective concerns. Under California law, public officials who act under the apparent authority of an enactment that is unconstitutional are not civilly liable if they acted \u201cin good faith, without malice.\u201d Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 820.6 (West 1966). Similarly, a public official is not liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for actions taken under the authority of unconstitutional statutes unless he \u201c \u2018knew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of [the plaintiff], or if he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury to [the plaintiff].\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Donaldson, </em>422 U.S. 563, 577, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2494, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975) (quoting <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 322, 95 S.Ct. 992, 1000, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975)). <em>See also Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 247-48, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1691-92, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974). Moreover, an official \u201chas no duty to anticipate unforeseeable constitutional developments.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Donaldson, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 577, 95 S.Ct. at 2494; <em>see Wood v. Strickland, supra, </em>420 U.S. at 322, 95 S.Ct. at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">This case, in which no California or section 1983 claim is present, would be a particularly poor record upon which to decide the difficult question whether an official who believes a statute to be unconstitutional can, for immunity purposes, be deemed nonetheless to act in good faith. The ripeness doctrine, particularly as it affects the standing question, <em>see O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, supra, </em>414 U.S. at 494, 94 S.Ct. at 675, is designed primarily to avoid such conjecture. It is sufficient to point out the numerous contingencies which might prevent the councilmembers from ever being actually threatened with civil liability. We decide, therefore, that the threat of civil liability is too attenuated and conjectural to supply the councilmembers with a basis for standing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Neither the City\u2019s nor the councilmem-bers\u2019 claims supply a sufficient basis for standing to bring this action. Whether the abstract, generalized nature of the council-members\u2019 claims is considered a constitutional, or instead a prudential disability, their claims do not support federal-court jurisdiction. The action should therefore have been dismissed for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\">.

The Court has made it clear, in <em>Richardson, Schlesinger, </em>and <em>Warth, </em>that generalized grievances are insufficient to confer <em>standing </em>to sue. A second cases or controversy requirement, which is different from but often associated with standing, is that a case be <em>justiciable. </em>While standing \u201cfocuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court,\u201d justiciability involves \u201cthe issues he wishes to have adjudicated.\u201d <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), <em>quoting Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 99, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The question whether the councilmembers have brought us a case or controversy is a matter of standing rather than justiciability. The deficiency in the instant action lies not in the nature of the issues: the issue whether the CTRPA ordinances violate the constitution is of a traditionally justiciable sort. The problem, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>is that the councilmembers\u2019 interest in these justiciable issues is too abstract; thus, they are the wrong litigants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"aqb-dedup-0\">. A third standing limitation, the so-called \u201cnexus\u201d requirement announced in <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), is also a subject of some controversy in the Article III/prudential category debate. <em>See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, </em>438 U.S. 59, 79 n. 25, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2633, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978); <em>United States v.

In <em>Fiast, </em>the Court stated that to demonstrate standing a plaintiff must allege a \u201cnexus between the status asserted by the litigant and the claim he presents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1953. The \u201cnexus\u201d requirement has not been completely interred, <em>see Schlesinger v.

It is thus clearly inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. The facts which demonstrate a plaintiffs standing must be alleged in the complaint. <em>See Jenkins v.

In considering these allegations \u201c[f]or purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing, both the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\u201d <em>Warth v.

The City and the councilmembers also argue that they are closely identified with and entitled to represent the interests of landowners and other persons not parties to this action whose constitutional rights are violated by the CTRPA\u2019s regulations. Standing to raise constitutional rights of third parties is available only where the litigant\u2019s own injury is \u201cconcrete and particularized.\u201d Duke <em>Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, supra, </em>438 U.S. at 81, 98 S.Ct. at 2634. Because the councilmem-bers\u2019 personal grievance is \u201cabstract,\u201d the councilmembers\u2019 own injury fails this test. The City is absolutely barred by the rule in <em>Williams v.
