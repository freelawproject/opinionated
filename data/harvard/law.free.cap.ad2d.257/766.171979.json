After defendant was arrested on September 29, 1996 on new drug charges he was subsequently charged with and, following a hearing, found guilty of violating the terms of his probation. As a result, County Court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to a prison term of <em>4 </em>to 12 years. Notably, at the hearing, defendant admitted, <em>inter alia, </em>that he drank alcohol and possessed marihuana on the date of his arrest. Considering defendant\u2019s prior drug-related conviction and his admission to violating the terms of his probation, and there being no extraordinary circumstances warranting our intervention, we find the sentence, which was within the statutory parameters, neither harsh nor excessive (see, <em>People v Dalton, </em>247 AD2d 656).</p><p id=\"b821-4\">Cardona, P. J., Mikoll, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
