When claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>ant began working as a part-time letter carrier, he was placed on 90 days\u2019 probation with the condition that he maintain a valid driver\u2019s license. Claimant was subsequently discharged when he was arrested for driving while intoxicated during the probationary period and his driver\u2019s license was suspended, rendering him unable to fulfill his employment duties. Since claimant engaged in a voluntary act which violated a reasonable condition of his employment, we decline to disturb the Board\u2019s decision that claimant\u2019s behavior constituted disqualifying misconduct <em>(see, Matter of Ladner [City of New </em>York\u2014 <em>Commissioner of Labor], </em>254 AD2d 563). We have reviewed claimant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be lacking in merit.</p><p id=\"b834-3\">Cardona, P. J., Mikoll, Mercure, Crew III and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
