New York City Department of Transportation, Respondent; Commissioner of Labor, Respondent.</parties>\n<citation id=\"Ap_1\">[683 NYS2d 350]</citation>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"AiQW\">\u2014Appeal from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed September 30, 1997, which denied claimant\u2019s application to reopen a previous decision ruling that he was disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits because he was suspended from his employment without pay due to misconduct.</p><p id=\"b815-7\">Claimant signed a stipulation admitting to violating the employer\u2019s code of conduct and agreeing to a penalty of, <em>inter alia, </em>30 days\u2019 suspension without pay. By decision dated February 26, 1997, the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board ruled that claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits during the 30-day period because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>suspension was due to misconduct. The Board denied claimant\u2019s application to reopen and reconsider the February 26, 1997 decision, prompting this appeal by claimant. We affirm. Initially, our review of the record discloses no abuse of the Board\u2019s discretion in denying claimant\u2019s application for reconsideration of its prior decision <em>(see, Matter of Higgins [Hudacs], </em>201 AD2d 810). In any event, we find substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusions that claimant voluntarily admitted to a knowing violation of the employer\u2019s code of conduct and that he was therefore guilty of disqualifying misconduct <em>(see, Matter of Carr [Commissioner of Labor], </em>253 AD2d 931; <em>Matter ofOlan [Ross], </em>60 AD2d 113, 116).</p><p id=\"b816-3\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Peters, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
