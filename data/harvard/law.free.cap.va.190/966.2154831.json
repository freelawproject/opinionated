The defendant asserts here that the judgment was erroneous because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence, because of improper argument by plaintiff\u2019s counsel and because of erroneous rulings on instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">The plaintiff was discharged in September, 1946. He began working for the defendant or its predecessor in 1900, became an engineer in 1917 and had served continuously until his discharge, except for a period of about two years when he was unable to work because of injuries received in a collision. His contract of employment as an engineer contained these provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-12\">\u201c(a) Engineers will not be disciplined or dismissed from the service without a just cause. They will be given a hearing within five days if removed from service pending investigation and may hear the evidence submitted. They will be promptly notified in writing of the action taken against them, and should the charge be unfounded, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>will be paid for the time lost. Disciplinary action must be taken within thirty days after investigation or none will be applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">The issue submitted to the jury was whether the defendant had just cause for discharging the plaintiff. The defendant claimed it did because the plaintiff had cursed his flagman and had run his engine, with some cars attached, up and down a sidetrack at Greenville, North Carolina, one of its railroad stations, four or five times in a fit of temper without signals or contrary to signals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">The fireman, the flagman and the conductor on the train plaintiff was operating, together with a supervisory agent of the defendant and the agent of the express company at Greenville, all testified for the defendant, in substance, that Harris was guilty of the conduct charged against him and had in fact operated his train as alleged, in spite of the fact that the only signals given him were to back up, and that he had finally backed into the bumper at the end of the track, doing some slight damage in the express car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Harris denied that the incident happened that way. His version was that he backed his train in the usual way, stopped close to the bumper, and waited there 30 minutes or more while mail and express were being unloaded. During that period he ate his lunch and about the time he got through he heard a voice on the opposite, or fireman\u2019s, side of the train, from which the unloading was being done, saying, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d His flagman had gone ahead to the street crossing, which a company rule and a city ordinance required to be guarded. Harris moved forward a distance of two or three cars and as he approached the crossing his flagman gave him a \u201cwild wash-out signal\u201d and pointed back. Harris looked back and the conductor was giving him a back-up signal. He backed up and stopped. The conductor again signaled him back. Knowing he was close to the bumper, which he could see by leaning out of his window, Harris stopped again. The conductor continued to signal him back and Harris tried to direct his attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>to the car being close to the end of the track. He gave his engine steam, backed up in accordance with the signal and struck the bumper, but did no damage. Thereupon the car was cut off, his train was coupled up and he pulled away without knowing that anything out of the ordinary had happened. He said he probably did apply to his flagman the epithet testified to by defendant\u2019s witnesses, when the former gave him the wash-out signal, but claimed that' was ordinary railroad language and that nobody was mad so far as he.knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">The jury accepted the plaintiff\u2019s version and found that the defendant had no just cause to discharge him for that episode. That issue was for the jury under the evidence. The incident happened either as plaintiff said it did or as defendant\u2019s witnesses said it did. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence was not incredible and it was for the jury to decide whom they would believe. We cannot set aside their verdict because the greater number of witnesses testified in support of defendant\u2019s version. There were some contradictions among defendant\u2019s witnesses upon material points and at least two of them had made prior inconsistent statements which supported plaintiff\u2019s version.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">It is the duty of this court to set aside a verdict that is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code, 1950, section 8-491; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>178 Va. 172, 180, 16 S. E. (2d) 370, 373, 136 A. L. R. 1251. But where the conclusion depends on the weight to be given credible testimony, the verdict cannot be disturbed by this court or by the trial court. <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>183 Va. 56, 31 S. E. (2d) 265; <em>Edgerton </em>v. <em>Norfolk Southern Bus Corp., </em>187 Va. 642, 651, 47 S. E. (2d) 409, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Defendant insists that the verdict should be set aside because of improper and prejudicial argument by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. In his opening argument plaintiff\u2019s counsel said this (referring to the investigation of the incident by a company official hereafter mentioned): \u201cWe have read to you from the cross-examination of this colored fireman a dire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>threat as plain as could, that if he did not say what his superiors wanted him to say he had better look out for his job.\u201d Defendant objected and moved for a mistrial on the ground that this was arguing that defendant was putting pressure on the witnesses to make them testify as they had done. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then read the evidence on which his argument was based and said the jury could put their own interpretation upon it. Defendant\u2019s counsel said, \u201cThe jury can draw their own inferences.\u201d The court then told the jury that \u201cthey may construe the words in any of the evidence in their common accepted meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">In his closing argument plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cThe only witness in this case who has any pretense of not being under the absolute dominion of the Norfolk Southern Railway is this express agent. * <em>* </em>As to the rest of them, all their jobs were dependent upon the Norfolk Southern. * <em>* </em>The facts speak for themselves. Two of the witnesses have changed their stories, and the Norfolk Southern is the dominant factor because it is the employer of these men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6H\">Defendant objected and moved for a mistrial. The court refused to grant a mistrial, but gave the jury this instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3e\">\u201cGentlemen of the jury, a few minutes ago counsel for the plaintiff used in his argument these words, that all the witnesses who testified in this case, save and except one, were under the absolute dominion of the Norfolk Southern, the defendant. The Court instructs you to disregard that statement. There is no evidence to the effect that any of the witnesses are under the dominion of any person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">In <em>Norfolk, etc., R. Co. </em>v. <em>Eley, </em>152 Va. 773, 148 S. E. 678, relied on by defendant, there was a reversal because plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his closing argument had said that nobody had ever heard an engineer or fireman admit that he failed to blow for a crossing; that \u201chis family and his meat and bread are dependent on it. He works for the railroad company, and the minute he comes in and says that he fails in that duty and subjects the railroad to damages: \u2018You are suspended, Mr. Engineer.\u2019 \u201d 152 Va. at p. 776, 148 S. E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>at p. 678. The statement was excepted to because there was no evidence in the record that such had happened, to which the court replied that there was no evidence- of it but counsel was within his rights in making the argument. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">It was held that the remarks were prejudicial; that there was no evidence that defendant\u2019s witnesses were influenced in any way by the hope of retaining their positions; that it was impossible to measure the harmful effect upon the jury of the statement, \u201cnot as a matter of opinion but as a matter of fact, that the \u2018bread and meat\u2019 of the witness and of his family were dependent upon the giving of false testimony,\u201d particularly when the court had given its approval to that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">There are facts in the case in judgment that distinguish it from the <em>Eley Case </em>and prevent the result that followed there. Here the incident that preceded plaintiff\u2019s discharge happened on September 25, 1946. Three days later there was an investigation before an official of the defendant- at Raleigh, at which both the fireman and the flagman testified admittedly in direct conflict with their testimony on this trial. At the Raleigh hearing Wilbert Adams, the fireman; was being questioned by the official. Apparently his answers were not satisfactory and the official said: \u201cI don\u2019t care what you could see. I want to know what moves Engineer Harris made after he first went in on No. 2 track with cars.\u201d The fireman replied that he went back a certain distance and stopped, then pulled ahead a certain distance and stopped. The official asked him whether he had ever moved backwards and forwards on that track four or five or six times. He said no. The official said: \u201cThen that was a very unusual movement on the part of Engineer Harris?\u2019-\u2019 Adams replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say because sometimes in spotting cars we have trouble and make 2 or 3 attempts to spot the cars. That\u2019s what I thought they were doing.\u201d Thereupon the company official said: \u25a0:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-8\">\u201cWilbert, this investigation is not in connection with any-negligence on your part. However, I\u2019m compelled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>say that you were very dilatory and negligent in performing the duties of locomotive fireman that you didn\u2019t pay any more attention to the unusual movements that were made at Greenville by No. 2 on September 25.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">On the trial in the court below plaintiff\u2019s counsel read these proceedings to the fireman, and then inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-5\">\u201cQ. You knew what he was talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-6\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-7\">*\u2018Q. You would be the next one that the axe would hit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7E\">\u201cA. Going backwards and forwards is not an unusual movement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-8\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m talking about that hint to you, what would happen to if didn\u2019t tell the right kind of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-9\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t tell the truth in the investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ath\">Asked why he did not tell the truth, his explanation was that \u201cif one railroad man get in trouble and goes before the Superintendent, you try to hold him up there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">Mallory, the flagman, who had stated at the Raleigh hearing that Harris did not curse him and he did not curse Harris, was asked whether he was swearing the truth in court or at the time he made his conflicting statements in Raleigh. He answered: \u201cI was telling practically, what railroad men tell when they want to work together.\u201d He asserted that he was not afraid of anyone, and then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-12\">\u201cQ. I didn\u2019t say you were afraid of anyone. I say you felt free to lie before your superior officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-13\">\u201cA. No. A railroad can run you off their property at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-14\">Here, unlike the <em>Eley </em>Case, plaintiff\u2019s counsel pointed to the record and argued to the jury that there was a threat to the fireman in the investigation at Raleigh, not as a matter of fact but as a matter of opinion; and the court told the jury that it was for them to construe the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-15\">Two at least of defendant\u2019s employees gave testimony on the trial different from their statements soon after the incident. Their explanation was that they testified falsely at Raleigh out of a sense of loyalty to Harris. Harris\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>had a right to argue that they were employees of the defendant and that, as an inference from their testimony, they were now testifying falsely out of a sense of loyalty or duty to the railroad company or with an eye to their own advantage. <em>Cf. Burr </em>v. <em>Virginia Ry., etc., Co., </em>151 Va. 934, 951, 145 S. E. 833, 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel had no right, however, to argue that all of defendant\u2019s witnesses except the express agent were under the absolute dominion of defendant. There was no sufficient basis in the evidence to support that argument. There was enough, we think, to prevent its being classified as a gratuitous and indefensible effort to influence the jury to decide the case on feelings rather than facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Incidents occur where the harm done by improper argument cannot be remedied by instruction, and mistrials should then be granted or verdicts thereby obtained should be set aside. But such cases are the exception and usually it is a matter for.the exercise of a sound discretion by the trial court whose ruling should not be disturbed unless there is a manifest probability that the complaining party has been substantially prejudiced. <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>133 Va. 441, 454, 113 S. E. 893, 898-9; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 398, 401, 43 S. E. (2d) 45, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">We think such probability does not appear in this case and that the court\u2019s instruction was an adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence established that his discharge resulted in a loss to him of $400 a month for 14 months, or $5,600, which was the amount of the verdict. Defendant does not controvert this, but takes the position that plaintiff was not entitled to recover anything, or at most only nominal damages, because he was not employed for any particular time or term; that he could terminate the employment at will, and defendant had the same right. Rejection of this theory by the court in giving instructions for plaintiff and refusing instructions for defendant is the subject of another assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\"> By the contract the defendant agreed that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>not dismiss the plaintiff from service without a just cause. Defendant\u2019s theory amounts to an assertion that it could violate that agreement without penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">\u25a0 It is settled doctrine in this State that where no specific time is fixed for the duration of an employment, there is a rebuttable presumption that it is an employment at will, terminable at any time by either party. <em>Hoffman Co. </em>v. <em>Pelouze, </em>158 Va. 586, 594, 164 S. E. 397, 399; <em>Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>158 Va. 713, 718, 164 S. E. 387, 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">. Here, however, a definite time was fixed for the duration of the employment. It was, by the terms of the contract, to continue until the plaintiff gave to the defendant just cause to end it. The result of being discharged after long years of service in a particular occupation can well be serious. The defendant\u2019s agreement that it would not discharge plaintiff without just cause was a thing of value to him, a safeguard against the loss and embarrassment to be expected from an arbitrary discharge. The defendant\u2019s agreement that it would not be done was a term of plaintiff\u2019s employment, compensation for his work which he had earned along with his wages. The defendant ought not to take that promised reward from him without incurring a penalty for violating its agreement. It was a promise in return for services which the plaintiff performed and which furnished sufficient consideration for a binding contract. In such case the doctrine of mutuality is inapplicable. 12 Am. Jur., Contracts, section 14, p. 512. <em>Cf. Kiser </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers, </em>169 Va. 574, at p. 585, 194 S. E. 727, at p. 731, 114 A. L. R. 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">In <em>Kirkley </em>v. <em>Roberts Co., </em>268 Mass. 246, 167 N. E. 289, the plaintiff was employed as a sales agent \u201cas long as he shall faithfully and diligently perform the duties of his employment.\u201d There was no promise on the agent\u2019s part to remain with the company for any definite time. The court said: \u201cThis does not invalidate the contract, nor, of itself, make it terminable at the will of the company,\u201d and that the contract was binding upon the- company \u201cso long as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>agent faithfully and diligently performs and is willing and able to perform the prescribed duties at the compensation fixed.\u201d 167 N. E. at p. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">In <em>Seifert </em>v. <em>Arnold Bros., </em>138 Cal. App. 324, 31 P. (2d) 1059, the employment was \u201cto be steady as long as your services are satisfactory.\u201d It was held that \u201cthe contract ~was subject to termination on the happening of a contingency, that is, the contingency of dissatisfaction, and the courts and text-writers have held such to be for a definite length of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">To the same effect see <em>Gary </em>v. <em>Central of Georgia Ry. Co., </em>37 Ga. App. 744, 141 S. E. 819; <em>Mansell </em>v. <em>Texas, etc., R. Co., </em>135 Tex. 31, 137 S. W. (2d) 997; Labatt, Master and Servant, 2 ed., section 178, p. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">In Instruction P-2, given for the plaintiff, the jury were told that upon the plaintiff\u2019s proving his contract of employment and his discharge, it was then incumbent on defendant to \u201cproduce satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge was justified in fact.\u201d Defendant asserts that the instruction was erroneous, first, because the production of \u25a0\u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d involves a much greater burden than the production of a \u201cpreponderance of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">In <em>United Dentists </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. 347, 357, 173 S. E. 508, 511, instructions were offered stating that the burden was on the plaintiff \u201cto satisfy the jury.\u201d It was held not error to refuse them, because they were too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"AKu\">An instruction identical with P-2 was approved in <em>Rudlin </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>186 Va. 647, 652, 43 S. E. (2d) 918, 920, but on the ground that the defendant there had the burden of proving his defense by clear and satisfactory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">In <em>Shiflett </em>v. <em>Virginia Ry., etc., Co., </em>136 Va. 72, 83, 116 S. E. 500, 504, an instruction had been given stating that the plaintiff must prove negligence \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence and to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d It was held that the latter clause, while not approved, was harmless, on the reasoning that it could hardly be understood as intending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>to increase the burden of proof. See also, <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Virginia Ry., etc., Co., </em>138 Va. 310, 329, 122 S. E. 104, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">There is less reason here than in the two cases last cited for supposing that the term \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d as used in Instruction P-2 would be construed as creating a heavier burden than the usual and technically correct phrase \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">We see no substance in the second criticism, <em>i. e., </em>that the words \u201cjustified in fact\u201d left it to the jury instead of the court to say what was sufficient ground for discharge. The court told the jury in plain words that if the plaintiff ran' his train up and down the track as defendant alleged, he was properly discharged. The quoted words meant no more than that the defendant must produce facts to establish the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\"> There was no error in refusing defendant's Instructions 7-D and 10-D. The first was to the effect that number of witnesses was important as relating to preponderance of evidence, and the second stated that there was no evidence of malice. They were neither necessary nor appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">We find no reversible error and the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
