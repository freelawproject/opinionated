Upon a plea of not guilty he was convicted by a jury and his punishment fixed at two years in the penitentiary. To review the judgment entered on the verdict the present writ has been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">On Saturday afternoon, October 23, 1948, Smith telephoned A. M. Rubinstein, at the latter\u2019s home in the city of Norfolk, relative to purchasing a check-writing machine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Although Rubinstein\u2019s place of business, the Norfolk Office Equipment Company, was closed for the day, he agreed to meet' Smith at the store for the purpose of making the sale. During the telephone conversation Rubinstein\u2019s suspicions of Smith\u2019s intentions had been aroused. He notified the police department of his engagement with Smith and a detective was sent to Rubinstein\u2019s office and was there when the sale was consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Immediately after the sale was made and the check-writing machine delivered to Smith, he was arrested. He had in his possession thirty-nine blank checks, serially numbered, bearing the printed name of \u201cWestbrook Elevator Mfg. Co., Danville, Virginia,\u201d and directed to the First National Bank of that city. Some of the checks bore what purported to be the authorized signature of an official of the Westbrook Company. Each of the checks was incomplete as to the date, amount, and name of payee. These blank checks were not the <em>bona fide </em>checks of the Westbrook Company, and the purported signature was in fact a forgery. Pertinent to his unlawful intent, the Commonwealth proved that on the previous day Smith had cashed in Petersburg a forged check of the Westbrook Company for $73.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The check-writing machine was such as is commonly employed to impress on and into the face of a check the amount thereof, for example, \u201cExactly Ninety Dollars Twenty Cents\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Code, sec. 4488, reads thus: <em>\u201cMaking or having in possession anything designed for forging any </em>writing; <em>how punished\u2014 </em>If any person engrave, stamp, or cast, or otherwise make or mend, any plate, block, press, or other thing, adapted and designed\u2019 for the forging and false making of any writing or other thing, the forging or false making whereof is punishable by this chapter;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or if such person have in possession any such plate, block, press, or other thing, with intent to use, or cause or permit it to be used, in forging or false mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ing any such writing or other thing, he shall be confined in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The sole assignment of error is that the lower court should have set aside the verdict on the ground that it was contrary to the law and the evidence and without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The evidence which we have recited is sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the accused had the machine in his possession \u201cwith intent to use, or cause or permit it to be used,\u201d in writing or filling in the amounts of the checks. Such writing or filling in, with evil intent, would, of course, constitute a material step in the act of \u201cforging or false making\u201d of such an instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">But it is earnestly contended that proof of such evil intent is not sufficient to sustain the conviction here, because, it is said, a check-writing machine, such as the plaintiff in error had in his possession at the time of his arrest, is not within the condemnation of the statute, in that it is not <em>\u201cadapted and designed </em>for the forging and false making of any writing\u201d (italics supplied) but on the contrary is \u201cadapted and designed\u201d for a legitimate purpose or use.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">We cannot agree with this narrow interpretation of the statute. The section covers and provides punishment for two offenses in the alternative: (1) The maldng or mending of \u201cany plate, block, press, or other thing, adapted and designed for the forging and false making of any writing,\u201d which is \u201cpunishable by this chapter\u201d of the Code; or (2) the possession of \u201cany such plate, block, press, or other thing, with intent to use, or cause or permit it to be used, in forging or false making any such writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Plainly, \u201cany such plate, block, press, or other thing,\u201d the possession of which is condemned by the second portion of the section, is such a device or instrumentality the making or mending of which is condemned by the first portion\u2014 that is, such as is \u201cadapted and designed for the forging and false making of any writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The crux of the case, then, is whether the check-writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>machine in question is \u201cadapted and designed for the forging and false making of any writing\u201d within the meaning of the section. We think it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201cAdapted\u201d means \u201ccapable of being used; fit or suitable.\u201d 1 C. J. S., p. 1452. \u201cDesigned\u201d means \u201cappropriate, fit, prepared, or suitable; also adapted, designated, or intended.\u201d 26 C. J. S., p. 1238. Sometimes when an instrumentality is spoken of as being \u201cdesigned,\u201d reference is had to the purpose for which it was planned or constructed. 26 C. J. S., p. 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Manifestly, the machine with which we are concerned was \u201cadapted\u201d for completing or carrying out the forgery of the checks which the accused had in his possession. Moreover, as has been pointed out, the evidence was sufficient to warrant the finding that it was \u201cdesigned\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cintended\u201d\u2014to be used by the accused for that purpose. It was thus established by the evidence to have been both \u201cadapted and designed\u201d by the accused for the unlawful purpose which is condemned in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> The plaintiff in error argues that in order for him to be convicted of the unlawful possession of the machine, it must be of such character that one who makes or mends it is punishable under the first portion of the section. Undoubtedly, we think, one who makes or mends the machine is punishable if the evidence shows that this was done with the design, purpose or intent that it be used for forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">But proof of such evil intent on the part of one who makes or mends the machine is not necessary to sustain a conviction of unlawful possession of the instrumentality in the hands of another. What the statute condemns is either the making or mending or the possession of the instrumentality for an evil or unlawful.purpose. It is immaterial, then, to say that it was originally planned, constructed and intended to be used for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">A similar interpretation has been placed by the courts on statutes prescribing punishment for the possession of burglars\u2019 tools with criminal intent. The great weight of authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>is to the effect that it is not necessary that such tools or implements be originally constructed or intended for an unlawful use. \u201cIf they are suitable for the purpose of breaking and entering burglariously, it is wholly immaterial that they were also designed and adapted for honest and lawful uses.\u201d 9 Am. Jur., Burglary, sec. 86, p. 282. See also, 12 C. J. S., Burglary, sec. 69, p. 754; Anno., 103 A. L. R. 1322, collecting numerous cases on the subject. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hefflin, </em>338 Mo. 236, 89 S. W. (2d) 938, 103 A. L. R. 1301, a conviction for possession wjth unlawful intent of a crowbar or jimmy was sustained. There the statute provided that: \u201cAny person who makes, mends, designs or sets up, or who has in his custody or concealed about his person any tool, # # <em>* </em>instrument, or other mechanical device, whatsoever, adapted, designed, or commonly used for breaking into any vault, safe, * <em>* </em>* shall be guilty of a felony, # # <em>*\u25a0\u00bb </em>jn tpe course 0f the opinion the court said (89 S. W. (2d), p. 944):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201c* * * Appellant\u2019s theory seems to be that in order to come within the statute such tools must be especially, if not exclusively, designed for use by burglars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cThe overwhelming weight of authority is against appellant\u2019s contention. A leading case on the subject is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tivnon, </em>8 Gray (74 Mass.) 375, 380, 69 Am. Dec. 248, 251, where it was said: \u2018Nor do we think it necessary, in order to create'the offence which the statute is designed to punish, that it should appear that the tools or implements were originally made or intended for an unlawful use. If they are suitable for the purpose, so that they can be used to break and enter burglariously, it is wholly immaterial that they were also designed and adapted for honest and lawful uses. * * *\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">It will be observed that in that case the statute, like the one before us, condemns both the person who \u201cmakes, mends, designs or sets up\u201d the tool, instrument, or device, and one who has it in his possession, with evil intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In <em>Prather </em>v. <em>State, </em>191 Ark. 903, 908, 88 S. W. (2d) 851, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>a conviction of unlawful possession of burglars\u2019 tools under a similar statute and on like reasoning was sustained. See also, <em>People v. </em>Morgan, 59 Hun 619, 13 N. Y. S. 448, 35 N. Y. St. Rep. 643; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>141 Wash. 638, 251 P. 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As was pertinently said in <em>State </em>v. <em>Widenski, </em>50 R. I. 148, 146 A. 407, 408: \u201cIf the tools were originally intended for an innocent purpose, intent becomes the important element in an indictment\u201d for violation of a statute prohibiting the possession of burglars\u2019 tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The same reasoning applies to the interpretation of the statute now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorrington, </em>221 Mich. 571, 191 N. W. 831, relied on by the plaintiff in error, a conviction of unlawful possession of burglars\u2019 tools was reversed on the ground that there was no showing of unlawful intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">It is beside the point, too, to say that the statute is of long standing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that at the time of its enactment a machine of this character was unknown. It is an elementary rule of statutory construction that, \u201cThe language of a statute may be so broad, and its object so general, as to reach conditions not coming into existence until a long time after its enactment.\u201d 50 Am. Jur., Statutes, sec. 237, p. 225. See also, <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>183 Va. 931, 950, 33 S. E. (2d) 795, 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">It is further argued that the conviction of the plaintiff in error cannot stand, because, it is said, the statute condemns the possession of the instrumentality in the hands only of \u201csuch person\u201d who has engraved, stamped, cast, or otherwise made or mended it, and that there is no showing that he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">There is no merit in this contention. To adopt this interpretation would destroy or make meaningless the second portion of the section. If the statute was designed to punish only the person who made or mended the instrumentality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>there would be no point in providing a like punishment for possession of it by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In our opinion, \u201csuch person\u201d in the second portion of the section refers to \u201cany person\u201d in the first portion thereof. This view is confirmed by an examination of the history of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In the Code of 1849, ch. 193, p. 733, sec. 4, this section read: \u201cIf a <em>pee </em>person engrave, stamp or cast, * * <em>*, </em>or.if <em>such </em>person have in his possession * * * .\u201d (Italics supplied.) The language is the same in the Code of 1860, ch. 193, p. 797, sec. 4. Thus, \u201csuch person\u201d in the second portion of the section referred to \u201ca free person\u201d as written in the first portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In the Code of 1873, ch. 189, p. 1200, sec. 4, the words \u201ca free person\u201d were changed to read, \u201ca person.\u201d In the Code of 1887, sec. 3736, \u201ca person\u201d was changed to the present reading, \u201cany person.\u201d Consequently, \u201csuch person\u201d in the second portion of the section now refers to \u201cany person\u201d in the same manner in which it previously referred to \u201ca free person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The judgment complained of is</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> The forging of a check is punishable under Code, section 4489, as amended, which is found in the same chapter as section 4488.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-12\"> See Code of 1849, ch. 193, p. 733, section 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
