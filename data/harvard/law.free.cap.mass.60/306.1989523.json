That the respondents were not required by public necessity, policy, or expediency, to lay out the road in question, as they had done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">2d. That having laid out the road, and awarded damages in favor of the owners of the land taken, including the owners of the sheds, they afterwards increased the damages payable to the latter, upon a petition to discontinue the highway, which they had no jurisdiction to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">3d. That by submitting the matter to a jury, the interests of the petitioners would be hazarded, without affording them any effectual remedy.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-9\"><em>H. E. </em>Smith, for the petitioners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3I\">cited <em>West Boston Bridge </em>v. Middlesex, 10 Pick. 270; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West Boston </em>Bridge, 13 Pick. 195.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-10\"><em>J. H. Clifford </em>and <em>J. H. </em>Loud, for the respondents,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adu\">cited <em>Ex parte </em>Weston, 11 Mass. 417; <em>Brown </em>v.

But as it does not appear that they have yet suffered, or that they hereafter must suffer, any injustice, the irregularity of the commissioners\u2019 proceedings is not a sufficient reason for issuing a process to quash them. For aught that appears, these owners of sheds are satisfied with the amount last awarded to them as damages, and can obtain that amount. <em>Petition dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
