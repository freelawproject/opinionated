A life insurance company doing business under the act of April 16, 1867 (S. &amp; S. 218), purchased the assets of another company doing business under the same act, and, in consideration thereof, agreed to assume its risks and to pay its debts. Among the assets was the promissory note of the defendant (plaintiff in error), which was indorsed by the selling to the purchasing company: Held, 1. That, in an action on the note by the purchasing company, it will be presumed, in the absence of any averment to the contrary, that the agreement between the companies has been performed, or at least that it has not been abandoned. 2. That, where the validity of the note is admitted, the fact that the agreement between the companies is unauthorized by their charters is not a defense to the maker of the note. 3. Where there appears to be no connection between the taking of stock by the defendant in the selling company and the giving of the note, the fact of his being such stockholder will not affect a recovery on the note, in the absence of any showing that the transfer of the note was to his injury or prejudice as a stockholder.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-9\">, Error to the Superior Court of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-10\">The original action ivas brought by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error, on a promissory note.

We base this claim on two distinct grounds. Eirst, that part of the consideration of the contract was the acquisition by the Union Central, and the conveyance by the Home Mutual, of certain real estate in the face of an express prohibition in the charters of both of them, forbidding them \u201c to purchase, hold, or convey \u201d such real estate ; and that this partial illegality makes the whole consideration, and therefore the whole contract <em>ultra vires, </em>illegal, and void. Second, that it was a contract for the amalgamation of the two companies, and therefore <em>ultra vires, </em>illegal, and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-7\">As to the first ground, see Swan &amp; Sayler, 220, \u00a7 338 <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Swayne, </em>8 Ohio, 257 ; <em>Widoe </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>20 Ohio St. 431; <em>Raguet </em>v. <em>Roll, </em>7 Ohio, 77 ; 13 Ohio, 1; <em>White </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>3 Cush. 494, 495 ; <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>3 Comst. 27; <em>Aubert </em>v. <em>Maze, </em>2 B. &amp; P. 374, 375 ; <em>Benzley </em>v. <em>Bignold, </em>5 B. &amp; A. 341; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Blantern, </em>2 Wils. 351; <em>State </em>v. <em>Finlay, </em>10 Ohio, 51; <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Dover, etc., R\u2019y, </em>18 Q.

But we say that the question, whether or not the state is the <em>only </em>one to interfere depends, first, on the question of estoppel, where the-act complained of is merely in excess of corporate power expressly given, but not expressly or impliedly prohibited; and, second, where the act complained of is expressly or impliedly prohibited (that is, illegal, and therefore no question of estoppel can ever arise. See <em>Meddil </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>16 Ohio St. 599) on the rule of <em>par delictum. </em>The state can <em>always </em>punish a corporation for an unauthorized act. Hence,, the state\u2019s right to interfere can not in any way depend on the question, whether or not any one else has a right to interfere for the same act. Where the corporation\u2019s contract is do a thing \u201c merely in excess of power \u201d (and by this we-mean one of those intermediate class of acts before described, acts not expressly or impliedly prohibited, though not expressly authorized), so long as it is executory on both sides,, either party can refuse to go on and set up the fact of excess of power. There is no estoppel, and hence the state is here not the only one to interfere. If such a contract is executed on either side, an estoppel arises against the-other side, preventing its setting up the excess of power, and hence here the state is the only one to interfere.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">This principle can be illustrated by taking a few of the cases cited by our opponents, as well as any others. Eor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>instance, <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>24 Ohio St. 24; 101 Mass. 400 ; 17 Wis. 372; 3 Nevada, 385 ; 22 Cal. 398; 6 S. &amp; M. 179 ; 12 Wall. 358; 55 Mo. 218; 14 N. J. Eq. 13.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\">For the proposition that the maker of a note, on being sued by the holder, can show, as a bar to a recovery, that the holder holds it simply by virtue of a contract void for statutory illegality, we cite: <em>Sproule </em>v. <em>Merril, </em>29 Me. 260 ; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>8 Johns. 97; <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>55 Me. 555; Story on Promissory Notes, \u00a7 193 ; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rowan, </em>8 S. &amp; M. 624; <em>Holman </em>v. <em>Ringo, </em>36 Miss. 690; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>3 Sand.

The contract between the companies is executed, and is not involved in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">The note appears to be properly indorsed, and has been \u2022duly delivered. It will be observed that the contract provides for a transfer \u201c without recourse.\u201d Thus the contract between the companies is fully executed, and this \u2022contract of indorsement is fully executed. The indorsement of a promissory note is a distinct and independent \u2022contract, and is not connected with the contract between maker and payee. The indorser maybe sued without joining the maker, and may be held in many instances in which the maker could not be held. So the maker may be \u25a0sued without reference to the indorser. When, therefore, the Home Mutual Company indorsed and delivered this note to the Union Central, the contract between them was \u2022executed, because that was all that the Home Mutual .agreed to do. It agreed to transfer the title. The contract of indorsement was also, at the same time, fully exe\u2022cuted, and the Union Central Company was invested with the right to sue the maker upon <em>Ms contract.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">The contract sued upon is the contract of Mr. Ehrman to pa.y a sum of money to a lawful person upon a valid -consideration. <em>TMs consideration is not impeached by the answer in any way. </em>This is the only contract in question in the cause. It is the contract sued upon. The. contracts between the two companies are not sued upon, neither that \u2022of October, 1871, or the subsequent contract of indorsement of the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">The plaintiff in error, therefore, must make good his proposition that the maker of a valid promissory note may \u2022escape payment at the suit of an indorsee on the ground that the consideration of the contract between indorser and indorsee was illegal. No authority can be found to support such a proposition. The maker has no interest what, \u2022ever in the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">As opposed to the above proposition, see <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>3 Pick. 184; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>31 Wis. 61; <em>Shum </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>48 Ind. 206; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Donnell, </em>49 Me. 421; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Burnop </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>32 Ill. 168; 2 Hilliard Con. 415; <em>Streit </em>v. <em>Waugh, </em>48 Vt. 298; 25 La.

The defendant had no power to raise the question. He does not represent the state. He is not a creditor of either company. He is not a stockholder of plaintiff. It is the plaintiff alone who is alleged to have transcended the charter power. The defense under consideration does not show that he was a stockholder of the Home Mutual Company. At all events, no right of his as a stockholder is involved in this action. He is not a party to the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>ultra vires </em>contract. If it affected his rights as a stockholder,he was bound to object to it, and institute proceedings in equity to enjoin it. Otherwise, he would be estopped in equity, and the transaction would stand, leaving him only a remedy in damages. <em>Goodin </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>18 Ohio St. 169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-4\">He appears to have acquiesced. If the allegation in another count, to the effect that he is a Home Mutual stockholder, shall be considered in this connection, he must be held to have acquiesced, as he does not allege that the transaction was without his knowledge or consent, or that ne even now seeks to have it avoided. The absence of such allegations creates an estoppel. Bat we are only concerned to show that his rights as a stockholder are not involved in this action, and that he stands in no relation to the contract of October 13, 1871, which will enable him to raise the question of corporate power. Only parties, or persons whose rights are adversely affected, can raise the question. <em>Vermont Railroad </em>v. <em>Vermont Railroad, </em>34 Vt. 2; <em>Eno </em>v. <em>Crooks, </em>10 N. Y. 60; <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>17 Wis. 372; <em>Donnell </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>49 Me. 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">The courts of this country have generally adopted the doctrine of the case, of <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Michigan Railroad Co., </em>22 N. Y. 259, as embodied in the opinion of Judge Comstock, which is, in substance, that where either party has received the benefit of a contract, the plea of <em>ultra vires </em>can furnish no defense to the other. This court cites that case with approval, in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>23 Ohio St. 97; the Supreme Court of Illinois follows it in <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>55 Ill.; the Supreme Court of Indiana follows it in <em>Board of Agriculture </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Railway Co., </em>47 Ind. 407. And see the case of <em>Weare </em>v. <em>Petroleum Co., </em>27 Ohio St. 343.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">In the case of <em>Whitney Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>63 N. Y. 62, the court fully examined the question, and decided that \u201c the plea of <em>ultra vires, </em>as a general rule, will not prevail, whether interposed for or against a corporation, when it will not advance-justice, but, on the .contrary, will accomplish a legal wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Towner &amp; Farnham </em>were with Messrs. <em>Matthews, Ramsey &amp; Matthews </em>in two of the cases determined by this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-5\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZo\">The ground of error relied on in this case is, that the agreement of October 13, 1871, entered into between the Home Mutual Life Insurance Company and the plaintiff, is unauthorized by the charters of the respective companies, and is therefore void; and that, as the plaintiff\u2019s title to the note in controversy is derived through this agreement, the transfer of the note by the Home Mutual to the plaintiff is inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In applying the doctrine <em>of ultra vires, </em>in a particular case, regard must not only be had to the unauthorized agreement or transaction, but also to the relation which the <em>litigating parties </em>sustain to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Where there is an absolute or total want of power in a corporation to deal in respect to a given subject, it may be that acts done in the name of the corporation, in regard to such subject, would, as corporate acts, be void for all purposes and as against all persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">But there is an obvious distinction between such a case and one where the corporation deals with a subject within the scope of its granted powers, but for a purpose, or in a mode not authorized by its charter. Thus, where property which the corporation, under certain circumstances, is authorized by its charter to acquire, is purchased, in a mode or for a purpose not authorized, it seems clear to us that the title of the corporation to the property can not be defeated by a party who is a stranger to the agreement by which the property was acquired, and who is not injured by the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">A stranger to the agreement or transaction has no right to question its validity, whether it was entered into between corporations or natural persons. To obtain a standing in a court of justice to make such inquiry, a party must show that he is interested in the question, and that the execution of the agreement operates to his injury or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The plaintiff' and the Home Mutual Company, at the date of the agreement of October 13,1871, were carrying on the business of life insurance under the act of April 16,1867, entitled \u201c an act for the incorporation and regulation of life insurance companies.\u201d S. &amp; S. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The substance of the agreement between the companies was that the plaintiff purchased all the assets of the Home Mutual, an.d in consideration thereof agreed to assume its risks and to pay its debts. Among the assets was the promissory note of the plaintiff' in error, in controversy in this case, which was indorsed and delivered by the Home Mutual to the defendant in error, in pursuance of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The agreement is set forth in full as part of the answer; but there is no averment that it has not been performed by the respective parties. In the absence of such averment, it will be presumed, in a case like the present, that the agreement has been performed, or at least that it has not been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The validity of the note sued on is admitted. The only defense relied on is that the plaintiff, the purchasing company, has not.such a title to the note as will enable it to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">According to the principles already stated, the fact that the agreement between the companies is unauthorized by their charters does not constitute a defense by the maker of the note. As a debtor, he is interested in paying the note only to a parky who is authorized to receive payment and to discharge him from liability. But while the validity of the transfer is insisted upon or adhered to by the parties to it, he has no interest in questioning the title of the purchaser, as payment to the latter will discharge his liability on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The answer likewise states that the defendant, at the time of the making of the note, was, and that he still continues to be, a stockholder in the selling company. There appears, however, to be-no connection between the taking of the stock and the giving of the note ; and where such is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the case, the fact'of Ms being such stockholder can not affect a recovery on the note, in the absence of any showing that the transfer of the note was to his injury or prejudice as a stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Having stated the principles upon which we rest our decision in this case, we deem it unnecessary to analyze and review the numerous authorities cited by counsel in this case, and in several others argued in connection with it. In regard, however, to the case of <em>Straus </em>v. <em>Eagle Ins. Co., </em>5 Ohio St. 59, relied upon by the plaintiff in error, it is proper to say that, while we do not question the correctness of the decision in that case, there are expressions in the opinion apparently in conflict with the view we have taken. These expressions were subsequently qualified in the opinion in the case of <em>White\u2019s Bank of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>12 Ohio St. 610 ; and of this qualification we approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In regard to the averment in the answer, that Cochnower was not the <em>legal </em>president of the company, for the reason that at the time of his election he was not a stockholder in the compauy, it is only necessary to say, without inquiry whether the objection, in a proper proceeding, would be valid or not, that being a <em>de facto </em>officer, his title can not be questioned in a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b351-8\">Okey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGo\">dissenting. In Massachusetts, \u201c it is the estabtablished law that the holder of a negotiable note may bring suit upon it, whether in law or in fact he be orbe not the real owner of it.\u201d <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>125 Mass. 333, 339. In Minnesota, the suit must be brought by the real party in interest. There are exceptions to the rule, but a case like this would not be within them. <em>Farmers\u2019 and M. Bank </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>23 Minn. 198; <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Pierson </em>(Minn.), 16 Albany L. Jour. 319; <em>s. c., </em>Thompson\u2019s Nat. Bank Cas. 637. This difference in the practice in those states was supposed, as will be seen in the eases cited, to be a sufficient explanation of a difference in holding upon the question whether a national bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>purchasing a promissory note may maintain an action thereon, assuming the purchase to be one which it was not authorized by law to make. The statute of this state is like that of Minnesota. It is a sufficient defense in Ohio that the plaintiff is not the real party in interest. The answer in this case embraces that defense, and therefore it was error to sustain a demurrer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">But I do not place this dissent alone or principally upon such narrow ground. It appears from the answer that the contract between the insurance companies was entered into, not merely without authority of law, but in direct violation of statutes prohibiting it. The Home Company undertook to transfer all its property and business to the Central Company by a single and entire contract. The contract embraced real estate. The statute specifies the circumstances under, and purposes for which, such corporations may hold real estate, and it appears from the answer that the real estate attempted to be purchased was not within that provision. The same statute provides that \u201c it shall not be lawful for any company to purchase, hold, or convey real estate in any other ease or for any other purpose.\u201d 69 Ohio L. 153, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In a larger sense, however, the statutes prohibited the contract. They provide that such company may \u201c make insurance on the lives of individuals,\u201d show what business may be done in connection therewith, how policy holders shall be secured, how the funds of the company shall be invested, how the company may reinsure, and how it may be wound up. The whole act negatives the claim that the self-destruction attempted in this case was authorized. Indeed, the opinion has not been expressed by any member of this court that the contract was lawful, in the sense that either company could have enforced its execution as against the other. At the same time, it is asserted, in the opinion of the majority, that it does not appear that the contract has been rescinded. That, however, is not material, for it does not appear that the contract has been executed. There can be no presumption that an illegal contract has been per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>formed. If the company wished to rely upon the fact that the contract had been executed, a reply instead of a demurrer to the answer would have been proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">There is a well-known distinction between a mere abuse of the power delegated to directors and the absence of power in the corporation itself. The directors of a corporation may be authorized to receive the indorsement of a promissory note in a particular way, or on a particular consideration, and this authority may be abused. Or a corporation, authorized to receive the indorsement of a promissory note, may enter into a single and entire agreement, expressly prohibited by its charter, by which agreement a promissory note, among other things, is received. The distinction between these eases is important, but it is disregarded in the decision of this case. According to many authorities, the corporation receiving the note, in the instance first mentioned, may recover upon it. But I humbly submit that no case other than this can be found, in England or America, where a recovery has been permitted in the latter case. The title acquired by <em>such </em>an agreement is no better than if the company had been, in terms, prohibited from receiving the note. The transfer was \u201c void for all purposes and as against all persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The principles I have stated are so distinctly asserted and ably vindicated in <em>Straus </em>v. <em>Eagle Ins. Co., </em>5 Ohio St. 59, that the citation of other authorities seems almost a work of supererogation. As being in entire harmony with that decision, I will refer, however, to the following cases, most of which have been decided since it was announced : <em>Farmers\u2019 and M. Bank </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra; <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>St. Louis M. L. Ins. Co., </em>2 Tenn. Ch. 742; <em>Hood </em>v. <em>N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. Co., </em>22 Conn. 502; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Ottawa, etc., R. Co., </em>61 Ill. 422; <em>Madison Plank R. Co. </em>v. <em>Watertown Plank Road Co., </em>7 Wis. 59; <em>Board, etc. </em>v. <em>Lafayette, etc., R. Co., </em>50 Ind. 85 ; <em>Pearce </em>v. <em>Madison, etc., R. Co., </em>21 How. 442; <em>E. A. Railways </em>v. <em>E. C. Railway, </em>73 Eng. Com. L. 775; <em>Toomey </em>v. <em>L. B. &amp;. S. C. Railway, </em>91 Eng. Com. L. 146; <em>Ashbury Railway, etc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Riche, L. R., 7 </em>Eng. &amp; Ir. Appeal, 653. And see <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>11 Allen, 72; <em>Widoe </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>20 Ohio St. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">There is a remark of the judge delivering the opinion in <em>White's Bank </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>12 Ohio St. 601, 610, wholly unnecessary to the decision of that case, which is claimed to qualify something said by Ranney, J., in <em>Straus </em>v. <em>Ins. Co.. </em>Precisely what the supposed qualification is, or why it was suggested, is not very apparent. But I am satisfied that <em>Straus </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>being founded on correct principles, will withstand all the assaults made upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The rule that the charter of a corporation must be strictly construed, has been enforced in this state for many years. The statute now provides that \u201c corporations may be formed . . . for any purpose for which individuals may lawfully associate themselves, except for dealing in real estate, or carrying on professional business \u201d (Rev. Stats., \u00a7 3235), or banking (Const., art. 13, \u00a7 7). It is probable that the number of corporations organized in any year hereafter will greatly exceed that of any preceding year. In my opinion this is not a time when we should relax the strict rule upon this subject, which has operated so well in this state in the past. As this decision is in direct conflict with that rule, I dissent from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">This case was considered in connection with others involving supposed rights under the same or a similar contract. Without entering a formal dissent in any of them, this dissent applies to every case where the same infirmity was set up and the judgment or modification is in favor of the company. In some of them additional reasons for the view I have taken will be found to exist.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
