In the meantime a receiver had been appointed, and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>consent of parties he sold the goods and chattels, and held the fund subject to the order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">\u201c On January 15, 1875, Jonathan Switzer and Gr. H.. Eidson jointly filed an original petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Preble county, in the nature of a credit- or\u2019s bill, setting out the facts in relation to their lien; making all parties claiming liens on the fund defendants, and asking the court to determine the question of priority among the lienholders. To this petition all the lienholdersfiled answers and cross-petitions, and among the others the plaintiff, A. A. Seibert, filed his answer and cross-petition,, to which Switzer and Eidson jointly filed a reply, in which they denied the validity of said Seibert\u2019s attachment, and stated the following facts in substance :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\">\u201c That, on the 15th day of October, 1874, about eleven o\u2019clock, a. m., the said Seibert filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the-court of common pleas his affidavit for an attachment against Christian Brown, together with the required bond, and thereupon an attachment was issued by the clerk of said court, and placed in the hands of the sheriff, and was by him levied upon the goods, from the sale of which the fund mentioned was derived, and returned by him at three o\u2019clock, p. m., of said day. That at the time said attachment was issued, levied, and returned, there was no suit commenced by said Seibert against said Brown, nor was any petition filed by Seibert against said Brown until six or seven hours-after said attachment was issued.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-7\">\u201c To this reply the plaintiff in error, A. A. Seibert, filed a general demurrer, which was argued, and the demurrer was sustained. And thereupon the court proceeded to settle-the priorities of lien as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-8\">\u201c First lien, E. B. Eshelman, about which no question is raised; second lien, Augustus A.

Curme Dunn &amp; Co. filed a cross-petition in error, assigning tbe same error, and praying for the same relief. All persons interested were made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-5\">\u201cAt the May term, 1876, of the district court, the ease was argued by counsel, and the district court reversed the court of common pleas, to which the said A. A. Seibert, plaintiff in error, excepted ; and said Seibert now seeks to have the finding of the district court, that the common pleas erred in sustaining said demurrer, reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-6\">\u201c The amount of .the different liens is not-stated, but it is deemed sufficient to say that Eshelman\u2019s claim (which is no longer controverted) and Seibert\u2019s claim, if allowed, will exhaust the fund in the receiver\u2019s hands, and the claims of Switzer, Switzer and Eidson, and Curme, Dunn &amp; Co. will exhaust the fund if Seibert\u2019s lien is set aside.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b675-7\"><em>Stiver &amp; Freeman </em>for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b675-8\">Failing to give the statutory bond does not avoid the attachment.

There was an affidavit and bond filed about 11 o\u2019clock, a. m., and writ then issued. It was served by the seizure of a stock of goods, and the writ returned by 3 o\u2019clock, p. m. The petition was filed about 6 o\u2019clock, p. m., of the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\u201c The plaintiff <em>in a cioil action, </em>for the recovery of money, may, <em>at or after the commencement thereof, </em>have an attachment against the property of the defendant, and upon the grounds herein stated.\u201d Civil Code, \u00a7 191; Rev. Stat. \u2022\u00a7 5521.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\u201c An order of attachment shall be made by the clerk of the court <em>in which the action is brought, </em>in any case mentioned in the preceding section, when there is filed an affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, showing,\u201d etc. Civil Code, \u00a7 192; Rev. Stat., \u00a7 5522.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Section 193 requires a bond by the <em>plaintiff </em>to the <em>defendant, </em>except in case the defendant is a non-resident or a foreign corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">By section 196, the return day of the order of attachment, when issued <em>at the commencement of the action, </em>shall be the same as the summons; when issued afterward it shall be returned twenty days after it issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">\u201c A civil action must be commenced by filing in the office of the clerk of the proper coui\u2019t a petition, and causing a summons to be issued thereon.\u201d Civil Code, \u00a7 55; Rev. 'Stat., \u00a7 5035.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The plaintiff must also file with the clerk a precipe, \u2022stating the names of the parties to the action, and demanding a summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">From these provisions and others found in the chapter on attachment, we are to determine whether Seibert obtained a priority by his attachment, or whether, as against the other liens, it is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">Unlike the attachment laws formerly in force, the code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u25a0rewards the diligent creditor by giving priority to the order first delivered to the officer. This being in derogation of the equitable principle, that the assets of an insolvent debtor should be equally distributed among his creditors, it is but just that the party asserting such priority should clearly show that he has established the right given by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The record shows this to have been a race between creditors of an absconding debtor who did not have property sufficient to satisfy all the claims upon it. The plaintiffs were lienholders by attachment and by a chattel mortgage. After judgments in the several actions in which attachments had been sued out, the action was commenced to determine priorities among the several lienholders. These plaintiffs can not take advantage of any mere irregularity or informality in Seibert\u2019s attachment, for the purpose of defeating his priority; but they may show that his attachment was issued without authority of law, and thereby defeat it. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>12 Ohio St. 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">No action was, in fact, commenced by the filing of a petition, until some three or four hours after the order of attachment was served and returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The statute does not authorize an attachment except in an action, and the clerk of the court has' no authority to issue the order of attachment until an action is brought, and the relation of plaintiff and defendant is established in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">An action is commenced or brought, within the meaning of sections 192 and 193, by the filing of a petition and causing a summons to issue thereon. Code, \u00a7 55. Until then there is no action in which an attachment can issue. It is a remedy auxiliary to an action for a money judgment. It is a writ in aid of the plaintiff, granted in certain cases before he could have execution. Without an action there is no foundation for this auxiliary proceeding. Nor do we think that the subsequent commencement of an action, though on the same day, cures this defect. The order of .attachment being issued by the clerk of the court before .action brought, was unauthorized arid void, and the subsej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>quent commencement of an action, although on the same day, could not vitalize it so as to give it priority over other valid liens.</p>\n<p id=\"AOl\">This conclusion is supported by the following cases in point. <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Hibernia Ins. Co., </em>24 Ohio St. 481; <em>Endel </em>v. <em>Leibrock, </em>33 Ohio St. 254; <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Mount, </em>28 N.
