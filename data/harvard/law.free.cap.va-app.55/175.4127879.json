We find the trial court did not err, and, thus, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">Deputy Sheriff Scott Wyatt was patrolling the roads in Pittsylvania County when he saw, and heard, a Ford Ranger being driven down the road in the opposite direction. Based on the sound coming from the vehicle, Deputy Wyatt believed the driver was operating the Ranger without a muffler. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>deputy turned his patrol car around, found the Ranger, and stopped it. The driver, appellant, stopped the truck by the side of the road, in front of a business, where the vehicle would not impede traffic.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Appellant, who appeared nervous to the deputy, was the only person in the Ranger. He gave the deputy his social security number rather than a driver\u2019s license, and the deputy then discovered that appellant\u2019s license was suspended. Deputy Wyatt began talking to appellant and asked if he knew that his license was suspended. During this conversation, Deputy Wyatt asked appellant if he had any drugs or weapons in the Ranger. Appellant said no. Deputy Wyatt then asked for permission to search the vehicle, and appellant again said no. At this point, Deputy Wyatt advised appellant that he was going to have the Ranger towed \u201cdue to his driver\u2019s license status, where we were at\u201d and asked appellant \u201cif there was anything in the vehicle [that] wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d Appellant responded that \u201che thought there may be a gun underneath the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The deputy asked appellant to get out of the Ranger. As appellant was getting out, Deputy Wyatt asked \u201cif he had any weapons on him,\u201d and appellant \u201csaid that he had a knife in his left pants pocket.\u201d Deputy Wyatt told appellant to put his hands on the top of the Ranger after he got out of the vehicle. The deputy then reached into appellant\u2019s left pocket to remove the knife, but instead he pulled out \u201ca block of white substance,\u201d which proved to be cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Deputy Wyatt arrested and handcuffed appellant and put him into the back seat of the patrol car. The deputy then proceeded to search the Ranger, where he discovered a firearm under the driver\u2019s seat. He also found a digital scale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>with cocaine residue on it, two boxes of sandwich bags, and a hundred-gram weight used to calibrate digital scales.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence collected during Wyatt\u2019s search of the car. He conceded that Deputy Wyatt had a legitimate reason to stop the Ranger, but claimed the officer should have issued him a summons and then let him go. Appellant argued that once the deputy asked appellant to get out of the car and said he was going to impound the Ranger, appellant was no longer free to leave. He claimed that towing the Ranger was \u201cused by the officer to get the defendant out of the vehicle and allow the officer to search over and above the express denial,\u201d calling it a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d or \u201cpretext.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The prosecutor argued that the Ranger could be towed because \u201cthe defendant can\u2019t drive it.\u201d The prosecutor claimed that the deputy had authority during the traffic stop to ask appellant to get out of the truck and that appellant\u2019s statement that there was a gun in the Ranger gave the deputy probable cause to search the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The trial court found, \u201c[T]he only reason the officer had this [truck] towed was to search it...The court also found the Ranger was not \u201cin any way a problem\u201d where it was stopped. In addition, the trial court said that it was \u201cnot real happy about how the police handled the case.\u201d However, the court concluded that appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated and denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Appellant then entered conditional guilty pleas and was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm while possessing cocaine, and operating a motor vehicle while driving on a suspended license. He now appeals the two possession convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Appellant makes two arguments: (1) because the decision to tow the Ranger was pretext, Deputy Wyatt\u2019s search was not permitted under the inventory search exception to the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) because appellant was already arrested and in the patrol car, the deputy\u2019s search was not valid under <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009). Both of these arguments ignore the alternative justification for Deputy Wyatt\u2019s search presented by the Commonwealth\u2014that the deputy had probable cause to enter the vehicle and search for a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Under the Fourth Amendment, officers cannot search a place without a warrant unless <em>one </em>of several delineated exceptions to this warrant requirement apply. <em>Flippo v. West Virginia, </em>528 U.S. 11, 14, 120 S.Ct. 7, 8, 145 L.Ed.2d 16 (1999) (\u201cA warrantless search by the police is invalid unless it falls within one of the narrow and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement----\u201d (citing <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967))). Therefore, even assuming without deciding that appellant is correct that Deputy Wyatt\u2019s search was not justified under either the exception for an inventory search or the exception for a search incident to an arrest, the search here was conducted in a manner consistent with Fourth Amendment principles if the deputy conducted the search pursuant to the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">As the United States Supreme Court has explained, if an officer stops a vehicle and has probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of a crime, then a warrant-less search of that vehicle is permissible under the automobile exception. <em>Maryland v. Dyson, </em>527 U.S. 465, 466-67, 119 S.Ct. 2013, 2014, 144 L.Ed.2d 442 (1999) (citing <em>Pennsylvania v. Labron, </em>518 U.S. 938, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996); <em>California v. Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>L.Ed.2d 406 (1985); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982); and <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925)). Here, before getting out of the vehicle, appellant told Deputy Wyatt that he believed there was a firearm under the driver\u2019s seat. Appellant then also told the deputy, as appellant was getting out of the vehicle, that he had a knife in his pocket. When Deputy Wyatt reached into appellant\u2019s pocket, instead of pulling out a knife, he retrieved an item that appeared to be cocaine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At this point, Deputy Wyatt had probable cause to believe, at minimum, that the vehicle contained a concealed weapon directly under the seat in which appellant had been sitting. Thus, the deputy did not violate the Fourth Amendment when he conducted the search of the Ranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Appellant also argues that, under <em>Gant, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. at 1715, Deputy Wyatt could not search the Ranger because appellant was \u201csecured\u201d in a police car before the deputy began the search. We find appellant is misinterpreting the holding in <em>Gant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Gant was driving while his license was suspended, as was appellant here. <em>Id. </em>at-, 129 S.Ct. at 1715. However, at this point, the significant facts in Gant's situation and appellant\u2019s situation differ greatly. When the police arrested Gant, handcuffed him, and placed him in the back of a patrol car, <em>id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Gant made no statements regarding anything that the police might find in his car, and the police had no other information suggesting that evidence of a crime would be found in the vehicle. Thus, the United States Supreme Court concluded, \u201cBecause [the] police could not reasonably have believed either that Gant could have accessed his car at the time of the search or that evidence of the offense for which he was arrested might have been found therein, the search in this case was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 129 S.Ct. at 1719.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">On the other hand, appellant, while he was still sitting in the Ranger, told Deputy Wyatt that there was a firearm under his seat. Therefore, unlike the officers in <em>Gant, </em>the deputy here had additional information regarding the vehicle, independent of the status of appellant\u2019s license. This statement provided the deputy with probable cause to search the Ranger for evidence that appellant was in possession of a concealed weapon. <em>See Dyson, </em>527 U.S. at 466-67, 119 S.Ct. at 2013-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The Supreme Court specifically pointed out in <em>Gant </em>that, if an officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle contains evidence of a crime, then the officer may search that vehicle without a warrant. <em>Gant, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 1721. The search of Gant\u2019s vehicle was not supported by probable cause and, therefore, was in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Here, however, as Deputy Wyatt had probable cause for his search of the Ranger, the fact that appellant\u2019s truck was searched as he sat in the back of the patrol car did not invalidate the search under <em>Gant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">We find the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, and, thus, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-14\">. Appellant was also convicted of operating a motor vehicle on a revoked or suspended license. However, the issue raised in this appeal does not address that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">. Although the witnesses disagreed about exactly where the Ranger was parked, the trial court found that the parked vehicle was not impeding traffic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\">. During the suppression hearing, appellant testified that the gun belonged to his mother, who owned the truck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b225-11\">. Appellant does not argue that Deputy Wyatt violated the Constitution by simply <em>telling </em>appellant that he would do an inventory search. <em>Cf. Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 1425, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969) (holding that falsely informing a suspect that his co-conspirator had already confessed did not render the suspect\u2019s confession involuntary); <em>Lucero v. Kerby, </em>133 F.3d 1299, 1311 (10th Cir.1998) (finding that a suspect\u2019s confession was voluntary where an officer lied and said that the suspect\u2019s fingerprint was found at the crime scene).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\">. In his questions presented, appellant contended that the deputy\u2019s \"search of Appellant\u2019s person\u201d was unconstitutional. However, in his brief and in argument before this Court, appellant has failed to advance this argument beyond general quotations of hornbook law regarding searches. As he has failed to develop this argument based on the case here, we do not consider this issue on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e). In addition, as the officer had probable cause to search the vehicle for a concealed weapon based on appellant\u2019s statement that he believed a gun was under the driver\u2019s seat, and as that statement was made prior to any search, Deputy Wyatt also had probable cause to arrest appellant based on that same statement\u2014as well as appellant\u2019s statement that he had a knife in his pocket and the fact that appellant was driving on a suspended license\u2014all of which justified the deputy\u2019s action of reaching into appellant's pocket under the exception for a search incident to an arrest. <em>See Virginia v. Moore, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008); <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 96, 105-06, 496 S.E.2d 47, 53 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
