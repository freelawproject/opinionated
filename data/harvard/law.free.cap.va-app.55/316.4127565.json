INTRODUCTION</p>\n<author id=\"b365-10\">HALEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Pursuant to the provisions of the State Grievance Procedure, Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 <em>et seq., </em>a hearing officer sustained the termination of Todd Needham\u2019s employment as a guard at Wallens Ridge State Prison. The officer found as facts, supported by the preponderance of the evidence, that Need-ham had violated two sections of the Virginia Department of Corrections Operating Procedure. Needham appealed to the circuit court, as provided by Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That code section authorizes a circuit court to determine, based on the administrative record, if the hearing officer\u2019s decision \u201cis contradictory to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">The circuit court reversed the decision of the hearing officer and re-instated Needham with back pay. The Commonwealth maintains the circuit court erred (1) by employing an incorrect standard of review, that contained in Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 of the Administrative Process Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, in so doing, erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>reweighing the evidence in the administrative record and erroneously reversing the findings of fact made by the hearing officer; and (2) thus erroneously determining the decision of the hearing officer was \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d We agree as to both assignments of error. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court and remand with directions to enter an order affirming the decision of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">After receiving a notice of a \u201cGroup II\u201d offense and a notice of a \u201cGroup III\u201d offense, advising that the Department of Corrections considered him in violation of their procedures and terminated, Needham initiated an informal grievance procedure review by filing a form requesting a Second Resolution Step. He attached to the form a one-page Exhibit A. This Exhibit A is Needham\u2019s version of what happened on January 30, 2008. As will be seen, the circuit court relied on this Exhibit A in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Needham wrote that the inmate \u201cbecame belligerent ... turned in a quick and aggressive manner and moved in a threatening manner toward the employee.\u201d Needham wrote that he \u201cgrabbed the inmate ... [and] pushed the inmate back against the shower wall.... The employee was fearful of being head butted, kicked, spat upon or worse. The employee put him on the ground.\u201d In short, Needham maintained he acted in self-defense. This document was not under oath, nor its contents subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Following this step review meeting with an employee ombudsman, the reviewer wrote: \u201cI feel you should have followed the established policy/procedure ... [and] I have decided to uphold the Warden\u2019s decision of termination.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Needham then requested a formal hearing before a hearing officer, in accordance with Code \u00a7 2.2-3004 of the State Grievance Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The transcript of that hearing contains the following pertinent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">On January 30, 2008, Needham and another guard, Paul Middleton, were taking a prisoner to the shower room. The prisoner was in leg shackles and handcuffed behind his back. A heated breakfast cart arrived, and the prisoner asked if they could put his breakfast on the cart so it would be warm when he completed showering. He became angry when this request was denied. Nonetheless, he entered the shower, his shackles were removed, one hand released from the handcuff, and the shower door closed. A lanyard was placed on the handcuffs, leading out through an opening in the shower door, and was held by Middleton. When the prisoner continued cursing, Needham canceled the shower. The prisoner was directed to turn around, and he was re-cuffed behind his back. As Middleton testified before the hearing officer: \u201cNeedham opened the shower door ... the inmate tried to step out ... Needham shoved him back in the shower and took him to the back of the shower and put him on the ground.\u201d The inmate suffered cuts and bruises to his mouth and head, requiring stitches. Middleton further testified that the inmate\u2019s actions \u201cwasn\u2019t no threat to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Needham did not dispute that the inmate was handcuffed behind his back without incident. He testified: \u201cI was standing directly behind him, and he turned right ... he was fast ... I took it as aggression____ From the time he turned towards me, and I put my hands on him, he resisted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The core of Needham\u2019s testimony was that he acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Code \u00a7 2.2-3005.1(C) requires the hearing officer\u2019s decision be in writing and \u201ccontain findings of facts as to the material issues.\u201d In his August 4, 2008 decision, the hearing officer found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>APPLICABLE LAW AND OPINION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\"># \u00edjs * s\u00a1: * sji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Department of Corrections Operating Procedures 420.1 IV B.4 and 5 requires written reports on incidents where force was used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">Department of Correction Operating Procedure 420.1 IV, 2.c and 2.d lists as a \u201ccontrolling factor\u201d for the use of force \u201cAny alternative available to control the situation without the use of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">Virginia Department of Corrections Operating Procedure 420.1, IV B.4. \u201cFailure of any employee to accurately and completely report any incident where force was used may result in disciplinary action.\u201d The Agency proved conclusively and by a preponderance of the evidence that Grievant did not comply with this policy. For this failure alone, the Group II notice is sustained____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">The Agency proved conclusively and by a preponderance of the evidence that when the inmate became disruptive, as an alternative to the use of force (Operating Procedure 420.1 TV c.2.d). Grievant [sic] ... should have left the inmate locked in the shower and called for assistance instead of unlocking the door to deal with the inmate. Since the inmate was confined, all the Grievant had to do was leave the inmate locked in the shower room and call for assistance. Instead, he unlocked the shower room door and engaged the inmate----The Group III written notice with termination is sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">Thus, in sum, the hearing officer found Needham had violated two policies of the Department of Corrections, thereby justifying his termination. Although the \u201cDECISION\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>portion of the hearing officer\u2019s opinion did not expressly consider self-defense, the hearing officer elsewhere noted Needham \u201creacted to aggression with fear\u201d and \u201cdid not consider the use of force unauthorized.\u201d It may therefore be said that when the hearing officer determined Needham should have kept the inmate locked in the shower instead of employing force, the hearing officer rejected Needham\u2019s assertion of the necessity of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Needham appealed to the circuit court. Following argument, the circuit court reversed the decision of the hearing officer and ordered Needham reinstated with back pay. In so doing, the circuit court entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">The Court adopts evidence presented in Exhibit A<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Grievance filed by Todd Needham.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">The Court affirms evidence he acted in reasonable fear and acted in accordance to rules to restrain inmates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">The evidence supports a ruling that the Grievant acted in self defense and used only an amount of force to defend himself and to remain in control of the situation at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">There is sufficient evidence to show the Grievant\u2019s acts were proper for the situation in which he was confronted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">The Commonwealth now appeals from this order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"ALk\">The issues presented are questions of law which we review <em>de novo. Viking Enter., Inc. v. County of Chesterfield, </em>277 Va. 104, 110, 670 S.E.2d 741, 744 (2009); <em>PMA Capital Ins. Co. v. U.S. Airways, Inc., </em>271 Va. 352, 357-58, 626 S.E.2d 369, 372 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A2m\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">We summarily address three issues raised on brief by Needham.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>First, he argues the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal should be dismissed for failure to comply with Rule 5A:8, requiring the filing of a transcript or statement of facts. Rule 5A:8 \u201cdoes not apply to administrative or grievance appeals in which the circuit court functions as an appellate court rather than a trial court.\u201d <em>Va. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Compton, </em>47 Va.App. 202, 216, 623 S.E.2d 397, 404 (2005). Simply stated, the record reviewed is the administrative record alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Needham next erroneously invokes the Rule 5A:18 requirement of a contemporaneous objection to a \u201cruling of the trial court.\u201d Again, however, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s function was limited to considering the parties\u2019 legal arguments based upon the agency record.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Allen, </em>24 Va.App. 272, 277, 482 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1997). Rule 5A:18 is satisfied because the Commonwealth raised the issue here for resolution on brief before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Third, Needham refers to Code \u00a7 8.01-680, which deals with setting aside a verdict as plainly wrong or without evidence to support it in \u201ccivil or criminal\u201d cases in. circuit courts. Plainly, that statute has no bearing on proceedings governed by the State Grievance Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">On brief, Needham maintains, as he did in the circuit court, that the provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 of the Administrative Process Act, granting circuit court review of \u201cthe substantiality of the evidentiary support for findings of fact,\u201d apply to such review under the State Grievance Procedure. No such provision for review exists in the State Grievance Procedure; the permissible review, and the one chosen by Needham pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B), is limited to whether the decision is \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In <em>Compton, </em>we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">On appeal ... the hearing officer\u2019s decision is only subject to reversal if it is \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d This standard of review is applicable in both the circuit court and the Virginia Court of Appeals. <em>See Pound [v. Dep\u2019t of Game &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Inland Fisheries, </em>40 Va.App. 59, 64, 577 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2003)] (\u201cBecause the General Assembly granted to the circuit courts only the authority to consider whether the final determination of the hearing officer is \u2018contrary to law,\u2019 we are likewise limited to such review in considering whether the trial court erred in its determination.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">The \u201ccontradictory to law\u201d standard of appellate review is unique to cases brought pursuant to the State Grievance Procedure. <em>See </em>[Va. <em>Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Barton, </em>39 Va.App. 439, 445, 573 S.E.2d 319, 322 (2002) ] (noting that Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B) \u201crepresents the first and only appearance of the phrase \u2018contradictory to lav/ in the Code of Virginia as a standard of appellate review\u201d). \u201cLaw,\u201d when used in this context, is limited to \u201cconstitutional provisions, statutes, regulations or judicial decisions....\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">47 Va.App. at 218-19, 623 S.E.2d at 405 (additional citations omitted); <em>see also Va. Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Stevens, </em>53 Va.App. 654, 661, 674 S.E.2d 563, 567 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Concomitant with this \u201cvery narrow standard of review ... the party appealing the hearing officer\u2019s decision properly bears the burden of identifying the law thereby contradicted.\u201d <em>Va. Polytechnic Inst. &amp; State Univ. v. Quesenberry, </em>277 Va. 420, 429, 674 S.E.2d 854, 858 (2009). <em>Quesenberry, </em>as here, addresses the standard of review on appeal under the State Grievance Procedure. More precisely, in such review, an appealing party must \u201c \u2018identify [a] constitutional provision, statute, regulation or judicial decision which the [hearing officer\u2019s] decision contradicted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tatum v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Agric. &amp; Consumer Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 110, 122, 582 S.E.2d 452, 458 (2003) (quoting <em>Barton, </em>39 Va.App. at 446, 573 S.E.2d at 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In his notice of appeal to the circuit court, Needham states only that the hearing officer\u2019s \u201cdetermination is contradictory to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In a November 24, 2008 letter to the circuit court, Need-ham, as on brief, erroneously cites Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 of the Administrative Process Act, dealing with the substantiality of evidentiary support for agency findings of fact, as the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>standard of review. The only \u201claw\u201d designated by Needham is \u201cthe law of self-defense.\u201d On brief before this Court, Needham contends his arguments before the circuit court maintained that the hearing officer\u2019s decision \u201ccontradicted the law of self-defense and the VDOC\u2019s operating procedure.\u201d In either case, Needham fails to identify any \u201claw\u201d within the scope of judicial review permitted by the State Grievance Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We first note that under Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 <em>et seq., </em>the State Grievance Procedure, an administrative officer serves as the fact finder. The hearing officer\u2019s decision \u201cshall contain findings of fact as to the material issues in the case.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-3005.1(C); <em>see also Tatum, </em>41 Va.App. at 121, 582 S.E.2d at 458; <em>Barton, </em>39 Va.App. at 445, 573 S.E.2d at 322 (\u201cThese statutes clearly provide the hearing officer is to act as fact finder____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Whether an individual establishes that he acted in self-defense is \u201can issue of fact.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 979, 234 S.E.2d 286, 292 (1977). \u201cThe trier of fact determines the weight of evidence in support of a claim of self-defense.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 418, 426, 350 S.E.2d 229, 233 (1986); <em>see also Caison v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 423, 440, 663 S.E.2d 553, 562 (2008); <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 448, 464, 573 S.E.2d 324, 331 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In its written opinion, the circuit court found as a fact that Needham \u201cacted in self-defense.\u201d To reach that conclusion, and reverse the factual finding of the hearing officer, the circuit court plainly employed an erroneous standard of review, that of Code \u00a7 2.2-4027, and necessarily reweighed the evidence contained in the administrative record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">As the Virginia Supreme Court wrote in <em>Quesenberry: </em>\u201cThis appeal ... is presented to us in an unusual posture, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>which the circuit court failed to conduct the required review to determine whether the hearing officer\u2019s decision was \u2018contradictory\u2019 to applicable law. Instead, the circuit court, in the absence of any statutory authority, made its own factual findings....\u201d 277 Va. at 430, 674 S.E.2d at 859 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Likewise, did the circuit court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Needham\u2019s arguments concerning the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of the operating procedure of the Department of Corrections also fall outside permissible court review. Under the State Grievance Procedure, an appeal from a hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of policy goes to the director of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the Department of Human Resource Management, not the circuit court. Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(A). \u201cTo be sure, \u2018[interpretation of state agency policy is itself a matter of policy\u2019 outside the scope of judicial review.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>53 Va.App. at 663, 674 S.E.2d at 567 (quoting <em>Barton, </em>39 Va.App. at 446, 573 S.E.2d at 323). As we held in <em>Barton: </em>\u201cBarton only identifies a conflict in interpretation of a policy established by a state agency ... any dispute over the meaning of that directive is a matter of internal agency policy.\u201d 39 Va.App. at 446, 573 S.E.2d at 323.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is reversed and the case remanded with directions to enter an order affirming the decision of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-13\">. Needham did not pursue the appeal provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(A), which provide for an administrative review of the hearing officer\u2019s decision by the Director of Human Resource Management as to whether the decision is \"consistent with policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\">. Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 states in pertinent part: \"Such issues of law include ... (iv) the substantiality of the evidentiary support for findings of fact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>It later continues: \u201c[T]he duty of the court with respect to issues of fact shall be limited to ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record upon which the agency as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\">. The Department of Corrections Operating Procedure designates three Groups, or types, of violations. A Group I offense is \u201cleast severe\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>requires \u201ccorrection.\u201d A Group II offense is \"more severe in nature\u201d and \u201can accumulation of two Group II offenses normally should warrant removal.\u201d A Group III offense is \"of such a serious nature that a first occurrence normally should warrant removal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">. This was the Exhibit A attached to Needham\u2019s informal Second Resolution Step form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">. In its opinion, the circuit court adopted the \"evidence presented in Exhibit A of the Grievance filed by Todd Needham.\u201d We have noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that this was the self-serving statement prepared by Needham and tendered during the informal Second Resolution Step phase. The statement was not executed under oath, nor was Needham subject to cross-examination as to its contents during the informal meeting. The circuit court, in its opinion, makes no mention of or comment upon the evidence adduced at the formal proceedings before the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B), the circuit court is to \"hear the appeal on the [grievance] record.\u201d A court is to consider \"the [administrative] record as a whole.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988). Though dealing with the review provisions of the Administrative Process Act, in <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe v.
