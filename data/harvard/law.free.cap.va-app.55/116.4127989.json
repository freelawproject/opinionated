For the reasons stated, we agree with appellant and reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">\u2018When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial and consider all inferences fairly deducible from that evidence.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 121, 124, 661 S.E.2d 412, 414 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">The evidence showed that appellant and the victim had previously dated. On December 18, 2007, the victim was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>her home with her then boyfriend when appellant arrived at her back door uninvited. The victim told appellant she had company and she would not allow appellant into her residence. Appellant tried to get the victim to speak with him outside the residence, asserting that they had plans together for that evening. The victim repeatedly told appellant she did not want to speak with him, and appellant became angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The victim stated that after a brief altercation with her then boyfriend, appellant \u201cstormed out\u201d to his vehicle and cursed at her as he walked. The victim testified that appellant later telephoned her and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you fucking cunt---You\u2019re a fucking bitch\u2014 I hate you\u2014 I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this. [W]e had plans.\u201d The victim went to the magistrate\u2019s office and swore out warrants against appellant. When she returned home, she discovered a voice mail message in which appellant again called her a \u201cfucking cunt\u201d and said, \u201cyou fucking suck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">At trial, appellant admitted that he \u201cprobably\u201d used the language the victim described in the telephone conversation. Appellant also testified he was \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cI did say something to her when I was very mad. I couldn\u2019t believe she did what she did.\u201d He later elaborated that he was upset \u201c[b]e-cause of the way she behaved. I\u2019m coming over there. We had plans. And she is acting like she doesn\u2019t even know who I am, like I\u2019m not even her boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The trial court found appellant guilty, stating, \u201cI think he was a disgruntled lover who was upset and got out of control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-427, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">If any person shall use obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, over any telephone or citizens band radio, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>this Commonwealth, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Appellant argues the language he used, while arguably offensive, was not obscene and he did not intend to coerce, intimidate or harass the victim. He further asserts that his remarks were not sexually explicit, but were expressions of his disapproval of the victim\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 14-15, 402 S.E.2d 229, 233-34 (1991), we considered a claim that Code \u00a7 18.2-427 was unconstitutionally overbroad. The Court concluded that the legislature \u201cintended to address harassing conduct as the evil to be proscribed and intended to narrow the scope of the speech phrases to that which is obscene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 402 S.E.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Neither Code \u00a7 18.2-427 nor the chapter or article in which it is codified defines \u201cobscene.\u201d However, when addressing a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-427, this Court has adopted the definition of obscenity found in Code \u00a7 18.2-372. <em>See Allman v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 104, 109, 596 S.E.2d 531, 534 (2004) (reasoning that the Code of Virginia is one body of law and other sections of the Code may be referenced where the same phraseology is used).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-372 defines obscene as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">that [1] which, considered as a whole, has as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, excretory functions or products thereof or sadomasochistic abuse, and [2] which goes substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and [3] which, taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u201c \u2018To be obscene, conduct must violate contemporary community standards of sexual candor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allman, </em>43 Va.App. at 109-10, 596 S.E.2d at 534 (quoting <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 512, 515, 525 S.E.2d 9, 10 (2000)). \u201cOn appeal, we \u2018must make an independent determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>constitutional issue of obscenity, which is a mixed question of law and fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110, 596 S.E.2d at 534 (quoting <em>Price v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 113, 118, 189 S.E.2d 324, 328 (1972), <em>vacated on other grounds and remanded by </em>413 U.S. 912, 93 S.Ct. 3049, 37 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1973)). The first two prongs of the obscenity test codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-372 \u201cinvolve \u2018primarily factual issues, to be measured by \u201ccontemporary community standards.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 596 S.E.2d at 534-35 (quoting <em>State v. Harrold, </em>256 Neb. 829, 593 N.W.2d 299, 312 (1999)). \u201cAs to the third prong ... \u2018the appellate court should apply a <em>de novo </em>review ... since this determination does not depend upon community standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 596 S.E.2d at 535 (quoting <em>Harrold, </em>593 N.W.2d at 313).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The word \u201cfuck\u201d is defined as \u201cto engage in coitus with\u2014 sometimes used interjectionally with an object (as a personal or reflexive pronoun) <em>to express anger, contempt, or disgust.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>505 (11th ed. 2004) (emphasis added). It is also defined as \u201cto deal with unfairly or harshly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The word \u201cfucking\u201d is defined as \u201cdamned\u2014 used as an intensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCunt\u201d is defined as \u201cthe female genital organ; <em>also: </em>sexual intercourse with a woman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305. In addition to being a female dog, \u201cbitch\u201d is defined as \u201ca malicious, spiteful, or overbearing woman-sometimes used as a generalized term of abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In <em>Allman, </em>the defendant was charged with violating Code \u00a7 18.2-427 when he repeatedly referred to an attorney as a \u201cpussy\u201d and referenced female excretory functions in a telephone message left for the attorney who had represented a party in a civil suit against the defendant. <em>Allman, </em>43 Va.App. at 106-07, 596 S.E.2d at 532. Similar to \u201ccunt,\u201d the word, \u201cpussy\u201d \u201cis defined by <em>Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>as \u2018vulg[ar] slang\u2019 for either (1) the female genitals or (2) sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 596 S.E.2d at 535 (quoting <em>Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>1571 (2d ed. 1998)). The Court found that the defendant used the word \u201cpussy\u201d to characterize the attorney as weak or cowardly and that his use of the word did not reference a sexual act and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>no sexual connotations. <em>Id. </em>The Court also held that appellant\u2019s repeated references to female excretory functions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlB\">d[id] not establish that the message, <em>\u201cconsidered as a whole,\u201d </em>either (1) <em>\u201c[had] as its dominant theme </em>... an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, ... excretory functions or products thereof\u2019 or (2) <em>went \u201csubstantially beyond the customary limits of candor </em>in description or representation of such matters.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-372 (emphases added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 113, 596 S.E.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, using the definition of obscene set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-372, and the requisite standard of review, we hold that appellant\u2019s use of the phrases \u201cfucking cunt\u201d and \u201cfucking bitch\u201d was insufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude the references were obscene. Although the words \u201cfucking\u201d and \u201ccunt\u201d can have sexual connotations when utilized in certain contexts, appellant\u2019s use of these words \u201cconsidered as a whole\u201d and in the context in which they were spoken, did not establish that the communication had \u201cas its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex ... [or] w[ent] substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-372. Rather, the evidence showed that appellant became angry and upset with the victim when she refused to talk with him and when she did not agree with his assertion that they had plans to spend the evening together. He expressed his hatred for the victim in the conversation. In addition, appellant admitted that he was \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cvery mad\u201d at the victim when she acted like he was \u201cnot even her boyfriend.\u201d Furthermore, appellant had had a physical altercation with the victim\u2019s then boyfriend just prior to making the telephone call. Appellant used the offensive words as vulgar curse or swear words to communicate his frustration, anger, contempt or disgust with the victim after the incident. <em>See United States v. Landham, </em>251 F.3d 1072, 1087 (6th Cir.2001) (holding statement made via telephone using the term \u201ccuntless fuck\u201d was not obscene for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>purposes of violating 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but was an invective where husband swore vulgarly at wife because he was frustrated with their relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s language failed to meet the definition of obscene as required by <em>Allman </em>and Code \u00a7 18.2-372. \u201cBecause the language was not obscene, it did not violate the statute, and we need not consider whether appellant acted with the intent \u2018to coerce, intimidate, or harass.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allman, </em>43 Va.App. at 113, 596 S.E.2d at 536. For these reasons, appellant\u2019s conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-427 is reversed and the charge is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-14\">. Appellant was also convicted of destruction of property and two counts of assault and battery. He does not challenge the former. We denied his petition for appeal to the latter. <em>See Lofgren v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 1349-08-2 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-15\">. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a) \"makes it a crime to make, create, or solicit and initiate the transmission in interstate commerce \u2018any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Landham, </em>251 F.3d at 1085 (quoting 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 223(a) (Supp.2000)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
