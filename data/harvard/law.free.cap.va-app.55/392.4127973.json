He argues that the Commonwealth failed to produce sufficient evidence to convict him of either charge. A panel of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Court affirmed McMillan\u2019s conviction for attempted capital murder. <em>See McMillan v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No.2074-07-2, 2009 WL 667190 (Va.Ct.App. Mar. 17, 2009). A majority of the panel reversed McMillan\u2019s conviction of possession of a concealed weapon by a previously convicted felon, concluding that the knife McMillan possessed was neither one of those items enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) nor was it a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The Commonwealth petitioned for rehearing en banc, asserting the panel erred in finding the evidence was insufficient to support McMillan\u2019s conviction of possession of a concealed weapon by a felon. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing on that issue and stayed the panel mandate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On rehearing en banc we hold that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, neither establishes that the knife McMillan possessed was one of the items enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) nor that it is a weapon of like kind to one enumerated. Therefore, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of a concealed weapon by a convicted felon and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as it prevailed below, and grant to it all reasonable inferences. <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 732, 734, 636 S.E.2d 436, 437 (2006). So viewed, the evidence proves that on September 8, 2006, police pursued McMillan in a high speed chase that ended when McMillan intentionally crashed the vehicle that he was driving into a vehicle driven by a Virginia State Police Trooper, Nathan Lee Powell. After the crash, Trooper Powell searched the truck McMillan had been driving and found a knife in a sheath riveted to the inside of the driver\u2019s side door. Trooper Powell testified that the knife was a scuba diver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>knife with a full tang. The knife was approximately eight and one half inches long, less than four inches of which constituted the blade. Trooper Powell described the knife as \u201crigid on one side\u201d and \u201csmooth on the other.\u201d McMillan, who had previously been convicted of at least one felony, told Trooper Powell that he carried the knife for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The law prohibits a felon from \u201cknowingly and intentionally carry[ing] about his person, hidden from common observation, any weapon described in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-308.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) enumerates several weapons, including, \u201cany dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, machete, razor, slingshot, spring stick, metal knucks, or blackjack----\u201d This section also prohibits concealing \u201cany weapon of like kind as those enumerated.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>McMillan makes two arguments in support of his claim that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of possession of a concealed weapon by a convicted felon. First, he argues that the evidence failed to prove that his knife was a weapon within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Next, he argues that his knife was not hidden from common observation. We agree that the knife McMillan possessed was not a weapon and, therefore, we do not need to address McMillan\u2019s argument that the item was not concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">To convict McMillan under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), the Commonwealth must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that the knife McMillan possessed is one of the statutorily proscribed items or a \u201cweapon of like kind.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A); <em>see also Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 280, 287, 673 S.E.2d 469, 472 (2009); <em>Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 177, 182, 639 S.E.2d 227, 230 (2007). When reviewing whether the evidence is sufficient, we \u201cpresume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u201d and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002). \u201cThe construction of a statute, however, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>question of law reviewed de novo on appeal.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 287, 673 S.E.2d at 472 (citing <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 180, 639 S.E.2d at 229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230, our Supreme Court provided an analytic framework for evaluating whether an item falls within the purview of this statute. The initial inquiry is whether the bladed item is one enumerated in the statute. <em>Id. </em>If it is, the evidence is sufficient to convict and the inquiry ends. <em>Id. </em>However, if the bladed item is not enumerated, the next question is: is the bladed item a weapon? <em>Id.; Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 409, 415, 650 S.E.2d 89, 91-92 (2007). The analysis ends here if the bladed item is not a weapon. <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 183, 639 S.E.2d at 230; <em>Harris, </em>274 Va. at 415, 650 S.E.2d at 92. Only if the item is a weapon, does \u201cthe analysis continue[ ] to determine if the item possesses such similar characteristics to the enumerated items in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) such that its concealment is prohibited.\u201d <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Applying that framework here, we must first determine whether the knife McMillan possessed is one of the items enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). Our Supreme Court has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_C\">previously defined a \u201cdirk\u201d as \u201c\u2018a long straight-bladed dagger\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u00a3a short sword.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wood v. Henry County Public Schools, </em>255 Va. 85, 95 n. 6, 495 S.E.2d 255, 261 n. 6 [(1998)] (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>642 (1981)); <em>see also Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 242, 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d 177, 179 n. 2 (1994) (defining a dirk as \u201cany stabbing weapon having two sharp edges and a point, including daggers, short swords, and stilettos\u201d). A \u201cdagger\u201d is \u201ca short knife used for stabbing,\u201d and its definition refers to a \u201cstiletto.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>570 (1993). However, the definition of a \u201cstiletto\u201d is not particularly helpful, as it is defined as \u201ca slender dagger with a blade that is thick in proportion to its breadth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2243. The definition of a \u201csword\u201d is more instructive: \u201ca weapon with a long blade for cutting or thrusting set in a hilt usually terminating in a pommel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>often having a tang or a protective guard where the blade joins the handle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 290, 673 S.E.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The Court has also said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">[a] \u201cbowie knife\u201d is \u201c \u2018a large hunting knife adapted [especially] for knife-f\u00edghting\u2019 \u201d with a \u201c 10 to 15 inch [ ] long\u2019 \u201d blade. <em>[Wood, </em>255 Va. at 95 n. 6, 495 S.E.2d at 261 n. 6] (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>262). A \u201cswitchblade knife\u201d is \u201c \u2018a poeketknife having the blade spring-operated so that pressure on a release catch causes it to fly open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2314). A \u201cballistic knife\u201d is \u201c \u2018any knife with a detachable blade that is propelled by a spring-operated mechanism.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-308(N)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7u\"><em>Id. </em>at 288 n. 5, 673 S.E.2d at 472 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The knife McMillan possessed is clearly neither a \u201cswitchblade\u201d knife nor a \u201cballistic knife,\u201d and the Commonwealth does not claim otherwise. On appeal, the Commonwealth argued that McMillan\u2019s knife was either a dirk or a bowie knife or a \u201cweapon of like kind\u201d to one of those knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Observation of McMillan\u2019s knife, however, reveals that it does not match the description of a dirk or bowie knife. Unlike a dirk, the knife McMillan possessed lacked a \u201clong blade\u201d and a \u201cprotective guard where the blade meets the handle\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or a \u201chilt ... terminating in a pommel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 290, 673 S.E.2d at 473. As previously stated, the blade on McMil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Ian\u2019s knife could hardly be described as long in that it measured approximately 3.75 inches. Further observation reveals that McMillan\u2019s knife does not fit the definition of a dirk, described as any stabbing weapon having two sharp edges and a point. The knife at issue has one sharp edge and one manifold edge; approximately half of which is serrated and the remainder of which is blunt. The blunt portion culminates in the point, making its stabbing capability dubious. An examination of the knife at issue similarly reveals that it does not meet the definition of a \u201cbowie knife.\u201d As previously defined by our Supreme Court, a bowie knife is a large knife that has been modified to be a fighting knife. <em>Id. </em>at 288 n. 5, 673 S.E.2d at 472 n. 5. The remainder of that definition that our Supreme Court quoted with approval in <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 288 n. 5, 673 S.E.2d at 472 n. 5, provides that the long blade of a bowie knife is typically curved concavely to a point. <em>Wood, </em>255 Va. at 95 n. 6, 495 S.E.2d at 261 n. 6 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>262 (1981)); <em>see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, supra, </em>at 262. The blade of McMillan\u2019s knife is 3.75 inches, and the total length of the knife is 8.25 inches. The blade is straight on one side and serrated on a portion of the other side. No part of the blade is concave. Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that an 8.25 inch knife is large for a knife or that this knife had been adapted for fighting. Thus, the evidence is insufficient to prove that the knife McMillan possessed was a bowie knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Because the item McMillan possessed is not one of the enumerated items in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), the analysis then turns to whether the item is a weapon. For an item \u201cto be a \u201cweapon\u2019 within the definition of \u201cweapon of like kind,\u2019 the item must be designed for fighting purposes or commonly understood to be a \u201cweapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>274 Va. at 415, 650 S.E.2d at 92 (quoting <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230). Our Supreme Court was recently called upon to determine whether a butterfly knife is a statutorily proscribed weapon or one of like kind. <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 288-89, 673 S.E.2d at 472-73. In <em>Thompson, </em>a police officer testified that knives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>like the butterfly knife at issue are \u201c \u2018edge weapons [that] are very dangerous for police officers, due to the fact that they are easily concealed, and specifically ones like [Thompson\u2019s] that only require one hand to operate are very dangerous\u2019 \u201d and that he has retrieved \u201c \u2018this exact type of knife\u2019 ... from gang members on several occasions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 673 S.E.2d at 470. Our Supreme Court concluded that there was sufficient evidence in the record to prove that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1V\">Thompson\u2019s butterfly knife is a \u201cweapon\u201d because the evidence at trial concerning the knife\u2019s physical characteristics and method of operation established that it is \u201cdesigned for fighting purposes\u201d and is \u201ccommonly understood to be a \u2018weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230; <em>accord Harris, </em>274 Va. at 415, 650 S.E.2d at 92.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 288, 673 S.E.2d at 472-73. Our Supreme Court went further to cite cases from other jurisdictions that discussed the nature of a butterfly knife, its physical characteristics, and its reputation as a weapon. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Taylor v. McManus, </em>661 F.Supp. 11, 13 (E.D.Tenn.1986); <em>State v. Powell, </em>798 S.W.2d 709, 711 (Mo.1990); <em>City of Columbus v. Dawson, </em>28 Ohio App.3d 45, 501 N.E.2d 677, 679 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Such evidence is lacking, however, from the facts of this case regarding the knife in question. At McMillan\u2019s trial, the police officer testified that McMillan possessed a scuba knife. Unlike the police officer in <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 285, 673 S.E.2d at 470, the officer in this case did not testify about the knife\u2019s method of operation, the purpose for which it was designed, or its commonly understood uses. Therefore, the record is devoid of any facts on which one could find that the knife is either designed for fighting purposes or commonly understood to be a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Though McMillan testified that he carried the knife for protection, this statement does not change the physical characteristics of the knife he possessed or its method of operation such that it becomes a weapon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Thompson, </em>277 Va. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>291, 673 S.E.2d at 474 (stating that \u201cas we explained in <em>Farrakhan, </em>\u2018[subsequent use or circumstances may not be considered in the definitional analysis of \u201cweapon.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Nor can the purpose for which an individual carries a knife be dispositive as to whether that knife is either \u201cdesigned for fighting purposes\u201d or \u201ccommonly understood\u201d to be a weapon. <em>Cf. State v. Giltner, </em>56 Haw. 374, 537 P.2d 14, 16 (1975) (holding that a scuba diver\u2019s knife is not a \u201cdeadly or dangerous weapon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Though the knife in question, much like a kitchen knife, pocket knife, box cutter, butterfly knife, or letter opener, could be a dangerous instrument in the hands of a person with criminal intent, the issue before this Court is \u201cwhat is proscribed by statute as unlawful not simply what may be dangerous.\u201d <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 183, 639 S.E.2d at 230. We strictly construe penal statutes against the Commonwealth. <em>Harris, </em>274 Va. at 414, 650 S.E.2d at 91 (citing <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230). We conclude that the evidence before us does not establish that McMillan\u2019s \u201cscuba\u201d knife is designed for fighting purposes nor is it commonly understood to be a weapon. Because we conclude that McMil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Ian\u2019s knife is neither enumerated in the statute nor is it a weapon, we need not address whether it is a weapon of like kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">For these reasons, we reverse and vacate McMillan\u2019s conviction for possession of a concealed weapon by a convicted felon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">. This Court's decision to grant rehearing en banc vacates only the prior decision related to the issue or issues presented by the party requesting a rehearing. <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 427, 432-33, 658 S.E.2d 692, 695 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\">. Trooper Powell testified that the knife had a \"full tang.\u201d A \"tang\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHb\">a piece that forms an extension from the blade or analogous part of an instrument (as a table knife or fork, file, chisel, or sword) and connects with the handle and that may be a thin flat plate on each side of which a rounded piece is secured to form the handle or that may be a tapered piece inserted into the haft or handle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-11\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2336 (1993). Thus, the \"full tang\u201d described by Trooper Powell means that the blade of McMillan\u2019s knife continued through the entire handle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\">. A \u201cpommel\u201d is \"the knob on the hilt of a sword or saber.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, supra, </em>at 1762.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">. In his dissent, Judge Kelsey affords great weight to the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s language in <em>Farrakhan: </em>\"Because an offense under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) is \u2018possessory\u2019 in nature, it is committed upon concealment. Subsequent use or circumstances may not be considered in the definitional analysis of \u2018weapon.\u2019 \" <em>Infra </em>at 409, 686 S.E.2d at 533. The dissent reasons that this language supports the proposition that the individual appellant\u2019s intended use at the moment he conceals the item is relevant as to whether the item appellant possessed is a proscribed item or a weapon of like kind. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, Judge Kelsey cites to the Supreme Court of Virginia's decision in <em>Thompson </em>for the proposition that \"a knife can be a weapon either by design or common use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This overly literal interpretation of the language in <em>Farrakhan, </em>however, ignores the remainder of the paragraph the dissent cited and eviscerates the analytic framework laid out in <em>Farrakhan </em>and applied in <em>Thompson. </em>A logical reading of these cases and the analytic framework set forth therein indicates that it is the <em>common </em>use, not intended use by an individual, that is relevant to whether an item is a weapon of like kind under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Had Farrakhan intended to use the chef\u2019s knife to perpetrate a robbery at the moment he concealed it, as one could infer from the facts of that case, the chef\u2019s knife would still only be a cooking instrument and not a proscribed item or a weapon of like kind. Thus, McMillan's intended use for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>knife he concealed is only relevant, if at all, to a determination of the knife's common use.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b448-8\">PETTY, J., with whom ALSTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Acn\">joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Because the issue before us does not involve the constitutional over-breadth or vagueness of this statute, we must once again limit our discussion to whether this particular knife is a dirk, bowie knife or a weapon of like kind. For the reasons set out in the majority opinion, I agree that it is not and I concur in both the reasoning and the conclusion of the majority. I write separately simply to point that, while we analyze this particular knife and thus decide this case, once again we fail to provide real guidance to police, prosecutors or the citizens of this Commonwealth as to exactly what conduct is criminal under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The statutory language we are called upon to define\u2014\u201cdirk, bowie knife ... or weapon of like kind\u201d\u2014has appeared in the Code of Virginia since at least 1849. Title 54, Chapter 7, \u00a7 7 Code of Virginia (1849) made it illegal to \u201chabitually, carry about [one\u2019s person] hid from common observation, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife or weapon of like kind.\u201d Apparently, at that time, a mere thirteen years after the death of the designer of one of the knives in question, Colonel James Bowie, Virginians did not have much trouble differentiating this weapon, or weapons like it, from more utilitarian knives such as hunting knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">By the end of the twentieth century, however, that recognition had apparently faded. In 1998 our Supreme Court was first called upon to determine which bladed weapons fell within the scope of the statute. In <em>Wood v. Henry County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Public Schools, </em>255 Va. 85, 495 S.E.2d 255 (1998), the Court concluded that a pocketknife was \u201cneither a dirk, bowie knife ... nor a weapon of like kind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 495 S.E.2d at 260. Since that date, our Supreme Court and this Court have considered the applicability of Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) to various types of knives on no fewer than ten separate occasions, and the only consistency in the conclusions reached has been inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In 1998, we held that a kitchen knife was not a weapon of like kind. <em>Ricks v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 442, 499 S.E.2d 575 (1998). Seven years later, we were again called upon to consider the same type of knife, and we reached the same conclusion. <em>Goodunn v. Commonwealth, </em>No.2006-04-1, 2005 WL 1610764 (Va.Ct.App. July 12, 2005) (An eight to ten inch long steak knife with a six inch blade is not weapon of like kind.). That same year, however, we held that a twelve and three-quarter inch kitchen knife with a seven and three-quarter inch blade was a weapon of like kind because of the offensive manner in which it was used. <em>Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1804-04-4, 2005 WL 3157740 (Va.Ct.App. Nov.29, 2005). However, our Supreme Court reversed, holding that the offense of carrying a concealed weapon is completed at the time of concealment, and, thus, the subsequent use of the knife was irrelevant in determining if it was a weapon. <em>Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 177, 639 S.E.2d 227 (2007).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We have also applied the statute to other types of potentially dangerous cutting instruments. For example, we concluded that a box cutter was a weapon of like kind to a razor, <em>O\u2019Banion v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 47, 531 S.E.2d 599 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>(2000) (en banc), and that a razor blade is a razor under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), <em>Sykes v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 262, 556 S.E.2d 794 (2001). Our Supreme Court affirmed our decision in <em>O\u2019Banion </em>in an unpublished order. <em>O\u2019Banion v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 002014 (Va. May 7, 2001). However, six years later, it overruled <em>O\u2019Banion </em>and held that a box cutter was not a weapon of like kind. <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 409, 650 S.E.2d 89 (2007). The Court reasoned that \u201c[mjerely because a box cutter contains a sharp-edged, razor-type blade that is retractable does not mean that a box cutter meets the definition of the item \u2018razor\u2019 enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-380(A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 650 S.E.2d at 91. While recognizing that \u201ca box cutter is a potentially dangerous instrumentality and had, in fact, been used as such in the past\u201d our Supreme Court explained that \u201cit is ... the role of the General Assembly, not this Court, to craft any needed revisions to Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) and to decide what items to include within the statute\u2019s proscription.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 650 S.E.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Finally, this Court has held that a butterfly knife was a weapon of like kind, <em>Kingrey v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 2202-97-2, 1999 WL 1129723 (Va.Ct.App. July 13, 1999), and that a folding knife that locks open was a weapon of like kind as well, <em>Ohin v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 194, 622 S.E.2d 784 (2005). However, the Supreme Court later concluded that a butterfly knife is not a weapon of like kind. <em>Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 280, 673 S.E.2d 469 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">A review of these cases demonstrates the perplexity that exists among law enforcement officers, prosecutors, trial judges, and appellate judges over the scope of this statute. In an attempt to define its terms, we have resorted to embracing the \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d logic of Justice Stewart, <em>see Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 1683, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (Stewart, J. concurring),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by including a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>picture of the offending knife in our opinion. <em>See infra </em>at 408, 686 S.E.2d at 533, 413, 686 S.E.2d at 535; <em>see also Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 508, 515, 642 S.E.2d 774, 778 (2007). Moreover, on occasion, we even find the same jurist coming to a different conclusion when considering a similarly described knife. <em>Compare Kingrey, </em>No. 2202-97-2, 1999 WL 1129723 (affirming a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) and concluding that an open butterfly knife closely resembles a dirk), <em>with Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 280, 673 S.E.2d at 469 (reversing a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) and concluding that the \u201cevidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the butterfly knife is \u2018of like kind\u2019 to a dirk or any other weapon enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">I recognize the very legitimate and necessary purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-308\u2014\u201cto interdict the practice of carrying a deadly weapon about the person, concealed and yet so accessible as to afford prompt and immediate use.\u201d <em>Schaaf v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 429, 430, 258 S.E.2d 574, 574-75 (1979). I also recognize, however, that there are very legitimate and lawful reasons to carry a concealed sharp instrument that is capable of injuring another person. Clearly, the General Assembly did not intend to prohibit all such conduct simply because of that capability. Because the \u201c[subsequent use or circumstances may not be considered in the definitional analysis of [a] \u2018weapon,\u2019 \u201d <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230, we must, therefore, continue to engage in an <em>ad hoc </em>comparison of the knife in question with weapons that are today primarily found in museums and knife collections.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In doing so, I am concerned that we are forgetting that a \u201cstatute or ordinance [must] be sufficiently precise and definite to give fair warning to an actor that contemplated conduct is criminal.\u201d <em>Tanner v.

Whatever clarity and certainty it had in 1849 has been obfuscated by a series of confusing and sometimes contradictory interpretations as we have attempted to conform nineteenth century language to twenty-first century reality. As a result, it now provides neither notice to the citizenry of what conduct it criminalizes, nor does it provide guidance to the members of law enforcement and the prosecutors who must enforce it or the judges who must apply it. Additionally, because a literal application of this statute excludes many dangerous bladed weapons and ignores the intent of the accused, it does not effectively \u201cinterdict the practice of carrying a [concealed] deadly weapon about the person.\u201d <em>Schaaf, </em>220 Va. at 430, 258 S.E.2d at 574-75.

Neither party has raised that issue in this case. And we do not have the benefit of either briefing or oral argument on the subject. I also question whether it is \u201cappropriate for judges to heap either praise or censure upon a legislative measure that comes before them,\u201d <em>Kansas v. Marsh, </em>548 U.S. 163, 186, 126 S.Ct. 2516, 2532, 165 L.Ed.2d 429 (2006) (Scalia, J., concurring), particularly when doing so concludes with the suggestion that the legislature should give the judicially censured statute a \u201cdecent burial,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 406, 686 S.E.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The only issue before us is whether McMillan\u2019s knife\u2014 which he admittedly possessed \u201cfor protection\u201d and kept by his side in a sheath riveted to the inside of the driver\u2019s door of his vehicle\u2014was a weapon of \u201clike kind\u201d to one of the knives listed in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). The trial judge, sitting as factfinder, found it was. Finding no error of law in the trial judge\u2019s reading of the statute and no factual insufficiency in the evidence, I would affirm his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) treats a knife as a \u201cweapon\u201d if it is either \u201cdesigned for fighting purposes\u201d or nonetheless \u201ccommonly understood\u201d to be a weapon. <em>Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 280, 288, 673 S.E.2d 469, 472-73 (2009) (citation omitted). Thus, a knife becomes a statutory weapon either by design <em>or </em>by common use. If a knife constitutes a weapon under either definition, the knife fits within the \u201clike kind\u201d category only if it is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to one of the knives specifically mentioned in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). <em>Id. </em>at 290, 673 S.E.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In this case, the trial court found that McMillan\u2019s knife was a weapon substantially similar to a \u201cdirk\u201d\u2014one of the knives specifically mentioned in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). \u201cA \u2018dirk\u2019 or weapon of like kind is any stabbing weapon having two sharp edges and a point, including <em>daggers, </em>short swords and stilettos.\u201d <em>Richards v.

The primary bevels on the symmetrically tapered blade create a spear-point tip centered along the blade\u2019s long axis. One edge has a straight v-shaped bevel. The other edge has a beveled tip followed by a sharpened serration. Both the straight and serrated edges are razor sharp. The hilt lacks a protruding guard, but uses instead a deeply indented tang\u2014notched for enhanced grip\u2014 to accomplish the same purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The knife has three large holes drilled though the skeleton handle.

Instead, McMillan\u2019s knife is an aggressively crafted weapon \u201cdesigned for stabbing purposes like a dagger,\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 291, 673 S.E.2d at 474, substantial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ly similar (though not identical) in design and function to a dirk.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In reaching this conclusion, I see no reason why we should not also take into account McMillan\u2019s statement about <em>his </em>ongoing use of the knife as a weapon for his personal protection. <em>See ante </em>at 400, 686 S.E.2d at 529; post at 411, 686 S.E.2d at 584 n. 12. <em>Farrakhan </em>held that <em>\u201c[subsequent </em>use or circumstances may not be considered in the definitional analysis of \u201cweapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farrakhan v.

That holding, however, begs the question: Subsequent to what? <em>Farrakhan </em>answers in the sentence immediately preceding: \u201cBecause an offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) is \u2018possessory\u2019 in nature, it is committed upon concealment.\u201d <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Thus, as <em>Farrakhan </em>makes clear, the subsequent use that cannot be considered is the defendant\u2019s use of the knife <em>after </em>he conceals it\u2014that is, after he commits the crime. In contrast, his intended use <em>when </em>he conceals it\u2014that is, when he commits the crime\u2014while obviously not dispositive is still relevant. To be sure, if a defendant understands a specific type of knife to be an effective fighting weapon (particularly if he conceals it solely for this purpose), that fact may corroborate the inference that the knife is \u201ccommonly understood\u201d to be a weapon. <em>See Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 288, 673 S.E.2d at 472 (holding that a knife can be a weapon either by design or common use); <em>cf. ante </em>at 401, 686 S.E.2d at 529 n. 4 (acknowledging that the defendant\u2019s \u201cintended use for the knife\u201d could be relevant \u201cto a determination of the knife\u2019s common use\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">. \"A hilt is the 'handle of a weapon or tool, esp. of a sword or dagger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohin v.

In <em>Gilliam </em>this Court determined that the knife in question was a weapon based on its physical characteristics and on the fact that \u201cthe knife is clearly not an \u2018innocuous household [knife or an] industrial kni[fe] which may be carried for legitimate purposes.\u2019\u201d 49 Va.App. at 514-15, 642 S.E.2d at 777-78 (2007) (quoting <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 242, 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d 177, 179 n. 2 (1994)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">As shown in the photograph above, the knife here consists of a fixed blade with one sharp edge and one serrated edge culminating in a point suitable for stabbing. The knife is eight and one half (8 1/2) inches long with the blade measuring about four (4) inches. At trial, the officer described the knife as \u201crigid [[sic], in context it is obvious that what he actually said was \u201cridged\u201d] on one side, smooth on the other, comes to a point,\u201d and further described it as \u201csome sort of diver\u2019s knife.\u201d While the officer described it as a diver\u2019s knife and did not mention the knife\u2019s method of operation, purpose for which it is designed, or uses which it is commonly understood to be put to, we have the physical description on the record and the actual knife before us as an exhibit. In addition we have the trial court\u2019s factual finding that it is \u201ctwo-edged\u201d and has \u201ca point to it.\u201d Based on these facts, this knife is not just an \u201cinnocuous household knife\u201d nor is it an \u201cindustrial knife\u201d carried for a legitimate purpose.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, in my view and contrary to the holding of the majority, the evidence at trial established that the knife in issue is a bladed instrument that can be used for offensive or defensive combat and is therefore \u201ccommonly understood to be a \u2018weapon.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Because I would hold that the knife in this ease is a weapon, I now turn to whether the knife \u201c\u2018possesses such similar characteristics to the enumerated items in the Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) such that its concealment is prohibited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 289, 673 S.E.2d at 473 (quoting <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230). To be a weapon \u201cof like kind,\u201d the item has to be \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to an enumerated weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 673 S.E.2d at 473. In addition to the dictionary definition recited in <em>Wood, supra </em>note 13, other characteristics of a bowie knife are that it is \u201c \u2018a stabbing weapon having a single sharp edge, a dull or serrated flat edge and a point, such as a hunting knife, a fishing knife or a survivalist\u2019s knife.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>49 Va.App. at 514 n. 5, 642 S.E.2d at 777 n. 5 (quoting <em>Richards, </em>18 Va.App. at 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d at 179 n. 2). Both definitions are consistent with each other and I therefore take them together in determining whether the weapon in this case is \u201cof like kind\u201d to a bowie knife.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, as noted in <em>Wood </em>and reiterated in <em>Thompson, </em>a dirk is \u201ca long straight-bladed dagger or a short sword.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 282, 673 S.E.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The knife in question in this case, while not precisely congruent to either, has many significant similarities to both a bowie knife and a dirk. Here, even though the knife is not ten to fifteen (10-15) inches long, nor does it have a slight dip at the top of the blade, it has other substantially similar characteristics to both types of weapon. The knife here is eight and one half (8 1/2) inches long and is clearly designed for either cutting or stabbing. Its blade has one sharp edge, a serrated flat edge, and comes to a sharp point. As a \u201cdiver\u2019s knife,\u201d it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>is certainly akin to a hunting, fishing or survivalist\u2019s knife. It also has a fixed blade suitable for stabbing like a dagger, and it is typically carried in a sheath and thus shares the essential characteristics of a dirk. In my view, even though the officer describes the knife as being a \u201cdiver\u2019s knife,\u201d this fact does not take away the knife\u2019s obvious physical characteristics that are substantially similar to those of both a bowie knife and a dirk. Applying these two definitions separately to the knife in question, I would hold that it is substantially similar and thus \u201cof like kind\u201d to both a bowie knife and a dirk and therefore proscribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Because I would hold that McMillan\u2019s knife is a \u201cweapon of like kind,\u201d I would also address McMillan\u2019s contention that the knife was not concealed. That argument, however, is one that he makes for the first time on appeal. In his brief, McMillan acknowledged that he failed to present that argument to the trial court, and asks us to invoke the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception of Rule 5A:18 and address the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Rule 5A:18 provides that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d \u201cThe ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18 is narrow and is to be used sparingly.\u201d <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 424, 442, 592 S.E.2d 391, 399 (2004). In order for the exception to apply, \u201c[t]he record \u2018must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akers v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 521, 528 n. 2, 525 S.E.2d 13, 16 n. 2 (2000) (quoting <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u201cIn order to show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, an appellant must demonstrate more than that the Commonwealth failed to prove an element of the offense.\u201d <em>Redman, </em>25 Va.App. at 221, 487 S.E.2d at 272-73. The \u201cappellant must demonstrate that he or she was convicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense or the record must affirmatively prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>that an element of the offense did not occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 487 S.E.2d at 273. \u201cTherefore, \u2018in examining a case for miscarriage of justice, we do not simply review the sufficiency of the evidence under the usual standard, but instead determine whether the record contains affirmative evidence of innocence or lack of a criminal offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wheeler v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 689, 692, 607 S.E.2d 133, 135 (2005) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 126, 134, 596 S.E.2d 542, 546 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">McMillan does not claim that carrying a concealed weapon is not a criminal offense. Thus, for the ends of justice exception to be applicable here, the record must contain evidence affirmatively proving that McMillan\u2019s knife was not \u201chidden from common observation.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Trooper Powell\u2019s testimony is the only information in the record regarding the location of McMillan\u2019s knife. Trooper Powell testified that he found the knife in a sheath that was \u201criveted\u201d to the inside of the driver\u2019s side door of McMillan\u2019s truck. When asked where the sheath was riveted to the door, Powell answered, \u201cMidway, accessible to his left hand.\u201d Regardless of whether that testimony is sufficient to prove that the knife was hidden from common observation, it does not affirmatively prove that it was not. Thus, the ends of justice exception is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">For these reasons, I would affirm McMillan\u2019s conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">. Although framed in legalese, essentially, like the character portrayed by Paul Hogan in the film \"Crocodile Dundee,\u201d we find ourselves repeatedly posing the question in these cases, \"You call that a knife?\u201d and occasionally agreeing; \"Now THAT\u2019S a knife?\u201d While I am in agreement with Judge Petty that in responding to that question, we should not undertake a \"we know it when we see it\u201d type of analysis, I do not agree that we have reached this point yet. No issue of constitutional dimension with respect to this statute has previously been before us and none is before us now, and so, while I am sympathetic to the position expressed by Judge Petty in his concurrence, I am loathe to decide this case on issues neither presented nor briefed. This Court and our Supreme Court have struggled mightily, if perhaps with mixed success, to provide clear and consistent guidance to trial courts, police officers, and the citizens of the Commonwealth regarding the legality of carrying concealed, the contemporary cousins of bowie knives, daggers or dirks-items commonly carried by many in centuries past. Whether we can continue to be successful in this endeavor is obviously a matter of some debate among the members of this Court, but as long as the statute exists, we have a duty to continue to try.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b457-5\">. I agree with the majority that Judge Kelsey's dissent relies upon an incorrect interpretation of the language in <em>Farrakhan </em>and ignores the remainder of the paragraph he cites in support of his analysis, thereby \u201cevisceratpng] the analytic framework laid out in <em>Farrakhan </em>and applied in <em>Thompson.\" See supra </em>at 401, 686 S.E.2d at 529 n. 4. I further agree with the majority that \"[a] logical reading of these cases and the analytic framework set forth therein indicates that it is the common use, not intended use by an individual, that is relevant to whether an item is a weapon of like kind under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">.

A \"bowie knife\u201d is defined as \" 'a large hunting knife adapted [especially] for knife-fighting and common in western frontier regions and having a guarded handle and a strong single-edge blade typically 10 to 15 inches long with its back straight for most of its length and then curving concavely and sometimes in a sharpened edge to the point.' \" <em>Wood v.

The Court in <em>Gilliam </em>further baised its determination that the knife was a weapon on the circumstances under which the individual possessed the item because at that time the Court held that the \" \u2018circumstances surrounding its possession and uses\u2019 \" were relevant to \" 'defining [the] characteristics of the item in question.' \" <em>Gilliam, </em>49 Va.App. at 514, 642 S.E.2d at 777 (quoting <em>Delcid, </em>32 Va.App. at 19, 526 S.E.2d at 275). However, as noted by the majority, <em>Thompson </em>held that \" \u2018[subsequent use or circumstances may not be considered in the definitional analysis of \"weapon.\u201d ' <em>\" </em>277 Va. at 291, 673 S.E.2d at 474 (quoting <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b459-5\">. I recognize that in <em>Farrakhan, </em>and subsequently in <em>Thompson, </em>our Supreme Court made it clear that the use of the item or circumstances of possession may not be considered in the analysis of whether or not a particular item is a \" 'weapon' \u201d impacted by Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). <em>Thompson, </em>277 Va. at 291, 673 S.E.2d at 474 (quoting <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230). Thus, in yet another example of what often makes any attempt to construe this statute particularly difficult, the characterization in the record by Trooper Powell that this particular item was a \"diver\u2019s knife\u201d along with the item itself, would seem to provide the entire framework for our analysis and the fact that McMillan told Trooper Powell at the scene that he had riveted the knife to the door of his vehicle where no denizen of the deep was likely to be found and that he did so \"for protection\u201d since he was \"a country boy living in the city\u201d is of no moment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\">.

While <em>Goodwin </em>is unpublished, this Court can consider the rationale used and adopt it here since it is persuasive. <em>Fairfax County Sch. Bd. v.

In reaching this conclusion, I tend to agree with Judge Humphreys\u2019s analysis in his dissent to the extent that the knife here is \u201ca weapon of like kind\u201d to a bowie knife. In addition, I agree with the portion of Judge Kelsey\u2019s dissent that distinguishes <em>Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 177, 639 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>227 (2007), from the circumstances presented by this case, particularly as Farrakhan only indicated an intent to use the kitchen knife as a weapon <em>after </em>he removed it from its place of concealment, <em>id. </em>at 180, 689 S.E.2d at 229, whereas here, in contrast, McMillan admitted that he intended to use his rather menacing knife as a weapon for his protection <em>when he concealed it </em>in his vehicle. While I agree with the majority opinion that this admission alone is certainly not dispositive of whether the knife is actually a weapon, appellant\u2019s admission is a probative factor to consider when determining if the evidence is sufficient to prove that the knife is a weapon. Therefore, when appellant\u2019s admission is considered together with the other evidence in this case, I would find that the evidence is sufficient to prove the knife is a weapon.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
