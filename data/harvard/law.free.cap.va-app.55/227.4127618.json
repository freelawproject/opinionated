ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">In 1997, Melissa Antoinette Jones filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim and shortly thereafter settled the claim. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>original claim letter alleged various injuries, including injury to her left side and knee. The Memorandum of Agreement, however, narrowed the scope of her injuries and conspicuously excluded any mention of any left knee injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Eleven years later, Jones sought an additional award for an injury to her left knee caused by the 1997 accident. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission held Jones abandoned her left knee claim. Refusing to \u201cadjudicate cases piecemeal,\u201d the commission held that issues \u201craised and not pursued or determined by hearing or formal agreement are abandoned unless specifically deferred.\u201d On appeal, Jones argues the commission erred as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In 1997, Jones fell off a chair at work. Represented by counsel, Jones filed a claim alleging injuries to her \u201cneck, back, left side, knee, head, arm and shoulder.\u201d The claim letter requested a hearing \u201cseeking an adjudication of her entitlement to all benefits including temporary total, temporary partial, permanent partial disability and medical arising out of the industrial accident which occurred on or about 4-30-97.\u201d Before scheduling the hearing, the commission asked Jones to clarify the specific relief she requested. Counsel for Jones restated the claim as a request for temporary total benefits as well as permanent loss benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Later, in October 1997, the commission was informed that the parties had resolved the dispute. The commission entered an order stating that because \u201cthe parties have resolved the matter in controversy by Memorandum of Agreement ... the scheduled hearing is cancelled contingent upon the executed agreement being submitted\u201d to the commission within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">With advice of counsel, Jones entered into a Memorandum of Agreement using a form provided by the commission. The instructions for the form advised Jones to \u201cbe sure to ... indicate all parts of the body affected in the \u2018Nature of Injury* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>box.\u201d In that box, entitled \u201cNature of injury or illness, including parts of body affected,\u201d the Memorandum of Agreement identified Jones\u2019s injuries as \u201cCervical and dorsal strains; left arm and hand injury.\u201d Jones signed the agreement which included a certification \u201cthat the facts relating to this accident are correct as presented on this form____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The agreed-upon compensation award included a period of temporary total benefits and, by a Supplemental Memorandum of Agreement executed the same day, temporary partial benefits. The instructions accompanying the Supplemental Memorandum of Agreement advised that it was to be used \u201cwhenever additional periods of compensation occur for an accident or illness for which an initial Memorandum of Agreement has already been submitted.\u201d In January 1998, the commission entered an \u201cAward Order\u201d approving the settlement and directing the employer to pay Jones temporary, (total and partial) benefits and lifetime medical benefits for the claimed injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In April 1998, Jones requested a change-in-condition hearing seeking additional temporary total and partial benefits. The employer contested the request as medically unsupportable. To avoid further litigation, however, the parties submitted another Supplemental Memorandum of Agreement authorizing additional temporary total benefits. This form, like the earlier one, made clear it applied only to \u201cadditional periods of compensation\u201d for an \u201caccident or illness for which an initial Memorandum of Agreement has already been submitted.\u201d The commission entered another order approving the supplemental agreement and awarding the agreed-upon benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">About ten years later, in 2008, Jones filed a new claim\u2014 based upon the same 1997 worksite accident\u2014seeking a permanent loss award for, among other things, an injury to her left knee. The commission denied the 2008 claim as untimely under the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Code \u00a7 65.2-601. The commission also ruled the 1997 claim alleging a knee injury, while timely, had been settled by a Memorandum of Agreement that narrowed the scope of the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>contested claim. \u201cWe conclude,\u201d the commission found, \u201cthat the claimant abandoned her original claim for a knee injury by executing MOAs that did not list the left knee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Following a long line of its own precedent, the commission in this case explained: \u201cWe frequently have held that the Commission does not adjudicate cases piecemeal. Issues raised and not pursued or determined by hearing or formal agreement are abandoned unless specifically deferred.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Jones does not challenge the commission\u2019s restatement of the abandonment doctrine or seek to overturn it. Instead, Jones contends the commission\u2019s application of the doctrine to her left knee injury was \u201cunsupported by the evidence and should be reversed.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4. She raises several reasons why this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">First, Jones argues the 1997 Memorandum of Agreement did not need to list the injury to the left knee because the settlement \u201cresolved only part\u201d of her claim. <em>Id. </em>The commission disagreed with this reasoning, as do we. The Memorandum of Agreement required Jones to \u201cindicate <em>all </em>parts of the body\u201d injured as a result of the accident. (Emphasis added.) Nothing in the agreement implied Jones was free to list some, but not all, of her claimed injuries. Nor can Jones reasonably contend she had not previously raised the permanent loss issue related to her left knee. Prior to signing the agreement, Jones claimed her injuries included her left side and knee. Both her original claim and her clarification letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>sought an award for permanent loss benefits. In this context, the commission understandably concluded the settlement \u201cresolved the matter in controversy\u201d and cancelled the evidentiary hearing previously scheduled to resolve all contested issues. Jones points to nothing in the record suggesting she specifically deferred the left knee permanency claim for adjudication ten years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Second, Jones asserts that the commission failed to take into account the 1998 change-of-condition application and various medical records mentioning treatment for her left knee <em>after </em>the 1997 Memorandum of Agreement. We again disagree. Whatever the legal relevance of the 1998 application to the abandonment issue, the commission correctly pointed out that the 1998 application requested only temporary wage (not permanent loss) benefits. The application did not attempt to expand upon the description of Jones\u2019s injuries which the parties agreed to in the 1997 Memorandum of Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">As for the post-1997 medical reports, the commission acknowledged that some \u201ccontain several references to the claimant\u2019s left knee.\u201d But the content and context of these references, the commission nonetheless found, were \u201csimply too vague to constitute the filing of a claim for the claimant\u2019s left knee\u201d and addressed \u201ca multitude of conditions that may or may not be related\u201d to Jones\u2019s 1997 accident. Because the record supports the commission\u2019s factual findings on this issue, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A), we have no authority to set them aside.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Finally, Jones contends the commission\u2019s ruling is inconsistent with <em>Boxley v. Onorato, </em>218 Va. 931, 243 S.E.2d 201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(1978). We do not see the conflict. <em>Boxley </em>did not address, much less reject, the commission\u2019s abandonment doctrine. Instead, in <em>Boxley, </em>the parties agreed to a description of the injuries in a memorandum of agreement. Within the statutory limitations period, they <em>expanded </em>the agreed-upon scope of injuries by executing a supplemental agreement specifically incorporating by reference medical reports providing a more expansive description of the injuries. We face the inverse scenario. Jones filed a timely claim that <em>included </em>her left knee. Her later memorandum agreement <em>narrowed </em>the scope of the injuries. And her supplemental agreements neither expanded nor contracted the scope of injuries. Jones abandoned a claim for an injury she had previously filed, while the claimant in <em>Boxley </em>timely supplemented a claim for an injury she had not previously claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In sum, we find no error in the commission\u2019s application of the abandonment doctrine to this case. As the commission rightly observed, it cannot administer a complex adjudicatory system in a piecemeal fashion. When parties advise the commission prior to an evidentiary hearing that a disputed claim has been settled and an agreement reached, the commission should be able to rely on that agreement to define the agreed-upon scope of the claim and to set the boundaries for a consent award.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Finding no error in the commission\u2019s application of the abandonment doctrine to the facts of this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. <em>See Swain v.

The commission added an alternative reason for rejecting Jones\u2019s argument: \"Moreover, these medical reports were submitted before the parties submitted the second MOA. Thus, to the extent that these records could constitute a claim, it was abandoned by the filing of the second MOA.\u201d Because the commission\u2019s finding that the medical records do not fairly apprise the employer of a new claim, we need not address whether, even if they did, the Supplemental Memorandum of Agreement (by failing to expressly make the claim) likewise constituted an abandonment of the putative claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
