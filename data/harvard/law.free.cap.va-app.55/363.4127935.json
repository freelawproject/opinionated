McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">John T. Gordon, Jr. appeals the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s rejection of his change-in-condition application for benefits as time barred under the Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) two-year statute of limitations. Gordon argues the commission erred in ruling that the tolling provision in subsection C of this statute \u201cextends only once during the life of a workers\u2019 compensation case,\u201d and thus did not operate so as to render his claim timely. A panel majority of this Court agreed with Gordon and reversed the commission\u2019s decision. We granted a petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we reverse the commission and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Gordon suffered a compensable injury by accident on January 9, 2000 while working at Ford\u2019s production plant in Norfolk. Based on this injury, the commission entered a series of awards of compensation to Gordon for various periods of temporary total and temporary partial disability. The last of these awards, entered on January 13, 2003, was an open-ended award for partial disability. Gordon received his last direct payment of compensation under the award on February 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Following his injury, Gordon continued to work for Ford intermittently (between periods of temporary total disability), but only in a light-duty position due to restrictions arising from the injury. From October 23, 2000 through January 3, 2001 and from April 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002, Gordon worked in such a position and earned wages at or above his pre-injury wage. Gordon also worked in a light-duty capacity for Ford from April 20, 2003 through September 11, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>again earning wages equal to or higher than his pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On September 11, 2006, Gordon was temporarily laid off from his position at Ford because the plant was shut down for production reasons. On September 25, 2006 and again on November 6, 2006 Gordon applied for disability benefits based on lost wages caused by this \u201cchange in condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Ford defended against Gordon\u2019s 2006 application for benefits, in part, by arguing that it was time-barred. Ford asserted that the claim was not filed within two years of Gordon\u2019s last payment of compensation (February 23, 2003), that this last payment triggered the running of the two-year statute of limitations under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), and thus the claim was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Relying on Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gordon argued that his application was not time-barred because all the wages he received for the first twenty-four months of the last period he worked for Ford in a light-duty capacity (April 20, 2003 to September 11, 2006) were deemed to be compensation\u2014with those first twenty-four months ending on April 20, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gordon therefore asserted that the two-year statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) did not begin to run until April 20, 2005, meaning that his application, filed in 2006, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Ford responded that the twenty-four-month tolling provision in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) could be triggered only once, which occurred when Gordon returned to work, in a light-duty position, in October 2000. Ford reasoned that when Gordon was again awarded temporary total disability benefits in January 2001, the tolling provision was no longer applicable. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Ford concluded, \u201cthereafter, all claims for further compensation would have to be filed within two years from the date for which compensation was last paid per [Code] \u00a7 65.2-708(A) and that [Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C)] could not be used to extend the period during which compensation was said to be paid.\u201d Ford maintained that since Gordon was last paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits on February 28, 2003, he only had until February 23, 2005 to apply for benefits based on a change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The deputy commissioner rejected Ford\u2019s argument and awarded Gordon the benefits he requested. The deputy commissioner determined that \u201cnothing in the statute indicates that the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) do not begin to run anew after later periods of partial disability or temporary total disability for which awards are entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Ford appealed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision to the full commission. The commission held that Gordon\u2019s change-in-condition application was time-barred. The commission explained its holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">We have held that the term \u201cconsecutive\u201d in \u00a7 65.2-708(C) means \u201cfollowing successively without interruption.\u201d <em>Frisk v. Marshall\u2019s, </em>VWC File No. 183-99-55 (June 6, 2007); <em>Crites v. Slurry Pavers, Inc., </em>VWC File No. 202-99-47 (February 15, 2005) (finding the statute tolled only for one consecutive period). We have additionally held that this section provides <em>\u201can </em>extended limitation period\u201d and the consecutive twenty-four month period begins on the date the claimant is provided light duty work. <em>Phelps v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>77 OCE 138 (1998) (emphasis added), <em>aff'd, </em>Record No. 1246-98-4 (Ct.App.1999) (unpub.). Our holdings are consistent with the language of the statute referring to \u201ca period\u201d and not to multiple periods. <em>See also Greene v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Inc., </em>13 Va.App. 486, 492, 413 S.E.2d 650, 654 (1992).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Therefore, according to the commission, the Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) tolling provision does not \u201c \u2018begin to run anew<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after later periods of awarded disability.\u201d In other words, the provision is applicable only once to a compensable injury-regardless of the number of awards of compensation for subsequent periods of disability that may arise from the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a party may ask the commission to \u201creview any award\u201d of benefits based upon a change in condition. However, \u201c[n]o such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award under this title----\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). As such, the twenty-four-month limitation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708 \u201cis not a statute of limitations in the ordinary sense. It does not provide that a claimant has twenty-four months from the date the change in condition occurred to file.\u201d <em>Armstrong Furniture v. Elder, </em>4 Va.App. 238, 241, 356 S.E.2d 614, 615 (1987) (applying former Code \u00a7 65.1-99, now Code \u00a7 65.2-708). Rather, subsection A provides that the change in condition must occur within twenty-four months from the date compensation was last paid. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Subsection C of Code \u00a7 65.2-708, in turn, operates as a tolling provision that extends this limitation. This tolling is effected by an expanded definition of compensation to include wages paid to a claimant for light-duty work that are equal to or greater than his pre-injury wages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>All wages paid, for a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months, to an employee (i) who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury work due to a compensable injury and (ii) who is provided work within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage, shall be considered compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The parties concede that the wages paid to Gordon following his compensable injury met the statutory test, to the extent that (i) he was unable to return to his pre-injury work due to restrictions from the injury, and (ii) Ford provided him light-duty work at wages equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage. However, the parties disagree as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cfor a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) as applied in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Under well-settled rules of statutory construction, \u201cwe consider the language of a statute to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the plain and natural meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Alcoy v. Valley Nursing Homes, Inc., </em>272 Va. 37, 41, 630 S.E.2d 301, 303 (2006) (citations omitted). That is, \u201cwords [in a statute] are to be given their ordinary meaning, unless it is apparent that the legislative intent is otherwise.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 139, 142, 654 S.E.2d 926, 927 (2008) (citations omitted). And \u201cwe must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999) (quoting <em>Frazier v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 131, 135, 497 S.E.2d 879, 881 (1998)). Furthermore, it is our \u201cduty ... \u2018to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>nious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oraee v. Breeding, </em>270 Va. 488, 498, 621 S.E.2d 48, 52 (2005) (quoting <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Board of County Supervisors of Prince William County, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983)). Thus, we \u201c \u2018will look to the whole body of [a statute] to determine the true intention of each part.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a claimant may be paid compensation from time to time for various periods of disability under successive awards arising from the same compensable injury, as occurred in this case. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) contemplates a succession of awards by authorizing the commission to \u201creview <em>any </em>award\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> upon \u201cthe ground of a change in condition,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201con such review ... make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this title____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, the two-year statute of limitations under subsection A is tolled while the claimant receives compensation. Subsection A also provides, however, that (i) a \u201cchange in condition (cause of action) must occur\u201d and (ii) the change-in-condition application must be filed \u201cwithin twenty-four months from the date for which the last compensation was paid.\u201d <em>Whitten v. Mead </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Paperboard Products, </em>4 Va.App. 182, 186, 355 S.E.2d 349, 350 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The date for which compensation was last paid under any award is thus the determining factor as to whether a change-in-condition application is time-barred under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), subject to subsection C of the statute. Subsection C sets forth a caveat to the operation of the subsection A statute of limitations by providing that wages, when paid under the prescribed circumstances, are \u201cconsidered compensation.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C). As a result, the payment of such wages tolls the statute of limitations in the same manner as the payment of compensation. This caveat, in turn, is subject to the condition that the wages will cease being treated as compensation at the point when \u201ca period\u201d of such payment of wages \u201cexceed[s] twenty-four consecutive months.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In construing the word \u201ca\u201d in a similar statutory context, the Virginia Supreme Court recently stated that the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of this indefinite article is \u201c \u2018any\u2019 or \u2018each.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phelps, </em>275 Va. at 142, 654 S.E.2d at 927 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1 (1993)). <em>See In the Matter of Carroll, </em>124 Ohio App.3d 51, 705 N.E.2d 402, 404 (1997) (holding that the statutory term, \u201ca period of up to six months,\u201d contemplates multiple periods and that the word \u201cany\u201d in the subject statute \u201cmeans one out of many, i.e., an indefinite number\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The legislature was also specific when it defined the nature of the twenty-four-month period in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C): the twenty-four months must be consecutive. The word \u201cconsecutive\u201d means \u201csuccessive; succeeding one another in regular order; to follow in uninterrupted succession.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>304 (6th ed. 1990); <em>see also Am. Heritage Dictionary </em>313 (2d ed. 1982) (\u201cFollowing one after another without interruption.\u201d); <em>Hudson v. Youell, </em>179 Va. 442, 465, 19 S.E.2d 705, 715 (1942) (Hudgins, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>to define \u201cconsecutive\u201d as \u201c \u2018[Hollowing a train; succeeding one another in a regular order; having no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>interval or break; <em>sequent\u2019 </em>\u201d). Each month of that twenty-four-month period must \u201cfollow in uninterrupted succession.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 304. In other words, the statute does not permit a combination of multiple periods of shorter duration to end the tolling provisions of Subsection C. And, if multiple periods of shorter duration do not exhaust the twenty-four consecutive month period, it is illogical to think that a single period of shorter duration would do so. Had the General Assembly intended the statute to apply to any period of shorter duration, it simply would have omitted the word \u201cconsecutive\u201d and defined the period as \u201cnot to exceed twenty-four months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Accordingly, the Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) statute of limitations runs anew under each successive award of compensation for a particular compensable injury, and is triggered on the last day for which compensation was paid. Subsection C, in providing for wages to be treated as compensation under subsection A, is likewise subject to application under each such award as subsection C supplements subsection A, A and C operating in conjunction with each other. Subsection C is not a standalone provision\u2014it instead provides a definition for the tolling mechanism applied to subsection A, where a claimant has received wages (rather than compensation) as provided in subsection C. The Code \u00a7 65.2-708 change-in-condition/statute of limitations scheme thereby functions, in its entirety, on an award-by-award basis\u2014not on what amounts to a hybrid award-by-award/injury-by-injury basis under the commission\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Here, during three different periods following Gordon\u2019s compensable injury, Ford paid Gordon wages equal to or more than his pre-injury wage for performing light-duty work while under awards for temporary partial disability. The first two such periods extended from October 23, 2000 through January 3, 2001 and from April 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002. The third such period extended without interruption from April 20, 2003 through September 11, 2006, following the commission\u2019s January 13, 2003 open-ended award of compensation to Gordon for partial disability. Therefore, during the first twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>four months of this third period of Gordon\u2019s light-duty employment for Ford, Gordon\u2019s wages were to be \u201cconsidered compensation\u201d for purposes of tolling the Code \u00a7 65.2-708 statute of limitations. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C). The statute of limitations was thus tolled through April 20, 2005, meaning Gordon\u2019s ehange-in-condition application, filed in 2006, was not time-barred under the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\">.

The Code contains this limitation by authorizing tolling of <em>\u201ca period not exceeding </em>twenty-four <em>consecutive </em>months.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Although the majority holds the General Assembly intended to permit multiple periods of extension, our case law shows the language of \u201ca period\u201d contemplates only one period. Our Supreme Court addressed this issue in <em>Corns v. School Board of Russell County, </em>249 Va. 343, 454 S.E.2d 728 (1995). There the Court considered the meaning of statutory language requiring \u201c[a] probationary term of service for three years\u201d for teachers. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 454 S.E.2d at 732. The Court held that while the phrase \u201cservice for three years\u201d could \u201cbe interpreted as service in each of three intermittent school years ... [t]he words \u2018a term\u2019 mean one such period.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Van Dresser v. Firlings, </em>305 Mass. 51, 24 N.E.2d 969, 970 (1940) (\u201cThe word \u2018period\u2019 as applied to time carries with it the idea of the separation of a designated interval of time from the flow of time in general. The words \u2018a period\u2019 do not readily expand to include an irregular succession of times or periods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>varying length----\u201d). As applied here, the language in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) of \u201ca period\u201d likewise means one period. It was not necessary for the General Assembly to use the word \u201cone\u201d to indicate one period.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">If the General Assembly had intended to permit multiple periods of tolling under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C), it could have easily done this by writing the statute to authorize <em>\u201cperiods </em>not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months.\u201d It seems more rational to use the plural to mean the plural than to use the singular to mean the plural, as the majority holds. Long ago Justice Hudgins suggested as much when he remarked that \u201cit would be unreasonable to state that \u2018periods\u2019 refer to \u2018one single term.\u2019\u201d <em>Hudson v. Youell, </em>179 Va. 442, 465, 19 S.E.2d 705, 716 (1942) (Hudgins, J., dissenting); <em>cf. Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 237-39, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403-04 (1999) (holding that where a scientific test took multiple samples to produce a single result and the statute gave the defendant the right to observe the \u201cbreath test,\u201d \u201csample,\u201d and \u201cblood alcohol reading,\u201d phrased in the singular, the defendant only had the right to see the final printed result).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">When combined with the language of a single period, the statutory grant of an extension <em>\u201cnot exceeding </em>twenty-four consecutive months\u201d also evidences an intent to limit tolling to a defined period. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) (emphasis added). The term \u201cnot exceeding\u201d is defined: \u201cUsually a term of limitation only, denoting uncertainty of amount.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1061 (6th ed. 1990). Our Supreme Court has referred similarly to the term, calling it \u201cclear words of limitation.\u201d <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 831, 836, 147 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1966). Another court stated that \u201cnot exceeding\u201d means an amount \u201cshall not be more, but may be less.\u201d <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co. v. Jacksonville Oil Mill, </em>10 F.2d 54, 56 (6th Cir.1926). The court remarked that any other interpretation \u201cdoes violence to the plain and unambiguous language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Still another court held that where a contract required a company to operate a business \u201cfor a period \u2018not to exceed sixty days,\u2019 \u201d any amount up to sixty days satisfied the contract. <em>Union Liquors, Inc. v. Finkel &amp; Lasarow, Inc., 44 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Cal.App.2d 706, 113 P.2d 19, 21 (1941). Thus, the words \u201cnot exceeding\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) reveal the General Assembly\u2019s intention to limit the tolling of the statute of limitations to up to, but no more than twenty-four consecutive months. <em>See also Rohanna v. Commonwealth, </em>168 Va. 696, 701, 190 S.E. 171, 173 (1937) (holding that where a statute authorized a court to require a criminal defendant to give a bond for \u201ca term not exceeding one year,\u201d the court lacked power to require bonds beyond the term of the initial year); <em>Cox v. Hagan, </em>125 Va. 656, 680, 100 S.E. 666, 674 (1919) (using \u201cnot exceeding\u201d to refer to up to a maximum amount). Twenty-four consecutive months represents the maximum extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201cconsecutive\u201d means the period of extension described in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) runs until reaching twenty-four months ignores the statutory language of \u201cnot exceeding.\u201d \u201cThe words \u2018not exceeding,\u2019 in themselves, are words not of grant or apportionment, but of limitation only, and standing alone are ordinarily so construed.\u201d <em>City of Kingsville v. Meredith, </em>103 F.2d 279, 281-82 (5th Cir.1939); <em>see also Boston &amp; M.R.R. v. United States, </em>265 F. 578, 579 (1st Cir.1920). \u201cThe words denote uncertainty of amount. Such language imposes no duty to adopt the maximum amount rather than some lesser amount authorized.\u201d <em>Saxhaug v. County of Jackson, </em>215 Minn. 490, 10 N.W.2d 722, 724 (1943) (citation omitted). The plain meaning of a term \u201cnot exceeding twenty-four consecutive months\u201d is a period up to, but no more than twenty-four consecutive months.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Chiles v. Phelps, </em>714 So.2d 453, 459 (Fla.1998) (stating that a provision of the Florida Constitution limiting special sessions of the legislature to a period that \u201cshall not exceed twenty consecutive days\u201d set \u201conly outer limits on the length of special sessions\u201d). Any length of time from a day to two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>is a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months. As the dictionary states, the time is unspecified. Yet for the majority, the statute specifies a twenty-four-month period. This changes the language of \u201ca period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months\u201d to \u201ca period equal to twenty-four consecutive months.\u201d I cannot reconcile \u201cnot exceeding\u201d with \u201cequal to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">It may be objected that the statute could allow multiple single periods not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months based on new awards consistent with the above interpretation of language. Such an objection fails because of the absurd results it produces plainly contrary to the intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Indeed, an enormous problem in this case is that both the majority and commission interpretations cause potentially absurd results under the statute. Our Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that \u201ca statute should never be construed in a way that leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 802, 651 S.E.2d 637, 639 (2007). An absurd result is one \u201cin which the law would be internally inconsistent or otherwise incapable of operation.\u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 116, 597 S.E.2d 84, 87 (2004). Our Supreme Court construed language to avoid absurd results in <em>Marsh v. City of Richmond, </em>234 Va. 4, 360 S.E.2d 163 (1987). There a city charter permitted city council members to be reimbursed for their extraordinary expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 360 S.E.2d at 164. The Court held the General Assembly intended that only unusual, unforeseen expenses had eligibility for reimbursement. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 360 S.E.2d at 168. The Court acknowledged some expenses could be extraordinary simply because of the great expense incurred, but warned this situation would be rare. <em>Id. </em>To allow ordinary large expenses eligibility for reimbursement \u201cmight produce the absurd result that an item of expense, admittedly not of a kind or type intended ... to be reimbursable and, in this sense, not extraordinary, may yet be found extraordinary and hence reimbursable simply because the claimant expends an exorbitant amount on the item.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 360 S.E.2d at 168. \u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>General Assembly did not intend such an absurd result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, </em>230 Va. 422, 431, 337 S.E.2d 291, 296 (1985), the Court found an absurd result would occur where a party could \u201cescape the Act by doing exactly what it forbids.\u201d It is apparent from these cases that where a construction would plainly go contrary to legislative intent in a substantial number of instances, such an interpretation represents an absurd result a court should avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The majority\u2019s holding causes absurd results for several reasons. First, by holding tolling re-starts upon each award, the majority permits those having benefits reinstated after a termination for non-compliance with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to benefit from that disobedience.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The notion that a court could construe a statute in a way so that violating the statute could work in a person\u2019s self-interest was expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>repudiated in <em>Valley Acceptance Corp. </em>Second, the majority\u2019s holding inverts the purpose of the statute of limitations by least aiding those the statute seeks to protect and most assisting those not requiring protection. As previously noted, Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) exists \u201cto prevent employers from lulling partially disabled workers into a false sense of security ... by providing employees light duty work at their pre-injury wage for two years and then terminating the employee without liability for future disability benefits.\u201d <em>Nguyen, </em>26 Va.App. at 103, 493 S.E.2d at 392 (citation omitted). Employees diligent in asserting their rights obviously lack a risk of having a \u201cfalse sense of security.\u201d Nonetheless, the majority\u2019s holding benefits them the most by giving a new tolling period for each award.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Conversely, employees at risk of being lulled into complacence receive the fewest tolling periods. This type of inverted result goes against the holding of <em>Marsh </em>that statutes are to be construed consistently with their purpose. Third, the majority\u2019s holding permits employees to obtain twenty-four-month tolling periods indefinitely into the future since any award for any small period of time, even for something like a doctor\u2019s appointment, gives an employee a new period of tolling.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The commission\u2019s interpretation may cause absurd results since even such a brief break for a doctor\u2019s appointment instantly terminates the single twenty-four-month period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This could happen to many employees soon after returning from an injury, making the tolling period meaningless because of its brevity.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Thus, in the interpretations of both the majority and the commission, the General Assembly\u2019s plain intent that employees receive a limited period of tolling fails in a manifest way, rendering the statute \u201cincapable of operation.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>268 Va. at 116, 597 S.E.2d at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">To avoid these pitfalls and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly, which represents \u201cthe paramount object of statutory construction,\u201d <em>Vollin v. Arlington County Electoral Bd., </em>216 Va. 674, 678-79, 222 S.E.2d 793, 797 (1976), I would hold the statute provides a single twenty-four-month period of tolling per compensable injury and that earnings at or above pre-injury levels from any light-duty work falling within these twenty-four months are considered compensation, regardless of whether any new awards or breaks from work occur within this period. The tolling begins when an employee returns to light-duty work at or above his pre-injury wages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>next twenty-four months, those earnings are considered compensation. If the employee temporarily leaves work and then returns, the wages remain compensation. However, the single twenty-four month period permanently ends for that injury twenty-four-months from the start of light-duty work at or above pre-injury wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">This interpretation also accords with the principles of language expressed above. The statute\u2019s language of \u201ca period\u201d finds fulfillment in a single period. The period does not exceed twenty-four months. Furthermore, the period is up to, but not exceeding twenty-four months since an employee could leave work and not return before the period\u2019s expiration. Such an employee would receive less than the full period in tolling. Finally, the twenty-four months run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Support for this interpretation as the fulfillment of the General Assembly\u2019s intent becomes clearer when considered in light of workers\u2019 compensation jurisprudence from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Although Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) became effective in 1989, the principle it contains has a long history. During the Great Depression, in <em>Morrison v. Industrial Accident Commission, </em>29 Cal.App.2d 528, 537, 85 P.2d 186 (1938), it was written that \u201cpayment of wages to [an injured employee] ... is likely to lull him into false hopes and cause him to delay presenting his claim until the statute of limitations has barred it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">To remedy these perceived ills, payments of wages to injured employees were held to toll the statute of limitations. Precisely when these wages operate a tolling, however, differs among jurisdictions. One leading treatise has summarized a general rule in this way: \u201cA theoretically correct rule ... would be this: Payment of wages tolls the statute if it was intended to be made on account of compensation liability, <em>or </em>if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the employee reasonably believed it was so intended.\u201d 7 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 126.07[12] (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In enacting Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C), the General Assembly recognized the policy concerns necessitating the statute, but rejected case-specific factual inquiries in favor of a bright-line rule. Wages at or above pre-injury levels paid to an injured employee performing light-duty work are now considered compensation for up to twenty-four consecutive months. The statute balances the interests of employees and employers by (1) providing an automatic tolling for up to twenty-four consecutive months, while (2) limiting the tolling period to twenty-four consecutive months.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The majority\u2019s holding eviscerates the balance struck by Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C). Rather than providing a rule for the benefit of employees and employers, the majority gives employees an essentially indefinite statute of limitations to file a change-in-condition application. While I recognize we liberally construe the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>Masonite Holdings, Inc. v. Cubbage, </em>53 Va.App. 13, 19, 668 S.E.2d 809, 812 (2008), that does not mean we ignore other considerations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As our Supreme Court has stated, the Act represents \u201ca carefully balanced societal exchange between the interests of employers, employees, insurers, and the public.\u201d <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 584, 385 S.E.2d 858, 862 (1989). It is also notable that the Act provides that of the three commission members, only one shall represent employees and only one shall represent employers. Code \u00a7 65.2-200(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In summary, the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 provides one period of extension per compensable injury from the statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). The language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>authorizing \u201ca period\u201d rather than \u201cperiods\u201d denotes a single period. Taken together, the words \u201cnot exceeding\u201d and \u201cconsecutive\u201d show the General Assembly desired an extension of the statute of limitations up to but no greater than twenty-four consecutive months. The twenty-four-month period starts when an employee begins light-duty work at or above pre-injury pay and the earnings from such work in the ensuing twenty-four months are considered compensation, regardless of whether breaks in work or other awards occur. After twenty-four months, the employee may not receive additional tolling for the injury that caused the tolling to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Here Gordon returned to light-duty work earning at or above his pre-injury wages in October 2000. This started the twenty-four-month tolling provision of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C). For the next twenty-four months, the Code considered any wages Gordon received in this work at or above his pre-injury pay to be compensation. The twenty-four-month period expired in October 2002 and could not be renewed thereafter based on the January 2000 injury. However, since Gordon last received payment pursuant to an award in February 2003, he had until February 2005 to file an application based on a change in condition. Yet Gordon did not file his application until September 2006.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This fell outside the time provided by the statute of limitations, and the commission correctly held the application time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">. Consecutive is defined: \"Successive; succeeding one another in regular order; to follow in uninterrupted succession.\u201d <em>Black's Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 304; <em>see also Hudson, </em>179 Va. at 465, 19 S.E.2d at 715 (Hudgins, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s International Dictionary </em>to define \"consecutive\u201d as \" '[Hollowing in a train; succeeding one another in a regular order; having no interval or break; <em>sequent\u2019 \u201d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\">. An example of a way that an employee could gain a new tolling period under the majority\u2019s holding by violating the Act is found in Code \u00a7 65.2-607. That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">A. After an injury and so long as he claims compensation, the employee, if so requested by his employer or ordered by the Commission, shall submit himself to examination, at reasonable times and places, by a duly qualified physician or surgeon designated and paid by the employer or the Commission....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">B. If the employee refuses to submit himself to or in any way obstructs such examination requested by and provided for by the employer, his right to compensation and his right to take or prosecute any proceedings under this title shall be suspended until such refusal or objection ceases and no compensation shall at any time be payable for the period of suspension unless in the opinion of the Commission the circumstances justify the refusal or obstruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Under the majority\u2019s holding, if an employee unreasonably refused a medical exam and so had benefits suspended, but then agreed to the exam, a new award ordering reinstatement of benefits would renew the tolling period, even though the issue only arose at all because of the employee\u2019s disobedience to the Act. Such a result is plainly erroneous, for a person may not extend the tolling provisions otherwise applicable in the Act \"by doing exactly what it forbids.\u201d <em>Valley Acceptance Corp., </em>230 Va. at 431, 337 S.E.2d at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">While it is true that reinstatement of compensation after an employee\u2019s breach of the Act resulted in termination would toll the statute of limitations under subsection A, such tolling would occur with or without the employee's disobedience. On the other hand, the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>would not receive a new award\u2014and hence an additional twenty\u2014four months of tolling under subsection C-without the disobedience.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\">. The commission's opinion also recognized that extending the tolling period upon later awards does not accord with the purpose of the Act. The commission wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">Moreover, the purpose of Virginia Code 65.2-708(C) is to deter an employer from gaining an advantage by bringing an employee back to light duty at pre-injury wages and then terminating him after the statute of limitations has expired. We do not believe this purpose is served by interpreting the statute to provide that the tolling provisions begin to run anew after later periods of awarded disability. There was no finding that the claimant was lulled into a false sense of security causing his filing to be delayed. Additionally, the claimant has not been terminated by the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
