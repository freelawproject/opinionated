The Department of State Police (\u201cDSP\u201d) demurred, and the trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed Foltz\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">On appeal, Foltz maintains the trial court erred in concluding that his prior conviction was a \u201cmisdemeanor conviction of domestic violence\u201d (\u201cMCDV\u201d) under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9). Because we conclude that Foltz\u2019s declaratory judgment action was a civil action over which we have no subject matter jurisdiction, we transfer the appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">On April 4, 2008, DSP wrote a letter to Foltz\u2019s counsel in response to a request for an opinion regarding whether Foltz\u2019s misdemeanor conviction for assault and battery pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 against his wife precluded him from purchasing a firearm under federal law. DSP concluded that Foltz\u2019s conviction rendered him ineligible from possessing a firearm under the amended Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), because he had been convicted of a MCDV.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On April 21, 2008, Foltz filed an action in circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(E) and 9.1-135 against DSP seeking a declaratory judgment that his assault and battery conviction did not constitute a MCDV under \u00a7 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DSP demurred on two grounds. First, it asserted Foltz\u2019s action was barred by sovereign immunity. Second, it maintained that Foltz\u2019s conviction constituted a MCDV as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Without addressing the sovereign immunity argument, the trial court ruled that Foltz had been convicted of an offense which involved \u201cthe use or attempted use of physical force\u201d and, therefore, that offense was a \u201cMCDV\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (a)(33)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tained the demurrer and dismissed Foltz\u2019s action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On appeal, DSP argues that Foltz\u2019s declaratory judgment action, filed pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(E) and 9.1-135, was a civil action under Code \u00a7 9.1-135 rather than an appeal of an administrative agency decision, thereby vesting appellate jurisdiction with the Supreme Court of Virginia. However, Foltz characterizes his declaratory judgment action as an appeal to circuit court from a decision of an administrative agency and, therefore, he contends we possess jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s decision. We agree with DSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Without statutory authority conferring subject matter jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals, we lack authority to review an appeal. <em>Lewis v.

Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 362, 611 S.E.2d 356 (2005), the surety on performance bonds, XL, originally appealed to this Court after the trial court ruled that sovereign immunity barred XL\u2019s breach of contract claims against the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Because \u201cXL\u2019s ability to file its civil actions against VDOT required compliance with the administrative provisions for claims resolution[,]\u201d the Supreme Court of Virginia reasoned that XL\u2019s actions were \u201cappeals from a final decision of a circuit court \u2018on appeal from ... a decision of an administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 611 S.E.2d at 358.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">In <em>Commonwealth v. E.W. Yeatts, Inc., </em>233 Va. 17, 353 S.E.2d 717 (1987), we concluded that an appeal from a circuit court judgment against VDOT awarding a highway contractor additional compensation under a construction contract was within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. <em>[Id.] </em>at 24, 353 S.E.2d at 721. This conclusion was based on the holdings that VDOT is an administrative agency and that the contractor\u2019s right to file the civil action under Code \u00a7 33.1-387 was dependent upon invoking the administrative review procedures of Code \u00a7 33.1-386. <em>Id. </em>at 22-24, 353 S.E.2d at 720-21. <em>Compare Allstar Towing, Inc. v.

On the contrary, while the General Assembly clearly contemplated administrative remedies with respect to certain violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(E), it expressly provided a civil action under Code \u00a7 9.1-135 to individuals having been determined to be ineligible to purchase a firearm. \u201c[W]here governing statutes make instituting a separate legal action an alternative to invoking administrative procedures, appeal of such a court action is not [an] appeal from the decision of an administrative agency.\u201d <em>XL Specialty Ins. Co., </em>269 Va. at 367, 611 S.E.2d at 359 (explaining <em>Allstar Towing, </em>231 Va. at 423-24, 344 S.E.2d at 905).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u201c\u2018The plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction^]\u2019 \u201d <em>Newton v.

Giving effect to the plain language of Code \u00a7 9.1-135, we conclude that the declaratory judgment action brought by Foltz was a civil action rather than an appeal of a decision by an administrative agency. <em>Cf. </em>19 VAC \u00a7 30-100-90 (applicant denied permit for multiple weapons purchase may appeal decision to Superintendent of State Police).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Because this case does not involve a \u201cfinal decision of a circuit court from a decision of an administrative agency,\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-405, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Accordingly, we transfer the appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\n<em>Transferred.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">.
