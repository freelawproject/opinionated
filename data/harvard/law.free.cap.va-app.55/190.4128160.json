HALEY, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The issue here for resolution may be stated as follows: Does a trial court have the inherent authority to dismiss criminal charges on grounds other than the legal or factual merits, when such a dismissal is not authorized by statute? We conclude a trial court does not have such inherent authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">However, we do not address the question as to whether a court has the authority, with the agreement of the Commonwealth and the defendant, to order a dismissal or other disposition of criminal charges, when such a dismissal or other disposition is not otherwise authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The relevant facts may be succinctly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Rafael Hernandez was tried by a court upon a charge of feloniously assaulting a police officer, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C). A conviction requires the imposition of \u201ca mandatory minimum term of confinement of six months.\u201d The statute makes no provision for any deferred finding of guilt or disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">At the conclusion of the evidence, counsel for Hernandez conceded that: \u201cI know my client has done wrong.\u201d However, relying upon Moreau <em>v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 661 S.E.2d 841 (2008), he maintained that the trial court had \u201cthe inherent authority ... to either defer findings or else find guilt and defer sentencing and <em>ultimately dismiss the case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel continued: \u201cSo I ask that you suspend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>disposition of sentence and if he complies say with community service or whatever he has to do and if he\u2019s [sic] complied with every condition you may impose on him that you <em>dismiss the case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Significantly, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney argued that, under the statute, the trial court did not have such inherent authority and, further, refused to agree to Hernandez\u2019s proposed deferral or disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The trial court held it did not have such \u201cinherent authority\u201d in this case, found Hernandez guilty, and sentenced him to eleven months in jail, all suspended except the six months mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">A. <em>Inherent Power of Courts</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9_\">It is without question that courts possess the inherent power of contempt. \u201cThe power to fine and imprison for <em>contemptis </em>is incident to every court of record. The courts, <em>ex necessitate rei </em>have the power of protecting the administration of justice----\u201d <em>Wells v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 500, 503 (1871). That power \u201cis inherent in all courts----\u201d <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>96 Va. 791, 808, 32 S.E. 780, 782 (1899). \u201cSuch power is inherent in the nature and constitution of a court.\u201d <em>Holt v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 332, 336, 136 S.E.2d 809, 813 (1964), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>381 U.S. 131, 85 S.Ct. 1375, 14 L.Ed.2d 290 (1965). \u201cThe power of courts to punish for contempt is inherent and an important and necessary arm in the proper discharge of the functions committed to them by fundamental law.\u201d <em>Nicholas v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 315, 321, 42 S.E.2d 306, 309 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Nonetheless, \u201c[it] is proper for the Legislature to regulate the exercise of the power so long as it confines itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>within limits consistent with the preservation of the authority of courts to enforce such respect and obedience as is necessary to their vigor and efficiency.\u201d <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>96 Va. at 808, 32 S.E. at 782. <em>See </em>Title 18.2, Chapter 10, Article 5, \u00a7 18.2-456 <em>et seq. </em>(containing limitations imposed by the legislature upon the inherent contempt power of a court).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The power to order restitution is another area addressed by the jurisprudence defining the inherent power of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In <em>Flemings v. Riddick\u2019s Executor, </em>46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 272, 280-81 (1848), the Supreme Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court\u2019s inherent power to order restitution when a: \u201c[e]ourt whose judgment or decree is reversed ... having by its own act occasioned the wrong, possesses an inherent and summary jurisdiction to afford the redress, without reference to the peculiar nature of the controversy which it had erroneously determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In <em>Reid v. Reid, </em>14 Va.App. 505, 511, 419 S.E.2d 398, 402 (1992) <em>(en banc), </em>this Court held the trial court had the authority to order restitution from a spouse who had received spousal support payments pursuant to a court order subsequently reversed on appeal. We found that authority in Code \u00a7 20-107.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in \u201c[t]he legal and proper inherent power [of a court] \u2018to repair an injury occasioned by its own wrongful adjudication.\u2019 <em>Flemings, </em>46 Va. (5 Gratt.) at 281.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The Virginia Supreme Court reversed in <em>Reid v. Reid, </em>245 Va. 409, 429 S.E.2d 208 (1993), finding the trial court had neither statutory nor inherent power to order restitution. The Court wrote: \u201cBut more important, the inherent authority discussed in <em>Flemings </em>is not absolute. For example, while courts possess \u2018an inherent power of self-defense and self-preservation\u2019 by way of contempt ... [citing <em>Carter\u2019s </em>Case] ..., the power may be regulated by legislative enactment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>provided it is not \u2018destroyed, or so diminished as to be rendered ineffectual.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413-14, 429 S.E.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The Court further noted that Code \u00a7 20-107.1 authorized spousal support at the time of entry of a divorce decree. But \u201c[r]estitution is the recovery of money already paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 429 S.E.2d at 209. Thus, there was no statutory authority to order restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">Nor do we find persuasive Dr. Reid\u2019s argument that the absence of an explicit statutory prohibition against granting restitution supports the existence of implied statutory authority to order restitution. The General Assembly did not ignore the possibility of altering spousal support awards retroactively, which would effectively occur if restitution were ordered. Provision was made for retroactive treatment when \u201cproceedings are reopened to increase, decrease or terminate maintenance and support for a spouse ...\u201d but only \u201cwith respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification, but [even then] only from the date that notice of such petition has been given to the responding party.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-112____ Indeed, the provisions contradict the existence of implied authority to grant such relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 429 S.E.2d at 209-10. \u201c[W]e think that the legislature has modified the inherent power described in <em>Flemings.\u201d Id. </em>at 415, 429 S.E.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The General Assembly, by granting authority to courts to act in designated circumstances, negates any implied or inherent authority of a court to act in similar circumstances not designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Legislative enactment may circumscribe the power of a court to impose punishment. As we noted in <em>Podracky v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 130, 143, 662 S.E.2d 81, 88 (2008): \u201cChief Justice Marshall wrote that \u2018[t]he power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to define a crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>and ordain its punishment.\u2019 <em>United States v. Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820). <em>See also Dowling v. United States, </em>473 U.S. 207, 213-14, 105 S.Ct. 3127, 3131-32, 87 L.Ed.2d 152 (1985).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Subject to the restriction of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution, \u201cThe legislature retains plenary discretion to \u2018determine the appropriate \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d \u2019 and to punish each violation separately. <em>Nelson v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 716, 740, 589 S.E.2d 23, 35 (2003) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>268 Va. 665, 604 S.E.2d 76 (2004); <em>see Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 39, 46, 636 S.E.2d 480, 483 (2006).\u201d <em>De\u2018Armond v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 26, 32-33, 654 S.E.2d 317, 320 (2007). A trial court has no inherent power to disregard this legislative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 173, 187-88, 647 S.E.2d 517, 524 (2007), this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">The legislative development of the mandatory minimum sentence ... produced a floor below which no judge or jury could go. A trial court\u2019s authority to depart downward below a mandatory minimum is \u201cnonexistent,\u201d <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 585, 575 S.E.2d 567, 571 (2003), because the legislative purpose was to divest trial judges and juries of \u201call discretion\u201d to sentence below the threshold minimum, <em>In re Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>229 Va. 159, 163, 326 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1985). Given this history, we find no basis for Lilly\u2019s characterization of mandatory minimum sentences as a legislative usurpation of a historically unique judicial function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 authorizes a trial court to impose a six-month to three-year period of supervision upon release from active incarceration. The trial court imposed a jury recommendation of three years incarceration for voluntary manslaughter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plus three years of post-release supervision. Arguing a violation of the separation of powers, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>argued that the legislature had ceded to the judiciary a legislative function, i.e., determining the actual maximum punishment. We rejected this reasoning, holding that \u201cthe legislature, not the trial court, established the range of punishment,\u201d by its enactment of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2. <em>Alston v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 115, 123, 637 S.E.2d 344, 348 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>274 Va. 759, 652 S.E.2d 456 (2007). <em>See also Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 580, 621 S.E.2d 98 (2005). Thus, the power to impose the post-release period arises from the legislature, not from any inherent power of a court to punish.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">B. <em>The Holding in Moreau</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We now address <em>Moreau, </em>276 Va. 127, 661 S.E.2d 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">After hearing evidence concerning a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a judge of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of the City of Danville entered an order containing the following: she found \u201cSufficient evidence to convict the defendant ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 131, 661 S.E.2d at 843; she held she had \u201cthe inherent authority to take the matter under advisement ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 137, 661 S.E.2d at 846-47; she concluded \u201c[I]t [w]as appropriate ... to defer judgment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 132, 661 S.E.2d at 844; and she \u201ccontinued\u201d the case to a later date. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The majority in <em>Moreau </em>carefully noted: \u201cContemporaneous records of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court ... indicated that if there were \u2018no problems\u2019 ... the case would be dismissed. These contemporaneous records were not in the form of an order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The Circuit Court of the City of Danville issued a writ of mandamus, requested by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, directing the juvenile and domestic relations district court judge, since she had found the evidence sufficient to convict, to \u201cperform the ministerial act of making,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 133, 661 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>at 844, \u201ca determination as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132-33, 661 S.E.2d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The majority discussed the separation of powers doctrine and noted that: <em>\u201calthough the subject matter of the judiciary\u2019s power may, in some ways be limited by legislative action, </em>the essential function of the judiciary\u2014the act of rendering judgment in matters properly before it\u2014may not be abridged by either the executive or legislative branches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 661 S.E.2d at 846 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The Court noted that: \u201cit was within the inherent authority of the court to \u2018take the matter under advisement\u2019 or \u2018continue the case for disposition\u2019 at a later date. Such practices involve the essence of rendering judgment---- Nothing contained in the order is beyond the power of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137-38, 661 S.E.2d at 846-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The majority dismissed the writ of mandamus, stating: \u201c[W]e disagree that a determination as to the guilt or innocence of the accused is a ministerial function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 661 S.E.2d at 847. The majority continued: \u201cWe hold that the act of rendering judgment is within the inherent power of the court and that the very essence of adjudication and entry of judgment involves discretionary power of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 661 S.E.2d at 847-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">After reciting those portions of the juvenile and domestic relations district court order quoted above, the majority wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">What may in a proper case be reasonably subject to challenge is whether the judge may decline to render judgment and continue the case with or without terms akin to probation status with the promise from the court of a particular disposition at a later date. However, <em>the case before us does not present such questions. ... </em>[T]he underlying juvenile court order in this case has no such terms or conditions and no provision of a future disposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 137-38, 661 S.E.2d at 847 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">As noted above, the \u201ccontemporaneous records\u201d of the court did contain conditions and a promise of the future potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>disposition of dismissal. These \u201crecords,\u201d as the majority determined, did not constitute an order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In footnote 5, the majority wrote: \u201cTo the extent that the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Gibson v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 285, 649 S.E.2d 214 (2007), is inconsistent with the holding of this case, it is expressly overruled. <em>See also Gibson v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 176, 180-81, 662 S.E.2d 54, 57 (2008) (this day decided).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We also address <em>Gibson, </em>276 Va. 176, 662 S.E.2d 54. An issue resolved was the criminal responsibility of an individual to pay over withholding taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Of relevance to this instant case, however, is the following from <em>Gibson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">The record reveals no additional requests or motions for deferral [of disposition]. Consequently, the trial court never denied such a request or motion. Accordingly, the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>present in Gibson\u2019s fourth assignment of error, namely that the trial court \u201cerred by not recognizing the courts [sic] authority to defer findings of guilt absent a specific legislative grant of authority\u201d is not properly before us because the record reflects no ruling of the trial court to that effect. We note that although the Court of Appeals addresses this issue in its opinion, the question was not properly before the Court of Appeals for the same reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 181, 662 S.E.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Following the word \u201creason,\u201d the Supreme Court inserted footnote 2, which reads as follows: <em>\u201cSee also Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 138, n. 5, 661 S.E.2d 841, 847 n. 5 (2008) (this day decided) (overruling <em>Gibson v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 285, 649 S.E.2d 214 (2007)[,] to the extent that it is inconsistent with the holding in that case).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">It is clear, manifestly clear, that the issue presented in the case presently before this Court; that is, does a trial court have the inherent authority to defer judgment upon terms contemplating a future dismissal of criminal charges, especially <em>without </em>the agreement of the Commonwealth, was not decided in either <em>Moreau </em>or <em>Gibson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">As <em>Moreau </em>instructs, a trial court has the inherent power to take a ease under advisement and to continue the same for future disposition\u2014that disposition being \u201cthe act of rendering judgment.\u201d <em>Moreau, </em>276 Va. at 136, 661 S.E.2d at 846. That disposition, that inherent authority, includes the dismissal of a criminal charge. But, we believe, <em>\u201cabsent an express statutory grant, trial courts may not dismiss criminal charges on grounds other than the legal or factual merits.\u201d Holden v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 403, 407, 494 S.E.2d 892, 895 (1998) (emphasis supplied). No court has the sole authority to dismiss a criminal charge for any reason not based upon the legal or factual merits, unless authorized to do so by a legislature. To construe the inherent power of a court to dismiss a criminal charge on a basis other than the legal or factual merits would, by such construction, potentially author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ize judicial nullification of a legislative act, in violation of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Once there is a finding of guilt (or a finding of evidence sufficient to support the same), or such a finding following a continuance to take that determination under advisement, the consequences of that finding; that is, a permissible punishment a court may impose, are circumscribed and delineated by the legislature. In accord with the separation of powers, the responsibility for \u201cfixing penalties are legislative, not judicial functions.\u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 510, 513, 458 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Evans, </em>333 U.S. 483, 486, 68 S.Ct. 634, 636, 92 L.Ed. 823 (1948)). <em>See also Falwell v.

These designations include marital rape, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-61(C); marital forcible sodomy, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1(0, marital object sexual penetration, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2(0),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, first offender possession of controlled substance or marijuana, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-251. Likewise included among crimes for which deferral and potential dismissal is authorized by the legislature is assault and battery upon a family or household member, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-57.3. No statute contains authorization for deferral and dismissal of a charge under Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C), assault upon a police officer, the crime for which Hernandez was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201cTo declare what the law is, or has been, is a judicial power; to declare what the law shall be is legislative.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Gregory, </em>193 Va. 721, 726, 71 S.E.2d 80, 83 (1952) (quoting 50 Am.Jur., <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 219, p. 198). As this Court noted in <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 635, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 (2004) (quoting <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)), \u201c[t]his axiom stems from basic principles of separation of powers. \u2018It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u2019 \u201d But in that determination, the judiciary is to \u201cascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Chase v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>266 Va. 544, 547, 587 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">To ascertain that intention, a principle of statutory construction is here relevant: \u201cInterpretation of the statute by comparison to other, similar statutes supports this result ... showing the General Assembly clearly knew how to limit a privilege ... when it so desired.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Schwartz, </em>46 Va.App. 145, 157-58, 616 S.E.2d 59, 66 (2005) (quoted with approval in <em>Marblex Design Intern., Inc. v. Stevens, </em>54 Va.App. 299, 304-05, 678 S.E.2d 276, 278 (2009)). <em>See also, Martin v. Howard, </em>273 Va. 722, 726, 643 S.E.2d 229, 231-32 (2007); <em>Hechler Chevrolet v. General Motors Corp., </em>230 Va. 396, 401, 337 S.E.2d 744, 747 (1985). Succinctly stated: \u201cThe Legislature is presumed to know what it intends to do and can do.\u201d <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>172 Va. 639, 649, 2 S.E.2d 343, 348 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As contrasted above, Code \u00a7 18.2-57.3 authorizes deferral and dismissal. Code \u00a7 18.2-57(0 does not. The trial court did not have the inherent power, as Hernandez asserts, to add, in effect, a provision granting deferral and dismissal from the former statute to the latter. This is true because \u201c \u2018[cjourts cannot read into a statute something that is not within the manifest intention of the legislature as gathered from the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 234, 245, 616 S.E.2d 754, 759 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Jordan v. South Boston, </em>138 Va. 838, 844-45, 122 S.E. 265, 267 (1924)), <em>aff'd, 272 </em>Va. 481, 634 S.E.2d 305 (2006). No court has the inherent power \u201cto add to a statute language which the legislature has chosen not to include.\u201d <em>County of Amherst v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982). To recognize such an inherent power would violate the separation of powers, as Chief Justice Marshall wrote, quoted above, \u201c[t]he power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.\u201d <em>Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-14\">. The question presented reads: \"Whether the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked the inherent authority to continue appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>case for future disposition.\u201d As noted at trial, the only future disposition sought was dismissal. At oral argument, counsel for appellant reiterated that the refined issue before the court involved only dismissal as a future disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\">. \"Upon ... decreeing a divorce ... the court may make such further decrees as it shall deem expedient concerning the maintenance and support of the spouses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">.
