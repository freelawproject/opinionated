On appeal, Cauls argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from his pants pocket. Cauls claims the trial court erred for two reasons. First, Cauls contends that he was \u201cunreasonably seized when he was ordered to comply with the deputies during the protective sweep.\u201d Second, Cauls contends that the search of his pants pocket did not fall within the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. For the following reasons, we disagree that Cauls was seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure. Nevertheless, we agree with Cauls\u2019 second contention and, therefore, reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u201cOn appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the Commonwealth all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from it.\u201d <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002) (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991)). So viewed, the evidence was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">On November 16, 2007, Deputy J.M. Woodard (\u201cWoodard\u201d) of the Spotsylvania Sheriffs Office executed an arrest warrant for Alexis Satkin (\u201cSatkin\u201d) at her residence in Spotsylvania County. When Satkin answered the door, Woodard informed her that she was under arrest for a probation violation; however, Woodard allowed Satkin to reenter the residence to put on more appropriate clothing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because she was under arrest, Woodard accompanied Satkin into the residence. In the front room, Woodard observed a digital scale and a \u201cwhite powder residue\u201d on the kitchen table. Woodard testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>in his training and experience the \u201cwhite powder residue\u201d was consistent with cocaine. At that point, Woodard asked Satkin for consent to search the entire residence. She refused. Woodard then decided to obtain a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">While he waited for Satkin to get dressed, Woodard conducted a protective sweep of the residence to determine whether there were any threats to the deputies\u2019 safety. In the bedroom, Woodard discovered Cauls lying in bed watching television. Woodard ordered Cauls to show his hands. Cauls complied. Woodard then explained to Cauls that they were obtaining a search warrant for the residence and that he was free to leave. Cauls informed Woodard that he was only wearing a pair of boxer shorts. When Woodard asked if Cauls wanted a pair of pants, he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Woodard observed a pair of men\u2019s pants lying on the floor next to the bed and asked Cauls if they belonged to him. Cauls said they did. As Woodard picked up the pants to hand them to Cauls, he observed the knotted and frayed end of a plastic baggy protruding from the watch pocket. However, Woodard could not see the contents of the baggy. Nevertheless, Woodard removed the baggy from the watch pocket and saw that it contained crack cocaine. Woodard then placed Cauls under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Prior to trial, Cauls made a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his pants pocket. The trial court denied his motion. Thereafter, Cauls entered a conditional plea of guilty in which he retained the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u201cAn accused\u2019s claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Grandison v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 316, 320, 645 S.E.2d 298, 300 (2007). \u201cIn making such a determination, we give deference to the factual findings of the circuit court, but we independently determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>manner in which the evidence was obtained meets the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 546, 551-52, 659 S.E.2d 512, 515 (2008). \u201cThe defendant has the burden to show that, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion was reversible error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">I. <em>Cauls\u2019 \u201cSeizure \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Cauls argues that he was \u201cunreasonably seized\u201d when Woodard picked up his pants from the floor because a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave the residence. Cauls claims that this unconstitutional seizure tainted what occurred immediately thereafter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u201cA person is \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment if, under the circumstances presented, a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave the scene of an encounter with the police.\u201d <em>McLellan v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 144, 151, 554 S.E.2d 699, 703 (2001) (citing <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980); <em>Cochran v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 604, 608, 521 S.E.2d 287, 289 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1075, 120 S.Ct. 1692, 146 L.Ed.2d 498 (2000); <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 96, 101, 496 S.E.2d 47, 50 (1998)). \u201cThus, a seizure occurs when a law enforcement officer, by physical force or some display of authority, restrains in some manner a citizen\u2019s freedom of movement. Only when such restraint is imposed is there a basis for invoking Fourth Amendment safeguards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 554 S.E.2d at 703 (citations omitted). Here, no such restraint was imposed upon Cauls.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Woodard properly executed an arrest warrant for Sat-kin at her residence. Incident to her arrest, Woodard was entitled to conduct a \u201cprotective sweep\u201d of the residence to ensure his own safety and the safety of the other deputies, so long as \u201cit [was] narrowly confined to a cursory visual inspection of those places in which a person might be hiding.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1094, 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>L.Ed.2d 276 (1990). During this sweep, Woodard encountered Cauls lying in bed. After confirming that Cauls was not a danger, Woodard told Cauls that he was in the process of obtaining a search warrant for the residence and that Cauls was free to leave. However, Cauls indicated that he was only wearing a pair of boxer shorts. Woodard asked Cauls if he wanted a pair of pants, to which he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Woodard then identified a pair of male pants on the floor next to the bed and asked Cauls if they belonged to him. Again, Cauls responded, \u2018Yes.\u201d Only when Woodard picked up the pants to hand them to Cauls, did he notice the plastic baggy protruding from the watch pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Cauls contends that he was seized when Woodard \u201cpicked up [his] pants after he had been told that he was free to leave.\u201d However, Cauls overlooks the fact that he specifically asked Woodard for a pair of pants and identified the pants on the floor as his own. By picking up the pants, Woodard did not restrain Cauls\u2019 movement through the use of physical force or a display of authority. Rather, Woodard merely responded to Cauls\u2019 specific request for his pants. \u201cThe purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to eliminate all contact between the police and the citizenry, but \u2018to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 421, 428, 559 S.E.2d 374, 377 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 554, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3081, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976)). Woodard\u2019s conduct in this instance can hardly be described as an \u201carbitrary and oppressive interference\u201d with Cauls\u2019 privacy or personal security, so as to invoke the protections of the Fourth Amendment. Cauls was told that he was free to leave and asked Woodard for his pants so that he could do so. Thus, Cauls was not \u201cunreasonably seized\u201d when Woodard complied with his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">II. <em>The Application of the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Alternatively, Cauls argues that the seizure of the plastic baggy constituted a search followed by a seizure and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>thus, did not fall within the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. Our Supreme Court has said that \u201c[t]he \u2018plain view doctrine\u2019 is an exception to the general rule that warrantless searches and seizures are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 146, 152, 400 S.E.2d 191, 195 (1991). While this language is often quoted in the Commonwealth as the constitutional shorthand for the \u201cplain view doctrine,\u201d it is somewhat misleading because it inaccurately summarizes the constitutional jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the United States on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">First of all, one of the fundamental characteristics of the \u201cplain view doctrine\u201d is that it is exclusively a <em>seizure </em>rationale. The doctrine only applies to seizures because, by definition, if a police officer has a legal right to be in a place where he observes an item in plain view, no \u201csearch\u201d takes place, and it is only the seizure of the item that implicates the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 326, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 1153, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987) (\u201cIt is well established that under certain circumstances the police may <em>seize </em>evidence in plain view without a warrant.\u201d (citing <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 465, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2037-38, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (plurality opinion)) (emphasis in original). This is so because \u201c \u2018[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u2019 \u201d) <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 213, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 1812-13, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986) (quoting <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)); <em>see also Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 42, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 2047-48, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001); <em>Florida v. Riley, </em>488 U.S. 445, 449-50, 109 S.Ct. 693, 696-97, 102 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989); <em>California v. Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 40-41, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 1628-29, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988); <em>Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 227, 235-36, 106 S.Ct. 1819, 1825-26, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986); <em>Air Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo. v. Western Alfalfa Corp., </em>416 U.S. 861, 865, 94 S.Ct. 2114, 2115-16, 40 L.Ed.2d 607 (1974). Thus, contrary to the language quoted above from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>Hams, </em>if an item is indeed in \u201cplain view,\u201d the Fourth Amendment is not engaged unless and until the item is seized because no search has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Secondly, although often characterized as such, the plain view doctrine is <em>not </em>really a separate \u201cexception\u201d to the constitutional requirement that the seizure of an item must be supported either by a properly issued and executed warrant or some other properly applied exception to the warrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances. In fact, \u201cplain view <em>alone </em>is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence. This is simply a corollary of the familiar principle ... that no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent \u2018exigent circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 468, 91 S.Ct. at 2039 (emphasis in original). As other jurists have noted, \u201c[t]he hardest conceptual problem attending the plain view doctrine is to grasp that it is not a universal statement of the right of a policeman to seize after seeing something in open view; it is rather a limited statement of the right in one of several instances\u2014following a valid intrusion.\u201d Judge Charles E. Moylan, <em>The Plain View Doctrine: Unexpected Child of the Great \u201cSearch Incident\u201d Geography Battle, </em>26 Mercer L.Rev. 1047, 1096 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">To that end, the United States Supreme Court has identified three requirements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">for application of the plain view doctrine, which are 1) that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly viewed, 2) <em>that the incriminating character of the evidence must he immediately apparent, </em>and 3) that the officer have a lawful right of access to the object itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6W\"><em>Vaughn v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 643, 648, 674 S.E.2d 558, 560 (2009) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990)). Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>previously determined that Woodard was properly on the premises and that Cauls had not been seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, we must now determine whether the incriminating character of the plastic baggy was immediately apparent. If \u201cthe police lack probable cause to believe that an object in plain view is contraband without conducting some further search of the object\u2014i.e., \u2018if its incriminating character [is not] immediately apparent,\u2019 ... the plain-view doctrine cannot justify its seizure.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2136-37, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 136, 110 S.Ct. at 2307-08).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Cauls argues that the incriminating character of the item seized from his watch pocket was not immediately apparent to Woodard, because Woodard was only able to observe the knotted end of the plastic baggy and not the baggy\u2019s contents. Thus, Cauls contends that Woodard lacked \u201cthe requisite probable cause to reach into [Cauls\u2019] pant\u2019s pocket and retrieve the plastic bag.\u201d The Supreme Court of Virginia has consistently held that, under the plain view doctrine, probable cause cannot be established \u201c\u2018solely on the observation of material which can be used for legitimate purposes, even though the experience of an officer indicates that such material is often used for illegitimate purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grandison, </em>274 Va. at 321, 645 S.E.2d at 300 (quoting <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 414, 420-21, 620 S.E.2d 760, 763 (2005)). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is not sufficient probable cause to seize an item from inside the suspect\u2019s clothing if the officer has no more than an educated \u2018hunch\u2019 ... that the item might be contraband.\u201d <em>Cost v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 246, 252, 657 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The facts of this case are analogous to those of <em>Grandison </em>and <em>Cost. </em>In <em>Grandison, </em>an officer conducting a pat down of Grandison observed \u201ca folded dollar bill protruding from [his] watch pocket.\u201d <em>Grandison, </em>274 Va. at 321, 645 S.E.2d at 300. The officer removed the dollar bill from Grandison\u2019s pocket because, based on his training and experience, he knew that drugs were frequently packaged in such a way. The officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>found cocaine inside the dollar bill, and Grandison was convicted. However, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed his conviction because the dollar bill was an object with a legitimate purpose and \u201c[n]o other circumstances indicated criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 645 S.E.2d at 300-01. Thus, the Court concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to remove the dollar bill from Grandison\u2019s pocket. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In <em>Cost, </em>an officer approached Cost who was sitting in the passenger seat of a parked vehicle. After observing Cost reaching for his left pants pocket several times, the officer \u201ctold Cost to \u2018get away from\u2019 his pocket.\u201d <em>Cost, </em>275 Va. at 249, 657 S.E.2d at 506. When Cost reached for his pocket again, the officer ordered him out of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>The officer then conducted a pat down of Cost, during which he felt \u201cnumerous capsules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like <em>Grandison, </em>the officer removed the capsules from Cost\u2019s pocket because, based on his training and experience, he \u201cknew\u201d the capsules contained heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 657 S.E.2d at 506. The officer found heroin in the capsules, and Cost was convicted. Again, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed Cost\u2019s conviction noting that legal medications such as Motrin and Tylenol are frequently packaged in capsule form. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 657 S.E.2d at 509. The Court reasoned that \u201cthe character of the capsules seized from Cost\u2019s pants pocket could not have been immediately apparent to Officer Davis as a result of the pat-down search.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Like the officers in <em>Grandison </em>and <em>Cost, </em>Woodard had no more than an educated hunch that the plastic baggy in Cauls\u2019 pants pocket contained contraband. When he picked up Cauls\u2019 pants, Woodard observed the knotted and frayed end of a plastic baggy protruding from the watch pocket, but he was unable to see the baggy\u2019s contents. Based on his training and experience, Woodard concluded that the baggy likely contained narcotics. However, like the capsules in <em>Cost </em>and the dollar bill in <em>Grandison, </em>plastic baggies are often used for legitimate purposes that do not involve the packaging of narcotics. Thus, Woodard\u2019s observation of the plastic knot and fray, standing alone, could not provide him with probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cause because the object\u2019s incriminating character was not immediately apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The Commonwealth argues that the \u201cother circumstance[s] indicating criminal activity,\u201d such as Woodard\u2019s observation of the digital scale and \u201cwhite powder residue\u201d on the kitchen table of the residence, provided him with probable cause to seize the plastic baggy from Cauls\u2019 pocket. <em>See Grandison, </em>274 Va. at 321, 645 S.E.2d at 300 (quoting <em>Brown, </em>270 Va. at 420-21, 620 S.E.2d at 763). While we agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the determination of whether or not probable cause exists depends on the totality of the circumstances, we disagree with its conclusion that probable cause existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Cauls did not own or reside at the residence in question. Therefore, the only nexus between Cauls and the \u201ccircumstances indicating criminal activity\u201d was his presence in the residence. The Supreme Court of Virginia dealt with a similar situation in <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 570 S.E.2d 836 (2002). In that case, Murphy was present in a residence when the police executed a search warrant. \u201cThe search warrant authorized the police to search \u2018the entire residence\u2019 for \u2018marijuana, cocaine, cocaine base, heroin, scales, ledgers, logs, money, guns, phone bills, syringes and any other item that would be connected with the illegal sale and/or use of any other illegal narcotic or non-prescription drug.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 570 S.E.2d at 837. When the police entered the residence, they found Murphy and three other men inside. An officer detained Murphy and frisked him for weapons. During the frisk, the officer felt a large bulge in Murphy\u2019s pocket, which he sensed was a plastic baggy. <em>Id. </em>The officer removed the baggy from Murphy\u2019s pocket because, based on his training and experience, he believed the baggy contained marijuana. <em>Id. </em>The officer was correct, and Murphy was arrested and ultimately convicted. In reversing Murphy\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court of Virginia stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">[The officer\u2019s] testimony established only that the character of the object as a plastic bag was immediately apparent from the \u201cpat down\u201d search, and that he knew from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>training and experience that plastic bags often are used to package marijuana. This information was insufficient under the holding in <em>Dickerson </em>to establish probable cause to search Murphy\u2019s pocket because <em>Harvey\u2019s conclusion that the bag contained marijuana was not based on his tactile perception of the bag\u2019s contents. Rather, his sense of touch revealed only that there was a plastic bag in Murphy\u2019s pocket. </em>Thus, Officer Harvey lacked probable cause to seize the item from Murphy\u2019s pocket because the character of the bag\u2019s contents as contraband was not immediately apparent from the frisk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\"><em>Our conclusion that Officer Harvey did not have probable cause to seize the marijuana is not altered by the fact that Murphy was present in a residence that was the subject of a search warrant for illegal drugs. The record contains no evidence linking him to the suspected presence of those drugs. </em>Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in denying Murphy\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the controlled substances because those items were seized after Murphy was arrested illegally based on the search of his pocket without probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 570 S.E.2d at 839-40 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 300, 683 S.E.2d 299 (2009) (holding that Whitehead\u2019s mere status as a passenger in a vehicle on which a drug dog alerted, without evidence that he and the other passengers were engaged in a common enterprise involving criminal activity, did not provide the officers with probable cause to search Whitehead\u2019s person).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Like the officer in <em>Murphy, </em>Woodard\u2019s conclusion that the plastic baggy contained narcotics was not based on \u201chis tactile perception of the bag\u2019s contents.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 574, 570 S.E.2d at 839. Rather, his observation of the knot and fray only revealed that there was a plastic baggy in Cauls\u2019 pocket. Therefore, Woodard lacked probable cause to seize the baggy, because \u201cthe character of the bag\u2019s contents as contraband was not immediately apparent----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 570 S.E.2d at 839. Furthermore, the record contains no evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>beyond his mere presence in the residence, linking Cauls to the digital scale or the \u201cwhite powder residue\u201d found on the kitchen table. Thus, Woodard\u2019s seizure of the bag was not supported by additional circumstances indicating Cauls\u2019 criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the facts of this case do not support the application of the plain view doctrine, because the incriminating character of the plastic baggy\u2019s contents was not immediately apparent. Thus, the retrieval of the baggy from Cauls\u2019 pants pocket was an invalid seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence obtained from the seizure of the plastic baggy, and we reverse Cauls\u2019 conviction and remand for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\">. Satkin was only wearing a tee shirt at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. Because we find the plain view doctrine inapplicable here, we need not and do not reach the issue of whether exigent circumstances existed, which would permit the seizure to be made in the absence of a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
