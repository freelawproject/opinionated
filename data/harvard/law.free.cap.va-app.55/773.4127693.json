Todd argues that the trial court erred in its interpretation of Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H). Copeland also challenges the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 on due process and equal protection grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we agree with Todd, and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Leslie Todd gave birth to the child who is at the center of this case while Todd was incarcerated. Todd\u2019s relatives were not prepared to take her newborn baby, so she agreed that Linda Guenther, who served as a chaplain at the jail, and Guenther\u2019s friend, Lucretia Copeland, would take temporary custody of the baby until she could finish serving her sentence. Copeland and Guenther sought and received an order granting them temporary, indefinite custody of the baby. The order also granted Todd visitation with her baby at Copeland\u2019s and Guenther\u2019s discretion. Although both Copeland and Guenther cared for the baby during the first year, Copeland eventually became the baby\u2019s primary physical custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Copeland brought the baby to visit Todd while she was incarcerated, usually on a weekly basis. After Todd\u2019s release in September 2003, the parties agreed that Todd could not take care of the child due to her housing and financial situation. However, she saw her child frequently through the summer of 2005. Beginning in July 2005, Todd\u2019s contact with the child began to wane, and from July 2006 through July 2007, Todd neither contacted nor visited with her child. While the record also indicates that Todd has been gainfully employed since her release from incarceration and has successfully completed her probation, Todd concedes that she cannot currently take custody of her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">On July 21, 2007, Copeland contacted Todd and asked about adopting the child. That same day, Todd requested visitation with her child. Todd visited with her child that same day, and refused the adoption request. Following that visit, Todd asked that she be allowed to visit with the child more frequently. However, Copeland and Todd were not able to come to an agreement about visitation during the summer of 2007, and Todd eventually sought and received court-ordered visitation with her child. At Todd\u2019s request, the court appointed a mental health professional to assist with the development of a visitation plan and a relationship between Todd and her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Following the institution of the visitation order, Todd visited with her child on every occasion allowed by the court order. The mental health professional appointed by the court to assist in the visitation plan monitored the visits and reported that Todd and the child interacted well and developed a close relationship, even though the child does not know that Todd is her biological mother. According to a report from the court-appointed mental health professional dated March 20, 2008, Todd and the child had progressed in their relationship to the point that the counselor believed that Todd should inform the child that she was her biological mother and that the two should have \u201cunrestricted and unlimited\u201d visitation. The report also stressed that: \u201cFrom a developmental perspective, it would be detrimental for Ms. Todd and [the child] to terminate a mother/daughter relationship at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">On November 26, 2007, Copeland filed a petition to adopt the child. At the conclusion of the proceedings below, the trial court granted the petition on two separate grounds. The trial court held that Todd had failed to maintain contact with the child for a period of six months prior to the filing of the adoption petition as provided in Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H) and, in the alternative, that Todd had withheld her consent contrary to the child\u2019s best interests as provided in Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">A. <em>Constitutionality of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Todd argues that Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205, as applied in this proceeding, violated her constitutional right to due process. We agree and hold that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires prospective adoptive parents to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, both that the entry of an adoption order over the objection of a nonconsenting parent is in the best interest of the child <em>and </em>that a continuing relationship with the birth parent would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare. Because the trial court did not make that determination here, it erred in granting the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">\u201c[W]hen, as here, the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, our determination of legislative intent is guided by the recognition that \u2018all actions of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Soc\u2019y for Human Life v. Caldwell, </em>256 Va. 151, 157, 500 S.E.2d 814, 816-17 (1998) (quoting <em>Hess v. Snyder Hunt Corp., </em>240 Va. 49, 52, 392 S.E.2d 817, 820 (1990)). Accordingly, we will construe a statute \u201c \u2018in such a manner as to avoid a constitutional question wherever this is possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Eaton v. Davis, </em>176 Va. 330, 339, 10 S.E.2d 893, 897 (1940)); <em>accord Jacobs v. Meade, </em>227 Va. 284, 287, 315 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">We are also mindful that the termination of parental rights \u201cis a grave, drastic and irreversible action,\u201d <em>Helen W. v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>12 Va.App. 877, 883, 407 S.E.2d 25, 28-29 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and that courts must apply a higher standard in determining whether adoption is appropriate, than would be applied in matters of custody or visitation. As our Supreme Court has noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">[t]he most drastic and far-reaching action that can be taken by a court of equity is to enter a final order of adoption. Such an order severing the ties between a parent and a child is as final, and often as devastating, as though the child had been delivered at birth to a stranger instead of into the arms of its natural mother or father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-7\"><em>Doe v. Doe, </em>222 Va. 736, 746, 284 S.E.2d 799, 805 (1981). In contrast, \u201c[cjustody of children and child support are matters that remain within the breast of the court\u201d and are therefore subject to less stringent review. <em>Robinette v. Keene, </em>2 Va.App. 578, 587, 347 S.E.2d 156, 161 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">2. The Biological Parent\u2019s Fundamental Rights in the Adoption Context</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a parent who has neither surrendered her rights to her child nor had those rights terminated by a judicial proceeding has a liberty interest in the \u201cnurture, upbringing, companionship, and custody\u201d of her child that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 77, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2066, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) (Souter, J., concurring); <em>see also Quilloin v. Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246, 255, 98 S.Ct. 549, 555, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978) (\u201cWe have little doubt that the Due Process Clause would be offended if a state were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family, over the objections of the parents and their children, without some showing of unfitness and for the sole reason that to do so was thought to be in the children\u2019s best interest.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Griffin v. Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. 77, 85, 581 S.E.2d 899, 903 (2003) (\u201cAbsent a showing of actual harm to the child, the constitutional liberty interests of fit parents take precedence over the best interests of the child.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">By necessity, then, \u201can adoption case has two parts. In the first, the natural parent\u2019s rights are severed.\u201d Margaret F. Brinig, <em>Virginia Domestic Relations Handbook </em>\u00a7 7-2, at 58 (3d ed. 1996). In most cases, that severance is voluntary, and is treated as a matter of contract. <em>Id. </em>When, however, as here, the biological parent protests the adoption, \u201cthe parent[\u2019s] rights are involuntarily terminated because of parental unfitness that cannot be remedied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because a biological parent has a fundamental right to raise her child, this involuntary termination of her parental rights involves significant substantive and procedural safeguards in order to protect the biological parent\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965); <em>Weaver v. Roanoke Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>220 Va. 921, 926, 265 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">These procedural safeguards are critical because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>[o]nce an order of adoption becomes final, the natural parent is divested of all legal rights and obligations with respect to the child____The child, to all intents and purposes, becomes the child of the person adopting him or her to the same extent as if the child had been born to the adopting parent in lawful wedlock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-6\"><em>Doe, </em>222 Va. at 746-47, 284 S.E.2d at 805. It is only after the court severs the biological parent\u2019s rights to the child in question that the court may address the \u201csecond step in the adoption proceeding\u201d\u2014\u201cwhether adoption by the prospective parents will be in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d Brinig, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7-2, at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">3. Virginia\u2019s Statutory Scheme and the Detriment to the Child Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">\n<em>Statutory History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">The Code of Virginia has long provided a procedure by which a trial court may enter an adoption order in the absence of the biological parents\u2019 consent. However, Virginia\u2019s appellate courts have always carefully interpreted that procedure in order to balance the best interests of the child in question and the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the biological parents. While Virginia\u2019s policy has never been to leave children in the untenable situation of being at the mercy of a parent who is \u201cobstinately self-willed in refusing to concur\u201d to the adoption, <em>Malpass v. Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 399, 192 S.E.2d 794, 798 (1972), we have required the prospective adoptive parent to prove not only that the adoption is in the child\u2019s best interests, but also \u201cthat continuance of the relationship between the [parent] and child would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Jolliff v. Crabtree, </em>224 Va. 654, 657, 299 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1983) (citing <em>Ward v. Faw, </em>219 Va. 1120, 1125, 253 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Virginia courts developed the detriment to the child standard in order to balance these competing interests during a time in which the applicable adoption statute did not contain an \u201cexplicit standard.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Futty, </em>25 Va.App. 420, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>426, 489 S.E.2d 232, 235 (1997) (collecting cases and explaining the relevant statutory history). The statute applicable at that time, Code \u00a7 63.1-225(D), stated, in pertinent part: \u201cIf after hearing evidence the court finds that the valid consent of any person or agency whose consent is hereinabove required is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child or is unobtainable, the court may grant the petition without such consent[.]\u201d 1995 Va. Acts, chs. 772, 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The General Assembly eventually codified the constitutional detriment to the child standard when it enacted Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1 in 1995. 1995 Va. Acts, chs. 772, 826. Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1 required the court to consider not only the child\u2019s best interest, but also whether continuing the relationship between the biological parent and the child would be \u201cdetrimental to the child\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">In determining whether the valid consent of any person whose consent is required is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child, or is unobtainable, <em>the court shall consider whether the failure to grant the petition for adoption would he detrimental to the child. In determining whether the failure to grant the petition would he detrimental to the child, the court shall consider </em>all relevant factors, including the birth parent(s)\u2019 efforts to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child, whether the birth parent(s)\u2019 efforts to assert parental rights were thwarted by other people, the birth parent(s)\u2019 ability to care for the child, the age of the child, the quality of any previous relationship between the birth parent(s) and the child and between the birth parent(s) and any other minor children, the duration and suitability of the child\u2019s present custodial environment and the effect of a change of physical custody on the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZb\">1995 Va. Acts, chs. 772, 826 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">In 2002, the General Assembly recodified Title 63.1 of the Virginia Code. 2002 Va. Acts, ch. 747. Former Code \u00a7 63.1-225, recodified at \u00a7 63.2-1203, continued to give a trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>the authority to grant an adoption petition without the biological parents\u2019 consent if it determined that the consent was \u201cwithheld contrary to the best interests of the child as set forth in \u00a7 68.2-1205.\u201d Former Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1, as recodified at \u00a7 63.2-1205 in 2002, retained the language requiring a finding of detriment to the child in order to permit adoption over a parent\u2019s withholding of consent. 2002 Va. Acts, ch. 747. The only change made by the General Assembly at the time of recodification, other than minor adjustments in punctuation, was the insertion of \u201cjuvenile and domestic relations district\u201d prior to the word \u201ccourt\u201d in the highlighted portion of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A year later the General Assembly added language so that the standard contained in Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 applied to determinations made not only by juvenile courts but also by circuit courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In 2006, four years after the recodification of Title 63.1 as Title 63.2, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>to remove the language requiring a finding of detriment to the child in order to permit adoption without parental consent. 2006 Va. Acts, chs. 825, 848; <em>see Gooch v. Harris, 52 </em>Va.App. 157, 161-62 &amp; n. 5, 662 S.E.2d 95, 97 &amp; n. 5 (2008) (holding that \u201cCode \u00a7 63.2-1205 no longer requires any specific finding that failure to grant the adoption petition would be detrimental to the child\u201d but declining to reach the constitutional issue because it was not raised by the parties); <em>see also T.S.G. v. B.A.S., </em>52 Va.App. 583, 597 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12, 665 S.E.2d 854, 861 &amp; n. 12 (2008) (same). As set out in the Acts of Assembly, that amendment made the following additions (indicated by italicized text), and deletions (indicated by strikethrough text):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9v\">In determining whether the valid consent of any person whose consent is required is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child, or is unobtainable, the circuit court or juvenile and domestic relations district court, as the case may be, shall consider whether the -failure to grant <em>granting </em>the petition pending before it would be detrimental to <em>in the best interests of </em>the child. -In determining\u2014whether- the failure to grant-the--petition would be detrimental to the efaild--the <em>The </em>circuit court or juvenile and domestic relations district court, as the case may be, shall consider all relevant factors, including the birth parent(s)\u2019 efforts to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child; <em>whether the birth parent(s) are currently willing and able to assume full custody of the child; </em>whether the birth parent(s)\u2019 efforts to assert parental rights were thwarted by other people; the birth parent(s)\u2019 ability to care for the child; the age of the child; the quality of any previous relationship between the birth parent(s) and the child and between the birth parent(s) and any other minor children; the duration and suitability of the child\u2019s present custodial environment; and the effect of a change of physical custody on the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">2006 Va. Acts, ch. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Thus, the General Assembly retained the factors required to be considered to determine whether the failure to grant the petition for adoption would be detrimental to the child. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ever, instead of requiring the consideration of those factors to determine <em>detriment, </em>Code \u00a7 63.2-1205, read in conjunction with Code \u00a7 63.2-1203, lists them simply as factors relevant to determining whether \u201cany person or agency whose consent is required is withheld contrary to the <em>best interests </em>of the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1203 (emphasis added). Once again, just like before the enactment of Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1 in 1995, the relevant statutes make no mention of the constitutional standard requiring proof of detriment to the child in order to override a lack of parental consent for adoption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">\n<em>The Detriment to the Child Standard Exists Independently of the Virginia Code to Protect the Constitutional Rights of Biological Parents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Since the Virginia Supreme Court decided <em>Malpass </em>in 1972, Virginia courts have emphasized that there must be more than a mere finding that granting an adoption over the parent\u2019s objection would be in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 393, 192 S.E.2d at 794. The rationale for this rule is clear: were \u201cthe suitability of placement in the prospective adoptive home ... alone sufficient to warrant a finding that consent to the adoption was being withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interests ... the consent requirement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>adoption statute would be meaningless.\u201d <em>Hickman, </em>25 Va.App. at 427, 489 S.E.2d at 235. If the best interest of the child were the sole consideration in granting an adoption, \u201cthe court could forever divest a natural parent of all rights and obligations with respect to the child, simply by finding placement in the prospective adoptive home more suitable to the child than placement with the child\u2019s birth parent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Instead, the best interest language of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205\u2014like the best interest language in earlier incarnations of the same statute\u2014must be read in light of the biological parent\u2019s right to her child. In <em>Ward,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for instance, our Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting the stepfather\u2019s adoption petition over the father\u2019s protest. 219 Va. at 1125, 253 S.E.2d at 662. There, the trial court found that the adoption was in the child\u2019s best interests because the child was \u201cvery affectionate towards his stepfather,\u201d the child\u2019s mother and stepfather provided him with a loving and stable home, and, although he had sent birthday and Christmas presents and regularly supported the child, the father had not visited his son for three-and-one-half years prior to the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1122, 253 S.E.2d at 660. As a result, the trial court found that \u201cthe boy did not know his natural father; ... Ward was \u2018a complete stranger\u2019 to his son.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court also reasoned that \u201c[t]o deny the adoption and take the child from a stable and happy environment and expose him to the natural father through his visitation rights would be in essence for the Court to experiment with the future welfare of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1123, 253 S.E.2d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Despite these factual findings, the Supreme Court reversed. The Court, relying on its earlier decision in <em>Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 393, 192 S.E.2d at 794, concluded that \u201cwhen \u2018there is no question of the fitness of the non-consenting parent and he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>not by conduct or previous legal action lost his rights to the child, it must be shown that continuance of the relationship between the two would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward, </em>219 Va. at 1124, 253 S.E.2d at 661 (quoting <em>Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 399, 192 S.E.2d at 799). In <em>Ward </em>there was \u201cno finding that the natural father [was] an unfit parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cthe burden was on the adoptive parent to establish by the evidence that continuation of the relationship between the father and the child would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1125, 253 S.E.2d at 661. There, the adoptive parent failed to carry the burden. <em>Id. </em>at 1125, 253 S.E.2d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Moreover, even in cases in which a parent is not fit, \u201cthe unfitness of the parent\u201d does not, in and of itself, justify the entry of an adoption order over the biological parent\u2019s objection. <em>Hickman, </em>25 Va.App. at 428, 489 S.E.2d at 236. Instead, the unfitness must be so severe and so incapable of remedy that \u201cthe continuance of the relationship\u201d between the biological parent and the child would be \u201cdetrimental to the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In <em>Doe, </em>222 Va. at 745-46, 284 S.E.2d at 805-06,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> our Supreme Court reversed a stepmother\u2019s adoption petition that relied solely on the father and stepmother\u2019s argument that the mother should not have parental rights to her biological son because she was a lesbian. The Court, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the mother\u2019s lifestyle rendered her an unfit parent, concluded that unfitness alone was not enough to permanently sever a biological parent\u2019s rights to her child: \u201cIf Jane Doe is an unfit parent, it is solely her lesbian relationship which renders her unfit, and this must be to such an extent as to make the continuance of the parent-child relationship hereto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>fore existing between her and her son detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 284 S.E.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The Court concluded that, because the petitioners had presented no evidence that a continued relationship with the mother would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare, the trial court erred when it granted the petition for adoption. Thus, in order to grant a petition for adoption over the biological parent\u2019s objection, courts must look beyond the biological parent\u2019s unfitness to have custody of a child, and \u201cdetermine whether the consequences of harm to the child of allowing the parent-child relationship to continue are more severe than the consequences of its termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747, 284 S.E.2d at 805: <em>accord Lyle v. Eskridge, </em>14 Va.App. 874, 877 n. 1, 419 S.E.2d 863, 865 n. 1 (1992) (\u201cThere may be situations where a parent may be deemed unfit and, yet, continuance of the relationship will not be detrimental to the child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">This recognition that the detriment to the child standard is necessary to protect the due process rights of nonconsenting biological parents is consistent with other decisions involving the rights of parents and the protection of children. For instance, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the constitutionally protected rights of biological parents can only be overcome by a showing of actual harm, or detriment to a child\u2019s well-being, in <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998) (plurality op.). There, the Court addressed the parents\u2019 appeal of an order allowing the child\u2019s paternal grandparents visitation based on Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, the parents argued that the order infringed upon their right to \u201cautonomy in child rearing and, hence, violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 501 S.E.2d at 417. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Our Supreme Court agreed with the parents and reversed the trial court\u2019s order. Adopting the reasoning of this Court, our Supreme Court held that \u201cstate interference with a fundamental right must be justified by a compelling state interest, and that to constitute a compelling interest, state interference with a parent\u2019s right to raise [her] child must be for the purpose of protecting the child\u2019s health or welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 501 S.E.2d at 418. Thus, the Court reasoned that a non-parent must prove\u2014in addition to establishing the visitation is in the best interests of the child\u2014that \u201cdenial of non-parent visitation would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare before the cdurt [could] interfere with the constitutionally protected parental rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 501 S.E.2d at 418; <em>see also Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. at 83, 581 S.E.2d at 902 (holding that in a \u201cdispute between a fit parent and a non-parent,\u201d the best interests test should be applied only if the trial court first finds \u201can actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare without\u201d visitation with the non-parent).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">As these cases illustrate, the detriment to the child standard exists independent of the Virginia Code to protect the parental rights of biological parents\u2014rights that the United States Supreme Court has recognized are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 57, 120 S.Ct. at 2055-56.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>we conclude that a trial court must make a detriment to the child determination, regardless of the language of the relevant statute, before entering an adoption order, in order to protect the Fourteenth Amendment rights of a nonconsenting biological parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Before 1995, Virginia\u2019s adoption statutes, as interpreted by-Virginia\u2019s appellate courts, passed constitutional muster despite the absence of an explicit standard because the courts read into the statute the requirement that \u201c[a]n adoption over objection by a natural parent should not be granted except upon clear and convincing evidence that the adoption would be in a child\u2019s best interest <em>and </em>that it would be detrimental to continue the natural parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>Lyle, </em>14 Va.App. at 876, 419 S.E.2d at 865 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Frye v. Spotte, </em>4 Va.App. 530, 532, 359 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1987)). We must now address what effect, if any, the General Assembly\u2019s 2006 amendment of Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 has on the applicability of the detriment to the child standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\n<em>Legislative Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Having reviewed the statutory history of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205 and determined that the detriment to the child standard is a constitutional, not statutory, requirement, we reach the underlying issue in this case: Whether the General Assembly intended trial courts to abandon the detriment to the child standard when applying Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and - 1205. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>In making this determination, we are guided by several principles of statutory construction. We initially note that \u201ca presumption normally arises that a change in law was intended when new provisions are added to prior legislation by an amendatory act\u201d or \u201cexisting rights\u201d are \u201cwithdraw[n] ... [from an] act.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 16, 20, 215 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1975) (per curiam). We also, however, have a duty to construe statutes subject to a constitutional challenge in a manner that \u201cavoid[s] any conflict with the Constitution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Doe, </em>278 Va. 223, 229, 682 S.E.2d 906, 908 (2009) (citations omitted). Accordingly, where, as here we are faced with the construction of a statute involving constitutional implications, \u201c[w]e attribute to the legislature the intent to enact laws that conform to the [Constitution in all respects.\u201d <em>Kopalchick v. Catholic Diocese of Richmond, </em>274 Va. 332, 340, 645 S.E.2d 439, 443 (2007). Thus, we \u201c[i]ndulg[e] every possible presumption in favor of the validity of the statute now under consideration,\u201d <em>Young v. Commonwealth, </em>101 Va. 853, 870, 45 S.E. 327, 331 (1903), and, \u201cwhenever possible, ... interpret statutory language in a matter that avoids a constitutional question,\u201d <em>Doe, </em>278 Va. at 229, 682 S.E.2d at 908. A statute cannot \u201cbe declared to be unconstitutional unless it is plainly and clearly so. If any reasonable doubt exists as to its constitutionality, the act will be upheld. To doubt is to affirm.\u201d <em>City of Roanoke v. Elliott, </em>123 Va. 393, 406, 96 S.E. 819, 824 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Thus, while we recognize that the General Assembly removed the detriment to the child language from Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 in 2006, that recognition does not, however, lead us to hold that the General Assembly intended that courts no longer make a detriment to the child determination. Because the detriment to the child standard is necessary to protect the due process rights of nonconsenting biological parents, a conclusion that the General Assembly intended to abandon that standard would lead us to deduce that Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205 facially violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Given that the standard is constitutionally necessary, we are confident that the General Assembly had no intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>rendering Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205 unconstitutional when it removed the \u201cdetriment to the child\u201d language. Instead, we conclude that the General Assembly removed this phrase because it was aware of our prior decisions and the constitutional import of the detriment to the child determination, and believed that including the detriment to the child language\u2014 which referenced a long-standing constitutional standard that existed independent of the statute itself\u2014was mere surplus-age. <em>See Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 803, 805, 553 S.E.2d 729, 730 (2001) (holding that principles of statutory construction require us to presume, in the absence of explicit evidence to the contrary, that the legislature is familiar with the decisions of our appellate courts and that it acquiesces therein when it takes legislative action).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Despite the deletion of this language from the Code, we conclude that the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution still requires that judges consider whether a continued relationship with his or her biological parent would be detrimental to a child\u2019s well-being. Because this requirement continues to exist, a trial court must make that finding before entering an adoption order over the objection of a nonconsenting parent. Here, the trial court did not make the detriment to the child determination; thus, its application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205 in this case violated Todd\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">B. <em>Interpretation of Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(11)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Our analysis does not end with our determination that the trial court\u2019s application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205 violated Todd\u2019s due process rights. Because the trial court announced alternative grounds for its holding, we must also address Todd\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H). Because we hold that the plain language of Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H) refers to the six months imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>diately preceding the filing of the adoption petition, we reverse on this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law which we review <em>de novo, </em>and we determine the legislative intent from the words the General Assembly used in the statute. <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 455, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313-14 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H) states that an adoption may proceed without a birth parent\u2019s consent when the prospective adoptive parent proves by clear and convincing evidence that the biological parent has failed, without just cause, to visit or contact \u201cthe child for a period of six months prior to the filing of the adoption petition.\u201d The parties dispute whether the statutory language \u201cprior to\u201d refers to a period <em>immediately </em>prior to the filing of the petition, or to <em>any </em>period prior to the filing of the petition. Todd argues that the phrase \u201cprior to\u201d refers to the six months immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition, whereas Copeland argues, and the trial court determined, that the phrase refers to any six-month period of abandonment that occurred at any time before the filing of the petition. Accordingly, the trial court held that Todd\u2019s failure to visit her child from July 2006 through July 2007 satisfied the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In determining the plain meaning of statutory language, \u201clegislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Ardestani v. I.N.S., </em>502 U.S. 129, 136, 112 S.Ct. 515, 520, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991). However, the phrase \u201cprior to\u201d simply means \u201cbefore,\u201d Bryan A. Garner, <em>A Dictionary of Modem English Usage </em>692 (2d ed. 1995), which does not aid in determining whether the General Assembly intended that the relevant time period be that immediately before the filing of the petition, or any time period before the filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">However, the fact that the General Assembly chose to tie the six-month period to a date certain\u2014the filing of the adoption petition\u2014does aid our analysis. <em>See United States v. Locke, </em>471 U.S. 84, 95, 105 S.Ct. 1785, 1792-93, 85 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985) (construing a statutory filing deadline of \u201cprior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>December 31\u201d to mean \u201con or before December 30\u201d\u2014the time immediately preceding the date certain). In this context, the filing of the adoption petition is a condition that must exist before the circuit court has jurisdiction over the adoption proceeding. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.2-1201. It is the beginning of the actual adoption process. By tying the beginning of the six-month period to a legally significant, specific date, the General Assembly chose to limit the time period that it determined was relevant to the trial court\u2019s determination to the six-month period immediately preceding that date certain. In this context, \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018prior to\u2019 may be clumsy, but its meaning is clear.\u201d <em>Locke, </em>471 U.S. at 96, 105 S.Ct. at 1793.</p>\n<p id=\"ACd\">We find this interpretation to be most consistent with the underlying legislative policy embodied by Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H). This statute is a codification of the principle that parental unfitness may be established by proof of abandonment of a child without justification. <em>See Patrick v. Byerley, </em>228 Va. 691, 694, 325 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1985) (\u201cAbandonment of a child without justification establishes parental unfitness.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must interpret the statute in a way that is most consistent with the General Assembly\u2019s intent to allow the adoption of an abandoned child without the abandoning parent\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Abandonment is the \u201crenunciation or abdication of responsibility over the child ... or a voluntary relinquishment [of the child] without cause.\u201d <em>Keene, 2 </em>Va.App. at 585, 347 S.E.2d at 161; <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1 (7th ed. 2000) (defining \u201cabandonment\u201d as \u201c[t]he relinquishing of a right or interest <em>with the intention of never again claiming it </em>\u201d (emphasis added)). Abandonment is not, however, incurable, and our prior decisions and the analogous provisions under Title 16.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>of the Virginia Code indicate a policy of encouraging the reunification of parent and child whenever possible. <em>See, e.g., Weaver, </em>220 Va. at 926, 265 S.E.2d at 695 (noting that statutes terminating the legal relationship between parent and child should be interpreted consistently with the governmental objective of preserving, when possible, the parent-child relationship); <em>Keene, 2 </em>Va.App. at 588, 347 S.E.2d at 162 (stating that a mother who had been \u201cdeprived of her children for more than a year\u201d was \u201centitled ... to an opportunity to demonstrate that she can succeed as a parent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">For instance, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2), which governs the disposition of abused and neglected children who are in the care of social services, provides that parental rights may be terminated only when the parent has been \u201cunwilling or unable, without good cause, within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months from the date the child was placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(1) allows for the termination of parental rights of parents who \u201chave, without good cause, failed to maintain continuing contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child for a period of six months after the child\u2019s placement in foster care.\u201d In both of these situations, the natural parents are afforded the assistance of \u201csocial, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(1), (2). These statutes reflect Virginia\u2019s policy of attempting to reunite families when it is possible to do so. Courts resort to the termination of parental rights in these situations only when the parents have exhibited, in the face of assistance from social services over an extended period of time, an intent to abandon one\u2019s child to foster care, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(1), or a complete inability to successfully parent one\u2019s child, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The foregoing interpretation of Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H) is consistent with Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C) and Virginia\u2019s policy of seeking to reunite parents and children whenever possible, because it allows a biological parent who abandons a child for a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>of time the same opportunity to cure that abandonment as that afforded a parent whose child is placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court erred in its interpretation of Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H), and hold that the statute refers to the six-month period of time immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition. We also hold that the trial court\u2019s application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205 violated Todd\u2019s due process rights because it failed to make the necessary finding under Virginia law that a continuing relationship with her child would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and dismiss the adoption petition without prejudice. <em>See Williams, </em>256 Va. at 22, 501 S.E.2d at 418 (stating that there was no need to remand a case when there was \u201cno allegation or proof that denial of grandparent visitation would be detrimental to this child\u2019s welfare\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-12\">. Todd also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove that the adoption was in the child\u2019s best interest and the constitutionality of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205 on equal protection grounds. Because we hold that the trial court misinterpreted Code \u00a7 63.2-1202(H) and violated Todd\u2019s due process rights through its application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203 and -1205, we need not reach the issues of sufficiency of the evidence and equal protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">.

Finally, we note that this conclusion is consistent with the Code\u2019s treatment of children who are in the care of social services. In order to terminate the parental rights of a biological parent under Title 16.1 of the Code of Virginia, the party seeking termination must prove more than the termination would be in the child\u2019s best interests. Code \u00a7 16.1-283, which governs the termination of residual parental rights of parents whose children have been placed in foster care, requires more than a finding that the termination will be in the best interest of the child. Instead, the statute sets forth several other required findings <em>in addition </em>to a determination that the termination would be in the child\u2019s best interests in order to justify a termination of parental rights. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) (requiring a finding that the child suffered serious abuse or neglect the causes for which are unlikely to be remedied within a reasonable time); Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(1) (requiring a finding that the parents \"have, without good cause failed to maintain contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child for a period of six months after the child\u2019s placement in foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>care\u201d despite support from social services); Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(C)(2) (requiring a finding that the parents are \"unwilling or unable ... to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child's foster care placement, notwithstanding\u201d the efforts of various agencies and professionals); Code \u00a7 16.1-283(D) (requiring a finding that the child was abandoned, the identity of the parents cannot be ascertained, and no parents, relatives or guardian has claimed the child); Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) (requiring a finding that the parent\u2019s residual parental rights to a sibling of the child have been terminated, the parent has been convicted of any of several statutorily enumerated crimes, or the parent has \"subjected any child to aggravated circumstances\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\">. In this case, we need not attempt to define the term \"detriment to the child.\u201d We do note, however, that none of the trial court\u2019s findings rise to the level of detriment required by prior appellate decisions or analogous statutes under Title 16.1 of the Code of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">. While we note that a finding of parental unfitness is sufficient to transfer the custody of a child to a non-parent, it is not enough\u2014 standing alone\u2014to justify the termination of parental rights. <em>See </em>Part II.A, <em>supra </em>(discussing the detriment to the child standard); <em>see also Keene, 2 </em>Va.App. at 588, 347 S.E.2d at 161 (collecting cases for the proposition that a showing of abandonment alone is not sufficient for the termination of parental rights in an adoption proceeding).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
