On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the fruits of a search of his person following a traffic stop of the car in which he was a passenger. We hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, fails to support the trial court\u2019s ruling. Thus, we reverse the challenged conviction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">On October 18, 2006, Richmond Police Detective Timothy Neville obtained a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, based on an incident that had occurred that day. Richmond Police Officer Roger Harris arrested appellant on that warrant. Officer Harris then entered information about appellant\u2019s arrest into the department\u2019s computerized PISTOL database, after which PISTOL included the alert \u201cprobably armed\u201d in reference to appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PISTOL is a computerized system that is maintained by the police department and is accessible to officers in the field through the computers in their cars. \u201c[OJfficers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>come in contact with people who are probably armed narcotics sellers/users\u201d may have such information entered into the PISTOL database so that, during a subsequent encounter with any such person, other officers in the field may consult the database for \u201cofficer safety\u201d purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">On June 21, 2007, appellant entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to the charge of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, based on the October 18, 2006 offense for which Officer Harris had entered the information in PISTOL. Appellant also entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to a charge of possession of cocaine with an intent to distribute, which had an offense date of March 13, 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced appellant to ten years for the cocaine offense and five years for the firearm offense but suspended all but three months of that time on certain conditions including supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">At an unspecified time on September 18, 2007,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> eleven months after the offense date for appellant\u2019s firearm possession conviction and six months after the offense date for appellant\u2019s possession-with-intent-to-distribute conviction, two off-duty police officers, Hedman and Moore, were working at Hillside Court in south Richmond, a Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority (RRHA) property. Their purpose was to \u201c[e]nforce trespassing [restrictions] in Hillside.\u201d While on routine patrol there, the officers observed a vehicle with a rear brake light out, and they activated their emergency equipment and effected a traffic stop of the vehicle. As part of their duty to prevent trespassing, they obtained identification from the car\u2019s two occupants, the driver and appellant, who was \u201cthe rear seat passenger\u201d and was sitting \u201cbehind the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d The officers determined neither had any outstanding warrants. However, when Officer Hedman checked the interdepartmental PISTOL system, appellant\u2019s name \u201ccame <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>back with an alert, <em>\u2018probably armed and a narcotics seller/user.\u2019\u201d </em>\u201c[0]nce [the officers] saw the alert for <em>\u2018probably armed, </em>\u2019 they immediately addressed that, ... for officer safety....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Officer Moore asked appellant to step out of the vehicle, and appellant complied. Officer Moore then asked appellant \u201cif he had any weapons on him,\u201d and appellant said he did not. Officer Moore responded, \u201cI\u2019m going to pat you [down] and make sure,\u201d to which appellant responded, \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re not going to search me.\u201d When Officer Moore began patting appellant down, he felt a gun in appellant\u2019s left front pocket<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and asked appellant about it. Appellant first failed to respond and then said the item was a lighter. Officer Moore then pulled a two-shot Derringer from appellant\u2019s pocket. At that time, Officer Hedman had not yet determined whether he would issue the driver a summons for the nonfunctioning brake light and the traffic stop had not yet been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Appellant moved to suppress the firearm, arguing information that he had possessed a firearm eleven months earlier on October 18, 2006, was insufficient to provide reasonable suspicion to believe he was armed and dangerous at the time of the traffic stop on September 18, 2007. The Commonwealth countered that the officers \u201cshould be able to rely on\u201d the information in \u201c[their] own system ... when they are out in the field doing their work.\u201d The trial court ruled that, given \u201cthe officer receiving information with regards to the fact that this person had been known to carry firearms,\u201d the officer \u201cdid not act impermissibly in conducting a pat down ... for purposes of the officer\u2019s safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">After appellant entered a conditional plea of guilty to the offense and was sentenced, he noted this appeal. Following briefing and oral argument in this Court, we ordered counsel for both parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing \u201cthe effect, if any,\u201d of the decisions in <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009), and <em>Montejo v. Louisiana, </em>556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009), on the question before the Court on appeal. Following the filing of those supplemental briefs, both counsel also presented supplemental oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">On appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Mills v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 459, 468, 418 S.E.2d 718, 723 (1992). \u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact[, whether express or implicit,] unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them[,] and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc). We review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as whether probable cause or reasonable suspicion supported a seizure or search. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911, 920 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Under settled constitutional principles, a law enforcement officer may conduct a <em>Terry </em>investigatory stop of an individual if the officer \u201creasonably suspects that the person ... is committing or has committed a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>555 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 781, 784, 172 L.Ed.2d 694, 700 (2009) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). Additionally, once the officer has conducted a valid stop, he may frisk the person for weapons if he \u201creasonably suspect[s] that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In cases in which the stop is based on reasonable suspicion of a contemporaneous crime, the nature of the crime suspected may be sufficient to support a concomitant frisk for weapons. <em>See, e.g., Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 28, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 910 (noting the suspect\u2019s actions \u201cwere consistent with [the officer\u2019s] hypothesis that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>these men were contemplating a daylight robbery\u2014which, it is reasonable to assume, would be likely to involve the use of weapons\u201d); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 692, 701 n. 3, 636 S.E.2d 403, 407 n. 3 (2006) (\u201c \u2018[I]t is reasonable for an officer to believe a person may be armed and dangerous when the person is suspected of being involved in a drug transaction.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Bustos-Torres, </em>396 F.3d 935, 943 (8th Cir.2005))). In other cases, the basis for the stop will add little or nothing to the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis required to support a weapons frisk, and more will be required to provide reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect may be armed and dangerous. <em>See McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 546, 554, 659 S.E.2d 512, 517 (2008) (\u201cAn officer may not automatically search a driver or his passengers pursuant to the issuance of a traffic citation ..., but he may frisk the driver and passengers for weapons if he develops reasonable suspicion during the traffic ... stop to believe the particular person to be frisked is armed and dangerous.\u201d); <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 407, 417, 551 S.E.2d 606, 611 (2001) (holding that trespassing is \u201can offense not generally associated with the wrongdoer being armed\u201d); <em>see also 4 </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 9.6(a), at 625-27 (4th ed.2003) (discussing the types of offenses various jurisdictions have held are likely and unlikely to give rise to reasonable suspicion for a weapons frisk).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The United States Supreme Court has concluded that when a law enforcement officer conducts a <em>Terry </em>stop of a vehicle to investigate a traffic violation, the Fourth Amendment permits the officer to detain not only the driver but also the passengers for the duration of the stop, as long as the duration of the stop is reasonable. <em>Brendlin v. California, </em>551 U.S. 249, 255-58, 127 S.Ct. 2400, 2406-07, 168 L.Ed.2d 132, 138-40 (2007). Most recently, in <em>Johnson, </em>555 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694, the Court has clarified the application of <em>Terry\u2019s </em>stop-and-frisk principles to traffic stops, holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArA\">[I]n a traffic-stop setting, the first <em>Terry </em>condition\u2014a lawful investigatory stop\u2014is met whenever it is lawful for police to detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>a vehicular violation. The police need not have, in addition, cause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is involved in criminal activity. To justify a pat down of the driver or a passenger during a traffic stop, however, just as in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of criminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 129 S.Ct. at 784, 172 L.Ed.2d at 700 (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The \u201cauthority\u201d to frisk for weapons during a stop must be \u201cnarrowly drawn.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>safety or that of others was in danger. And in determining whether the officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u201chunch,\u201d but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and footnote omitted); <em>see United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750-51, 151 L.Ed.2d 740, 749-50 (2002). In assessing the totality of the circumstances supporting reasonable suspicion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\"><em>the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intru</em>sion---- Anything less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result [the United States Supreme] Court has consistently refused to sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906 (emphasis added); <em>see Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750, 151 L.Ed.2d at 749 (reiterating that the officer must be able to articulate the \u201c \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 \u201d which he believes supports the frisk (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621, 629 (1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion must apply to the <em>particular </em>individual to be frisked, <em>e.g. Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 699 n. 9, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2592 n. 9, 69 L.Ed.2d 340, 347 n. 9 (1981) (citing <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979)), and the officer must reasonably suspect the person is \u201carmed and <em>presently </em>dangerous to the officer or to others,\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d at 908 (emphasis added). Circumstances relevant in this analysis include the characteristics of the area surrounding the stop, the time of the stop, the specific conduct of the suspect individual, whether a bulge in his clothing suggests the presence of a weapon, the character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of the offense under suspicion, the suspect\u2019s criminal history, if known, and the unique perspective of a police officer trained and experienced in the detection of crime. <em>See McCain, 275 </em>Va. at 554, 659 S.E.2d at 517; <em>Troncoso v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 942, 945, 947, 407 S.E.2d 349, 350-51 (1991) (holding the sighting of a large bulge under the clothing of a person stopped for a traffic infraction, coupled with nervousness, fidgeting, perspiring, and furtive efforts to cover the bulge, provided reasonable suspicion for a weapons frisk); <em>State v. Valentine, </em>134 N.J. 536, 636 A.2d 505, 510-11 (1994) (\u201c[A] police officer\u2019s knowledge of a suspect\u2019s criminal history, especially where that history involves weapons offenses, is a relevant factor in judging the reasonableness of a <em>Terry </em>frisk.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In sum, \u201c\u2018[e]ven in high crime areas, where the possibility that any given individual is armed is significant, <em>Terry </em>requires reasonable, <em>individualized[, articulated] </em>suspicion [that the individual may be <em>presently </em>armed and dangerous] before a frisk for weapons can be conducted.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 554, 659 S.E.2d at 517 (quoting <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334 n. 2, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1098 n. 2, 108 L.Ed.2d 276, 286 n. 2 (1990)) (emphasis added); <em>see Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Here, the record failed to demonstrate Officers Hedman and Moore had reasonable suspicion for the frisk based on personal knowledge and contemporaneous observations, and the Commonwealth does not contend otherwise. The factual basis for the stop was an equipment violation\u2014a nonfunctioning brake light\u2014committed by the vehicle\u2019s driver. The record contains no evidence that the stop occurred late at night or even after dark. It also contains no evidence concerning the character of the neighborhood, beyond the fact that it was an RRHA-owned property that sought to avoid problems with trespassers, as demonstrated by the employment of off-duty police officers to enforce trespassing restrictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Harris, </em>262 Va. at 417, 551 S.E.2d at 611 (in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>assessing the reasonableness of a stop and frisk on the premises of a public housing development where the evidence established a \u201clong-term\u201d \u201cdrug elimination program\u201d was in place, observing this evidence did not indicate whether the program had been successful or whether the drug problem persisted). Although the officers also wished to investigate whether appellant and the driver might be trespassing, trespassing is a minor offense, and the record neither contains evidence nor supports an inference indicating that trespassers in general, or trespassers on this property in particular, were likely to be armed. <em>See id. </em>Further, neither appellant nor the driver had any outstanding warrants, and the record gives no indication the officers saw any signs of weapons, drugs or other contraband on the car\u2019s occupants or in the vehicle. It also gives no indication that they observed appellant or the driver engage in any furtive behavior tending to indicate the presence of a weapon or some sort of contraband or other criminal activity. Finally, appellant was cooperative until he declined Officer Moore\u2019s request to frisk him and responded negatively to Officer Moore\u2019s statement that he would conduct a frisk with or without appellant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Thus, we examine whether sufficient additional information existed upon which the officers were entitled to rely to provide reasonable suspicion for a weapons frisk. We conclude the holding of <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 229-33, 105 S.Ct. 675, 681-82, 83 L.Ed.2d 604, 612-15 (1985), permits imputation of the knowledge of the officers who <em>entered </em>the information in the police department\u2019s PISTOL system to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Officers Hedman and Moore for purposes of assessing whether they had reasonable suspicion for the frisk. In <em>Hensley, </em>the Court held that where officers issue a flyer indicating they have reasonable suspicion to stop a suspect, and other officers, who lack sufficient personal knowledge to provide reasonable suspicion, \u201cobjeetive[ly] rel[y]\u201d on the flyer to make a stop, the validity of the stop depends upon whether the officers issuing the flyer in fact had the requisite reasonable suspicion. <em>Id. </em>at 232, 105 S.Ct. at 682, 83 L.Ed.2d at 614; <em>see Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 260, 266, 549 S.E.2d 616, 619 (2001) (applying <em>Hensley </em>to hold the arresting officer \u201cwas entitled to rely on information communicated to him by his fellow law enforcement officers\u201d); <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 234, 240, 481 S.E.2d 486, 489 (approving aggregation of police, information under \u201ccollective knowledge\u201d principles), <em>reaching the same result on other grounds, </em>25 Va.App. 662, 492 S.E.2d 451 (1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We hold the imputation-of-knowledge principles used in <em>Hensley </em>to determine whether reasonable suspicion existed <em>for a stop </em>also apply to determining whether an individual, already being detained in the course of a legitimate stop, may be subjected to <em>a weapons frisk. </em>We also hold the PISTOL system\u2019s alert listing appellant as \u201cprobably armed/\u2019 implying justification for a weapons frisk, is the computer equivalent of the paper flyer in <em>Hensley. See </em>LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.5(i), at n. 510 (4th ed. Supp.2008-2009) <em>(\u201cHensley </em>no doubt applies to transferring of information by computer, as well, but in such circumstances the officer must act reasonably as to his interpretation of the [information] received via computer.\u201d); <em>see also Duckett v. United States, </em>886 A.2d 548, 550-52 (D.C.2005) (implicitly approving an officer\u2019s use of vehicle registration information obtained from two different computerized databases\u2014the national \u201cNCIC\u201d database including, <em>inter alia, </em>information about stolen vehicles, and the local police database, \u2018WALES,\u201d containing vehicle registration data updated on a weekly basis\u2014but holding the officer could not rely blindly on the results of a search of those databases indicating they found \u201cNO RECORD\u201d of the specific vehicle information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>entered for purposes of establishing reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop). Thus, for purposes of determining whether a violation of the Fourth Amendment occurred,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Officers Hedman and Moore, like.the officers in <em>Hensley, </em>could rise no higher than the facts and circumstances known to the officers who entered the information into the PISTOL system. Here, like in <em>Hensley, </em>we hold the information proved to be within the knowledge of the officers performing the PISTOL data entry\u2014coupled with any personal knowledge Officers Hedman and Moore acquired during the course of the September 18, 2007 traffic stop\u2014was insufficient to provide reasonable suspicion for the frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The information Officer Hedman obtained about appellant from PISTOL was that appellant was <em>\u201cprobably armed and a narcotics seller/user.\u201d </em>The only information in the record proved to be known by Officer Harris, the person who entered the information leading to the alert, \u201cprobably armed,\u201d was that appellant had been arrested on a warrant for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, based on an act of possession that had occurred <em>eleven </em>months prior to the September 18, 2007 traffic stop. Although the Commonwealth offered evidence <em>at trial </em>that appellant was convicted for the firearm offense after the information was entered into PISTOL and before the encounter at issue in this appeal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the record contains no indication that the fact of appellant\u2019s conviction for the firearm offense was known to the data entry officer or to the detective who observed the offense and obtained the arrest warrant. It also contains no indication that appellant\u2019s <em>conviction </em>for the firearm offense had any impact on the alert that had already been entered in PISTOL. Thus, we consider only the information known to the data entry officer at the time he entered the information into the database\u2014that appellant had been arrested on the warrant for the firearm offense, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>had occurred eleven months prior to the traffic stop at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">As to the drag-related portion of the alert, Officers Hedman and Moore did not articulate any reliance on it in determining whether to frisk appellant. Nevertheless, we assume Officer Moore considered this part of the alert, as well. We assume further that this part of the alert was based on appellant\u2019s act of possessing cocaine with an intent to distribute six months prior to the instant firearm offense and for which appellant was convicted prior to his arrest for the instant firearm offense. We note, however, that the record fails to indicate who entered the information about the drag offense or when. In the absence of any such evidence, we can infer at most only that this information was entered into PISTOL in the same way as the information regarding the previous incident of firearm possession in October 2006\u2014after appellant\u2019s arrest for the drag offense but before his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In sum, the most this record establishes the data entry officers knew was that appellant had been (1) <em>arrested </em>on a warrant for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon for an act of possession alleged<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to have occurred <em>eleven months prior </em>to the instant offense and (2) <em>arrested </em>for possessing cocaine with an intent to distribute for an act alleged to have occurred <em>six months prior </em>to the instant offense. The record contains no indication appellant was in possession of a firearm on the date of the cocaine possession offense in March 2007 or at any other time after the date on which he was alleged to have committed the previous firearm possession offense in October 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Thus, the issue is whether police who encounter a passenger in the course of a routine traffic stop have reasonable suspicion to believe he may be armed and dangerous when they learn he has no warrants outstanding but that he was previously arrested on a warrant for possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>firearm by a convicted felon based on an act of possession that occurred <em>eleven months earlier </em>and previously arrested for possessing cocaine with an intent to distribute based on an act of possession that occurred <em>six months earlier. </em>We hold that, in the absence of some <em>contemporaneous </em>indication that the individual might be carrying a weapon, these facts do not provide reasonable suspicion to believe he may be <em>presently </em>armed and dangerous. Absent additional circumstances, \u201can officer\u2019s knowledge of a suspect\u2019s criminal history alone is not sufficient to justify the initial stop of a suspect\u201d or, absent special circumstances such as a lengthy or closely contemporaneous criminal history, \u201c[sufficient] to justify a frisk of a suspect once stopped....\u201d <em>Valentine, </em>636 A.2d at 510-11 (involving prior incident of firearm possession); <em>United States v.

Prior involvement with guns and drugs is an appropriate factor for consideration in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis but is insufficient, standing alone, to provide reasonable suspicion for a weapons frisk. An adequate temporal or other connection must be shown before reasonable suspicion may be found to exist. <em>See Williams, </em>962 F.2d at 1223; <em>United States v.

The officers\u2019 interaction with [appellant] during the traffic stop in no way supported this hunch, because the officers did not observe or notice any [weapons,] drugs, odor of drugs, or drug paraphernalia in the vehicle. Further, the officers did not notice any physical or mental impairment that would indicate drug use by [appellant], and there were no physical or other characteristics observed by the officers[, such as nervousness, furtive gestures, a bulge in appellant\u2019s clothing, or a refusal to remove his hands from his pockets,] that indicated [appellant] might be armed and dangerous----[Appellant] identified himself when requested, did not make any furtive movements, and cooperated fully with the police officers until [Officer Moore] asked permission to do a pat-down search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 555, 659 S.E.2d at 517. Although appellant, unlike <em>McCain, </em>was known to the officers to have had a prior arrest on a warrant for possessing a firearm and a separate prior arrest for possessing cocaine with an intent to distribute, the acts leading to these convictions occurred, respectively, eleven and six months earlier and provided no more than a hunch that appellant was engaged in any related illegal activities at the time of the traffic stop. This evidence, viewed in its totality, failed to provide reasonable suspicion to believe appellant may have been armed and dangerous. If we were to reach a contrary conclusion in this case, it would logically follow that an individual arrested for illegally possessing a firearm and possessing drugs with an intent to distribute would forever thereafter be subject to a weapons frisk if stopped for a minor traffic infraction, regardless of whether police had any contemporaneous evidence of ongoing involvement with illegal drugs or weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We hold further that, as appellant avers, the recent decision in <em>Herring, </em>555 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496, does not provide an alternate ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Herring, </em>a majority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Court, by a vote of five to four, intimated that appropriate application of the exclusionary rule might be more limited than previously held. <em>Herring </em>involved negligent record-keeping regarding the existence of an outstanding warrant in one jurisdiction, which led to an arrest without probable cause in another jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at---, 129 S.Ct. at 698-99, 172 L.Ed.2d at 502-03 (\u201caccept[ing] the parties\u2019 assumption that there was a Fourth Amendment violation\u201d). In holding the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied and that the fruits of the arrest were admissible, the Supreme Court relied on its 1984 decision in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), in which it first recognized a good faith exception. <em>Herring, </em>555 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 699-702, 172 L.Ed.2d at 503-07. The Court cited <em>Leon </em>as holding that \u201c[w]hen police act <em>under a warrant </em>that is invalid for lack of probable cause, the exclusionary rule does not apply if the police acted [in \u2018good faith\u2019\u2014] \u2018in objectively reasonable reliance\u2019 on the subsequently invalidated search warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 129 S.Ct. at 701, 172 L.Ed.2d at 505 (quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 922 &amp; n. 23, 104 S.Ct. at 3420 <em>&amp; </em>n. 23, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698 &amp; n. 23) (emphasis added). It noted its subsequent extension of the good faith exception to \u201cwarrantless administrative searches performed in good-faith reliance on a statute later declared unconstitutional,\u201d to a warrant that was \u201cinvalid because a judge forgot to make \u2018clerical corrections\u2019 \u201d to it, and \u201cto police who reasonably relied on mistaken information in <em>a court\u2019s database </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>an arrest warrant was outstanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-,-, 129 S.Ct. at 698, 701, 172 L.Ed.2d at 502, 505-06 (emphasis added). It concluded that an error about the existence of an outstanding warrant in <em>a police database in a different county </em>also was subject to the good faith exception. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this conclusion, the Court discussed the purpose and applicability of the exclusionary rule, holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">Our cases establish that ... suppression is not an automatic consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation. Instead, the question turns on the culpability of the police and the potential of exclusion to deter wrongful police conduct. # * * # * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">To trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\"><em>Id. </em>at---, 129 S.Ct. at 698-702, 172 L.Ed.2d at 502-07.

Krull, </em>480 U.S. 340, 107 S.Ct. 1160, 94 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987)). The Court\u2019s rulings in two other <em>cases\u2014Hensley </em>and <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009)\u2014support the conclusion that the Court did not intend in <em>Herring </em>to extend the good faith exception to admit the fruits of a warrantless frisk or search based on the searching police officer\u2019s honest but erroneous belief about what the Fourth Amendment requires to establish the necessary reasonable suspicion or probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">In <em>Hensley, </em>decided in 1985 just six months after <em>Leon, </em>police made a <em>Terry </em>stop which the Court held violated the Fourth Amendment. 469 U.S. at 229-30, 105 S.Ct. at 681, 83 L.Ed.2d at 612-13. The decision in <em>Hensley </em>specifically mentioned that good faith might insulate the arresting officers from <em>civil </em>suit, but it gave no indication whatsoever that good faith principles might apply to assessing the Fourth Amendment validity of a <em>warrantless </em>seizure for purposes of a <em>criminal </em>trial, and it ruled the failure to suppress the evidence was error. <em>Id. </em>at 232, 105 S.Ct. at 682, 83 L.Ed.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Similarly, in <em>Gant, </em>decided in April 2009 just three months after <em>Herring, </em>the Court addressed another case involving wholly warrantless Fourth Amendment activity and held the search at issue was unconstitutional. In doing so, the Court noted that because a view of the law contrary to what the Court held in <em>Gant </em>\u201chas been widely accepted, the doctrine of qualified immunity will shield officers from liability for searches conducted in reasonable reliance on that understanding.\u201d 556 U.S. at- n. 11, 129 S.Ct. at 1723 n. 11, 173 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 500 n. 11. Nevertheless, just like in <em>Hensley, </em>neither the majority nor the dissent in <em>Gant </em>made any mention of good faith principles in reference to the criminal trial suppression issue, and the majority affirmed the lower court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at---&amp; n. 11, 129 S.Ct. at 1723-24 <em>&amp; </em>n. 11, 173 L.Ed.2d at 501 &amp; n. 11; <em>see Guzman v. City of Chicago, </em>565 F.3d 393, 399 (7th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Gant </em>as authority that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Herring </em>does not mean \u201cthe exclusionary rule is necessarily on life support\u201d). In sum, the Court held implicitly that although the officers conducting the search relied in good faith on existing case law, this reliance did not excuse the Fourth Amendment violation, and application of the exclusionary rule was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">From these rulings, we conclude that, despite the breadth of some of the Court\u2019s language in <em>Herring, </em>it did not narrow the exclusionary rule beyond the bounds previously defined and that the good faith exception does not apply to a police officer\u2019s honest but erroneous legal conclusion that a particular set of facts provides him with the necessary reasonable suspicion or probable cause for a seizure or search. In deciding <em>Herring, </em>the Court merely discussed <em>the rationale </em>for the exclusionary rule to determine whether the officers\u2019 mistake about the existence of a warrant fell more appropriately under general exclusionary rule principles or, instead, under the rule\u2019s good faith exception as applied to some searches made pursuant to defective warrants. <em>See also Montejo, </em>555 U.S. at-,-, 129 S.Ct. at 2082, 2090, 173 L.Ed.2d at 960, 968 (discussing the rationale for the exclusionary rule as set out in <em>Herring </em>and concluding that it did not justify retention of \u201cthe rule ... in <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986), forbidding police to initiate interrogation of a criminal defendant once he has requested counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding\u201d because the costs of the rule outweighed its benefits in light of the related protections provided \u201c[ujnder the <em>Miranda-Edwards-Minnick </em>line of cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Further, the general exclusionary rule principles set out in <em>Herring </em>support application of the rule in this case because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the officers\u2019 error in frisking appellant did not result from \u201cisolated negligence attenuated from the arrest,\u201d i.e., faulty record-keeping in a different jurisdiction. <em>Herring, </em>555 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 698, 699, 172 L.Ed.2d at 502, 503. Instead, it was caused by conduct which occurred within a single police department and which was \u201csufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it\u201d and \u201csufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 129 S.Ct. at 702, 172 L.Ed.2d at 507; <em>see United States v.

Nevertheless, the officers on the scene relied on nonspecific information in their PISTOL database indicating that appellant was \u201cprobably armed and a narcotics seller/user.\u201d The record contains nothing showing the entry indicated the source of the information, any particular event upon which the information was based, or when any such event had occurred. Absent some contemporaneous corroboration, this information indicated, at most, that the officers should be especially cautious in their dealings with appellant; without more contextual information, no reasonable officer could have concluded under the Fourth Amendment that these facts supported a weapons frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>When we impute to Officers Hedman and Moore the information known to the data entry officers, we reach the same result. The officers who entered the data into PISTOL were not shown to have done so based on any more information than that appellant had been <em>arrested </em>for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon for an incident that had occurred eleven months earlier and possession of cocaine with an intent to distribute for an incident that had occurred six months earlier. Absent any <em>contemporaneous </em>indication that appellant possessed a weapon or drugs, this stale arrest information was similarly insufficient to permit a reasonable officer to conclude a weapons frisk was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Under either informational scenario, the conduct of the officers was \u201csufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d <em>Herring, 555 </em>U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 702, 172 L.Ed.2d at 507. To hold that an officer who receives vague information like \u201cprobably armed and a narcotics seller/user\u201d from the PISTOL system is entitled to rely unconditionally on that information to provide reasonable suspicion for a stop or frisk would encourage negligent behavior or worse on the part of those designing the database system, those entering the data, or those relying on it to provide reasonable suspicion or probable cause for police action.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court erroneously denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the fruits of a search of his person following a traffic stop of the car in which he was a passenger.

The Commonwealth contends on brief that the Court also held in <em>Johnson </em>\"there were reasonable grounds to suspect the defendant was armed and dangerous.\u201d As factual support for this conclusion, the Commonwealth notes the defendant in <em>Johnson </em>\"told police he had spent time in prison for burglary and had been out about a year, wore gang-related garb, mentioned he was from a city known to police as a home base for the Crips gang, and had a [portable police] scanner in his pocket.\u201d The United States Supreme Court set out these facts in reciting the procedural history of the case and later, in its analysis, stated that the officer \"surely was not constitutionally required to give Johnson an opportunity to depart the scene after he exited the vehicle without first ensuring that, in doing so, she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.\u201d 555 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 788, 172 L.Ed.2d at 704-05. In a footnote following that sentence, however, the Court observed (a) that the Arizona Court of Appeals had assumed without deciding the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe Johnson was armed and dangerous and (b) that the United States Supreme Court's decision in <em>Johnson </em>\"[did] not foreclose the appeals court's consideration of that issue on remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-n. 2, 129 S.Ct. at 788 n. 2, 172 L.Ed.2d at 705 n. 2. Construed together, these statements compel the conclusion that the Court did not decide whether the facts in that case provided reasonable suspicion to believe the defendant was armed and dangerous. Although holding the Constitution did not require the officer to allow Johnson \"to depart the scene without ensuring ... she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her,\u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 129 S.Ct. at 788, 172 L.Ed.2d at 704-05, the Supreme Court did not decide whether the facts established a reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe defendant Johnson was such a person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">.

In this case, the prosecutor argued in the trial court that the \"police [department]\u2019s own system\u201d was \u201cinherently [re]liable[e]\u201d and that \u201cthey should be able to rely on [it],\u201d which we hold was sufficient to place the issue of good faith before the trial court. Further, no additional factual findings are required to permit us to conclude that the exclusionary rule\u2019s good faith exception is inapplicable in this case. Thus, we conclude <em>Whitehead </em>does not prevent us from considering this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
