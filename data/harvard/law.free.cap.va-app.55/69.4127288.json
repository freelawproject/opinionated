The Commissioner alleges that the circuit court erred in determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the agency\u2019s record lacked substantial evidence to support a finding of sexual abuse. On cross-appeal, Timothy J. Fulton contends that the investigator\u2019s failure to tape record the interviews with the alleged victim is reversible error. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">On the morning of November 26, 2002, the child protective services unit of the local department received a complaint that A.J., a twelve-year-old girl, may have been sexually abused by Fulton, the father of one of A.J.\u2019s friends (\u201cH.M.\u201d), while she was in his care. In response, Shana Prohofsky, a social worker with the local department, and Detectives Ron D. Montrose and Lisa Krisik of the Virginia Beach Police Department conducted a joint investigation of the complaint against Fulton.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">After A.J. and her father filed the complaint against Fulton, A.J.\u2019s father took her to the Virginia Center for Women for a SANE examination. There, Detective Montrose and Prohofsky conducted an initial interview of A.J., which was not recorded. In that interview, A.J. told her interviewers that she had gone over to her friend H.M.\u2019s house after school and spent the night. Around 1:00 or 1:15 a.m., Fulton came into H.M.\u2019s room, where the girls were sleeping, to check on them. A.J. told Fulton that her wrist hurt, and he brought her \u201ca slippery blue clear oval-like capsule and a white circular pill, resembling a really big Tylenol.\u201d A.J., who was \u201creally sleepy\u201d both before and after taking the pills, said that H.M. was awake when she took the pills but soon fell back asleep. A.J. told her interviewers that she was soon back asleep as well. She said that she awoke awhile later when she felt something hard in her mouth. As A.J. squinted, she saw Fulton\u2019s stomach and \u201csome parts of his penis\u201d in front of her. She opened her eyes and saw Fulton standing before her with his red boxer shorts around his ankles. A.J. closed her eyes and yawned to \u201cget away.\u201d When she opened her eyes, Fulton had raised his boxer shorts and was petting one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>family\u2019s rottweilers that was lying down on H.M.\u2019s bed. H.M. was now awake and also petting the dog. Before Fulton left H.M.\u2019s room, A.J. said that she wanted to call her father, so Fulton brought her a phone. A.J. said that she told her father that she really wanted to come home, and her father said that was fine as long as Fulton agreed. Because A.J.\u2019s father was sleeping, Fulton drove A.J. home. After Fulton left, A.J. told her father what Fulton had done to her and her father called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Later that day, A.J. spoke with Prohofsky again. This time Detective Krisik joined them. A.J. told the interviewers substantially the same version of events that she previously described to her father and repeated to Prohofsky and Detective Montrose.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A. J.\u2019s father also spoke with Prohofsky and Detective Mont-rose on November 26, 2002. In that interview, he told them that after she came home from Fulton\u2019s home, A.J. came into his room and sat on the edge of his bed. He was still asleep at the time. He said that A.J., who was \u201cfidgety\u201d and \u201cnervous,\u201d began crying. She did not want to talk but then made a hand gesture to indicate what she was trying to say. A. J.\u2019s father replied, \u201cplease don\u2019t tell me he put his penis in your mouth.\u201d He said that A.J. then finally told him what happened and he decided to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Prohofsky and Detective Krisik interviewed H.M. at her school at approximately 9:45 a.m. on November 26, 2002. H.M. told her interviewers that A.J. is her best friend and that A.J. visits her home every other day. H.M. said that A.J. was at her house the night before while their fathers went out, but that A.J. had intended to return home when her father came to pick her up. During this time, H.M.\u2019s stepbrother taught the girls to box, and during that lesson, A.J. injured her wrist. H.M. said that she and A.J. fell asleep in Fulton\u2019s bedroom,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and when he returned home, he woke the girls to tell them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>go to H.M.\u2019s room. A.J. asked to go home, but she was unable to reach her father on the phone. H.M. said that her father took A.J. home. When interviewed, H.M. said that she knew A.J. was absent from school that morning but did not know why. H.M. also told the interviewers that \u201cno one has ... showed her their [sic] private parts\u201d and that \u201cshe does not know anyone who this has happened to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Carolyn Dressen, a roommate who lived with A.J. and her father, also spoke with Prohofsky and Detective Krisik. She said that she called Fulton at 7:30 a.m. to \u201cfigure out what was going on.\u201d Fulton told her he. did not know what was going on and that AJ.\u2019s father would be over shortly to pick him up for work. Dressen told Fulton what A.J. had alleged. Dressen stated that she heard Fulton tell H.M. what A.J. claimed happened and then Fulton told her that H.M. said she was awake and nothing happened. Dressen stated that neither H.M. nor A.J. had ever lied to her. She added that she believes that A.J. is generally very truthful, especially with her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">During the investigation, Prohofsky and Detective Krisik also interviewed Fulton. In his interview, Fulton told police that he had been out drinking with AJ.\u2019s father and others the night before. When he arrived home around 1:15 a.m., the girls were asleep in his room. He woke them up and told A.J. that her father was on his way to pick her up. The girls went into H.M.\u2019s room. He denied knowing that A.J. had hurt her wrist or giving her medicine. When AJ.\u2019s father never arrived, she asked Fulton to call her father. Fulton asked A. J what she wanted him to do when A.J.\u2019s father did not answer the phone. She informed him that she wanted to go home, and he took her home. Fulton said that A.J. always becomes angry when her father fails to pick her up as promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">At the conclusion of her investigation, Prohofsky determined that the complaint of sexual abuse was founded. Specifically, she found that A. J.\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">behaviors and emotions are consistent with that of a victim. Additionally, according to both [A.J.] and [H.M.], [A.J.] has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>had no other sexual contact. [A.J.] was able to describe the sexual act in detail, including sensory descriptions. [A.J.] had no motive for fabricating an allegation of sexual abuse____As a result of [A. J.] coming forward with these allegations, [A.J.] lost her best friend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Prohofsky further concluded that Fulton\u2019s memory of the night was impaired by the alcohol he consumed because he was unable to recall events that A.J. described and H.M. confirmed. Prohofsky notified Fulton by letter dated January 24, 2003 of the result of her investigation. On February 11, 2003, Fulton noted his appeal, which was stayed during the pendency of a related criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">A preliminary hearing for Fulton\u2019s criminal charge was held in Virginia Beach Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court on April 9, 2003. During that hearing, A.J. again repeated the account that she told her father and investigators. On cross-examination, A.J. said that she knew how serious it was to allege that someone committed a sexual.offense when challenged as to her past veracity. She admitted that she erroneously told neighborhood boys and a friend of hers that a neighbor had raped her mother. She stated that she did so because th\u00e1t is what her mother told her. A. J. also admitted that she thought her dad drank too much and spent too much time with Fulton, his drinking companion. A.J. said that she and H.M. never left H.M.\u2019s room after 7:00 that night.. Though other inconsistencies between A.J.\u2019s testimony and her interviews with the investigators were revealed on cross-examination, at the conclusion of the hearing, the judge certified the case to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Pursuant to Fulton\u2019s administrative appeal, a hearing was held before a hearing officer on July 9, 2003. On July 14, 2003, the hearing officer for DSS upheld the investigator\u2019s \u201cfounded level one\u201d disposition of sexual abuse. Specifically, the hearing officer noted that there were discrepancies in both Fulton\u2019s and AJ.\u2019s versions of events. That said, the officer concluded that the evidence meets the preponderance of the evidence standard because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>1. The DNA report submitted presupposes that Fulton had not previously showered. The report does not indicate that the underwear tested was the one he wore the night of the alleged abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">2. [A.J.] submitted to a full sexual assault examination and did not recant any of her statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">3. [A.J.] was consistent with the details surrounding the actual assault. She described [Fulton\u2019s] position over her, the underwear down around [Fulton\u2019s] legs, seeing mostly [Fulton\u2019s] stomach and a little of [Fulton\u2019s] penis, the smell of alcohol, and the texture of the object in her mouth. She describes [Fulton\u2019s] action afterward in petting the dog before leaving the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">4. [A.J.] told her father immediately about the experience and was observed to be emotionally distraught by [her father] and Carolyn Dressen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The hearing officer discounted the fact that H.M.\u2019s testimony did not support A.J.\u2019s recollection because \u201c[H.M.] was only interviewed after she would have had time to learn [Fulton\u2019s] version of events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">On July 21, 2003, Fulton appealed the hearing officer\u2019s determination to the Commissioner. During that hearing, both Fulton and DSS presented additional evidence and argument. In her March 4, 2004 opinion, the DSS hearing officer appointed by the Commissioner held that \u201cbased on the evidence contained in the record and presented at the hearing, the disposition of \u2018founded\u2014sexual abuse (intercourse and sodomy)\u2014level one\u2019 of [A.J.] by Timothy Fulton is sustained.\u201d To support this determination, the hearing officer found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">[o]n the night of November 25, 2002, [H.M.] invited [A.J.] to come to her house after school. Timothy Fulton left the house at about 5:30 p.m. to meet [A.J.\u2019s father] and other friends to go drinking. [Joshua] ..., [H.M.\u2019s] half-brother, age 22, and his girlfriend ... were at the Fulton home and supervised [A.J.] and [H.M.]. [H.M.] and [A.J.] made furniture for [H.M.\u2019s] dollhouse, did homework and watched television.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>[A.J.\u2019s father] was supposed to pick [A.J.] up from the Fulton house on his way home. [A.J.] routinely became upset if her father failed to pick her up after promising that he would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">At approximately 11:00, [H.M.] and [A.J.] fell asleep in Timothy Fulton\u2019s room while watching television. While out with [A.J.\u2019s father], Timothy Fulton drank at least six bottles of beer. When Timothy Fulton came home at approximately 1:00, he found the girls asleep in his room. He woke them up, and they went to [H.M.\u2019s] room, where [H.M.] lay down on her bed and [A.J.] lay down on a couch near the bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">After [H.M.] and [A.J.] went to sleep, Timothy Fulton went into [H.M.\u2019s] room, and put his penis into [A.J.\u2019s] mouth. This action awakened [A.J.], who yawned as if she were awakening. Timothy Fulton removed his penis and dressed himself. He petted one of the family\u2019s dogs which was lying on [H.M.\u2019s] bed. As he was leaving the room, [A.J.] said she wanted to go home, as it had become apparent to her that her father would not come to pick her up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">Timothy Fulton gave [A.J.] his cell phone and she called her father, however, she could not get him to answer the phone. [A.J.\u2019s father] was home but asleep and did not answer the phone. [A.J.] told Timothy Fulton that she wished to go home and he offered to drive her home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">Timothy Fulton drove [A.J.] to her house, and went inside the house to tell [A.J.\u2019s father] that his daughter was home. As soon as Timothy Fulton left, [A.J.] told her father that Timothy Fulton had put his penis in her mouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">Carolyn Dressen, a lodger in [A. J.\u2019s] house, was awakened after 2:00 a.m. by [A.J.\u2019s father], who was angry and upset. [A.J.\u2019s father] told Carolyn Dressen that Timothy Fulton put his penis in [A.J.\u2019s] mouth. Carolyn Dressen went to check on [A. J.] and found that she was visibly upset and had been crying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>[A.J.\u2019s father] drove to the Fulton home, where he awakened Joshua ... by banging on the door. Joshua told [A.J.\u2019s father] that his father; Timothy Fulton, was \u201cpassed out\u201d and could not speak to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">Early the next morning, Carolyn Dressen called Timothy Fulton on his cell phone and advised him that [A.J.] had made an allegation of \u201csomething sexual\u201d against him. Her phone call was prior to Timothy Fulton being interviewed by the police. Timothy Fulton relayed the information to his daughter, [H.M.]. Carolyn Dressen could hear [H.M.\u2019s] voice saying, \u201cNothing happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">Forensic tests did not reveal the presence of any sperm in [A.J.\u2019s] mouth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The opinion concluded that \u201c[t]he record contains a preponderance of evidence that Timothy Fulton sexually abused [A.J.], causing serious harm to her.\u201d In so finding, the DSS opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">As [the judge] noted at the preliminary hearing, the case is not without problems\u2014chiefly the lack of forensic evidence and the question of the complaining witness\u2019s credibility. The standard of proof being a preponderance of the evidence, those problems weigh less heavily on the likelihood that [Fulton] acted as [A.J.] alleged. [A.J.] was regarded by Carolyn Dressen as a truthful child. As it turns out, she did not fabricate a prior allegation of rape, she repeated something she had been told and which she believed to be true. Many adult sexual assault victims cannot recall accurately the layout of a room where the assault occurred. In the absence of a clear motive on the part of the alleged victim to invent an allegation, and taking into account her age and her relationship to ... [Fulton\u2019s] daughter, I conclude that it is more likely than not that the incident occurred as [A.J.] described, and the disposition will be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Fulton appealed the agency\u2019s decision to the circuit court. At a hearing on the matter on August 24, 2004, the trial court repeatedly asked the parties for argument on what \u201csubstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tial evidence\u201d meant. DSS asserted that under the standard of review that the circuit court must apply, the court is bound to uphold the agency\u2019s determination, no matter how uncorroborated or unsubstantiated, unless a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion. The circuit court questioned whether the record indicated that A.J. specifically said Fulton put his penis in her mouth, but DSS asserted that the \u201chearing officer necessarily [found] that\u2014one of her factual findings is that it was Fulton\u2019s penis.\u201d The circuit court indicated that it could not find evidence to support this factual finding by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In an order entered December 15, 2008, the circuit court held that \u201cthere were erroneous findings of fact and that reasonable minds, considering the actual facts, would necessarily have come to a different conclusion[.]\u201d The circuit court thus concluded that there was \u201cnot substantial evidence in the agency record to support the March 4, 2004 decision of the Commissioner,\u201d and ordered that the agency\u2019s determination be changed to \u201cunfounded\u201d and the records purged.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\"><em>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence in the Administrative Record to Support the Disposition of \u201cFounded-Sexual Abuse-Level 1 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">As outlined in Code \u00a7 63.2-1526(B), the Administrative Process Act (APA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 to 2.2-4033, governs judicial review when DSS makes a disposition of founded child abuse. <em>Jones v. West, </em>46 Va.App. 309, 322-23, 616 S.E.2d 790, 797 (2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">Accordingly, \u201cthe burden is upon the appealing party to demonstrate error.\u201d <em>Carter v. Gordon, </em>28 Va.App. 133, 141, 502 S.E.2d 697, 700-01 (1998); Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. The reviewing court will view \u201cthe facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the [agency\u2019s] action,\u201d <em>Atkinson v. Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Comm\u2019n, </em>1 Va.App. 172, 176, 336 S.E.2d 527, 530 (1985), and \u201ctake due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and special<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted,\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. Moreover, the review of an agency\u2019s factual findings \u201cis limited to determining whether substantial evidence in the agency record supports its decision,\u201d <em>Avante at Lynchburg, Inc. v. Teefey, </em>28 Va.App. 156, 160, 502 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1998), and \u201cgreat deference is to be accorded the agency decision,\u201d <em>Holtzman Oil v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 532, 539, 529 S.E.2d 333, 337 (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><em>Id. </em>.\u201c[T]he circuit court\u2019s role in an appeal from an agency decision is equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court. In this sense, the General Assembly has provided that a circuit court acts as an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>School Bd. of County of York v. Nicely, </em>12 Va.App. 1051, 1062, 408 S.E.2d 545, 551 (1991). \u201cThe reviewing court may reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988) (citations omitted). It is not the trial court\u2019s role to determine the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Here, A.J. alleged that Fulton inserted his penis into her mouth as she slept and that he removed it only when she awoke and faked a yawn. She immediately reported the incident to her father. A.J. did not have a reputation for lying. Though Fulton denied the allegations and A.J.\u2019s claim was not supported by forensic evidence, the agency acting as the fact finder determined that the claim was \u201cfounded,\u201d meaning that the agency determined that \u201ca review of the facts [showed] by a preponderance of the evidence that child abuse ... has occurred.\u201d 22 VAC 40-705-10. Based on the evidence in the record, it cannot be said that after reviewing the record as a whole a reasonable mind would inevitably or unavoidably determine that A.J.\u2019s allegations are false. Thus, the trial court erred in finding that there is not substantial evidence and we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\n<em>B. Whether the Failure to Tape Record the Interviews with the Alleged Victim is Reversible Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">On cross-appeal, Fulton contends that the DSS committed reversible error by not tape recording the interviews with the alleged victim. He concedes that this issue was not preserved at trial but \u201casserts there is good cause shown and the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18 ... applies.\u201d The Court of Appeals will not consider a claim of trial court error as a ground for reversal \u201cwhere no timely objection was made, except to attain the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 627, 636, 496 S.E.2d 120, 125 (1998) (citing Rule 5A:18). \u201cTo be timely, an objection must be made when the occasion arises-at the time the evidence is offered or the statement made.\u201d <em>Marlowe v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 619, 621, 347 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1986). Because the objection was not timely, Rule 5A:18 bars our consideration of this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Rule 5A:18 allows exceptions for \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d <em>Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 834, 531 S.E.2d 41, 44 (2000) (holding that where \u201cthe defendant had the opportunity to object but elected not to do so, his claim is not preserved\u201d), or to meet the \u201cends of justice,\u201d <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (holding that \u201c[i]n order to avail oneself of the exception, a defendant must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred\u201d). Fulton \u201casserts there is good cause shown and the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18 ... applies\u201d because he could not have made this argument at trial as the case upon which his argument is based, <em>Jones, </em>46 Va.App. 309, 616 S.E.2d 790, was decided after Fulton\u2019s case was heard. Fulton does not contend that the applicable DSS regulation was not in effect at the time his case was before the agency or on appeal to the circuit court and, indeed, <em>Jones </em>did .not change existing law; it simply interpreted an existing DSS regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 322-33, 616 S.E.2d at 797-802. Thus, the law applicable to Fulton\u2019s claim that the DSS interviews with A.J. should have been recorded did not change. Given this circumstance, we cannot find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the ends of justice or good cause exceptions to Rule 5A:18 allow our consideration of the issue on appeal. <em>See Talbert v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 239, 246, 436 S.E.2d 286, 290 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">As Fulton\u2019s question presented on cross-appeal was not properly preserved and does not warrant the application of either the \u201cends of justice\u201d or \u201cgood cause shown\u201d exception, we decline to consider it. Because the agency\u2019s record contains substantial evidence to support its finding of founded sexual abuse, we reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">.
