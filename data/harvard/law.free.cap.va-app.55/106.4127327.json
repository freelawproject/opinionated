Kilby argues that the trial court erred when it found that he had been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia that constituted felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault of the child. Kilby also argues that the trial court erred when it found that the termination of his parental rights was in the child\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we disagree with Kalby and affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We view the facts and incidents, and all reasonable inferences flowing therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>See Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1991). In May 2005, Kilby\u2019s child was placed in foster care after the Culpeper County Department of Social Services (DSS) discovered through the course of a related investigation that the child\u2019s brother had been sexually assaulting her for the past year. This abuse was so severe that the child suffered an injury to her anus, which led to long-term bowel incontinence that caused the child to regularly soil her clothing. Kilby was prosecuted for, and convicted of, a violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103, cruelty or injury to a child, based on his failure to prevent the abuse of his child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the Kilbys would not take steps to create a safe home environment for the child, DSS eventually changed the child\u2019s foster care plan goal to adoption and, consequently, petitioned for termination of Kilby\u2019s residual parental rights. Following a hearing, the trial court terminated his parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283. Along with a finding that termination was in the best interests of the child, the trial court also found that Kilby \u201chad been convicted of an offense under the laws of this Commonwealth ... that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii). Alternatively, the trial court found that Kilby\u2019s \u201cresidual parental rights regarding a sibling of the child had previously been involuntarily terminated.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(i). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">As we address the issues Kilby has raised in this case, we are mindful of our standard of review. While we review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute <em>de novo, Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003), we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings on appeal unless they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them, <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990). Recognizing that \u201cthe termination of [residual] parental rights is a grave, drastic and irreversible action,\u201d <em>Helen W. v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>12 Va.App. 877, 883, 407 S.E.2d 25, 28-29 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), we, nevertheless, presume the trial court has \u201cthoroughly weighed all the evidence [and] considered the statutory requirements,\u201d <em>Logan, </em>13 Va.App. at 128, 409 S.E.2d at 463 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, the trial court is vested with broad discretion in making decisions \u201cnecessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>9 Va.App. at 328, 387 S.E.2d at 795. Finally, we recognize that this Court\u2019s primary interest in deciding this case is this child\u2019s best interests. <em>See Toombs v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs., </em>223 Va. 225, 230, 288 S.E.2d 405, 407-08 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">B. Termination of Parental Rights Pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E), which governs the termination of the residual parental rights of parents whose children have been placed in foster care, provides several grounds for termination. In all cases, the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that the termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E). Then, the court must also find, by clear and convincing evidence, one of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">(i) the residual parental rights of the parent regarding a sibling of the child have previously been involuntarily termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>nated; (ii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of this Commonwealth ... that constitutes murder or voluntary manslaughter ... if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent ...; (iii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of this Commonwealth ... that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent ...; or (iv) the parent has subjected any child to aggravated circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">1. <em>Felony Assault</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Kilby argues that the trial court erred by determining that his parental rights should be terminated under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii) because, he contends, his conviction under Code \u00a7 40.1-103 for cruelty or injury to a child is not \u201can offense ... that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(E)(iii). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Code \u00a7 40.1-103 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person employing or having the custody of any child willfully or negligently to cause or permit the life of such child to be endangered or the health of such child to be injured, or willfully or negligently to cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that its life, health or morals may be endangered, or to cause or permit such child to be overworked, tortured, tormented, mutilated, beaten or cruelly treated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">In <em>Brown v. Spotsylvania Department of Social Services, </em>43 Va.App. 205, 597 S.E.2d 214 (2004), we had occasion to discuss whether a conviction under Code \u00a7 40.1-103 was a \u201cfelony assault\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), which sets forth circumstances in which a child welfare agency may cease making reasonable efforts to reunite a child with a parent. Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3) uses the exact same language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>as Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(E)(iii). According to Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), a child welfare agency is no longer required to reunite a child with his or her parent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlJ\">if the court finds that ... the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth ... that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B), again like Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E), defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as an injury \u201cthat involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty.\u201d However, neither Code \u00a7 16.1-281, nor Code \u00a7 16.1-283 defines the term \u201cfelony assault.\u201d Thus, we interpreted that phrase in <em>Brown, </em>43 Va.App. at 205, 597 S.E.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The appellant in <em>Brown </em>argued that Code \u00a7 40.1-103 could not be a \u201cfelony assault\u201d because it did \u201cnot contain the common law elements of assault, specifically the intent to cause bodily harm.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>43 Va.App. at 213, 597 S.E.2d at 217. We rejected that argument and, relying on settled principles of statutory interpretation, held that \u201cthe term \u2018felony assault,\u2019 as used in Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), means any felonious crime that results in serious bodily injury to a child of the parent or a child who lives with the parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that the General Assembly\u2019s \u201coverarching concern in adopting Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B) was the physical health of the child\u201d because of the emphasis the statute places on the term \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 215, 597 S.E.2d at 216-17, and that another interpretation of the phrase \u201cfelony assault\u201d would render the provision meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Turning from <em>Brawn </em>to the issue in this case, we hold that a conviction under Code \u00a7 40.1-103 is a \u201cfelony assault\u201d for the purposes of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii) as well as Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3). In reaching this decision, we are guided by the concept of <em>in pari materia. </em>The concept of <em>in pari materia </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>embodies the idea that \u201c \u2018statutes which relate to the same subject matter should be read, construed and applied together so that the legislature\u2019s intention can be gathered from the whole of the enactments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 256, 450 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1994) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>791 (6th ed. 1990)). \u201cUnder the rule of statutory construction of statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great, connected homogeneous system, or a single and complete statutory arrangement.\u201d <em>Lillard v. Fairfax County Airport Auth., </em>208 Va. 8, 13, 155 S.E.2d 338, 342 (1967). Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3) and 16.1-283(E)(iii) are part of the same statutory scheme, and were adopted to protect the physical well-being of children. Concluding that the term \u201cfelony assault\u201d includes Code \u00a7 40.1-103 in the context of Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), but not in the context of Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 283(E)(iii), when the two statutes are part of the same legislative scheme and the relevant language of the two statutes is identical, would be illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Kilby, however, maintains that he, unlike Brown, did not inflict \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d on the child. \u201cRather,\u201d he argues, \u201c[he] was convicted for acts of <em>omission, </em>i.e.....once having gained knowledge of sexual assault by his son against his [child], [he] failed to prevent further abuse.\u201d We reject this argument based on the plain language of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii). First, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii) does not predicate its application on the underlying facts of the \u201cfelony assault\u201d conviction\u2014it merely states that the parent be convicted of a \u201cfelony assault.\u201d Here, Kilby concedes that he was convicted of a violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103\u2014an offense that, according to our decision in <em>Brown, </em>meets the statutory definition of a \u201cfelony assault.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Second, Code \u00a7 16.1\u201428B(E)(iii) provides for the termination of the residual parental rights of a parent \u201cconvicted of an offense ... that constitutes felony assault <em>resulting in </em>serious bodily injury ... if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent.\u201d (Emphasis added). The statute nowhere states that the parent must injure the child through an affirmative act. The gravamen of the statutory language is the effect on the child: simply put, whether the parent\u2019s act, of either omission or commission, resulted in the child\u2019s serious bodily injury. <em>See Brown, </em>43 Va.App. at 215, 597 S.E.2d at 219 (\u201cConsistent with the purpose of the act, we believe the provision\u2019s focus on crimes that result in serious bodily injury indicates, in this particular instance, that the legislature is not concerned with the nomenclature or the elements of the crime itself, <em>but rather with the effect the crime had on the child-victim.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Thus, we conclude that the situation in this case is precisely the kind of situation Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii) is designed to address. Like Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), the focus of Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(E)(iii) is the removal of a child from an environment injurious to her physical health. Here, DSS informed Kilby that his son \u201crepeatedly sexually abused\u201d his child. However, Kilby \u201cdid not obtain the DSS recommended psychological intervention for [his] children or provide adequate supervision, which allowed the abuse to continue. [Kilby] den[ied] that the abuse occurred despite evidence confirming it.\u201d This evidence included his child\u2019s bowel incontinence, caused by an anal tear she suffered as a result of her brother sexually abusing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Three years after her removal from the Kilby household in May of 2005, the child continued to suffer from this injury. In a foster care service plan review dated June 2, 2008, DSS reported that: \u201c[The child] continues to have issues with bowel leakage as associated with sexual abuse. She wears panty liners or full napkins to avoid soiling her clothing during periods of being unable to control her bowels.\u201d Clearly, this is a \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 283(E)(iii) because it \u201cinvolves ... protracted loss or impair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ment of the function of a bodily member, [or] organ____\u201d These facts led to Kilby\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 40.1-103, and these facts militate in favor of the termination of his parental rights to the child. Accordingly, we hold that a conviction under Code \u00a7 40.1-103 is a \u201cfelony assault\u201d for the purposes of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">2. <em>Best Interests of the Child</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Kilby also argues that the trial court did not find that he was an unfit parent and that, in the absence of that finding, \u201cthe law presumes the best interest of the child will be served when in the custody of the natural parent.\u201d <em>Mason v. Moon, </em>9 Va.App. 217, 220, 385 S.E.2d 242, 244 (1989). Essentially, Kilby asserts that he was not afforded due process during the termination proceeding because the trial court did not specifically adjudicate him to be an unfit parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Our Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in <em>Knox v. Lynchburg Division of Social Services, </em>223 Va. 213, 288 S.E.2d 399 (1982). According to our Supreme Court, \u201c[o]nce the [trial] court finds [the factors listed in Code \u00a7 16.1-283] are present, it need not make a further finding of parental unfitness. In our opinion, a finding that the factors exist is tantamount to a finding of parental unfitness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 288 S.E.2d at 403. Because Kilby was, as a matter of law, adjudicated an unfit parent, he cannot now rely upon the presumption that it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to remain with him. <em>See Mason, </em>9 Va.App. at 220, 385 S.E.2d at 244 (\u201cTo overcome the strong -presumption favoring a parent, the [Department] must adduce by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) the parents are unfit____\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\">. Kilby also raises a third question on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">Whether the trial court erred in ruling/finding that the residual parental rights of Russell Kilby to a sibling of [the child] had previously been involuntarily terminated as Russell Kilby noted an appeal to the prior involuntary termination and subsequently voluntarily withdrew same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">When a trial court's judgment is made on alternative grounds, we need only consider whether any one of the alternatives is sufficient to sustain the judgment of the trial court and, if we so find, need not address the other grounds. <em>See Boone v. C. Arthur Weaver Co., </em>235 Va. 157, 161, 365 S.E.2d 764, 766 (1988). Thus, we do not address Kilby\u2019s third question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The appellee, Culpeper County Department of Social Services, also raised three additional questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">Was the trial court\u2019s failure to rule that the prior conviction of Russell Kilby was preclusive on the issues in this case an abuse of discretion, plainly wrong, or without evidence to support it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">Was the trial court\u2019s failure to rule that Russell Kilby's prior conviction constituted a determination that Russell Kilby acted with \"wanton or depraved indifference to human life\u201d an abuse of discretion, plainly wrong, or without evidence to support it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">Was the trial court\u2019s failure to find that Russell Kilby did not subject the child to \"aggravated circumstances\u201d an abuse of discretion, plainly wrong, or without evidence to support it?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Because an appellate court \u201ddecide[s] cases 'on the best and narrowest ground available,\u2019 \" <em>Luginbyhl v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 58, 64, 628 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2006) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Air Courier Conference v. Am.
