On appeal, Ray contends the trial court erroneously denied his request to call his mother as a witness. At no time, however, did Ray proffer to the trial court what, if anything, his mother might say in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">In Virginia, when \u201ctestimony is rejected before it is delivered, an appellate court has no basis for adjudication unless the record reflects a proper proffer.\u201d <em>Whittaker v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 968, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977). \u201cWhen an appellant claims a trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence, we cannot competently determine error\u2014much less reversible error\u2014without \u2018a proper showing of what that testimony would have been.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, 21, 635 S.E.2d 688, 689 (2006) (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>omitted); <em>see also Commonwealth Transp. Comm\u2019r v. Target Corp., </em>274 Va. 341, 348, 650 S.E.2d 92, 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Though sometimes thought of as a mere waiver principle, the proffer requirement serves the higher purpose of safeguarding our duty under Code \u00a7 8.01-678 to reverse only when the trial court error actually prejudiced the defense. <em>See Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 691, 698-99, 653 S.E.2d 600, 603-04 (2007). Absent a proffer showing \u201charm was done,\u201d we are \u201cforbidden to consider the question.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 73, 78-79, 60 S.E.2d 14, 16 (1950). This is because \u201ca proffer allows us to examine both the \u2018admissibility of the proposed testimony,\u2019 and whether, even if admissible, its exclusion \u2018prejudiced\u2019 the proffering party.\u201d <em>Tynes, </em>49 Va.App. at 21, 635 S.E.2d at 689-90 (quoting <em>Molina v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 338, 368, 624 S.E.2d 83, 97 (2006)). \u201cWe can perform this examination only when the proponent proffers the testimony he expected to elicit, rather than merely his theory of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cTo be sure, even when \u2018we are not totally in the dark concerning the nature of the evidence,\u2019 we still must \u2018know enough about the specifics\u2019 to be able to \u2018say with assurance\u2019 that the lower court committed prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 635 S.E.2d at 690 (citation omitted); <em>see Owens v. Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 624, 630, 136 S.E. 765, 767 (1927).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">On appeal, Ray acknowledges these principles but argues the trial court committed structural error\u2014thereby sidelining the traditional harmless error analysis and rendering inapplicable the proffer requirement. We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>distinction Ray draws but disagree it applies to this case. The harmless error doctrine recognizes the distinction between \u201ctrial error\u201d and \u201cstructural error.\u201d The former is governed by the harmless error doctrine; the latter is not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See generally Rivera v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1446, 1455, 173 L.Ed.2d 320 (2009) (holding the denial of a defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge did not qualify as \u201cstructural error\u201d requiring automatic reversal); <em>Hedgpeth v. Pulido, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 530, 532, 172 L.Ed.2d 388 (2008) <em>{per </em>curiam) (holding an erroneous jury instruction was \u201ctrial error\u201d but did not constitute a \u201cstructural defect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Structural error exists \u201conly in a \u2018very limited class of cases,\u2019 \u201d <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 8, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)), in which the error affects the very \u201cframework within which the trial proceeds\u201d in a manner that defies \u201canalysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards\u201d because it undermines the \u201centire adjudicatory framework\u201d of a criminal trial. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1432, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (holding a violation of a plea agreement not structural error). An error \u201caffecting the framework within which the trial proceeds\u201d must not be mistaken for \u201csimply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d <em>Morrisette v. Warden, </em>270 Va. 188, 192, 613 S.E.2d 551, 556 (2005) (citation omitted). Thus, structural error is reserved for the \u201climited class\u201d of errors that \u201cdefy analysis by harmless error standards,\u201d <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 7, 119 S.Ct. at 1833, like the denial of a public trial or representation by counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Emmett v. Warden, </em>269 Va. 164, 168, 609 S.E.2d 602, 605 (2005) (listing examples).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">No Virginia court has ever characterized a trial court\u2019s decision to disallow testimony of a witness as structural error. Nor do we. The \u201cgreat weight of authority\u201d holds it to be mere trial error. <em>Quarels v. Commonwealth, </em>142 S.W.3d 73, 82 (Ky.2004) (applying principle to defendant\u2019s right to testify); <em>People v. Solomon, </em>220 Mich.App. 527, 560 N.W.2d 651, 655 (1996). And understandably so\u2014for the exclusion of a witness\u2019s testimony could never defy the ordinary harmless error analysis. Proffering the expected testimony of an excluded witness requires only that the litigant disclose what he in good faith believes the witness would likely say. No defendant could reasonably expect a trial judge to make a decision to admit or exclude challenged testimony without receiving such a proffer. Nor can a defendant expect an appellate court to vacate a criminal conviction and order a new trial without knowing whether the excluded testimony was admissible, relevant, or in the least bit probative. A trial court\u2019s exclusion of a witness, even if erroneous, does not constitute structural error and thus does not suspend the longstanding requirement of a proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In short, because Ray\u2019s \u201cfailure to proffer the expected testimony is fatal to his claim on appeal,\u201d Tynes, 49 Va.App. at 21, 635 S.E.2d at 690 (quoting <em>Molina, </em>47 Va.App. at 367-68, 624 S.E.2d at 97), we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">. Just as the proffer principle applies to a trial court\u2019s order sustaining an objection to questions asked of a witness, <em>see, e.g., Tynes, </em>49 Va.App. at 21-24, 635 S.E.2d at 689-91, it likewise applies to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a witness, <em>see, e.g., Holles v. Sunrise Terrace, Inc., </em>257 Va. 131, 135, 509 S.E.2d 494, 497 (1999); <em>Ripper v. Bain, </em>253 Va. 197, 205, 482 S.E.2d 832, 837 (1997); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 226, 228-29, 228 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1976); <em>Worrells v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 270, 271-72, 183 S.E.2d 723, 724 (1971); <em>Durant v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 459, 466, 546 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2001); <em>Zelenak v.

Code \u00a7 8.01-678 makes \"harmless-error review required in <em>all </em>cases.\u201d <em>Ferguson v.

This mandatory harmless-error review necessarily requires us to determine whether the claimed error involves structural or trial error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
