ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Barbara J. Sims (wife) appeals a final decree of divorce that incorporated the property settlement agreement she entered into with Marvin Junior Sims (husband). Wife argues the trial court erred by (1) finding that the agreement was not unconscionable; (2) ratifying the agreement; (3) granting husband\u2019s motion to reconsider the ruling that the agreement was unconscionable; and (4) refusing to retain jurisdiction over property omitted from the agreement. We hold the trial court misinterpreted the controlling legal principles, and we conclude, based on the facts found by the trial court, that the agreement was unconscionable and must be set aside. Thus, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion without reaching wife\u2019s final assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting [that party] the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 834 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The parties were married in 1968 and separated on August 11, 2006. Wife consulted an attorney, who requested financial information from husband. Husband retained an attorney, who responded to wife\u2019s attorney and provided the requested financial information, including information concerning husband\u2019s deferred profit sharing and retirement benefits. Wife could not afford to retain the attorney she had consulted, and she proceeded <em>pro se </em>for several months. Wife told husband she wanted half of everything. Husband did not want to sell the marital residence at that time because he was living in the residence and raising the parties\u2019 grandson there. As a result, he offered to pay wife $2,000 per month \u201cuntil she had received half of everything that [they] owned.\u201d In late 2006 or early 2007, husband\u2019s attorney prepared a property settlement agreement and sent it to wife for her review, but wife refused to sign the agreement because it did not provide for the division of husband\u2019s retirement and deferred compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Later, however, wife told several people, including husband\u2019s attorney and the parties\u2019 son, that she did not want anything from the marriage and just wanted a divorce. After learning of this from the parties\u2019 son, husband asked his attorney to prepare such an agreement. Wife telephoned husband\u2019s attorney on numerous occasions to say she \u201cjust want[ed] a divorce\u201d and to inquire \u201chow fast [she could] get one.\u201d In March 2007, husband\u2019s attorney prepared a second property settlement agreement and sent it to wife for her review. On March 12, 2007, wife went to the attorney\u2019s office to sign the second agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Under the terms of the agreement, each party waived the right to spousal support and equitable distribution. Husband received the marital residence, which he valued at $300,000 at the time of the parties\u2019 separation, and assumed the related debt of approximately $100,000. Each party received the automobile and other tangible personal property in his or her possession. The agreement did not mention husband\u2019s deferred profit-sharing account, valued at approximately $128,000 at the time of the separation, and retirement benefits, from which he received approximately $2,400 per month after withholding for taxes and insurance. Pursuant to the agreement, wife received only the 1999 pickup truck and \u201cyard sale\u201d personal property in her possession, and husband agreed to hold her harmless on the debt secured by the marital residence. On April 11, 2007, wife returned to the office of husband\u2019s attorney and signed a waiver of service.\" Thereafter, husband\u2019s attorney proceeded to finalize the divorce and sent the necessary paperwork to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Meanwhile, wife retained counsel, and on May 9, 2007, wife filed an answer and cross-bill, alleging the agreement was unconscionable. On April 17, 2008, the trial court held a hearing on the unconseionability issue. Wife offered evidence that she was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d due to numerous health conditions but that she did not receive disability. She said she applied for Medicaid but did not qualify because her name was on the title for a relatively new vehicle that husband had in his possession and she \u201ccouldn\u2019t get it out of [her] name to get the Medicaid back.\u201d She was receiving food stamps and borrowing money from family and friends \u201cto try to get by.\u201d Regarding her disabilities, wife testified she suffered from depression, high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes and that she had had a foot fusion and dual hip, knee, and knuckle replacements. She said she took medication for her depression, insulin for her diabetes, and used morphine and Percocet for pain. Wife testified she had been using these medications for twenty years, including \u201cat the time she signed th[e] agreement.\u201d She had health insurance at the time because she was still covered on husband\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Wife denied reading the agreement before signing it and said she did not understand its legal impact other than that \u201cit would let [her] get a divorce.\u201d She admitted, however, that she refused to sign the initial agreement because it did not provide her with a share of husband\u2019s retirement and deferred compensation benefits and that by the time she signed the second agreement, she understood the \u201c[h]ouse and car and truck and retirement and profit sharing\u201d were the assets comprising the marital estate. She conceded she probably received a copy of the agreement in advance and that she just wanted a divorce. She admitted she had a \u201cseasonal business\u201d picking boxwood and running pine for a florist in exchange for \u201ca little spending money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Wife offered testimony from her twin sister corroborating her testimony about her \u201csevere\u201d medical conditions and the fact that she routinely took morphine. Wife\u2019s sister also testified that wife \u201cdoes [not] read ... well,\u201d \u201cdoesn\u2019t comprehend hardly at all,\u201d \u201cdoes [not] ... exercise good judgment,\u201d and \u201cis not always thinking clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Husband admitted wife had mood swings, which he did not attribute to her medical conditions, and he conceded she had told him she took medication for pain and depression. He said he first learned that wife did not want anything from the marital estate when the parties\u2019 son called him and told him about wife\u2019s statements to that effect. Husband admitted he felt lucky when he learned wife did not want anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The parties\u2019 son conceded wife had \u201cfrequentf ]\u201d mood swings and that her decision to relinquish one hundred percent of the marital estate to husband was \u201cnot a good judgment.\u201d The son also said mother\u2019s medical conditions were \u201c[a]s severe as she would like for them to be.\u201d When asked to explain, he indicated that as he was growing up, his mother\u2019s medical conditions did not seem to prevent her from doing what she wanted to do but that she always seemed to be \u201churting, aching,\u201d \u201cif she didn\u2019t want to clean the house or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Husband offered evidence from his attorney indicating that wife conveyed her understanding of the first agreement when she refused to sign it because it did not address husband\u2019s pension and profit sharing. The attorney also indicated he first learned wife had changed her mind about the property division when she contacted him directly, indicating that she wanted a divorce quickly and \u201c[didn\u2019t] want anything from [husband].\u201d The secretary in husband\u2019s attorney\u2019s office who notarized wife\u2019s signature on the second agreement testified that she took wife to the law firm\u2019s conference room, gave her the document and asked her read it, after which wife appeared to be doing so. When wife said she was finished reading it, the secretary inquired whether wife had any questions. She also inquired whether wife understood everything, and wife indicated that she did. The secretary testified wife did not appear to be mentally impaired at any point during the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">After hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, the trial court found the agreement was unconscionable \u201c[o]n the basis of <em>O\u2019Bryan [v. O\u2019Bryan, </em>No. 1912-91-4, 1992 WL 441907 (Va.Ct.App. July 28, 1992)],\u201d which the court relied on as providing that a gross disparity in the division of marital assets, standing alone, \u201cif ... great [enough],\u201d is sufficient to support a ruling that an agreement is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Husband filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court granted. The trial court found that \u201cwhile hardly an exaggeration to say that this is about as grossly disparate a deal as probably anybody has ever seen, it\u2019s not entirely true that [wife] didn\u2019t get some value out of it. She got held harmless on loans and mortgages and things like that.\u201d The trial court concluded under <em>Galloway v. Galloway, </em>47 Va.App. 83, 622 S.E.2d 267 (2005), that the agreement was valid and not unconscionable because wife proved only a gross disparity in the value of the division and failed, based on the testimony of husband\u2019s former attorney and the attorney\u2019s secretary, to meet her burden of proving husband engaged in overreaching and oppressive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Wife filed a motion asking the court to retain jurisdiction to divide omitted property, arguing that husband omitted property, including retirement benefits and other assets, from the agreement. Husband sought entry of a final decree incorporating the agreement. On December 5, 2008, the trial court entered the final decree incorporating the agreement and denied wife\u2019s motion to retain jurisdiction. Wife noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">UNCONSCIONABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In her first three assignments of error, wife argues the trial court erred in granting husband\u2019s motion for reconsideration, concluding that the agreement was not unconscionable, and incorporating the agreement into the final decree. We agree and hold the agreement was unconscionable on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u201cAny issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a matter of law. Recitations in the agreement shall create a prima facie presumption that they are factually correct.\u201d Code \u00a7 20\u2014151(B); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-155 (providing that Code \u00a7 20-151 applies to marital agreements as well as premarital agreements).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">While the question of unconscionability is a matter of law, the underlying facts must be determined by the fact finder, and on appeal we determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the factual findings. If there is credible evidence in the record supporting the factual findings made by the trier of fact, we are bound by those findings regardless of whether there is evidence that may support a contrary finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\"><em>Galloway, </em>47 Va.App. at 92, 622 S.E.2d at 271.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">[W]hen \u201cfaced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences\u201d a court reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cmust <em>presume\u2014even if it does not affirmatively appear in the </em>record\u2014that the trier of fact resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>any such conflicts in favor of the [party that prevailed below], and must defer to that resolution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><em>Harper v.

Drewry, </em>8 Va.App. 460, 463, 383 S.E.2d 12, 12 (1989). In a typical case alleging unconscionability of a marital agreement, the court must consider (1) whether \u201ca gross disparity existed in the division of assets and [(2)] [whether the evidence shows] overreaching or oppressive influences.\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>47 Va.App. at 92, 622 S.E.2d at 271; <em>see also Shenk v. Shenk, </em>39 Va.App. 161, 179 n. 13, 571 S.E.2d 896, 905 n. 13 (2002). \u201c[G]ross disparity in the value exchanged is a <em>significant </em>factor in determining whether oppressive influences affected the agreement to the extent that the process was unfair and the terms of the resultant agreement unconscionable.\u201d <em>Derby v. Derby, </em>8 Va.App. 19, 28, 378 S.E.2d 74, 79 (1989) (emphasis added), <em>quoted with approval in Chaplain v. Chaplain, </em>54 Va.App. 762, 773, 682 S.E.2d 108, 113 (2009). Proof of the \u201coverreaching or oppressive influences\u201d prong may be established in either of two ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cWhen the accompanying incidents are inequitable and show [(a)] bad faith, such as concealments, misrepresentations, undue advantage, [or] oppression <em>on the part of the one who obtains the benefit, or </em>[(b)] ignorance, weakness of mind, sickness, old age, incapacity, pecuniary necessities, and the like, <em>on the part of the other, </em>these circumstances, combined with [evidence of the first prong,] inadequacy of price, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>easily induce a court to grant relief, defensive or affirmative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><em>Derby, </em>8 Va.App. at 28-29, 378 S.E.2d at 79 (quoting Pomeroy, <em>Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 928 (5th ed. 1941)) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Wife argues first that, in keeping with the trial court\u2019s initial ruling, a gross disparity in the outcome is sufficient, standing alone, to prove that the agreement here was unconscionable and that proof of oppressive influence is not required in all cases. We need not decide whether or under what circumstances gross disparity may be enough because we hold as a matter of law under the facts of this case that gross disparity <em>in conjunction with </em>pecuniary necessity on the part of the disadvantaged spouse establishes unconscionability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In the case of a marital agreement, \u201c[w]hile no fiduciary duty exists between the parties, marriage and divorce creates a relationship which is particularly susceptible to overreaching and oppression,\u201d and we have noted several reasons why courts should scrutinize separation agreements more carefully than ordinary contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 378 S.E.2d at 79. Among those reasons are the fact that \u201cthe relationship between husband and wife is not the usual relationship that exists between parties to ordinary commercial contracts\u201d and that \u201c[particularly when the negotiation is between the parties rather than between their lawyers, the relationship creates a situation ripe for subtle overreaching....\u201d <em>Id </em>We also recognized that in cases involving separation agreements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201cunlike commercial contracts, the state itself has an interest in the terms and enforceability of [the] agreement ]\u201d because, \u201c[i]f either spouse is left in necessitous circumstances by a separation agreement, that spouse ... might become [a] public charge[ ].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The holding in <em>Galloway </em>is illustrative. <em>Galloway </em>involved the husband\u2019s receipt of what we concluded was approximately 94% of the marital assets<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, which we merely assumed established the first prong of the unconscionability test. 47 Va.App. at 92-93, 622 S.E.2d at 272. The wife pointed to her waiver of spousal support as an additional circumstance supporting a finding of unconscionability, but we noted the wife was employed throughout the marriage, which lasted seventeen years, and testified \u201cshe could easily obtain a job as a secretary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 88, 93-94, 622 S.E.2d at 268, 269, 272. Also, the wife had been employed as a nurse\u2019s aide for twenty years and then with husband in his heating and air conditioning business for eleven years, during which time she worked as an installer. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 622 S.E.2d at 268. The trial court found no evidence that the wife \u201csuffered from any disability or necessity,\u201d and we concluded the evidence proved she was \u201cnot penniless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 94, 622 S.E.2d at 270, 272. In addition to the fact that the wife retained her pension from working for twenty years as a nurse\u2019s aide, approximately half of which was marital but apparently was not included in the separation agreement, the evidence established \u201c[the wife] had inherited $30,000 cash and a home with no debt valued at $275,000.\u201d On these facts, we held \u201c[n]othing in the record suggests [the wife] is incapable of enjoying financial independence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 622 S.E.2d at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Here, by contrast, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to husband, establishes as a matter of law both \u201c \u2018inadequacy of price or inequality in value\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018pecuniary necessities\u2019 \u201d coupled with a degree of infirmity. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 622 S.E.2d at 270-71 (quoting <em>Derby, </em>8 Va.App. at 29, 378 S.E.2d at 79). Proof of \u201c \u2018pecuniary necessities\u2019 \u201d and infirmity satisfies the second prong of the unconscionability test without the need for separate proof of overtly \u201c \u2018oppressive influences\u2019 \u201d exerted by husband or on his behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 622 S.E.2d at 271 (quoting <em>Derby, </em>8 Va.App. at 29, 378 S.E.2d at 79 (quoting Pomeroy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 928)). It is undisputed that wife, who had a third grade education and numerous health problems including diabetes, \u201cfrequent[]\u201d mood swings, and rheumatoid arthritis for which she took pain medication,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was fifty-six years old at the time of the evidentiary hearing and had qualified to receive food stamps. Wife had married husband when she was sixteen and remained married to him for 38 years, during which time husband said her lack of education was a problem \u201cto deal with\u201d and interfered with his ability to teach her how to do things like \u201cpay bills and stuff of this nature.\u201d Although wife had engaged in some employment outside the home during the marriage, wife testified she was totally disabled at the time of the evidentiary hearing due to her physical condition. Husband made no claim that wife was capable of supporting herself at the time of the divorce, and the evidence indicated her only recent employment had involved picking boxwood and pine for a florist during the winter months. Husband received all the marital assets with the exception of an automobile and the small amount of personal property in wife\u2019s possession, which husband testified consisted of \u201csome of the stuff she had purchased over the years at yard sales.\u201d The parties\u2019 son agreed that, given wife\u2019s circumstances, her \u201crelinquishing] 100 percent of the marital property\u201d to husband was \u201cnot a good judgment.\u201d The trial court expressly found that \u201cthis is about as grossly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>disparate a deal as probably anybody has ever seen\u201d and that the only value wife received was husband\u2019s agreement to hold her harmless on the debts secured by the marital residence, in which husband received the remaining estimated $200,000 of equity. Husband also received his deferred compensation account valued at $128,000 and his retirement benefits, which yielded $2,400 per month after withholding for taxes and insurance. The trial court further recognized the extreme disparity in this division and wife\u2019s resulting pecuniary need, concluding erroneously that although it \u201cha[d] to ... deci[de]\u201d that wife had not met the controlling legal standard, it found the agreement was \u201c[unjfair,\u201d and it \u201cstrongly urge[d]\u201d husband to do \u201cthe right thing\u201d \u201cmorally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Although the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that husband did not engage in any <em>overt </em>overreaching or oppressive conduct, his act of entering into a contract with wife in which she waived spousal support and relinquished to him almost 100% of the marital estate\u2014including the marital residence, all retirement benefits and deferred compensation\u2014literally left her penniless with no practical means for supporting herself. These facts stand in marked contrast to those in <em>Galloway, </em>in which the wife had been employed outside the home throughout the couple\u2019s 17-year marriage, and had numerous job skills, a $275,000 home she inherited, and assets of her own. 47 Va.App. at 89, 622 S.E.2d at 270. On those facts, the trial court held in <em>Galloway \u201c </em>\u2018[t]here [was] no evidence ... that wife suffered from any disability or necessity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.; see also Derby, </em>8 Va.App. at 29, 378 S.E.2d at 79 (recognizing that in cases involving separation agreements, \u201cunlike commercial contracts, the state itself has an interest in the terms and enforceability of [the] agreement[ ]\u201d because, \u201c[i]f either spouse is left in necessitous circumstances by a separation agreement, that spouse ... might become [a] public charge[ ]\u201d). Here, the evidence established that wife had in fact already become a public charge, receiving food stamps, despite husband\u2019s retention of substantial marital assets. Thus, the evidence established not only a gross disparity in the division of assets but also infirmity and pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>necessities which, in combination, established uneonscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">For these reasons, we hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to husband, compels the conclusion that the agreement was unconscionable and must be set aside. Thus, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion without reaching wife\u2019s final assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\">. In <em>Derby, </em>8 Va.App. at 28, 378 S.E.2d at 79, we cited <em>Smyth Bros. v. Beresford, </em>128 Va. 137, 169-70, 104 S.E. 371, 381-82 (1920), for the proposition that, \"If inadequacy of price or inequality of value are the only indicia of unconscionability, the case must be extreme to justify equitable relief,\u201d thereby implying that, on appropriate facts, gross disparity in the value exchanged may be sufficient by itself to establish unconscionability. In <em>Galloway, </em>47 Va.App. at 90-91, 622 S.E.2d at 270-71, we quoted this language from <em>Derby </em>but also rejected the claim of Mrs. Galloway \"that 'gross disparity,\u2019 with nothing more, should render the agreement void as being unconscionable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 92, 622 S.E.2d at 271. We think a proper synthesis of these principles, in light of our holdings in <em>Shenk, Galloway, </em>and <em>Chaplain, </em>is that when gross disparity is so extreme as to prove \"pecuniary necessities,\u201d it establishes both prongs of the unconscionability test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-5\">. The opinion does not make clear how this 94% figure was calculated.
