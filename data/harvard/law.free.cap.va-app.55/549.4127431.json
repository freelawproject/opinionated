On appeal, Lawson argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of cocaine discovered in his vehicle because the officer who stopped and detained him violated his Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we affirm Lawson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress based on the alleged violation of an individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Ward v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 211, 218, 639 S.E.2d 269, 271 (2007) (citation omitted). Investigator Tennis with the Norfolk Police Department received information from a confidential informant that Lawson was selling cocaine from his apartment located at 1223 Strand Street in the City of Norfolk. Pursuant to this information, Tennis conducted a two-week long surveillance of Lawson. On two occasions during that period, Tennis saw Lawson leave his apartment in his vehicle, a Jeep Grand Cherokee, travel to the \u201cHugo Street area park,\u201d and engage in what Tennis believed were \u201chand-to-hand\u201d drug transactions from his vehicle. One such transaction occurred within twenty-four hours of Lawson\u2019s subsequent subject detention by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Within the same two-week period, Investigator Tennis also saw several individuals on different occasions park their vehicles in the driveway of Lawson\u2019s apartment, enter the apartment, stay for approximately five minutes, and then exit the apartment. Tennis opined that this activity was consistent with the illicit sale of narcotics. Tennis further observed the confidential informant enter and exit Lawson\u2019s apartment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the same manner during the course of the confidential informant\u2019s \u201ccontrolled purchase\u201d of cocaine from Lawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Based on this information, which Investigator Tennis submitted to a magistrate in an affidavit, a search warrant was issued for Lawson\u2019s apartment. While Tennis was obtaining the search warrant, other officers, including Investigators Price and Lee, maintained Lawson\u2019s apartment under surveillance. Before Tennis returned with the warrant, Price saw Lawson leave his apartment and drive away in his Jeep. Price relayed this information to Lee, who stopped Lawson in his vehicle six to seven blocks from his apartment. Lawson consented for Lee to search Lawson\u2019s person, but no contraband was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Pursuant to instructions from Investigator Tennis, Investigator Lee detained Lawson for twenty to twenty-five minutes while waiting for a narcotics canine unit to arrive in order for Lawson\u2019s vehicle to be scanned by a trained narcotics detection dog. Investigator Decker, who handled the narcotics dog, testified that the dog alerted on the exterior of the partially opened driver\u2019s door of Lawson\u2019s Jeep. Once inside the vehicle, the dog alerted on the back of the driver\u2019s seat. Upon searching that area of the vehicle, Decker recovered a small quantity of cocaine. While Lawson was being detained, Investigator Tennis and other officers executed the search warrant on Lawson\u2019s apartment and discovered additional contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In a pretrial motion, Lawson moved to suppress the cocaine recovered from his vehicle. Relying on <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981), Lawson argued that the encounter violated his Fourth Amendment rights because he had left his apartment before the search warrant was executed, and thus the warrant did not give the police the authority to stop and detain him six blocks from his apartment at the time of the warrant\u2019s execution. The trial court denied the motion upon principles established in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny governing the police\u2019s authority to effect an investigatory traffic stop. The court found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>police had reasonable suspicion, based on the information in the affidavit supporting the search warrant, to believe that Lawson was \u201cin possession of narcotics and engaged in distribution of that substance\u201d at the time of the stop. Thus, the court concluded, the stop and detention of Lawson, and the search of his vehicle, did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Lawson was subsequently convicted, in a bench trial, of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute. In this appeal, he challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling on his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">When this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201c \u2018the burden is upon the [defendant] to show that the ruling ... constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). Where a Fourth Amendment challenge is at issue, \u201c \u2018ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause\u2019 \u201d as here presented \u201cinvolve questions of both law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). Thus, \u201cwe give deference to the factual findings of the trial court but independently decide whether, under the applicable law, the manner in which the challenged evidence was obtained satisfies constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 672, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">In stopping Lawson\u2019s vehicle and detaining him, Investigator Lee effected a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>See Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); <em>Jackson, </em>267 Va. at 672, 594 S.E.2d at 598; <em>Shiflett v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 141, 146, 622 S.E.2d 758, 760 (2005). To justify such action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>commonly referred to as a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop,\u201d \u201ca police officer must have a \u2018reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity \u201cmay be afoot.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)); <em>see Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884 (articulating standard); <em>see also United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (\u201c \u2018An investigatory stop must be justified by some objective manifestation that the person stopped is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981))). \u201c \u2018Actual proof that criminal activity is afoot is not necessary.\u2019\u201d <em>Shiflett, </em>47 Va.App. at 146, 622 S.E.2d at 760 (quoting <em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 440, 444, 425 S.E.2d 77, 79 (1992)). A reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop is \u201csomething more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 of criminal activity,\u201d but \u201csomething less than probable cause.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>267 Va. at 673, 594 S.E.2d at 598 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883) (some internal quotation marks and other citations omitted). If a police officer is so justified in stopping a suspect, \u201cthe officer may detain the suspect to conduct a brief investigation without violating the person\u2019s Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>25 VaApp. at 202, 487 S.E.2d at 263. In determining whether such justification for an investigatory stop has been established, \u201cthe courts must consider the totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture.\u201d <em>Shiflett, </em>47 Va.App. at 146, 622 S.E.2d at 761 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Given the information Investigator Tennis collected during his two-week surveillance of Lawson, we agree with the trial court that the police were justified in stopping Lawson\u2019s vehicle and detaining him, while awaiting the canine unit\u2019s arrival and investigation of the vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tennis\u2019 recent obser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>vations of Lawson leaving his apartment in his Jeep and apparently conducting drug transactions from his Jeep in a nearby park on multiple occasions, along with Tennis\u2019 information indicating that Lawson was also selling' cocaine from his apartment, clearly established reasonable articulable suspicion (if not probable cause) that Lawson was, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity. That is to say, under our objective standard of review of this investigatory traffic stop, we conclude that \u201cthe facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure ... \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate[.]\u201d <em>Iglesias v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 93, 102, 372 S.E.2d 170, 175 (1988) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Because the police had reasonable articulable suspicion to justify stopping and detaining Lawson, the constitutional principles Lawson relies upon regarding the police\u2019s limited authority to detain persons occupying the premises on which a search warrant for contraband is about to be executed, as the United States Supreme Court addressed in <em>Summers, </em>are not controlling. The <em>Summers </em>Court held that under such circumstances officers may \u201cdetain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\u201d <em>Summers, </em>452 U.S. at 705, 101 S.Ct. at 2595. The Court identified three governmental interests justifying the detention: (a) \u201cpreventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found\u201d; (b) \u201cminimizing the risk of harm to the officers\u201d; and (c) \u201corderly completion of the search, [which] may be facilitated if the occupants or the premises are present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702-03, 101 S.Ct. at 2594.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Thus, in <em>Whitaker v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 21, 31-35, 553 S.E.2d 539, 544-45 (2001), cited by Lawson, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>held that the rationale in <em>Summers </em>did not justify defendant\u2019s seizure, where the defendant left the targeted residence with no knowledge of the impending execution of a warrant to search the premises and was then stopped and detained by the police a mile and a half away only because the warrant was about to be executed. We made clear in <em>Whitaker, </em>however, that the <em>Summers </em>and <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d doctrines were not to be conflated. Citing <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 53, 354 S.E.2d 79 (1987), we explained that even if a person left the targeted premises before the execution of a search warrant, that person, of course, could still be lawfully stopped and detained under <em>Terry </em>if the police possessed reasonable suspicion that he was, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity. <em>Whitaker, </em>37 Va.App. at 34, 553 S.E.2d at 545. This distinction in the respective <em>Summers </em>and <em>Terry </em>stop doctrines is also recognized in cases from other jurisdictions cited by Lawson, which further negate his reliance on <em>Summers. See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, </em>103 F.3d 90, 93-94 (10th Cir.1996) (defendant\u2019s initial detention constituted a valid <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d even though it was not justified under <em>Summers); United States v. Taylor, </em>716 F.2d 701, 706-08 (9th Cir.1983) (same); <em>State v. Mallard, </em>246 Ga.App. 357, 541 S.E.2d 46, 50-53 (2000) (addressing distinction between <em>Summers </em>and <em>Terry </em>doctrines); <em>Commonwealth v. Graziano-Constantino, </em>553 Pa. 150, 718 A.2d 746, 747-48 (1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Lawson next argues that, \u201c[e]ven if the initial stop was somehow justified, there was no reasonable basis for [his] further detention following the initial questioning and search of his person.\u201d His detention \u201cin the back of a police vehicle for upwards of an hour,\u201d he contends, \u201cwas nothing more than the police waiting for further developments from the search of the apartment, which cannot be justified under either <em>Terry </em>or <em>Summers.\u201d </em>Because he was unreasonably detained, Lawson concludes, the search of his vehicle was still a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. We disagree with Lawson\u2019s as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>sessment of both the facts and the law governing the circumstances of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">First, the evidence establishes that, following the search of his person, Lawson was justifiably detained by the police for the purpose of awaiting the arrival of the canine unit to investigate the police\u2019s reasonable suspicion that illegal narcotics were located in his vehicle. We reach that conclusion based on \u201c \u2018an objective assessment of the officer[s\u2019] actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting [them] at the time,\u2019 and not on the officer[s\u2019] actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 2783, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 138, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1722, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Second, the evidence shows that Lawson was only required to wait twenty to twenty-five minutes for the canine unit\u2019s arrival. Our assessment of this aspect of Lawson\u2019s detention is to be governed by \u201ccommon sense and ordinary human experience,\u201d as the Supreme Court has refused to adopt a \u201chard-and-fast time limit for a permissible <em>Terry </em>stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 685-86, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985). Thus, in assessing whether Lawson\u2019s detention was \u201ctoo long in duration to be considered an investigatory stop,\u201d we are to \u201cexamine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 105 S.Ct. at 1575. As we have previously recognized, \u201cclear[ly] ... there will be inevitable delay in obtaining a [narcotics detection] dog\u201d to assist in performing an investigation at the scene of a traffic stop. <em>Limonja v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 532, 543, 383 S.E.2d 476, 483 (1989) <em>(en </em>banc). In <em>Limonja, </em>we held that the detention of the defendants for twenty-two minutes while waiting for a narcotics detection dog to arrive at the scene of an investigatory traffic stop did not exceed the bounds of a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>Id. </em>at 541-43, 383 S.E.2d at 481-83. In doing so, we noted that other courts had upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>detentions as long as seventy-five minutes in similar circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 543, 383 S.E.2d at 483. We likewise conclude here that the police diligently pursued their investigation of Lawson\u2019s vehicle for narcotics by dispatching the canine unit to the scene within twenty to twenty-five minutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Finally, the fact that Lawson was placed in the back seat of a police vehicle while awaiting the arrival of the canine unit did not take his detention beyond the scope of a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\"><em>Terry </em>stops are not [characterized] ... by the absence of any restriction upon the suspect\u2019s liberty. Indeed, a brief but complete restriction of a suspect\u2019s liberty is valid under <em>Terry, </em>and the police are permitted to use methods of restraint that are reasonable under the circumstances. Drawing weapons, handcuffing a suspect, placing a suspect in a patrol ear for questioning, or using or threatening to use force does not necessarily elevate a lawful stop into a custodial arrest for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. Rather, <em>Terry </em>stops differ from custodial interrogation in that they must last no longer than necessary to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 554, 566, 500 S.E.2d 257, 263 (1998) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Once again, the officers detained Lawson only so long as was reasonably necessary to procure a narcotics detection dog to scan his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">In sum, the police lawfully stopped Lawson based on reasonable articulable suspicion that he was, or was about to be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>engaged in criminal activity, and then detained him only so long as was reasonably necessary to confirm or dispel that suspicion. The trial court thus did not err in denying Lawson\u2019s suppression motion.
