About a year later, she sustained an injury at work that aggravated her preexisting condition. Without differentiating her preexisting condition from the aggravation, the claimant\u2019s treating physician gave her a 37% lower left extremity impairment rating. The Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarded permanent partial loss benefits solely on the basis of this opinion. We reverse and remand for further factfinding by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">On appeal, we view the \u201cevidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence\u201d in the light most favorable to the party prevailing before the commission. <em>Ar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>tis v. Ottenberg\u2019s Bakers, Inc., </em>45 Va.App. 72, 83, 608 S.E.2d 512, 517 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Charles Ubelhart, performed a total knee replacement on the claimant\u2019s left knee in 2005. The claimant has never asserted the knee replacement was in any way caused by a work-related condition. In August 2006, the claimant fell at work injuring her recently reconstructed knee. In April 2008, Dr. Ubelhart wrote a letter to the claimant\u2019s counsel stating the claimant\u2019s work-related accident resulted in \u201cmultiple contusions and impact upon her total knee replacement.\u201d After Dr. Ubelhart surgically repaired the damage caused by the fall, Martin-Elberhi eventually was \u201cable to acquire comfortable range of motion\u201d for the knee replacement. Dr. Ubelhart worried about the \u201cpossibility in the future that the patella prosthesis could deteriorate\u201d but concluded, \u201cRight now, all seems to be progressing very well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In the penultimate paragraph of his letter, Dr. Ubelhart advised the claimant\u2019s counsel: \u201cI would rate her disability at this point in time as 37% impairment of the lower extremity which extrapolates to 15% impairment of the whole person.\u201d Relying solely on Dr. Ubelhart\u2019s letter, the commission awarded the claimant permanent partial loss benefits based on a 37% impairment rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The employer argues on appeal that the commission erred as a matter of law because neither the treating physician nor the commission distinguished between the impairment rating attributable to the claimant\u2019s 2005 total knee replacement (a preexisting condition unrelated to the claimant\u2019s work) and the rating attributable to her 2006 aggravation injury (a compensable loss related to her work). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Under settled principles, an employee can recover a permanent partial loss award under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 only for an impairment caused by a work-related accident. When a work-related accident aggravates a preexisting condition, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>employee can recover for the degree of impairment caused by the aggravation but not for any preexisting impairment unrelated to the work-related accident. By statute, \u201cif an employee has a permanent disability\u201d prior to the work-related accident, he is \u201centitled to compensation <em>only for the degree of incapacity </em>which would have resulted from the later accident if the earlier disability or injury <em>had not existed.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-505(A) (emphasis added). Any other conclusion would render the employer hable for a preexisting impairment that arose \u201cin some other employment or in a non-occupational accident.\u201d <em>Noblin v. Randolph Corp., </em>180 Va. 345, 362, 23 S.E.2d 209, 216 (1942) (applying the statutory predecessor to Code \u00a7 65.2-505(A)). The General Assembly \u201cintended to hold the employer hable only for the amount of injury sustained by the employee in the conduct of his particular business.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">So what is true in Virginia law generally<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is equally true in workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>See Va. Fibre Corp. v. Moore, </em>17 Va.App. 691, 693, 440 S.E.2d 432, 434 (1994) (recognizing that Code \u00a7 65.2-505 excludes employer\u2019s liability for \u201cpre-existing injuries that place the employee\u2019s disability at or above a defined level of compensability\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>249 Va. 1, 452 S.E.2d 360 (1995); <em>Mellon v. Tredegar Corp., </em>VWC File No. 203-11-25 (Apr. 26, 2004) (holding an employer is not responsible for a \u201cpermanent impairment\u201d associated with a preexisting condition). This venerable principle recognizes the claimant, not the employer, alone bears the burden of proving causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In this case, the commission awarded the claimant a 37% lower extremity impairment rating without addressing whether it applied to the work-related aggravation injury (which the parties conceded was compensable) or the preexisting condition (which the parties conceded was noncompensable). By failing to distinguish between the two, the commission made no holding on \u201cthe degree of incapacity which would have resulted from the later accident if the earlier disability or injury had not existed.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-505(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The claimant argues our reasoning relies on a cramped reading of the commission opinion. Implicit in the opinion, she argues, is the conclusion that her aggravation injury <em>wholly </em>caused her present impairment rating. If that were true, however, it would necessarily follow that the commission also implicitly concluded her total knee replacement caused no impairment whatsoever. That implied finding, if we assume it had been made, would inexplicably contradict the commission\u2019s longstanding practice of accepting the American Medical Association\u2019s impairment guidelines which call for a 37% lower extremity impairment rating attributable <em>solely </em>to a successful total knee replacement. <em>See Va. Natural Gas, Inc. v. Tennessee, </em>50 Va.App. 270, 281, 649 S.E.2d 206, 212 (2007) (affirming commission\u2019s application of a 37% rating for a total knee replacement);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Martin v. Findlay Industries, Inc., </em>VWC File No. 212-94-00 (2009) (applying 37% rating to a total knee replacement); <em>Nichols v. City of Norfolk Health, </em>VWC File No. 206-24-72, 2007 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 214, at **3-4 (2007) (same); <em>Perkins v. Paramont Coal Comp., </em>VWC File No. 187-95-91, 2005 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 969, at *4 (2005) (same). We think it inadvisable to impute to the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>an implied finding so wholly out of sync with its established jurisprudence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We thus reverse the commission\u2019s ruling and remand for further factfinding consistent with this opinion. In cases where, as here, the commission\u2019s express ruling on a dispositive point is too \u201cunclear\u201d for us to fairly infer an implied holding, we prefer to restate the governing legal principles and to permit the commission on remand to address the case anew. <em>Bergmann v. L &amp; W Drywall, </em>222 Va. 30, 32, 278 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1981). That is particularly true when we conclude the commission applied \u201can incorrect legal standard\u201d and \u201ctruncated the factfinding task necessary under the correct legal standard.\u201d <em>Dowden v. Hercules, Inc., </em>51 Va.App. 185, 197, 655 S.E.2d 755, 761 (2008) <em>(en </em>banc) (plurality opinion). In its discretion, the commission may provide the parties an opportunity to reopen the evidentiary record to specifically address the causation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">. <em>See also Bradner v.
