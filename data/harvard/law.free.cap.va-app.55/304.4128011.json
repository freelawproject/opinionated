McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Dunia Rivera-Padilla appeals from her conviction for welfare fraud and argues the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress statements she made during an interview with Virginia Department of Social Services agents. Rivera-Padilla contends the statements were coerced in violation of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Disagreeing with her arguments, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">In September 2003, Rivera-Padilla applied for and began receiving TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) and food stamps through the Virginia Department of Social Services (DSS). In August 2005, during a review -with her eligibility worker, Rivera-Padilla was asked to provide verification of her income to maintain her eligibility for benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Rivera-Padilla failed to do so, her case was closed effective August 31, 2005. Rivera-Padilla\u2019s children, however, continued receiving Medicaid benefits although those too were scheduled to terminate at the end of September.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">In September 2005, DSS received information that Rivera-Padilla was working under an assumed name but not reporting those wages. DSS requested a meeting with Rivera-Padilla to obtain information regarding Rivera-Padilla\u2019s income to determine if her children remained eligible for the Medicaid benefits as those benefits were scheduled to termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>nate September 30th, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Initially present at the meeting were Rivera-Padilla, a DSS eligibility worker, social worker, and interpreter. Because the DSS workers were having difficulty getting Rivera-Padilla to understand what information DSS needed, Sarah Hogan, a fraud investigator, was asked to join the meeting. Hogan was introduced to Rivera-Padilla as the fraud investigator. Rivera-Padilla was told there was a suspicion that she was receiving income that she had not reported and that in order for benefits to continue the agency needed to follow up on that information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rivera-Padilla admitted she had been working under an assumed identity and had lied because she feared DSS would report her to the police. When Rivera-Padilla stated how long she had been working, she was told it was possible benefits had been overpaid which would have to be paid back by her and that she could be subject to fraud charges for submitting false documentation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, Rivera-Padilla was charged with fraud in connection with benefits she received to which she was not entitled during the time she was earning wages that were not reported to DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Before trial on the fraud charges, Rivera-Padilla moved to suppress the statements she made during the meeting on the grounds they were coerced in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The trial court denied the motion finding that Rivera-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Padilla\u2019s statements were made voluntarily and free of \u201cany sort of coercive or pressuring aspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Rivera-Padilla argues \u201cthe threat of denial of public benefits was inherently coercive\u201d such that her statements to DSS were compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is on the appellant to show that the denial of her motion was reversible error. <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 489-90, 545 S.E.2d 541, 545 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The Fifth Amendment, in relevant part, provides that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d This prohibition not only permits a person to refuse to testify against himself at a criminal trial in which he is a defendant, but also \u201cprivileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973). In all such proceedings,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">a witness protected by the privilege may rightfully refuse to answer unless and until he is protected at least against the use of his compelled answers and evidence derived therefrom in any subsequent criminal case in which he is a defendant____ Absent such protection, if he is nevertheless compelled to answer, his answers are inadmissible against him in a later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 78, 94 S.Ct. at 322 (citations omitted). \u201cThe [Fifth] Amendment speaks of compulsion. It does not preclude a witness from testifying voluntarily in matters which may incriminate him. If, therefore, he desires the protection of the privilege, he must claim it or he will not be considered to have been \u2018compelled\u2019 within the meaning of the Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Monia, </em>317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S.Ct. 409, 410-411, 87 L.Ed. 376 (1943) (footnote omitted). And \u201cif a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>claiming the privilege, the Government has not \u2018compelled\u2019 him to incriminate himself.\u201d <em>Garner v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 648, 654, 96 S.Ct. 1178, 1182, 47 L.Ed.2d 370 (1976) (footnote omitted). In general, the Fifth Amendment privilege is not self-executing such that the witness must affirmatively claim the privilege or lose the benefits of its protection. \u201cThus it is that a witness confronted with questions that the government should reasonably expect to elicit incriminating evidence ordinarily must assert the privilege rather than answer if he desires not to incriminate himself.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 </em>U.S. 420, 429, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1143, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The general rule that a witness must affirmatively claim the privilege is inapplicable only in well-defined situations where some identifiable factor denied the witness the free will to admit, deny, or refuse to answer. <em>Id. </em>For example, the general rule has \u201cbeen deemed inapplicable in cases where the assertion of the privilege is penalized so as to [foreclose] a free choice to remain silent, and ... [compel] ... incriminating testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 104 S.Ct. at 1146 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See, e.g., Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. 801, 97 S.Ct. 2132, 53 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977) (political party officer banned from holding any public or party office for five years for exercising privilege); <em>Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 94 S.Ct. 316, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (public contractors required to waive their privilege or lose state contracts); <em>Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass\u2019n v. Comm\u2019r of Sanitation, </em>392 U.S. 280, 88 S.Ct. 1917, 20 L.Ed.2d 1089 (1968) (sanitation workers required to waive privilege or lose their jobs); <em>Gardner v. Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1968) (state statute required discharge of police officer exercising privilege in an investigation of police corruption); <em>Spevack v. Klein, </em>385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967) (attorney disbarred for exercising privilege and refusing to honor a subpoena); <em>Garrity v. New Jersey, </em>385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967) (police officers in corruption investigation were required to either waive privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>lege or lose their jobs). Thus, in such cases, the individual\u2019s very assertion of the privilege triggers a penalty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It is undisputed that Rivera-Padilla failed to claim her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during the DSS interview. She argues, though, her failure is excused by the \u201cpenalty\u201d exception because her choice to remain silent was foreclosed by the threat to terminate her benefits unless she gave the requested information to DSS.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But \u201c[i]n each of the so-called \u2018penalty\u2019 cases, the State not only compelled an individual to appear and testify, but also sought to induce him to forgo the Fifth Amendment privilege by threatening to impose economic or other sanctions \u2018capable of forcing the self-incrimination which the Amendment forbids.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 434, 104 S.Ct. at 1146 (quoting <em>Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. at 806, 97 S.Ct. at 2136.) It is \u201c[t]he threat of punishment for reliance on the privilege [that] distinguishes cases of this sort from the ordinary case in which a witness is merely required to appear and give testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 104 S.Ct. at 1146. Thus, to determine whether Rivera-Padilla\u2019s statements were voluntary or involuntary, the issue is not whether she was compelled to attend the meeting with DSS and answer questions in order to claim benefits, but whether she was coerced to surrender her privilege to claim benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 434-45, 104 S.Ct. at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Rivera-Padilla cannot rely on the \u201cpenalty\u201d exception to claim she was compelled to give statements in violation of the Fifth Amendment because she was never told she must forgo her Fifth Amendment privilege to seek the benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>She was required to provide information regarding her income in order to seek the continuation of the benefits but that requirement did not convert her voluntary statements into compelled ones since she was not refrained from claiming her privilege.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, </em>468 U.S. 841, 858, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 3358, 82 L.Ed.2d 632 (1984) (requirement that student applicants for federal financial aid state they had registered for draft to be eligible for aid did not compel them to incriminate themselves where \u201cthe Government has not refused any request for immunity for their answers or otherwise threatened them with penalties for invoking the privilege\u201d); <em>Husske v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 217, 476 S.E.2d 920, 928 (1996) (court-ordered requirement that defendant meet with mental health workers \u201cdid not in itself convert his \u2018otherwise voluntary statements into compelled ones\u2019 \u201d where he was not threatened if he relied on privilege (quoting <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 427, 104 S.Ct. at 1142)); <em>J.D. v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 329, 591 S.E.2d 721 (2004) (student summoned to principal\u2019s office to provide information regarding thefts at school was not coerced into making incriminatory statements where he was not threatened with disciplinary action if he exercised his right to remain silent).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Simply put, it is permissible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>state to require persons to provide relevant accurate information regarding matters relating to benefits or risk discontinuation of the benefits. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rivers, </em>146 P.3d 999 (Alaska Ct.App.2006) (requirement that recipient of unemployment benefits provide information to fraud investigator did not compel him to incriminate himself where he claimed the obligation amounted to an economic threat to discontinue his benefits); <em>State v. Baeza, </em>156 Wis.2d 651, 457 N.W.2d 522 (Ct.App.1990) (requirement that welfare recipient give notice of newly acquired income did not compel her to incriminate herself where she claimed she would be forced to admit illegally acquired income); <em>Alcaraz v. Block, </em>746 F.2d 593 (9th Cir.1984) (requirement that applicant for school meal eligibility food stamps provide social security number did not compel him to incriminate himself where he claimed he was being forced to admit he was an illegal alien).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In <em>Rivers, </em>the Alaska Court of Appeals similarly concluded statements by a recipient of unemployment benefits to an agency investigator who suspected the recipient of fraud were made voluntarily despite the fact he was required to attend the interview and answer questions. As the concurring judge noted in writing separately to emphasize the core of the opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">[F]or purposes of [the penalty] exception, one must distinguish situations where a person will be penalized for the very act of asserting the privilege <em>{e.g., </em>the person will lose their job if they assert the privilege, regardless of the other evidence in the case) from situations where a person is free to assert the privilege but they then run the risk that, based on the remaining evidence, the court or administrative agency will decide the ease against them. The exception applies only to the former situation, not the latter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\"><em>Rivers, </em>146 P.3d at 1005 (footnote omitted). There is no evidence DSS asked Rivera-Padilla to waive her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination much less indicated, either expressly or impliedly, that her eligibility for benefits was conditioned on her forfeiting her Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Therefore, we conclude since Rivera-Padilla \u201crevealed incriminating information instead of timely asserting [her] Fifth Amendment privilege, [her] disclosures were not compelled incriminations.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 440, 104 S.Ct. at 1149. We further hold the \u201cpenalty\u201d exception articulated in <em>Garrity </em>and its progeny is not applicable since DSS neither conditioned Rivera-Padilla\u2019s eligibility to obtain benefits on a waiver of her Fifth Amendment rights nor threatened to disqualify her from seeking benefits if she did rely on the privilege.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\">. Pursuant to agency regulations, Rivera-Padilla was required to update her income information every six months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. Benefits are certified for a specific time frame and if the requested information regarding income is not given to continue the benefits, they will be terminated. Therefore, if Rivera-Padilla had failed to appear for the meeting, the benefits would have discontinued, as scheduled, on September 30th.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">. According to Hogan, at the time she joined the meeting, while the agency had information Rivera-Padilla was working under an assumed identity and not reporting income such that she may not be eligible for continued benefits, the agency was not aware there was an issue with a prior time frame during which Rivera-Padilla had already received benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\">. No decision had been made regarding whether there would be a referral to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office since the time frame during which Rivera-Padilla had worked and the amount of overpayment was still undetermined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">. Other exceptions to the requirement of a timely assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege have been developed in the context of custodial interrogations requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings and in the context of the federal occupational and excise taxes on gamblers. <em>See Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 429-40, 104 S.Ct. at 1143-49. Rivera-Padilla does not contend her failure to claim the privilege is excused by these exceptions, which clearly have no application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">. We assume without deciding for purposes of our analysis the loss of her children's Medicaid benefits would constitute a \"penalty\u201d within the meaning of <em>Garrity </em>and other \"penalty\u201d cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\">. Rivera-Padilla contends that questions related to eligibility for future benefits asked by an eligibility worker are permissible but questions related to past events or by a fraud investigator are not permissible. This distinction is irrelevant since we have assumed the interview with DSS was a \"proceeding ... where the answers might incriminate\u201d Rivera-Padilla making the Fifth Amendment privilege applicable. <em>Turley, </em>414 U.S. at 77, 94 S.Ct. at 322.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. The Commonwealth argues Rivera-Padilla\u2019s obligation to provide information regarding her eligibility is much like that of a probationer who must appear and give statements to his probation officer regarding matters relating to his probationary status. <em>See Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 435-39, 104 S.Ct. at 1146-49 (Court holding there was no Fifth Amendment violation where Minnesota law required probationer to meet with his probation officer and give truthful answers since Minnesota did not condition his probation on waiving his Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to further criminal prosecutions). Rivera-Padilla challenges the Commonwealth's reliance on cases involving the use of incriminating statements by probationers because courts have relaxed restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>on gathering information from probationers due to the rehabilitative value of probation. The United States Supreme Court, though, has expressly noted when \"a defendant is imprisoned or on probation at the time he makes incriminating statements, if those statements are compelled they are inadmissible in a subsequent trial for a crime other than that for which he has been convicted.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 426, 104 S.Ct. at 1141-42. Therefore, while the state may impinge upon a probationer\u2019s privacy rights to assure the conditions of probation are being observed, it may not compel the probationer to incriminate himself in a pending or subsequent criminal prosecution. The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Murphy </em>was not based on a relaxed restriction on gathering information from probationers as Rivera-Padilla suggests, but rather on the fact that Minnesota did not condition Murphy\u2019s probation on waiving his Fifth Amendment privilege. As the Court stated, Murphy's situation was \"indistinguishable from that facing suspects who are questioned in noncustodial settings\u201d and \u201cgrand jury witnesses, who are sworn to tell the truth and placed in a setting conducive to truthtelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 431, 104 S.Ct. at 1145, 1144. Indeed, while the probation setting is coercive in nature since a probationer is compelled by court order to attend meetings with his probation officer, a welfare recipient is \"in no sense under any [governmental] 'compulsion' to seek that aid.\u201d <em>Selective Service System, </em>468 U.S. at 857, 104 S.Ct. at 3357 (Court pointing out difference between public contractors required by New York law to waive privilege and male students disqualified from seeking federal financial aid due to their failure to register for the draft).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">. The Fifth Amendment privilege is not violated by mandatory self-reporting necessary to accomplish the objectives of a regulatory statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>where disclosures are not \u201cextracted from a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities ... in an area permeated with criminal statutes\u201d but rather apply to the general public and to activities that are generally lawful. <em>California v. Byers, </em>402 U.S. 424, 430, 91 S.Ct. 1535, 1539, 29 L.Ed.2d 9 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>Cf. Marchetti v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L,Ed.2d 889 (1968) (Court holding because of the pervasive criminal regulation of gambling activities and the fact that claiming the privilege in lieu of filing a return would tend to incriminate, the privilege may be exercised by failing to file). Rivera-Padilla does not seek application of this exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">. Discussing the choice to incriminate themselves or forfeit jobs to <em>which they were otherwise entitled, </em>the Court in <em>Garrity </em>noted \"[wjhere the choice is 'between the rock and the whirlpool,\u2019 duress is inherent in deciding to \u2018waive\u2019 one or the other.\u201d <em>Garrity, </em>385 U.S. at 498, 87 S.Ct. at 619. Rivera-Padilla claims she faced a similar \"Hobson\u2019s choice\" in that she was forced to choose between surrendering her privilege (which as we stated she was not asked to do) and forfeiting benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>We assume, for the sake of argument, she was otherwise entitled to the benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">. We reject Rivera-Padilla's contention that our conclusion is precluded by the recent decision in <em>Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 105, 677 S.E.2d 265 (2009), in which the Virginia Supreme Court held it was improper to affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions on grounds not argued in the trial court or this Court where additional factfinding was necessary. At trial, Rivera-Padilla moved to suppress her statements in reliance on the \"penalty\u201d exception recognized in <em>Garrity </em>and the Commonwealth argued the <em>Garrity </em>exception was inapplicable. The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth finding Rivera-Padilla's statements were not compelled. On appeal, Rivera-Padilla again contends <em>Garrity </em>and its progeny apply such that her statements were compelled despite her failure to claim privilege and the Commonwealth again contends <em>Garrity </em>is inapplicable. Affirming the trial court we likewise agree with the Commonwealth that <em>Garrity </em>is inapplicable. We fail to see how <em>Whitehead, </em>even under the broadest interpretation, can be construed so as to preclude us from adopting this rationale. Although Rivera-Padilla points to the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to cite <em>Murphy </em>in the trial court, the Commonwealth is not prohibited from relying on cases not presented to the trial court when its position was adequately presented at trial, as it was here. <em>See Byrd v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 542, 549, 651 S.E.2d 414, 418 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
