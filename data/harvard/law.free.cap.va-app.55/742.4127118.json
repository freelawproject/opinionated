On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the vehicle and appellant because the police lacked probable cause for the search. Appellant asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the confidential informant\u2019s tip lacked the detail necessary to support probable cause. Appellant also argues that the trial court erred when it refused to strike the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. For the following reasons, we agree that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress; however, the motion to strike issue is not properly before this Court because it is procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (citation omitted). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">At the suppression hearing held on January 8, 2008, Virginia Beach Police Officer William Canada (\u201cCanada\u201d) testified that on March 27, 2007, at approximately 1:00 a.m., he received a tip from a reliable confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) that in approximately thirty (30) minutes a drug transaction involving crack cocaine was going to take place at the Harris Teeter grocery store at 29th and Arctic Boulevard in Virginia Beach. Canada stated that the Cl told him a green four-door vehicle, driven by a black female with a black male passenger, would pull into the Harris Teeter parking lot where the drug transaction would take place. The Cl further told him that the male in the car had a gun. At the suppression hearing, Canada testified that he did not know the basis of the Cl\u2019s knowledge with regard to this tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">After receiving the information from the Cl, Canada, Officers Jason Gregory (\u201cGregory\u201d), and Robert Ernest (\u201cErnest\u201d) set up surveillance at the Harris Teeter. Gregory testified at the suppression hearing that Canada told them the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Cl stated a green Dodge with a black female driver and black male passenger would drive to the Harris Teeter, the passenger would get out, conduct a drug transaction, get back in the car, and they would leave. He further told them that the drug would be crack cocaine and the passenger would be armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The officers were in position at Harris Teeter ten minutes after receiving the tip. They waited for approximately twenty minutes when they saw a green four-door Dodge pull into the parking lot with a black female driver and a black male passenger. The driver pulled into a parking space, and after one minute the passenger got out and walked directly into the Harris Teeter. Approximately two minutes later, the passenger walked out of the store without anything in his hands and returned to the vehicle. They then drove out of the parking lot. The officers did not see what occurred in the store, nor did they see any visible purchases on the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Based on the information from the Cl and the officers\u2019 observation, Canada stated that they stopped the vehicle on 28th Street and removed appellant, the black male passenger, and the female driver from the car. The officers detained the individuals and placed them in separate police cars. They then searched the passenger compartment and found a loaded Jimenez nine-millimeter handgun in the glove compartment. The female driver claimed ownership of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">After discovering the gun, Gregory took appellant to the Second Precinct police station where he read him his rights in accordance with <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Appellant then waived his right to remain silent and to consult with counsel and indicated that he wanted to speak with Gregory. Appellant informed Gregory that even though his girlfriend owned the gun, his fingerprints would be found on it because he had moved it the previous night. After Gregory interviewed appellant at the police station, Ernest transferred him to the detective bureau where appellant was wanted on a different matter. Upon arriving at the First Precinct, Ernest took him to an interview room, and based on department policy had him remove his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>pants because he had a pair of shorts on underneath them. As appellant pulled off his pants, a small baggie containing a white substance fell to the floor underneath appellant\u2019s pant leg. Ernest testified that there had been nothing on the floor when they entered the room and that he saw the baggie fall to the floor. The certificate of analysis entered into evidence showed that the baggie contained .27 gram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Canada testified that the Harris Teeter area was known as a high crime drug area in which several narcotics arrests had been made. With regard to the Cl, Canada testified that he knew the identity of the Cl, and had worked with this Cl for about eighteen (18) months with the last six (6) months of that time being after the Cl had completed the process of becoming a confidential informant. Canada stated that the information the Cl provided during this time was reliable, never found to be false, involved narcotics, and had resulted in \u201cover twelve search warrants, seizures of large quantities of money, drugs, firearms, people with arrest warrants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress on the grounds that there was a sufficient basis for the stop based on the Cl\u2019s information and the totality of the circumstances. Specifically, the trial court stated that this case was distinguishable from <em>Russell v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 604, 535 S.E.2d 699 (2000), in that the information in this case was sufficient because the informant had been a source of twelve previous search warrants that resulted in seizure of significant quantities of drugs, weapons, and money, the accurate description of the vehicle and the occupants of the vehicle, and the time and place it was going to stop. The trial judge further observed that he did not think the officers needed to physically observe the criminal transaction before they made a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">At trial, the Commonwealth admitted, without objection, a copy of California Penal Code \u00a7 12021.1 along with a conviction order from the Superior Court of California, San Diego County, finding appellant guilty of possession of a firearm by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>person previously convicted of a specified violent crime in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 12021.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A9S\">I. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Appellant contends that the police lacked probable cause to search him and the car based on the Cl\u2019s tip and, thus, the evidence found in the stop and flowing from the subsequent arrest should be suppressed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, this Court considers the evidence given at both the suppression hearing and the trial, <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 583, 359 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (1987), and views the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the Commonwealth all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from it,\u201d <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002) (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">This Court is \u201cbound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc) (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). However, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of legal standards ... to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>McCracken v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 254, 258, 572 S.E.2d 493, 495 (2002) (citing <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699,116 S.Ct. at 1663). \u201c \u2018Ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause ... involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>Ramey v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 624, 628, 547 S.E.2d 519, 521 (2001) (quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ing <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 233, 237, 498 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1998)). \u201cThe burden is on the defendant to show that the denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was reversible error.\u201d <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 490, 545 S.E.2d 541, 545 (2001) (citing <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment ... protects \u2018the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 674, 682, 496 S.E.2d 143, 147 (1998) (citation omitted). \u201c[A] \u2018highly intrusive, full-scale ... \u2019 search[ ] ... must be based upon probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the suspect.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (citing <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)). If probable cause exists for a search, then a warrantless search of an automobile is permitted under the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d and it does \u201cnot contravene the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 569, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 1986, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991) (citing <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 158-59, 45 S.Ct. 280, 287, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925)). The reasons for this exception are the ready mobility of the vehicle as well as the fact that \u201c \u2018the expectation of privacy with respect to one\u2019s automobile is significantly less than that relating to one\u2019s home or office.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v.

Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 367, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3096, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976)). \u201cIf a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits police to search the vehicle without more.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Labron, </em>518 U.S. 938, 940, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 2487, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">\u201c[P]robable cause exists when \u2018there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 171, 178, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>670 S.E.2d 727, 731 (2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. 90, 95, 126 S.Ct. 1494, 1499, 164 L.Ed.2d 195 (2006)). An officer has probable cause sufficient for a warrantless search if \u201c \u2018the facts and circumstances within [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949) (quoting <em>Carroll, </em>267 U.S. at 162, 45 S.Ct. at 288).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In this case, a confidential informant was the basis for the police officer\u2019s probable cause. \u201cWhen a confidential informant provides the basis for probable cause, there are two considerations that are particularly relevant to our analysis: (1) the veracity or reliability of the informant and (2) the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge.\u201d <em>Byrd v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 542, 551, 651 S.E.2d 414, 419 (2007) (citing <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">The reliability and basis of knowledge of an informant are not independent elements that must be proved in order to find probable cause, <em>Polston v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 738, 744, 485 S.E.2d 632, 635 (1997), but instead \u201c \u2018are better understood as relevant considerations in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that traditionally has guided probable-cause determinations: a deficiency in one may be compensated for, in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to the other, or by some other indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 552, 651 S.E.2d at 419 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZW\"><em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 732, 738, 675 S.E.2d 206, 209 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\u201cIn \u2018applying the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis,\u2019 the Supreme Court has \u2018consistently recognized the value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip by independent police work.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGuire v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 584, 594, 525 S.E.2d 43, 48 (2000) (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>241, 103 S.Ct. at 2334). \u201c[A]n officer \u2018may rely upon information received through an informant, rather than upon direct observations,\u2019 so long as the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the informant\u2019s statement is true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594-95, 525 S.E.2d at 48 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 242, 103 S.Ct. at 2334).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In this case, the trial court found that the information provided by the Cl and his history of being a source were sufficient to support the stop and search of the vehicle and its occupants. Canada had worked with the Cl in the present case for six months, and the Cl had provided information prior to the instance in this case that had proved to be reliable. Canada stated that the Cl had never provided false information in the time that he worked with him. Further, the information provided in the past by the Cl had resulted in twelve search warrants that produced evidence of drugs, weapons, and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The reliability of the Cl in this case is similar to the reliability of the informant in <em>Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 552, 651 S.E.2d at 419. In that case, the informant had provided information to the officer that resulted in one search warrant, three arrests, and six recoveries of narcotics, and the information provided was never inaccurate. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we agree that the record in this case supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Cl in this case was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Although we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the Cl was reliable, our analysis does not end there, for we must also consider the Cl\u2019s basis of knowledge of the purported criminal activity. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cNevertheless, although the confidential informant used ... was reliable, the informant did not provide any basis for his knowledge of [defendant\u2019s] criminal activity.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201cThe basis of an informant\u2019s tip must be \u2018something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation.\u2019 <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 416, 89 S.Ct. 584, 589, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969). For example, a confidential informant may provide the basis of his knowledge by claiming that he personally observed the crime that he is reporting. <em>See e.g., Askew [v. Commonwealth], </em>38 Va.App. [718,] 720, 568 S.E.2d [403,] 405 [ (2002) ] (confidential informant personally observed the defendant in possession of narcotics); <em>Lester v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 495, 501-02, 518 S.E.2d 318, 321 (1999) (confidential informant personally observed the defendant in possession of stolen property); <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 179, 182, 402 S.E.2d 914, 916 (1991) (anonymous informant had personally observed the defendant in possession of cocaine). In other cases, although the informant does not explicitly claim personal knowledge, his tip may be \u2018so detailed as to raise an inference either of personal observation or of acquisition of the information in a reliable way.\u2019 <em>McGuire, </em>31 Va.App. at 595, 525 S.E.2d at 49.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>53 Va.App. at 739, 675 S.E.2d at 210 (quoting <em>Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 552-53, 651 S.E.2d at 419-20). Appellant contends that the informant provided no basis as to how the Cl obtained the information he provided and that the information corroborated by the officers was general information. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>As we noted in <em>Byrd, Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959), is the classic case where an informant\u2019s basis of knowledge is not given, yet this deficiency is overcome by corroboration of extensive detail given by the informant. <em>Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 553, 651 S.E.2d at 420 (citing <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 242, 103 S.Ct. at 2334) The informant in <em>Draper </em>told the officers that Draper would be carrying heroin when he arrived in Denver on a train from Chicago on one of two specific days. <em>Draper, </em>358 U.S. at 309, 79 S.Ct. at 331. The informant specifically described Draper\u2019s physical appearance, what he would be wearing, the specific bag he would be carrying, and that he \u201cwalked real fast.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the officers arrested Draper, he had just stepped off a train in Denver that had arrived from Chicago on one of the two specified dates, was dressed exactly as the informant said he would be, and was walking fast. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 79 S.Ct. at 331. The Court in <em>Draper </em>concluded that the police had probable cause to arrest him even though the officer did not witness the accomplishment of the mission because the officer was able to verify that Draper arrived when predicted, had the exact physical characteristics, was dressed exactly as described, and was walking quickly. <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 79 S.Ct. at 333-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Like the informant in <em>Draper, </em>the Cl in this case did not state that he was personally observing the activity nor did he provide detailed information sufficient \u201c \u2018to raise an inference ... of acquisition of the information in a reliable way.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson, </em>53 Va.App. at 739, 675 S.E.2d at 210 (quoting <em>Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 553, 651 S.E.2d at 420). However, unlike the informant in <em>Draper, </em>the information that the Cl gave in this case was not \u201c \u2018accurate and detailed predictions of future events\u2019\u201d demonstrating \u201c\u2018personal or \u201cinside\u201d knowledge of the suspect\u2019s activities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740, 675 S.E.2d at 210 (quoting <em>Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 554, 651 S.E.2d at 420). The information the Cl provided merely included the appellant\u2019s gender and race, the location of the appellant as the passenger, the color and make of the vehicle, the destination, and an estimate that it would take place in the next thirty minutes. The Cl predicted that the appellant would be armed and that the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>transaction would take place in the parking lot.

In 2006, appellant was convicted in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a specified violent crime under California Penal Code \u00a7 12021.1(a).

Although appellant asks this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>apply the ends of justice exception, the application of this exception is not warranted here because the record does not show \u201c \u2018affirmative evidence of innocence or lack of a criminal offense.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765, 627 S.E.2d at 536 (citing <em>Lewis, </em>43 Va.App. at 134, 596 S.E.2d at 546).

The dissent contends that this latter factor does not discount the informant\u2019s degree of reliability. While the record is not clear whether the past information provided led to convictions, whether it did is certainly a consideration in a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis in determining whether or not the informant was so unusually reliable as to overcome the necessity to establish an adequate basis of knowledge. <em>See Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 555, 651 S.E.2d at 421 (\"There is no evidence that any information previously provided by the informant had ever led to a conviction.\u201d). The dissent\u2019s citation to LaFave for the proposition of when \"an informant\u2019s track record is sufficiently established\u201d overlooks the constitutional requirement that what is needed in the present situation, absent any evidence of the informant's basis of knowledge, is a showing that the Cl was \"unusually reliable,\u201d not that he was just simply reliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b805-5\">. The dissent ignores this Court\u2019s previous application and analysis of the law in <em>Byrd, Robinson, </em>and <em>Askew </em>to arrive at its conclusion to the contrary while simultaneously claiming that we have applied a standard that is not \u201cflexible.\u201d Specifically, the dissent asserts that we have \"undertaken an overly 'legalistic' review of the facts presented, and, in the process, applied an excessively 'rigorous definition of probable cause,\u2019 all in contravention to the teaching of <em>Gates </em>and its progeny.\u201d (Citations omitted.) While we agree with the dissent that the informant had been reliable in the past, presumably on those prior occasions the law was properly applied and any search warrant issued on those occasions was the result of a judicial official reviewing <em>both </em>the informant\u2019s track record for providing accurate information and also whether the information was acquired by him firsthand or through third parties who may or may not share the same level of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The thrust of our disagreement with the dissent is that where the dissent would apparently end its analysis with the trial court's factual finding that the Cl had been reliable in the past and hold that this fact alone supports probable cause, we cannot ignore the remaining constitutional requirement that the totality of the circumstances to establish probable cause must also consider the basis of the informant's knowledge in conjunction with his level of reliability. Since any competent police officer, before applying for a search warrant, would likely ask an informant for details he would be expected to supply to a magistrate or testify to in a suppression hearing including how the informant knows the incriminating information he is passing along, presumably the basis for this informant\u2019s knowledge could have been easily established by the prosecution\u2014it simply was not. It may be that the Commonwealth can remedy this deficiency if it is inclined to proceed further, but whether such is the case is not properly a part of our analysis. Thus, we have merely followed the approach used by this Court in examining <em>both </em>the informant\u2019s reliability and his basis of knowledge in light of the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a Cl\u2019s tip provides a sufficient basis for probable cause. <em>See Robinson, </em>53 Va.App. at 738-40, 675 S.E.2d at 209-11; <em>Byrd, </em>50 Va.App. at 552-55, 651 S.E.2d at 419-21; <em>Askew, </em>38 Va.App. at 723-24, 568 S.E.2d at 406; <em>McGuire, </em>31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Va.App. at 595-96, 525 S.E.2d at 49; <em>Russell, </em>33 Va.App. at 613-15, 535 S.E.2d at 703-04.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b808-8\">McCLANAHAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Azj\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">In reversing the trial court\u2019s determination that probable cause for searching Byrd\u2019s vehicle was established, the majority concludes that: (a) the informant \u201cwas reliable,\u201d but was just not reliable enough; (b) the informant\u2019s tip was \u201cdetailed,\u201d but was just not \u201cso detailed\u201d as to support an inference that it was obtained in a \u201creliable way\u201d through \u201cinside personal knowledge of [Byrd\u2019s] activities\u201d; and (c) the fact there was no direct evidence of the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge regarding Byrd\u2019s activities further undermined the informant\u2019s reliability.

Furthermore, Canada indicated that all of the information he had received from the informant over the eighteen-month period had proven to be reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">As to the subject incident, consistent with the informant\u2019s tip, Canada and two other officers observed a green four-door vehicle pull into the Harris Teeter parking lot at about 1:35 a.m. A black female was driving the vehicle, and a black male, later identified as Byrd, was in the passenger seat. The driver parked the car and, approximately a minute later, the officers saw Byrd exit the vehicle and enter the grocery store\u2014this latter development being in variance with what the informant had expected, having indicated that a drug transaction would take place in the parking lot. Less than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>minutes later, however, Byrd exited the store empty-handed. He then got into the waiting vehicle, and the two suspects drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The officers subsequently stopped and searched the vehicle in which Byrd was a passenger and recovered the loaded nine-millimeter handgun that led to Byrd\u2019s arrest for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Then at the police station, one of the officers discovered that Byrd was carrying a bag of cocaine on his person, resulting in his drug charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In view of the totality of the circumstances presented to the police at the time they stopped and searched Byrd\u2019s vehicle, I do not believe this Court can conclude, as a matter of law, that the police lacked probable cause to conduct the search. That is, I do not agree with the majority that we can say, under the circumstances, no reasonable police officer could have believed there was a fair probability that criminal activity was afoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Upon reviewing similar circumstances involving a confidential informant, even in certain instances where the police had no prior history with the informant, courts in a number of other jurisdictions have concluded that the police had probable cause for executing a warrantless search and/or arrest. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gagnon, </em>373 F.3d 230, 232-38 (2d Cir.2004) (informant, previously unknown to the police, but cooperating after being apprehended for possession of a large quantity of marijuana, advised that Gagnon would be arriving at a certain date, time, and location, driving a tractor trailer with the name \u201cLanfort\u201d on the side of the trailer, for the purpose of receiving the shipment of marijuana located in the informant\u2019s trailer); <em>United States v. Marchena-Borjas, </em>209 F.3d 698, 699-700 (8th Cir.2000) (a reliable informant advised that a named Hispanic male was in possession of methamphetamine at a certain trailer park, and would be delivering it at a certain time to a certain location, driving a silver Oldsmobile mini-van with Nebraska license plates); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>925 F.2d 695, 696-700 (4th Cir.1991) (informant, previously unknown to the police but providing information to gain leniency on pending charges, advised that Miller would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>arriving at the bus station on a certain day wearing blue jeans and a blouse, carrying a brown tote bag, and would be in possession of drugs); <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>147 S.W.3d 1, 6-8 (Ky.2004) (reliable informant advised police that a black male, who would be in possession of crack cocaine, would be driving a blue El Camino to a certain apartment complex and picking up another black male); <em>State v. Abbott, </em>277 Kan. 161, 83 P.3d 794, 796-98 (2004) (reliable informant advised that Abbott would be traveling in a two-tone van to a certain location, giving the date and time, to purchase methamphetamine); <em>State v. Munson, </em>594 N.W.2d 128, 132-37 (Minn.1999) (reliable informant advised that \u201cin 1 1/2 to 2 hours a rented, green 1996 \u2018Bronco or Jeep type vehicle\u2019 with Minnesota license plates\u201d would arrive at a certain location occupied by three African-American males, and the vehicle would contain a large quantity of crack cocaine); <em>Commonwealth v. Bakoian, </em>412 Mass. 295, 588 N.E.2d 667, 668-72 (1992) (reliable informant advised that Bakoian and another named individual, traveling in a black Thunderbird with a beige roof bearing a Massachusetts license plate, would \u201csoon\u201d arrive at a certain location with a shipment of heroin).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">While concluding the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of Byrd\u2019s vehicle in this case, the majority acknowledges that the confidential informant \u201cwas reliable.\u201d The majority nevertheless discounts the informant\u2019s degree of reliability because there was no testimony that the informant\u2019s tips to the police over the period of approximately eighteen months\u2014all of which were reliable\u2014ever resulted in a conviction. Yet, what we do know is that the informant\u2019s tips resulted in the execution of twelve search warrants, seizures of large quantities of money, drugs, and firearms, and a number of arrests, which was more than sufficient to establish the informant as a highly reliable source of information. As stated in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>351 F.3d 254, 259 (6th Cir.2003), even if \u201cprevious successful searches based on [the informant\u2019s] statements had not led to successful prosecutions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>this would by itself not have thrown any doubt on the reliability or truthfulness of the informant,\u201d as the \u201cmere fact that contraband was discovered where he claimed it was going to be discovered is sufficient indicia of his reliability.\u201d <em>See United States v. Angulo-Lopez, </em>791 F.2d 1394, 1397 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cIf the informant has provided accurate information on past occasions, he may be presumed trustworthy on subsequent occasions,\u201d and \u201cthe inference of trustworthiness is even stronger\u201d if \u201cthe information provided in the past involved the same type of criminal activity as the current information.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">As Professor LaFave explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">Courts have consistently held that an informant\u2019s track record is sufficiently established by a showing (i) that on one or more prior occasions the informant indicated that a certain object, usually narcotics, but sometimes such other items as stolen property, counterfeit money, or even the body of a homicide victim are concealed at a certain place, and (ii) the information was verified as true by a search which uncovered the specified items at the place indicated. This is a sound result, for the fact that evidence was turned up which the informant indicated would be turned up bears very directly upon the informant\u2019s credibility---- [A]s a general proposition such a showing may be more convincing than an assertion that the informer\u2019s prior information led to convictions, for\u2014except in those cases where conviction follows from the single fact of a defendant\u2019s possession of a certain object, which the informant may have previously asserted as a fact\u2014a conviction is likely to follow from an accumulation of several facts above and beyond those communicated by the informant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 3.3(b), at 116 (4th ed. 2004) (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Sexton v. State, </em>397 A.2d 540, 546 (Del.1979) (\u201cThe test for determining the reliability of an undisclosed informant is not his record in aiding arrests or convictions, but whether his information has ever been verified in the past.\u201d); <em>People v. Arnold, </em>186 Colo. 372, 527 P.2d 806, 809 (1974) (explaining it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>would be \u201can undue restriction\u201d on the police to require that the informant\u2019s information led to convictions because \u201c[t]he information previously furnished may be in connection with cases not yet tried or may relate to prosecutions dismissed for reasons unrelated to the reliability of the informant\u2019s information\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The majority also concludes that the confidential informant did not provide Officer Canada with enough detail to infer that the informant had \u201cpersonal knowledge of [Byrd\u2019s] criminal activity.\u201d To the contrary, the informant provided critical details \u201crelating not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip, but to future actions of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted,\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 245, 103 S.Ct. at 2335-36; and the Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently recognized the value of corroboration of [such] details of an informant\u2019s tip by independent police work\u201d in establishing probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 241, 103 S.Ct. at 2334.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">As outlined above, thirty-five minutes before Byrd\u2019s arrival at the Harris Teeter grocery store located at 29th and Arctic Boulevard in Virginia Beach, the informant accurately advised Canada that Byrd, identified as a black male, would be arriving at that location in approximately thirty minutes, that he would be a passenger in a green four-door vehicle, and that he would be accompanied by a black female, who would be driving the vehicle. The informant also advised that a drug transaction would be taking place in the grocery store parking lot. Canada and two other officers then corroborated all but the latter piece of information, as Byrd quickly entered and exited the grocery store, empty-handed, rather than engaging in a transaction in the grocery store parking lot. The fact that there was a discrepancy with this latter piece of information does not mean that the police should have concluded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>tip was unreliable. <em>See United States v. Diallo, 29 </em>F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir.1994) (rejecting contention that informant\u2019s tip was unreliable because he had predicted \u201cthere would be three men in a red Toyota [who were going in engage in a drug transaction on a particular night] when in actuality there were four men in two cars\u201d and declaring that \u201c[a] tipster need not deliver an ironclad case to the authorities on the proverbial silver platter\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Morales, </em>923 F.2d 621, 625 (8th Cir.1991) (\u201cWhile Morales was not wearing a black T-shirt at the time of arrest as the informant had predicted, he did arrive at the depot at the appointed time in a red pick-up with a white topper accompanied by a woman.\u201d). Once again, we are to apply a totality-of-the-eireumstances analysis, viewed from the perspective of a reasonable police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Furthermore, the fact that \u201call of the corroborat[ed] detail ... was of entirely innocent activity\u201d does not diminish its significance. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 245 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 n. 13. \u201cIn making a determination of probable cause the relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018guilty,\u2019 but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts.\u201d <em>Id.; see Morales, </em>923 F.2d at 625 (\u201c[T]he corroboration of minor, innocent details can suffice to establish probable cause.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, when the officers evaluated the seemingly innocent details of the corroborating information in conjunction with the informant\u2019s history of veracity, they could have reasonably believed that the uncorroborated portion of the informant\u2019s tip, i.e., Byrd\u2019s predicted illegal activity, was also correct. \u201c[Because] an informant is right about some things, he is more probably right about other facts, ... including the claim regarding ... criminal activity.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>see Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959) (discussed at length in <em>Gates, </em>wherein the Court described <em>Draper </em>as the \u201cclassic case on the value of corroborative efforts of police officers,\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 242, 103 S.Ct. at 2334). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>addition, as we pointed out in <em>Ramey v. Commonwealth, 35 </em>Va.App. 624, 631, 547 S.E.2d 519, 523 (2001) (quoting <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2417, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)), \u2018\u201c[bjeeause only a small number of people are generally privy to an individual\u2019s itinerary, it is reasonable for police to believe that a person with access to such information is likely to have access to reliable information about that individual\u2019s illegal activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Finally, in light of the totality of the circumstances here presented\u2014including the informant\u2019s eighteen-month history of providing accurate information to the police; the informant\u2019s prediction of Byrd\u2019s future behavior; the police\u2019s near-total corroboration of that prediction; the fact that the subject location was known to police as a high drug crime area where numerous narcotics arrests had been made; and the fact that Byrd quickly entered and exited the grocery store empty-handed\u2014I disagree with the majority in terms of the negative weight it attaches to the fact there was no direct evidence of the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge regarding Byrd\u2019s activities. If there is a \u201cstrong showing\u201d of \u201csome other indicia of [the informant\u2019s] reliability,\u201d there need not be any indicia of the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Gates, </em>consistent with the \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances analysis,\u201d \u201ca deficiency in [the showing of either the informant\u2019s \u2018veracity\u2019 or his \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019] may be compensated for, in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a <em>strong showing as to the other, </em>or by <em>some other indicia of reliability.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added); see 2 LaFave <em>swpra </em>\u00a7 3.3(f), at 190 (The <em>Gates </em>Court \u201cspecifically approved of corroboration as a means of overcoming the lack of a more direct showing of an informant\u2019s basis of knowledge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the trial court in denying Byrd\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of his vehicle (the firearm) and the custodial search of his person (the cocaine) on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>that the police had probable cause to search the vehicle, which led to his arrest and custodial search. I would also hold that Byrd\u2019s alternative argument challenging his firearm conviction is barred under Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\">. We thus said in <em>Robinson, </em>more specifically, that \"neither <em>Askew [v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 718, 568 S.E.2d 403 (2002),] nor any other controlling case law\u201d\u2014meaning <em>Byrd v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 542, 651 S.E.2d 414 (2007), as well\u2014establishes any \"technical standard concerning informant reliability,\u201d and we declined the invitation to create any such standard in <em>Robinson. Robinson, </em>53 Va.App. at 738, 675 S.E.2d at 210. To have done so, of course, would have been in contravention to <em>Gates. </em>The majority is, therefore, mistaken in relying on <em>Askew, Byrd, </em>and <em>Robinson </em>as support for its assertion that there was a \u201cconstitutional requirement\u201d that the confidential informant in the instant case had to be \"unusually reliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">The origin of the phrase \"unusually reliable\u201d in the current context is <em>Gates, </em>where the Supreme Court was simply illustrating, by way of example, the flexible nature of the totality-of-the-circumstances approach to assessing probable cause, in contrast to the rigid two part <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>test. After explaining that any number of factors, either alone or in combination, may serve as satisfactory \"indicia of reliability\u201d for a informant\u2019s tip, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">If, for example, a particular informant is known for the unusual reliability of his predictions of certain types of criminal activities in a locality, his failure, in a particular case, to thoroughly set forth the basis of his knowledge surely should not serve as an absolute bar to a finding of probable cause based on his tip.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-11\"><em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329-30. In any event, the <em>Gates </em>Court went on to make clear that a case-by-case review of the totality of the circumstances, \u201cwhich permits a balanced assessment of the rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>live weights <em>of all the various indicia of </em>reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant\u2019s tip,\u201d is still the ultimate test. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">. Thus, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the informant in this case had to be \u201cunusually reliable\" for probable cause to have been established, as the majority contends, the informant should certainly be viewed in that light due to the informant's eighteen-month similar history of providing reliable information to Officer Canada regarding significant criminal activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
