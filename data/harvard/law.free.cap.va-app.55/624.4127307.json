On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a new trial when it was discovered that exculpatory evidence known to the police was not disclosed to him prior to his trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Under well established principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence proved that on March 15, 2008, Richmond police officers were conducting outstanding warrant checks at a particular motel, checking the names of registered guests. Officers Derrick Longoria and William Bagent determined that Room 150 was registered to appellant and that he had an outstanding warrant from Petersburg. The officers knocked on the door of Room 150, but no one answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">As they returned to their police vehicle, the officers saw a silver Ford Explorer back out of a parking space quickly and spin its wheels as it left the area. The officers followed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Explorer from the hotel parking lot. The Explorer then pulled into a parking space at a gas station across the street from the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">From less than 13 feet away in the well-lit parking lot, Officer Longoria saw the driver of the Explorer get out, look at him, and then walk into the store. Longoria noticed an indentation under the driver\u2019s right eye. Longoria recognized the driver from a previous encounter and told Officer Bagent that the driver was Tyree Coley.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">However, before backup officers arrived, appellant returned to his vehicle and left the parking lot. Longoria and Bagent attempted a traffic stop. Appellant drove back to the gas station and, as the officers exited their police vehicle, the vehicle backed up and rammed the police vehicle. Appellant drove off again. Longoria and Bagent pursued appellant onto the ramp of Interstate 95 South. The vehicle again stopped, and appellant attempted to ram his vehicle into the police vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although they continued to pursue appellant, the officers lost sight of the Explorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The officers then executed a search warrant on Room 150. They found a duffle bag containing five or six pictures of appellant posing with his friends. The photographs were not produced at trial. At trial, Officer Longoria testified that the search of the hotel room produced no other identifying items. Officer Bagent testified that he did not recall if other identifying items were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">After completing the search, both officers pulled recent and older photographs of appellant and his twin brother, Tyrone Coley. Longoria also took the photographs to the gas station for the clerk to identify. At trial, both officers testified that appellant, not his brother, had been driving the Explorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Officer Longoria testified that the driver who returned to the gas station and rammed the police vehicle was the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>person who had first driven into the gas station parking lot. Longoria stated that during the pursuit, the driver looked right at them. Longoria noticed an indentation under appellant\u2019s right eye. Longoria testified that he knew appellant had a tattoo on the right side of his neck, but he could not testify to seeing it that night. Bagent testified that appellant \u201cwas definitely the same individual that I saw driving the silver Ford Explorer.\u201d Bagent also testified that appellant had an indentation on the left side of his face and that based on a photograph from 2005, Tyrone Coley was much heavier than appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Longoria testified that he did not write the police report of this incident. Bagent testified that he could not remember who wrote the report. The parties stipulated that the police report contained no reference to an indentation in appellant\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Appellant\u2019s mother, Constance Coley, testified that her son Tyrone had been a fugitive for about five years. She stated that in March 2008, Tyrone and appellant were the same height and weight and wore their hair in a similar fashion. She also testified that she went to the motel in question on the night of the incident. She was not there to see appellant, but she testified that appellant was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Latonya Terry, a convicted felon, testified that she was with appellant from 7:00 a.m. on March 15 until 4:00 a.m. the following day. Terry stated that she remembered the date because a friend of hers and appellant\u2019s had died on that date in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The trial court convicted appellant of the charges, stating, \u201con the evidence I find beyond a reasonable doubt that you were the person involved in these events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">After his conviction but before his sentencing, appellant filed a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. The motion alleged the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence; specifically 1) that police recovered a document from Room 150 of the motel bearing the name of Jeremy Venable; 2) that the officers testified differently as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>location of the indentation on appellant\u2019s face; 3) that Longoria was aware of appellant\u2019s tattoo prior to the March 15, 2008 encounter, but did not observe the tattoo from a distance of less than 13 feet; 4) that neither officer knew who wrote the police report and that the report did not mention any indentation on the driver\u2019s face; and 5) that Longoria had previously testified that the Explorer struck the police vehicle a second time on 95 south, causing more damage than the first impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">After a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion, the trial court overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\u201cIn making a <em>Brady </em>challenge, \u2018[a] defendant cannot simply allege the presence of favorable material and win reversal of his conviction. Rather, [he] must <em>prove </em>the favorable character of evidence he claims has been improperly suppressed. Speculative allegations are not adequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Currie v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 58, 67, 515 S.E.2d 335, 340 (1999) (quoting <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 510, 526, 446 S.E.2d 451, 461 (1994)). \u201c[A] constitutional error occurs, and the conviction must be reversed, only if the evidence is material in the sense that its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3381, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">\u201cA <em>Brady </em>violation occurs when the government fails to disclose evidence materially favorable to the accused.\u201d <em>Youngblood v. West Virginia, </em>547 U.S. 867, 869, 126 S.Ct. 2188, 2190, 165 L.Ed.2d 269 (2006) (citing <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)). The United States Supreme Court has held that <em>Brady </em>obligations extend not only to exculpatory evidence, but also to impeachment evidence, <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 676, 105 S.Ct. at 3380, and that a <em>Brady </em>violation exists even when the government fails to divulge evidence that is \u201cknown only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>514 U.S. 419, 438, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1568, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). \u201c[T]he individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 115 S.Ct. at 1567.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">\u201cThere are three components of a true <em>Brady </em>violation: The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1948, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Evidence is material \u201c \u2018if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 119 S.Ct. at 1948 (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383). However, it is not necessary to demonstrate \u201cby a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. at 1566. A conviction must be reversed if the accused shows \u201cthat the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 115 S.Ct. at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In this case, four of the five pieces of non-disclosed information mentioned by appellant were either discovered during the trial or could have been secured had appellant exercised reasonable diligence. Only the first piece of evidence\u2014the document bearing Jeremy Venable\u2019s name\u2014became available to appellant after the conclusion of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Appellant complains that Officers Longoria and Bagent gave inconsistent testimony as to the location of the indentation on his face, that neither officer knew who wrote the police report, and that the police report contained no reference to any indentation on the driver\u2019s face. It is undisputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>these pieces of information were not disclosed to appellant. However, none of this results in a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Once the trial was in progress, the officers\u2019 testimony-revealed inconsistencies as to the location of the indentation on appellant\u2019s face. Appellant had the opportunity to explore the inconsistency, as well as the omission of the indentation in the police report, through cross-examination, and he did so. Appellant\u2019s mother testified, and appellant did not take that opportunity to explore whether his twin brother had an indentation on his face. Therefore, appellant suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Appellant also argues that he was prejudiced by Officer Longoria\u2019s testimony at trial that although Longoria was aware of appellant\u2019s tattoo prior to their encounter on March 15, 2008, he did not observe it that night. This argument is without merit. Longoria\u2019s testimony at trial revealed this fact, and again, appellant had the opportunity to cross-examine Longoria. Appellant fully explored any alleged weaknesses in Longoria\u2019s testimony. Further, appellant also had the opportunity to ask his mother whether his twin had a tattoo. His failure to do so does not constitute trial court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Appellant cites <em>Bowman v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 130, 445 S.E.2d 110 (1994), to support his position. However, <em>Bowman </em>is distinguished on its facts. The arresting officer, in his police report, described the suspect as approximately five-foot-eight, 150 pounds. The same officer, who had seen appellant approximately 12 times, identified appellant in a photo lineup. At the time of the offense, appellant weighed approximately 194 pounds and was six feet two inches. At trial, Bowman contended this discrepancy in height and weight affected the officer\u2019s credibility and was exculpatory. Appellant moved for a dismissal based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The Supreme Court of Virginia determined that Bowman learned of the discrepancies in the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence during trial and was allowed to cross-examine the officer on that issue. Thus, the Court concluded Bowman was able to effectively challenge the credibility of the officer. No <em>Brady </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>violation occurred as to credibility. However, the Court reached a different conclusion as to Bowman\u2019s argument concerning mistaken identity. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 445 S.E.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The Court indicated the drug sale occurred late at night, the officer was in Bowman\u2019s presence for only five or six minutes, and the photo identification was made over 30 days after the sale. In addition to a size discrepancy, the undisclosed report indicated Bowman had two scars on his face. The <em>Bowman </em>Court concluded these facts suggested a \u201cpossibility of mistaken identity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Supreme Court of Virginia concluded Bowman \u201creasonably may have taken different and potentially significant actions which could have strengthened [his] defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134-35, 445 S.E.2d at 112. Essentially, the Court in <em>Bowman </em>reviewed the facts and determined there was a possibility of mistaken identity. Here, however, there is no such possibility that the two officers confused appellant with his twin brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Officer Longoria did not need a photo lineup to identify appellant. He knew him from a previous encounter and knew him by name. He identified appellant at the scene. Officer Bagent also saw appellant and identified him. The officers saw appellant in a well-lit parking lot from less than 13 feet away. The room registered to appellant contained numerous photos of appellant, not his twin brother. The record further \u25a0revealed the two police officers had the opportunity to view photos of appellant and his twin and continued to identify appellant as the suspect. Further, appellant\u2019s mother placed appellant, not his twin, at the motel on the night of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The inconsistent testimony as to the location of the indentation on appellant\u2019s face, which officer wrote the police report, and the number of impacts to the police vehicle are credibility issues resolved by <em>Bowman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Longoria indicated he knew appellant had a tattoo on his neck but he could not testify as to whether he saw it that night. This fact does not support the conclusion that Longoria confused appellant with his twin. No evidence suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the twin was in the vicinity. To the contrary, appellant\u2019s mother testified the twin was a fugitive for about five years, but that she saw appellant at the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Unlike <em>Bowman, </em>where his conviction was based on the officer\u2019s sole testimony, here two officers identified appellant without hesitation and appellant\u2019s mother placed him at the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Furthermore, our recent decision in <em>Bly v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 1, 10, 682 S.E.2d 556, 561 (2009), controls. In <em>Bly, </em>we held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201cAbsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Caprino v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 181, 184, 670 S.E.2d 36, 37-38 (2008) (quoting <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977)); <em>see Groves v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 57, 61-62, 646 S.E.2d 28, 30 (2007) (\u201cThis means the \u2018judge is presumed to know the law and apply it correctly in each case.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Crest v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 165, 172 n. 3, 578 S.E.2d 88, 91 n. 3 (2003))).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">As in <em>Bly, </em>appellant points to no such evidence to rebut this presumption. \u201cThus, for purposes of this appeal, we presume the trial court correctly applied the principles dictated by <em>Brady </em>and made a factual determination that [appellant] was not prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s nondisclosure of the [non-disclosed] information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 682 S.E.2d at 561. <em>See Deville v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 754, 757-58, 627 S.E.2d 530, 532 (2006) (explaining that the trial court\u2019s \u201cno prejudice\u201d determination under <em>Brady, </em>following appellant\u2019s bench trial, was a factual finding).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">We concluded in <em>Bly,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">Accordingly, here, as in <em>Deville, </em>where \u201ca trial judge, sitting as \u2018both trier of fact and arbiter of law,\u2019 finds the <em>Brady </em>evidence inconsequential, there can be \u2018no logical possibility\u2019 that its earlier disclosure \u201cwould have altered the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757-58, 627 S.E.2d at 532 (quoting <em>Stroik v. State, </em>671 A.2d 1335, 1340 (Del.1996)). That is because, \u201c[u]nder such circumstances, we need not hypothesize how a reasonable jury would likely have reacted to the new information. We know with certitude, from the factfinder himself, that the outcome of the proceeding would not have been different had the evidence been disclosed earlier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, as further explained in <em>Deville, </em>\u201ca trial court cannot foreclose appellate review by an <em>ipse dixit </em>denial of prejudice. Just as the original finding of guilt must fail if no \u2018rational trier of fact\u2019 could have made such a finding, so too the factual finding of no prejudice should be set aside if patently unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8l\"><em>Bly, </em>55 Va.App. at 11, 682 S.E.2d at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As in <em>Bly, </em>from our review of the record, we cannot say the trial judge\u2019s presumptive finding of no prejudice was patently unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Appellant also assigns much importance to the fact that Officer Longoria had previously testified at the appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing that the Explorer struck the police vehicle a second time on 95 south, causing more damage than the first impact. Again, this information emerged during Longoria\u2019s trial testimony, and appellant was able to explore this inconsistency by way of his cross-examination. Further, to the extent that the preliminary hearing testimony showed an inconsistency, appellant had access to that transcript as much as the Commonwealth did. Indeed, appellant and his counsel were present at the preliminary hearing and had the opportunity to hear Longoria\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Each of these aforementioned pieces of information came to light during the course of appellant\u2019s trial. Appellant could have discovered some of this evidence himself. Further, appellant had the opportunity to question and impeach the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses with this information through cross-examination. He also referred to these discrepancies in his closing argument. Appellant therefore suffered no prejudice. Appellant did not claim surprise, did not ask for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>continuance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and had an adequate opportunity to explore any inconsistencies, so no harm resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Finally, appellant contends the trial judge should have granted his motion for a new trial based on the fact that police recovered a document from Room 150 of the motel bearing the name of Jeremy Venable. This information was admittedly not disclosed to appellant until after his trial. However, the information is neither relevant nor exculpatory. The issue of a possible mistaken identity involved only appellant and his twin brother, Tyrone Coley. Appellant never advanced any theory that Jeremy Venable was the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Furthermore, police did not recover Venable\u2019s identification, mail, or other documents indicating that he had been in Room 150. The document was simply a piece of paper with Venable\u2019s name, Richmond City Jail number, tier number, and jail address. This does not support a theory that Venable was driving the Explorer. Its exculpatory value is questionable, and the document is certainly not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Finally, the Commonwealth\u2019s other evidence is so overwhelming that the nondisclosure of this piece of information did not prejudice appellant. <em>See generally Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 477, 487, 500 S.E.2d 219, 224 (1998). In <em>Jefferson, </em>the Commonwealth did not disclose a statement from an eyewitness to a shooting that she could not see without her glasses. <em>See id. </em>at 481, 500 S.E.2d at 221. However, there were three other eyewitnesses who testified that they saw the defendant shoot the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 500 S.E.2d at 222. This Court ruled that faced with such overwhelming evidence of guilt, there was nothing in the record to show that the nondisclosed information was prejudicial or material to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 488, 500 S.E.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Likewise, in this case, Officers Longoria and Bagent determined that appellant was the registered guest of Room 150. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>They then observed the Explorer leave the motel parking lot, and they followed the vehicle to a well-lit parking lot at a gas station. Both officers saw the driver, and Longoria recognized the driver as appellant. When officers later searched the motel room, they discovered photographs of appellant posing with his friends. The evidence against appellant was so strong that the nondisclosure of a piece of paper bearing Jeremy Venable\u2019s name caused no harm or prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Commonwealth failed to disclose evidence to which appellant was entitled. However, this nondisclosure caused no prejudice to appellant and did not undermine confidence in the outcome of his trial. Therefore, appellant was not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant a new trial. We therefore affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\">. At trial, Longoria testified that he did not recall testifying at preliminary hearing that the Explorer did more damage the second time it hit the police vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\">. <em>See generally Frye v.
