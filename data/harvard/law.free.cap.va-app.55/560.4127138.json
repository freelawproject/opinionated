Trent for unemployment benefits under Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2) because her employer fired her for misconduct. Trent appealed the VEC decision to the circuit court, which vacated the denial order and reinstated the benefits. Because the circuit court exceeded its authority in doing so, we reverse and enter final judgment affirming the VEC decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Like the circuit court, we must \u201cconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding by the Commission.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Alarm Svcs. v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>24 Va.App. 377, 383, 482 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1997) (quoting <em>Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n v. Peninsula Emergency Physicians, Inc., 4 </em>Va.App. 621, 626, 359 S.E.2d 552, 554 (1987)). \u201cIf the commission\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence, they are binding on appeal.\u201d <em>McNamara v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>54 Va.App. 616, 624, 681 S.E.2d 67, 70 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The VEC record shows that Trent worked as a store manager for 7-Eleven, Inc. One of 7-Eleven\u2019s workplace rules permitted employees to pay for products consumed while on duty through a payroll deduction. This \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule, as it was known, had specific limitations: \u201cThe Grocery Bill may only be used to purchase products that are consumed while the employee is on duty.\u201d The rule specifically prohibited using the \u201cGrocery Bill\u201d to purchase alcohol, lottery and lotto tickets, gasoline, money orders, and any prepaid items such as phone cards, Internet cards, and gift cards. As the VEC explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a mechanism to purchase food they may then eat while on duty. Other activities, for example, drinking, smoking, driving a vehicle, talking on the telephone, using the Internet, etc., are not allowed while on duty, and no such mechanism is provided to allow employees to purchase those items through payroll deduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Trent was familiar with the \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule and, because she was a store manager, was responsible for enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">A regional supervisor suspected Trent of violating the \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule. He ordered an audit of the store\u2019s surveillance videotape and discovered that Trent had violated the rule by using the \u201cGrocery Bill\u201d to purchase a prepaid phone card while on duty. After giving Trent an opportunity to explain herself, 7-Eleven fired her for this violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Trent filed a claim for unemployment benefits with the VEC. She acknowledged that 7-Eleven fired her for violating the \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule, but argued she should still be eligible for benefits because the rule was \u201cnot reasonably designed to protect the legitimate business interests of the employer.\u201d She also claimed 7-Eleven inconsistently enforced the rule and should have issued a warning upon discovering her first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The VEC disagreed with each of Trent\u2019s arguments. Examining the \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule in the context of the operation of a convenience store like 7-Eleven, the VEC found 7-Eleven had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">a legitimate business interest in regulating the activities of its employees during their scheduled work shifts. Regularly scheduled meal breaks at a convenience store, such as the one at issue in this case, may not be practical. Employees may have to take their meals in shorter breaks in between waiting on customers. The employer\u2019s policy furthers the employer\u2019s interest in ensuring that employees are able to take what sustenance is necessary during the workday. To do so, the employer allows employees the convenience of not having to have cash on hand to make such purchases and to use, instead, a deduction from their paycheck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">However, the types of purchases that are not permitted would represent activities that the employer would have a legitimate business interest in prohibiting while at work. Such activities would impair or interfere with the employees\u2019 ability to perform their duties____An equally important requirement under the policy is that employees consume the products they purchase by payroll deduction \u201cwhile on duty.\u201d Alcohol, cigarettes, and phone cards, are products which the employer would have a definite business interest in prohibiting employees from \u201cconsuming\u201d at work, regardless of their value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">The purchase of a telephone card, to be \u201cconsumed\u201d while on duty could only entail the use of that card while on duty. The fact that the claimant testified she had no intention of using that card while on duty does not help her case, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>purchasing a product no[t] for her own consumption at work was also a violation of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">After finding Trent \u201cknew and understood the policy,\u201d the VEC held 7-Eleven had \u201cmade out a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The VEC then addressed Trent\u2019s mitigation arguments. No evidence proved by a preponderance, the VEC found, that 7-Eleven failed to enforce the rule consistently. And nothing in the \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule prohibited 7-Eleven from enforcing it by terminating, rather than warning, employees upon discovery of the first offense. For these reasons, the VEC denied Trent\u2019s claim for unemployment benefits under Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Trent appealed to the circuit court seeking judicial review of the VEC decision denying her unemployment benefits. The circuit court held Trent \u201cdid violate a company rule\u201d but the VEC erred in enforcing it because \u201cthe record is devoid of evidence from the employer as to what legitimate business interest the rule serves.\u201d The court then concluded: \u201cAlthough the Commission offered some business interest protected by the rule, the Commission\u2019s function is not to provide the business justification, but rather, to evaluate whatever business justification is provided, which in this case was absent.\u201d Given its holding, the circuit court did not address whether the VEC properly rejected Trent\u2019s mitigation arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">A. <em>Standard of Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqbQ\">By statute, \u201cthe findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be confined to questions of law.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-625(A). This statutory standard of judicial review does not invite a reviewing court to examine the administrative record <em>de novo </em>and to reweigh the possible inferences that could be drawn from it. Instead, a court can overturn VEC factfinding \u201conly if, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Craft v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>8 Va.App. 607, 609, 383 S.E.2d 271, 273 (1989) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). This deferential standard applies not only to the historical facts themselves, but also to the inferences implicated by those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Equally important, a reviewing court cannot \u201csubstitute its own judgment for the agency\u2019s on matters committed by statute to the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Boone v. Harrison, </em>52 Va.App. 53, 62, 660 S.E.2d 704, 708 (2008). Instead, \u201cwhen the appellant challenges a judgment call on a topic on which \u2018the agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly,\u2019 we will overturn the decision only if it can be fairly characterized as \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 and thus a \u2018clear abuse of delegated discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cThis standard recognizes the larger premise that, before any legal question can be answered, an <em>a priori </em>question must first be asked\u2014who has the authority to decide. It is the one question that precedes all others.\u201d <em>Boone, </em>52 Va.App. at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">B. <em>Misconduct Bar to Unemployment Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On appeal, the VEC argues the circuit court erred as a matter of law in reversing its finding that 7-Eleven discharged Trent for misconduct. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The legislature intended unemployment benefits to be paid only to those who find themselves unemployed \u201cwithout fault on their part.\u201d <em>Israel v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Va.App. 169, 172, 372 S.E.2d 207, 209 (1988) (citation omitted). Furthering this policy goal, Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(a) prohibits benefits \u201cif the Commission finds such individual is unemployed because he has been discharged for misconduct connected with his work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Among other things, misconduct involves an intentional violation of \u201ca company rule reasonably designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>protect the legitimate business interests\u201d of the employer. <em>Brady v. Human Res. Inst., </em>231 Va. 28, 32, 340 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1986) (quoting <em>Branch v. Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>219 Va. 609, 611, 249 S.E.2d 180, 182 (1978)). The very adoption of a rule by an employer \u201cdefines the specific behavior considered to harm or to further the employer\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n v. Gantt, </em>7 Va.App. 631, 634, 376 S.E.2d 808, 811, aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, 9 Va.App. 225, 385 S.E.2d 247 (1989). <em>\u201cBy definition, </em>a violation of that rule disregards those interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The employer\u2019s rule, of course, must advance \u201clegitimate\u201d business interests. <em>Brady, </em>231 Va. at 32, 340 S.E.2d at 799 (citation omitted). To be legitimate, however, an employer\u2019s rule need not be a model of workplace governance or aspire to what some might view as best business practices. It need only be a reasonable effort by an employer to manage its workforce and to enforce its own expectations of workplace order. In this context, legitimate simply means <em>not </em>illegitimate. A rule is illegitimate when it appears to be a pretextual policy used by an employer as a subterfuge for firing employees without incurring the collateral costs associated with unemployment benefits. <em>See Schmidgall v. FilmTec Corp., </em>644 N.W.2d 801, 805 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (Minn.2002) (holding the employer\u2019s rule was not \u201cfacially unreasonable\u201d or \u201cused to circumvent an employer\u2019s legal obligations\u201d); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. U.C.C., </em>191 Va. 812, 822, 63 S.E.2d 28, 32 (1951) (finding the Minnesota unemployment compensation statute \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as its Virginia counterpart).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Consistent with these principles, the VEC found 7-Eleven\u2019s \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule served legitimate business interests. The rule governed employees consuming store products <em>while on duty </em>and paying for them through a payroll deduction. The legitimacy of 7-Eleven\u2019s interest in limiting the scope of the rule is obvious: Some products (like alcohol, tobacco, phone cards, and the like) should <em>not </em>be consumed while an employee is on duty and, thus, should not be paid for through the payroll deduction system. Nothing in the text of the \u201cEmployee Purchases\u201d rule or in its application suggested 7-Eleven used the rule as a subterfuge for cutting off a discharged employee\u2019s right to unemployment benefits. <em>See generally </em>Code \u00a7 60.2-529 (factoring employer\u2019s claim experience into its applicable unemployment tax rate).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Because the VEC has statutory authority \u201cto draw reasonable inferences from the evidence,\u201d <em>McNamara, </em>54 Va.App. at 626, 681 S.E.2d at 72, the VEC may infer the legitimacy of the employer\u2019s interest from an examination of the policy itself. Inferences, after all, \u201care elemental ingredients of the fact finding process.\u201d <em>Agee v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 123, 129, 578 S.E.2d 68, 70 (2003) (citation omitted). \u201cAn inference ... permits a finder of fact to conclude the existence of one fact from the proof of one or more other facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reviewing court can reverse such factfinding \u201conly if, in considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Craft, </em>8 Va.App. at 609, 383 S.E.2d at 273 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). No such showing has been made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">C. <em>Trent\u2019s Mitigation Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Trent argues the circuit court, even if it erred in finding no misconduct, still reached the right result because the VEC erroneously failed to credit her evidence of mitigation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">If an employer presents <em>prima facie </em>evidence of misconduct, the burden shifts to the claimant to prove \u201cdr<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>cumstances in mitigation of such conduct.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>219 Va. at 611-12, 249 S.E.2d at 182. <em>See also Gantt, </em>7 Va.App. at 635, 376 S.E.2d at 811. \u201cEvidence of mitigation may appear in many forms which, singly or in combination, to some degree explain or justify the employee\u2019s conduct. Various factors to be considered may include: the importance of the business interest at risk; the nature and purpose of the rule; prior enforcement of the rule; good cause to justify the violation; and consistency with other rules.\u201d <em>Gantt, </em>7 Va.App. at 635, 376 S.E.2d at 811. Absent proof of circumstances in mitigation, established to the satisfaction of the factfinder, the employee is \u201cdisqualified for benefits.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>219 Va. at 611-12, 249 S.E.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Though Trent claimed 7-Eleven applied the rule inconsistently, the VEC found the allegation unpersuasive because \u201cshe provided no names of any employees who had violated the policy, and she admitted no managers she knew of had purchased prepaid phone cards through payroll deduction.\u201d The record fully supports this finding. Trent also argued she should have merely been warned for the first offense rather than fired. Yet nothing in the Unemployment Compensation Act or our precedent requires an employer to punish the first violation of a workplace rule with a mere warning rather than, as the 7-Eleven policy permits, a discharge. For these reasons, the VEC did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Trent\u2019s mitigation defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The circuit court erred in vacating the VEC\u2019s order denying Trent\u2019s claim for unemployment benefits. The administrative record provides ample support for the VEC\u2019s findings that Trent violated a legitimate workplace rule and that no mitigation circumstances excused the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-5\">. <em>See also Caterpillar, Inc. v.
