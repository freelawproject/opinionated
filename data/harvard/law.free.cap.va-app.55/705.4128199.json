PETTY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Husband, Gary M. Kotara, appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County denying his motion to terminate that court\u2019s jurisdiction over modification of spousal support to his wife. We determined that we did not have jurisdiction to reach the substantive issues husband raised because the order he appealed from was neither a final order of the trial court nor an appealable interlocutory order. <em>Kotara v. Kotara, </em>No. 0290-09-4, 2009 WL 3568665 (Va.Ct.App. Nov. 3, 2009). Accordingly, we dismissed his appeal. We also entered an award of attorney\u2019s fees in favor of wife, Kathleen M. Kotara, for fees incurred in the defense of the appeal. Husband petitioned for panel rehearing on the issue of the propriety of the attorney\u2019s fees award. We granted his petition, stayed the mandate, and ordered the parties to brief the following question: \u201cWhat, if any, authority does this Court have to award attorney\u2019s fees when it has determined that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that this Court has the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in cases over which we do not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">This Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, <em>de Haan v. de Haan, </em>54 Va.App. 428, 436, 680 S.E.2d 297, 301 (2009), and, of course, we must have subject matter jurisdiction over a case before considering its merits, <em>Comcast of Chesterfield County, Inc. v. Bd. of Supers., </em>277 Va. 293, 299, 672 S.E.2d 870, 872 (2009). We possess subject matter jurisdiction over only those classes of cases specified by statute. <em>Canova Elec. Contracting, Inc. v. LMI Ins. Co., </em>22 Va.App. 595, 599, 471 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1996). These cases include domestic relations matters by virtue of Code \u00a7 17.1-405(3), which allows an appeal of right to this Court from \u201c[a]ny final judgment, order, or decree of a circuit court involving ... divorce\u201d and \u201c[a]ny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>interlocutory decree or order entered in any of the cases listed in this section [including divorce] (i) granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction or (ii) adjudicating the principles of a cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Husband argues that \u201cthe absence of jurisdiction over the appeal necessarily means that [this Court] does not have jurisdiction to award attorneys [sic] fees absent the express statutory authority to do so.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Supplemental Br. at 1. In support of his argument, husband relies upon <em>Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev. v. Donald, </em>251 Va. 227, 467 S.E.2d 803 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Husband\u2019s reliance on <em>Donald </em>is, however, misplaced. <em>Donald </em>involved a petition alleging that Donald\u2019s children were subject to abuse or neglect that originated in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, and was appealed for a <em>de novo </em>trial in the circuit court, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-132, - 136, and -296. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 467 S.E.2d at 804. The County, however, failed to appeal the district court\u2019s decision in a timely manner, and the circuit court dismissed the County\u2019s appeal. In the same order, the circuit court denied Donald\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 228, 467 S.E.2d at 804. Donald appealed, and this Court remanded the case to the circuit court \u201cfor determination of reasonable attorney fees to be fixed together with costs.\u201d <em>Donald v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>20 Va.App. 155, 162, 455 S.E.2d 740, 744 (1995) (en banc). Our Supreme Court reversed that decision, and held that the circuit court had no authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in that case. <em>Donald, </em>251 Va. at 228-29, 467 S.E.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on its reading of the statutes governing procedure in the district courts. According to Code \u00a7 16.1-296, the circuit court has \u201call the powers and authority granted by Chapter 11 to the district courts\u201d in cases that originate in the district court and are later appealed for a <em>de novo </em>trial in the circuit court. Thus, our Supreme Court reasoned, the circuit court had the same authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in cases that originated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the district court as the district court had. However, Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19 limits that authority to cases that are \u201cproperly before the court.\u201d <em>Donald, </em>251 Va. at 229, 467 S.E.2d at 804. Accordingly, our Supreme Court held that because the <em>de novo </em>appeal was not filed in a timely manner, the case was not \u201cproperly before\u201d the circuit court and the circuit court therefore did not have authority to award attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 229-30, 467 S.E.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Unlike <em>Donald, </em>this case involved a divorce and an award of spousal support under Title 20 of the Code. The General Assembly has empowered courts to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs in divorce cases. <em>See Tyszcenko v. Donatelli, </em>53 Va.App. 209, 222, 670 S.E.2d 49, 56 (2008). Code \u00a7 20-99(5) states that \u201c[c]osts may be awarded to either party as equity and justice may require.\u201d As used in this statute, the term \u201ccosts\u201d includes attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Tyszcenko, </em>53 Va.App. at 222, 670 S.E.2d at 56. Finally, this express grant of authority to award attorney\u2019s fees does not contain the language the Court relied upon in deciding <em>Donald, </em>which limits the district court\u2019s authority to award fees to cases \u201cproperly before the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">We see no reason why the authority of this Court to award attorney\u2019s fees should be limited to those cases over which we have subject matter jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-405. We are frequently called upon to determine whether a case has, in fact, been appealed from a final order or an appealable interlocutory order, and thus determine whether we have jurisdiction over a particular appeal. We are able to do so because \u201ca court has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 292 n. 57, 67 S.Ct. 677, 695, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). And, when questions of jurisdiction arise, a court has a \u201cduty to permit argument and to take the time required for such consideration as it might need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 67 S.Ct. at 695. In these situations, a court\u2019s authority to hear and adjudicate the question of jurisdiction arises \u201cfrom the necessity of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 67 S.Ct. at 695. Thus, the resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>these questions does not come until the parties have briefed and argued the issue before us, often causing an appellee to incur significant attorney\u2019s fees as a result of an appellant\u2019s imprudent decision to appeal a case prematurely.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">When the husband filed his notice of appeal, we acquired personal jurisdiction over the parties. <em>Woody v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 188, 196, 670 S.E.2d 39, 43 (2008). And, this Court, by necessity, had subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether the order from which husband appealed was a final order or an appealable interlocutory order. As a result, we had the authority to enter orders relating to the disposition of the case\u2014including, according to Code \u00a7 20-99(5)\u2014the authority to enter an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a divorce case pending before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Because this Court has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction, and Code \u00a7 20-99(5) empowers courts in which divorce cases are pending to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas equity and justice may require,\u201d we hold that we had the authority to enter an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Accordingly, the original panel decision is reinstated and we remand the case to the trial court for a determination of the amount to be awarded to wife for the attorney\u2019s fees she incurred in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
