There is no allegation that this was the second or third offence, and the amount of the fine imposed would indicate that it was the first offence.</p> <opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b91-5\" pgmap=\"91\">Scholfield, J.:</author> <p id=\"AHt\" pgmap=\"91\">The indictment and conviction in this case were for a mere misdemeanor.
