An agreement under seal between the owners of adjoining premises, whereby one is to build a party wall, one-half on the ground of each, for building purposes, and the other is to pay for one-half the cost of its construction when he uses the same, or any part thereof, for a building upon his premises, when executed gives to each of the parties an easement on the lot of the other for the purpose of support of their respective buildings, which becomes appurtenant to their several estates, and as such passes to their respective assignees by any mode of conveyance that passes the title to the land itself.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b11-10\" pgmap=\"11\">2.

It is further agreed that the wall shall be ledged out four inches at each resting for the floor joists of each and every story of said building. It is also further agreed that the party of the second part will be to the expense of one-half of all the area walls, both front and rear, upon like conditions of the foregoing contract for building walls. It is also further agreed that all the covenants and agreements herein contained shall be binding upon each party, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and grantees of the said parties of the first and second part, and shall be so construed as to run with the land.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-6\" pgmap=\"13\">\u201cIn witness whereof the said parties have hereunto set their hands and seals, the day and year above written.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-7\" pgmap=\"13\">Jos.

[seal.] \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ah\" pgmap=\"14\">This agreement was recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Cook county, August 2, 1872. Ullman thereupon proceeded to build upon his own lot, and in doing so erected a party wall, in accordance with the above agreement, one-half of which was upon his own lot and one-half upon Butler\u2019s lot. After the above agreement was made and recorded, Butler sold and conveyed his lot to Eben F. Runyan, who sold and conveyed it to John J. Douglas. April 6, 1875, Douglas borrowed $10,000 of Roche, the appellant, for which he gave his note, due in ten years, with interest at nine per cent per annum, payable semi-annually. To secure this note, Douglas gave a trust deed of the Butler lot to Murray F. Tuley, dated April 6, 1875. About June 1, 1876, Douglas commenced the erection of a building on the Butler lot, and made use of the party wall for the west wall of his building. The building erected by Douglas was of the same height and length as the party wall. About September 1, 1876, Douglas abandoned work upon the building. At this time the walls were up, the roof on and the joists set, but there were no floors or stairs, doors or windows, plastering or partitions. The building remained in this condition until December 14, 1876, when the bill in this ease was filed.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\" pgmap=\"14(137) 15(182)\">The bill sets forth substantially the foregoing facts, and the further fact that Ullman had not been paid one-half the value of the party wall, and asks to have the defendants restrained from any further use of the wall until such payment was made. A temporary injunction was granted, according t\u00f3 the prayer of the bill. In the meantime Douglas had defaulted in his interest on the note to Roche, who elected to declare the whole amount of principal and interest to be due and payable, and directed Tuley to advertise and sell under the trust deed. Tuley proceeded accordingly, and on the 9th day of January, 1877, as trustee under the deed, he sold and conveyed the Butler lot to Roche. Roche took possession of the property, and in order to avoid delay in completing the building, entered into a stipulation, in pursuance of which the injunction was dissolved upon Roche giving a bond to Ullman in the penal sum of $2500, conditioned to pay Ullman whatever sum, if any, the court should decree that he should pay for said party wall, or the amount of any lien which the court should decree in favor of Ullman upon the lot or building, or any part of either, for any portion of the cost of the wall. Roche gave the bond, and the injunction was dissolved on the 28th' of February, 1877. Roche then proceeded to complete the building by laying the floors, putting in the doors and windows, and plastering the first story, and has ever since owned and occupied the premises. It was agreed that the market value of the wall, when used by Roche, was $1372.69. In February, 1881, the complainant filed a supplemental bill, setting forth the facts which had occurred subsequent to the filing of the original bill. Answers were duly filed to the original and supplemental bills.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\" pgmap=\"15\">Upon the above facts the court decreed that the covenants in the party wall agreement were binding upon Roche personally; that he was personally liable to the complainant for the value of the party wall, and interest from May 1, 1877, and that the complainant was entitled to a lien therefor upon the east half of the west half of said lot 2. A personal decree was entered against Roche, and a sale ordered in case of non-payment, as in foreclosure proceedings.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-7\" pgmap=\"15\">Messrs.

Coleman, 7 Harris, 100.</p> <opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b18-6\" pgmap=\"18\">Mr. Justice Mulkey</author> <p id=\"Ai\" pgmap=\"18\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b18-7\" pgmap=\"18(326) 19(176)\">By the agreement between Butler and Ullman the latter was authorized to build a party wall, the east half of which was to rest on Butler\u2019s part of the lot, and the west half on Ullman\u2019s, and it wTas expressly provided that when so built, Butler, upon payment of one-half the cost of its construction, should have the right to use the same, or such part of it as he might need, as a party wall for any building he might erect on his part of the lot. The legal effect of this agreement, upon its performance, was to give to each of the parties an easement on the other\u2019s lot for the purpose of support of their respective buildings, which became appurtenant to their several estates, and as such would pass to their respective assignees by any mode of conveyance that would transfer the land itself. That such would have been the effect of the agreement had it been executed on the part of Butler, is not questioned. But it is .claimed that Boche, his assignee, occupies a better position with respect to the agreement than Butler, through whom he claims,\u2014that while he may avail himself of all its benefits, he is relieved of all obligations to perform its burdens. If this be the correct view, it must be conceded it results solely from the fact the parties to the agreement had no power to impose its burdens as well as its benefits upon their assignees, for nothing can be clearer than it was their intention to do so, and it is equally clear the terms expressive of such intention are altogether appropriate and sufficient for that purpose, if, as matter of law, they had power to thus bind their assignees. The language of the agreement expressive of such intention is: \u201cIt is also further agreed, that all the covenants and agreements herein contained shall be binding upon each party, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and grantees of the said parties of the first and second part, and shall be so construed as to run with the land. \u201d There can be no mistaking the object and purpose which the parties sought to accomplish by this provision, and appellant, having bought with constructive, and doubtless actual, notice of it, must be presumed to have intentionally assumed the burdens as well as the benefits of the agreement. The duty of paying for one-half the wall being a continuing liability resting upon the owner of the lot in his character of owner, and this not having been paid at the time of appellant\u2019s purchase, it is to be presumed that in becoming a purchaser, and thus assuming the relation of owner himself, he paid less for the property by the amount of the incumbrance than he otherwise Would have done. Such being the ease, it would now be highly inequitable to permit him to enjoy the benefit of the wall without reimbursing Ullman for one-half its cost.</p> <p id=\"b19-6\" pgmap=\"19(185) 20(109)\">But outside of the equitable view here suggested, we think the law is with appellee on other grounds. While the authorities are not altogether harmonious with respect to the legal effect of covenants and agreements providing for the construction of party walls between adjacent proprietors, yet we think the decided weight of authority establishes the position that an agreement under the hands and seals of such parties, containing covenants and stipulations like those found in the instrument we are considering, will, when duly delivered and acted upon, as was done in this case, create cross-easements in the respective owners of the adjacent lots with which the covenants in the agreement will run, so as to bind all persons succeeding to the estates to which' such easements are appurtenant. This being so, it follows that Boche, in succeeding to the east half of the lot, whereby he acquired an easement in the west half, became bound for the performance of the covenant to pay one-half the cost of constructing the wall. We do not deem it necessary to enter upon a review of the \"authorities upon this subject, but will content ourselves with a reference to the following cases, which are believed to sustain the conclusion reached: Keteltas v. Penfield, 4 E. D. Smith, (N. Y.) 122; Savage v. Mason, 3 Cush. (Mass.) 504; Mame v. Cumston, 98 Mass. 317; Standish v. Lawrence, id. 111; Dorsey v. St. Louis, Alton and Terre Haute R. R. Co. 58 Ill. 68; Sterling Hydraulic Co. v. Williams, 66 id. 397; Rindge v. Baker, 57 N. Y. 209; note to Spencer\u2019s case, Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, (6th Am. ed.) 211; Weyman\u2019s Exrs. v. Ringold, 1 Bradf. 40; Giles v. Dugro, 1 Duer, 331.</p> <p id=\"b20-6\" pgmap=\"20\">The decision in Goodrich v. Lincoln, 93 Ill. 359, does not conflict with the conclusion reached in the present case.</p> <p id=\"b20-7\" pgmap=\"20\">We concede the general doctrine, as contended for by appellant\u2019s counsel, that where the relation of landlord and tenant does not exist, only such covenants as are beneficial to the estate will run with the land, but we do not regard the doctrine as applicable to' cases where adjacent proprietors have, as in the present case, so contracted as to create mutual easements upon each other\u2019s estates, and entered into covenants with respect to the same. The new relation thus created being of an intimate character, involving reciprocal duties with respect to each other\u2019s estates, may be regarded as an equivalent for the absence of tenure, so as to give effect to all covenants without regard to whether they are beneficial or onerous. However this may be, it is cl\u00e9ar the rule contended for does not seem to be applied in this class of cases.</p> <p id=\"b20-8\" pgmap=\"20\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b20-9\" pgmap=\"20\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
