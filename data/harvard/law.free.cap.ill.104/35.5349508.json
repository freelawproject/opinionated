After the return of the parties to that kingdom, and they had acquired a domicile there, a suit was brought by the husband to annul and declara the marriage void, and the proper court, having jurisdiction by the laws of that country of the subject matter and of both parties, rendered a decree declaring the marriage absolutely null and void, the effect of which there was not only to establish the nullity of the marriage, but also to annul and terminate the status of the parties arising from a defacto as well as a de jure marriage: Held, that such decree was conclusive upon the late wife in this State, and deprived her of all rights as widow or heir of her former husband.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b36-9\" pgmap=\"36\">4.

As both the parties were domiciled here at the time of its celebration, it is not important to determine whether the validity of a marriage depends upon the lex domicilii or the lex loci contractus, for whatever conclusion might be reached upon that question, the result would be the same, so far as this case is concerned. Both laws being identical, if the marriage was in conformity with either it must necessarily have been with the other also, and as it seems to have been solemnized in strict conformity with our statute regulating the subject, and as the parties were manifestly competent, under our own laws, to contract the relation, it follows, as before stated, the marriage was valid and binding.</p> <p id=\"b43-9\" pgmap=\"43(32) 44(232)\">While this marriage was clearly valid here for all purposes whatsoever, it does not follow that upon the return of the parties to the country of their nativity, and of which they were still subjects, it would or ought to be held equally valid there, for it is clearly settled by the decided weight of private international law, so called, that every State has the power to enact laws which will personally bind its citizens or subjects when sojourning in a foreign jurisdiction, provided such laws in terms profess to so bind them when thus circumstanced. It is true, such laws have no extra-territorial effect so as to authorize their enforcement in a foreign country, and may, therefore, so far as their execution is concerned, be said to remain dormant till the return of those violating them, when they will be enforced in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if their infraction had occurred within the State enacting them.

Whether the kingdom of Wurtemberg, on their return and acquiring a new domicile there, would recognize the status or relation which they had con-, tracted here, depended upon its own laws, and not upon ours. That kingdom, in 1808, adopted an ordinance or law, which was in full force at the time of the marriage in Chicago, declaring all such marriages in a foreign State, without the license of the sovereign, absolutely null and void. It was, therefore, according to the general current of authority on the subject, entirely competent for the courts of that kingdom having jurisdiction of such matters, to give effect to that law by annulling and setting aside-the marriage, upon a proper application for that purpose, which was done in this case. 1 Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, secs. 367, 368; Story on Conflict of Laws, secs. 18, 19, 21-23, 25; Wharton on Conflict of Laws, (2d ed.) sec. 207; 4 Phill. on Int.

The general rule unquestionably is, where it affirmatively appears the court of a foreign State has jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of the suit, its judgment or decree will be conclusive on the parties, their legal representatives and privies, in all countries where the matters litigated are again drawn in question, and this is particularly true with respect to judgments or decrees affecting the status of a person, for they are in the nature of judgments in rem, which are binding on the whole world.

The limitation to this rule is, that it may be shown that such judgment or decree was obtained by means of fraud, or some gross abuse of the process of the court, or flagrant departure from the ordinary course of judicial procedure, as, for instance, that a party in interest sat as a judge in the cause.

It is not sufficient, as it has often been held by this court, for the purpose of successfully assailing a transaction on the ground of fraud, to charge fraud generally; but the complaining party must state in his pleading, and prove on 'the trial, the specific acts or facts relied on as establishing fraud. That has not been done in this case. So far as we are able to discover, the trial was perfectly regular, and conducted with the utmost fairness, and we see no ground to question the jurisdiqtion of the court. The depositions of persons learned in the law of that country have been taken in this cause, and they clearly show the, several courts through which that case passed during its pendency, were, by the laws of that country, the proper tribunals to take cognizance of cases of that character in the manner it was done. And it is further shown that both parties appeared in the cause, by themselves and counsel. Hence, as before'stated, we see no ground for questioning the jurisdiction of those tribunals. We are of opinion, therefore, the decree of nullity must be given in the courts here the same effect which w'ould be given to it by the courts of the country in which it was rendered. The effect of the decree there, as we understand it, was not merely to establish conclusively the nullity of the contract of marriage, or of the marriage itself, but also to annul and terminate the status or marital relation of the parties which arises from a de facto as well as a de jwre marriage, so as to leave them in precisely the same condition as if no marriage had ever taken place between them. This being the effect of the decree there, it must be given the same effect here. Barber v. Root, 10 Mass. 260 ; Ross v. Ross, 129 id. 243; Kinnier v. Kinnier, 45 N. Y. 535; Hunt v.

Jur. 473, 474.</p> <p id=\"b48-7\" pgmap=\"48(191) 49(75)\">Such, then, being the legal operation of the decree, it follows that the appellant was not at the time of Both\u2019s death his wife, either de facto or de jure, and hence she is not his widow, for no one answers that description who was not his wife at the time of his death, and consequently she has no right, as such, to succeed to his estate. (Hood v. Hood, 110 Mass. 463.) For the same reasons it follows that the subsequent marriage between Both and Amalie was lawful and valid, and that relation having continued up to the time of his death, it results that she, and not appellant, is his lawful widow, and as such is entitled to his estate. It is true the \u201cmarriage and inheritance contract\u201d did not, upon his decease, have the effect of clothing her with legal title to the real estate in controversy, as his survivor, as it doubtless would have done had the property been situated in the kingdom of Wiirtemberg instead of here; for it is not competent for parties, here or elsewhere, by mere agreement, to change the manner of transferring real property in this State, but the agreement in question, upon his decease, operated as an equitable assignment of the estate to her, which was properly enforced by the decree in this case.

Under our laws they were competent to enter into the contract, and they did in strict conformity to all of the requirements of the laws of this State,' and it is on all hands conceded that it was valid according to our laws. All contracts lawfully made confer rights that must be enforced by our laws. Among the rights conferred by that contract was the right of the wife to dower in her husband\u2019s real estate, and to become his heir to one-half of the real estate of which he might die seized, leaving no children living, or descendants of such children. These were the vested rights she acquired by this contract, and she can not be divested of them by the contract being declared void but by the tribunals of this State. The foreign court had no power to construe and give authoritative judgment against the validity \u00f3f contracts made under our laws, and we are not bound by the decree of nullity. Had any court having competent' jurisdiction granted a divorce, then by abrogating the marriage contract she would have lost her rights to dower and heirship, because the contract was destroyed in all of its parts, and the parties absolved from its performance, and all rights under it destroyed and ended. But in this case there, was no divorce, but it was decreed, in the very teeth of our never doubted laws, to have been void. The tribunals of this State are not bound by the decree of the foreign tribunal. That government, has no pretense of power to control the title to, or the descent of, property in this State. \u25a0 As to power of controlling the rights of, and descent of, property by that kingdom, it is absolutely wanting, and it can not, under, any circumstances, control rights of persons in this State, under our laws. As well contend that had the laws of that kingdom been that none of its subjects should purchase or hold real estate without the consent of the king, and deceased had purchased this property as he did, and had died, his heirs could not inherit his property because he had not procured\" the consent of his king. I apprehend no one would contend for such a doctrine, and the effect of this case is to so hold. I am, therefore, unable to concur in the conclusion reached in this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
