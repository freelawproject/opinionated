Negligence\u2014injury from defective sidewall!,\u2014of the degree of care required of the plaintiff. The degree of care which the law requires a plaintiff to exercise while passing over a sidewalk, to entitle him to recover for an injury received from its defective condition, is ordinary care, under all the circumstances of the case. Knowledge of the condition of the walk is one of the circumstances to be considered in determining whether the plaintiff exercised ordinary care.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-11\" pgmap=\"268\">2. It can not be laid down as a legal proposition that a person traveling on the sidewalk of a city is bound to go out into the street and pass around the walk, although he knows it to be defective, especially when the defect is merely loose boards, and the walk is not palpably dangerous.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-12\" pgmap=\"268\">3. In an action against a city to recover for an injury caused by loose boards in the sidewalk, an instruction that the law required the plaintiff to show that at the time she sustained the injury she was exercising ordinary care and caution, and that if by the exercise of such care and caution she would have avoided the danger, the verdict should be for the defendant, states the law sufficiently favorable for the defendant, and removes any just cause of complaint in refusing an instruction that if the plaintiff knew of the defective condition of the walk, it was her duty to exercise a high degree of care while passing over it, and also another, that if she could have gone out into the street and around the defective sidewalk, and her failure to do so showed a want of ordinary care on her part, the jury should find for the defendant.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-13\" pgmap=\"268\">4. Pleading and evidence\u2014proof of business or occupation of one seeking to recover for personal injury resulting from, negligence\u2014wnder what averments as to special damage. In an action to recover damages sustained from a personal injury, resulting from the alleged negligence of the defendant, one count of the declaration alleged that plaintiff was hindered from transacting her business and affairs, and deprived of large gains and profits which she otherwise would have earned, and in another count, that the injuries received had a permanent effect upon her personal bodily strength and ability to make a living, and that she had been rendered unable to earn or make for herself a living, and had been deprived of large gains and profits which she otherwise would have earned: Held, that under these averments it was admissible for the plaintiff to show what was her business, and that she had been disabled from pursuing it by reason of her injuries.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b269-4\" pgmap=\"269\">5. Evidence\u2014concerning such business, and the profits arising from, it. In such case, the court permitted the plaintiff to testify that she had taught school at $50 per month, and that at the time of receiving the injury she and another lady were making arrangements to teach a select school, but on account of the injury she was compelled to give it up. She had already testified, without objection, that she had followed the business of teaching school, and that she did not suppose she could prosecute that business: Held, that the only objection to this was the witness stating what she had received, instead of what was the usual compensation for school teaching, and that that was sufficiently removed by the remark of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cIf he objects, strike it out, \u201d made on objection to her stating what she received. Such evidence went to show no more than an actual interruption of the business of school teaching. Had it gone to show the loss of the profits of a particular engagement to teach, another question would hav\u00f3 been presented.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\" pgmap=\"269\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the Third District;\u2014 heard in that court on appeal cfrom the Circuit Court of McLean county; the Hon.

One of the refused instructions asked by defendant was, that if plaintiff knew of the defective condition of the sidewalk, it was her duty to exercise a high degree of care while passing over it. The degree of care which the law required the plaintiff to exercise, was ordinary care, under all the circumstances of the ease. The plaintiff\u2019s knowledge as to the condition of the sidewalk, would be one of such circumstances to be considered by the jury in determining whether there had been the exercise of ordinary care. The court did instruct the jury that the law required plaintiff to show that at the time she sustained the injury complained of she was exercising ordinary care and caution, and that if, by the exercise of such care and caution, she w7ould have avoided the danger, they should find for the defendant. We think the instruction given stated the law upon the subject sufficiently favorable for the defendant, and that, there is no just ground of complaint in not giving the further instruction which was refused.</p> <p id=\"b273-5\" pgmap=\"273\">The tenth refused instruction told the jury, in substance, that the law required the plaintiff to go out into the street and pass around the walk, if she knew it was defective; and the eleventh, that if plaintiff could have gone out into the street and around the defective sidewalk, and if her failure to do so showed a want of ordinary care on her part, the jury should find for the defendant. Clearly, the tenth one could not be laid down as a legal proposition. (See City of Aurora v. Hillman, 90 Ill. 61.) All the law that there was embraced in the eleventh refused instruction was, that a want of ordinary care on plaintiff\u2019s part would preclude her from recovering, and the jury were so informed in an instruction which was given, as already stated. There could be no error in not repeating the instruction. The present case is quite unlike that of City of Centralia v. Krouse, 64 Ill. 19, where the sidewalk was in a palpably dangerous condition. The defect here ivas, that there were loose boards in the wralk, and plaintiff was injured by the turning up of a loose board, which caused her to fall.</p> <p id=\"b273-6\" pgmap=\"273(162) 274(361) 275(23)\">On the trial, against the objection of the defendant, the court permitted the plaintiff to testify that she had taught school at \u00a750 per month; also, that at the time of receiving the injury complained of, she and another lady were making arrangements to teach a select school, but on account of the injury she was compelled to give it up. The admission of this evidence is complained of as error, as being evidence of special damages, which should not have been received under the general averment in the declaration. The witness stated, without objection, that she had followed the business of teaching school, and that she did not suppose that she could prosecute that business. The allegation in the declaration as to special damages in the above respect is, in the first count, that plaintiff was hindered from transacting her business and affairs, and deprived of large gains and profits which she otherwise would have earned; and in the second count, that the injuries received had a permanent effect upon her personal hodily strength and ability to make a living, and that -she had been rendered unable to earn or make \u25a0 for herself a living, and had been deprived of large gains and profits which she otherwise would have earned. We think it was admissible, under these averments in the declaration, to show what was the business of the plaintiff, and that she had been disabled from, pursuing it by reason of her injuries. The testimony objected to tended to no more than this, and to give the jury some idea of the wages of school teaching. Any objection there might be in this last respect from the witness' stating 'what she had received, instead of what was the usual compensation for school teaching, was, we think, sufficiently removed by the observation of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, when, upon defendant\u2019s counsel making objection to the introduction into the record of plaintiff\u2019s statement of the amount she received, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cIf he objects, strike it out.\u201d The testimony was not as to the loss of the profits of a particular engagement for school teaching, but only that arrangements which were being made to teach a school were compelled to be given up, without any intimation as to the amount of the compensation under the arrangement, had it been perfected. The evidence went to show no more than an actual interruption of the business of school teaching. Had it gone to show the loss of the profits of a particular engagement which had been made for teaching school,' another question would have been presented,\u2014 the one appearing in City of Chicago v. O\u2019Brennan, 65 Ill. 160, a case much relied upon by appellant\u2019s counsel, where, in a similar action for injuries sustained, it was held error in the' court below to permit the plaintiff to give in evidence the fact of particular engagements by him to lecture, and the probable gains thereof, and that the plaintiff was prevented from fulfilling them by reason of the injury, and his estimates of the special loss thereby sustained. It was held that these special damages should have been set out in the declaration. The essential difference between that case and the present is obvious.</p> <p id=\"b275-6\" pgmap=\"275\">The cases of Tomlinson v. Derby, 43 Conn. 562, and Taylor v. Monroe, id. 43, seem opposed to the view we take, but we find it supported by the case of Luck v. City of Ripon, 52 Wis. 196. We prefer to follow the authority of the latter case. The judgment must he affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b275-7\" pgmap=\"275\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
