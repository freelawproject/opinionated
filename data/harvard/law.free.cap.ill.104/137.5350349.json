Gardner, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-8\" pgmap=\"138(220) 139(78)\">The facts material-, to a proper: understanding of this case are, in substance, as follows: On the 10th of May, 1871, Eben F. Eunyan, being the owner in fee of a certain lot of ground in Chicago, Cook county, mortgaged the same to Iza H. Scribner, to secure a loan of $2000, the mortgage being filed in the proper office for record the day it was executed. On the 12th of July-following, for the consideration of $7000, Eunyan sold, and conveyed by warranty deed, the same property to Mason B. Loomis, the appellee, the latter having constructive, but no actual, knowledge of the Scribner mortgage. Loomis paid $500 cash on his purchase, and executed to Eunyan thirteen notes, of $500 each, payable at intervals of six months, the last maturing on July 12, 1878. These \u2022notes were secured by a deed of trust on the purchased property. Loomis took possession of the premises at the time of his purchase, and occupied the same until May 1, 1875, having in the meantime paid the first six of said notes. On the day last mentioned, for the consideration of $7500, Loomis sold, and reconveyed by warranty deed, the property to Eunyan, the latter agreeing, in part payment of the consideration, to take up and surrender to Loomis the remaining seven notes, which were then outstanding in the hands of other parties, and this stipulation was set forth in the conveyance, which\" was. duly recorded about the date of its execution; The\" seventh and eighth notes were taken up and surrendered by Eunyan in pursuance of the stipulation in the deed. The remaining five notes had already been transferred by Eunyan to Lazarus Silverman, who subsequently transferred them, for value, to L. C. Paine Freer.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\" pgmap=\"139(281) 140(46)\">On the 23d of June, 1876, Eunyan contracted and sold the premises in question to Silverman, but at the instance of the latter the conveyance was made to Bernhard Moos, who subsequently, on the 2d of April, 1879, by quitclaim, deed, conveyed the property to Silverman, the real purchaser. By a stipulation .in the deed from Eunyan to Moos, the grantee covenanted and agreed, as a' part of the .consideration, to take up and surrender to Loomis the remaining notes given by the latter to Eunyan on his original purchase, which were then outstanding in the hands of Freer. Silverman took up the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth of these notes, as provided in the deed, on his purchase from Eunyan, but declined to surrender them to Loomis, on the ground he had been compelled to redeem from a sale under the Scribner mortgage, at an expense of $2655.91, which he claims appellee is bound to make good to him by reason of his covenant against incumbrances in his deed of reconveyance to Eunyan, as heretofore stated. Appellee denying, all liability on. account of his covenants in that deed, suits at law were commenced against him by Silverman on the four notes last mentioned, and by Freer on the thirteenth of said notes, and the present bill was filed by appellee to enjoin these suits. On the hearing, the circuit court of Cook county rendered a decree perpetually enjoining Silverman from further prosecuting his suit upon the four notes taken up by him, and directing that the same be canceled and delivered to Loomis within ten days, and that Silverman, within thirty days,\u2018pay the amount of the thirteenth note to Freer, arid upon such payment surrender the said note, canceled, to Loomis. From this decree Silverman appealed to the Appellate Court for the First District, where the same was affirmed, and Silverman brings the case to this court by appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-6\" pgmap=\"140\">Mr. Frank J.

The circuit court held, and we think properly, that the conveyance and reconveyance of the premises between Eunyan and Loomis by operation of law- canceled or extinguished the covenants in the latter\u2019s deed as to all incumbrances covered by Runyan\u2019s deed to Loomis. The object of the parties in having a covenant against incumbrances inserted in appellee\u2019s deed upon his reconveyance to Eunyan, was doubtless to assure the property to the latter in the same condition it was in when conveyed by Eunyan \u25a0 to Loomis, and nothing more; and to give it a wider range, by extending it to matters covered by Runyan\u2019s covenants to Loomis, would be to make the parties severally, liable to each other on account of the same incumbrance. The enforcement of this liability by legal proceedings would give rise to circuity of action, and an unnecessary and useless expenditure of money in vexatious litigation, which the law ever abhors. To avoid these consequences, the law wisely construes such covenants as mutually canceling each other, so that no action can be maintained on them by either of the parties or their assignees. The assignee of a grantee can not recover on a covenant made by the latter\u2019s grantor, where, by reason of matters apparent upon the record of deeds in the line of his title at the time of the assignee\u2019s purchase, the grantee himself could not recover. The assignee, in such.,case, occupies no better position than the original covenantee through whom he claims.</p> <p id=\"b142-6\" pgmap=\"142\">Silverman, having purchased with constructive notice of these two deeds, is conclusively presumed to have known and understood at the time of his purchase their legal effect, and he has no cause, therefore, to complain. The view here presented we understand to be fully sustained by well recognized legal principles. 2 Coke on Littleton, sec. 743; Brown v. Metz, 33 Ill. 339; Kellogg v. Wood, 4 Paige, 578.</p> <p id=\"b142-7\" pgmap=\"142\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b142-8\" pgmap=\"142\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
