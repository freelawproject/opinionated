Limitations\u2014act of 1839\u2014what is color of title. A quitclaim deed for a parcel of ground which includes a strip claimed adversely by another party, is color of title to such strip, under the seven years Limitation law, and possession and payment of taxes thereon, under such claim and color of title, for seven successive years, will be a bar to a recovery in ejectment under such adverse claim or title.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-9\" pgmap=\"235\">2. Same\u2014possession not lost by use in others subordinate to the party claiming. The use of a strip of land adjoining a party\u2019s lot, by the claimant\u2019s permission, in connection with other property adjoining it, as a common driveway by others, and also by himself, does not impair such claimant\u2019s possession under the Limitation law. In such case the use of the strip is not adverse, but strictly in subordination to his right of possession.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-10\" pgmap=\"235\">3. Evidence\u2014on question of possession under claim and color of title. The signing and acknowledging of a plat of certain grounds, for the purpose of describing the land of the signer, and that adjacent thereto, by numbers, for conveyance and taxation, in which a strip of land was marked as belonging to another, and the declaration of such signer that his land only came to a certain fence, which would not include such strip, is competent evidence against such party on the question of possession under claim and color of title.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-11\" pgmap=\"235\">4. Same\u2014admissions\u2014declarations\u2014of their weight as evidence. In order to make an admission or declaration of a party of any value as evidence, it ought to appear that it was made by the party with a full knowledge of his rights, and deliberately. If made in ignorance of his rights, it amounts to nothing. The jury, in weighing such evidence, should consider all the circumstances throwing light on the admission.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-12\" pgmap=\"235\">5. Same\u2014declaration of former owner of land, as affecting title. On the trial of an action of ejectment, the plaintiff, who claimed title under one H., proposed to prove by a witness that once, while he and H. were looking at the land in dispute, the witness proposed to buy it of H., but H. declined to sell it, for the reason that he wanted it for a driveway, which the court refused to allow: Held, that this evidence was not admissible on the ground that it was a part of the res gestee, nor on the ground that it was a declaration against interest.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-13\" pgmap=\"235(24) 236(54)\">6.

A description of land, in a tax receipt or deed, as, the \u201cNorth side S. \"W. \\ of block 2,\u201d etc., is not void for indefiniteness and uncertainty. Those words mean the north half of the south-west quarter of the lot. Mathematical accuracy is not indispensable, and descriptions are not to be rejected because they are awkwardly and inaptly expressed. If, taking the language in the connection in which it is used, the meaning is reasonably clear to the ordinary apprehension, it is sufficient.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b236-10\" pgmap=\"236\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of McLean county; the Hon, Franklin Blades, Judge, presiding.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-11\" pgmap=\"236\">Mr.-Wm.

The proof shows that on the 23d of September, 1864, Gridley and wife conveyed, by quitclaim deed, to appellee, a parcel of ground, which includes the strip in controversy. This constituted color of title, and the principal questions discussed in argument relate to the'sufficiency of the evidence to show possession and payment of taxes by appellee, under this color of title, for seven successive years.</p> <p id=\"AUU\" pgmap=\"239\">There is a sharp controversy in the testimony of different witnesses with regard to the question of possession, but we are unable to say the court below clearly erred in finding the preponderance to be with appellee. A number of witnesses testify that a fence was built, as early as 1840, on the south line, substantially, of the strip in controversy, and that appellee was in possession, under her deed, of the ground north of that fence, so as to include the strip in controversy, from the date of her deed until the commencement of the suit, continuously. The number of those who thus support appellee\u2019s claim of possession is greater than that of those who controvert it, and from what is before us it is impossible for us to say that the latter show any marked superiority, in respect of fairness or intelligence, over the former.</p> <p id=\"b239-6\" pgmap=\"239(218) 240(189)\">Appellant\u2019s counsel, however, contend that appellee is equitably estopped to claim the strip in controversy, for two reasons: First, on the 28th of July, 1880, she, jointly with other adjacent property holders, signed and acknowledged a plat, made for the purpose, of more definitely describing her property, and that adjacent thereto, by numbers, for conveyance and taxation, and in that plat the strip in -controversy was marked as belonging to appellant; second, just before James P. Hodge sold to appellant, himself and two brothers went through the alley which includes the strip in controversy, and when in front of appellee\u2019s they asked appellee how far down south her land went, to which she replied that it went down to the picket fence on Madison street,\u2014and this, it is understood, does not include the strip in controversy. It would seem a sufficient answer to this, that estoppels in pais affecting permanent interests in land can only be made available in a court of equity. St. Louis Stock Yards v. Wiggins Ferry Co. 102 Ill. 514; Wales v. Bogue, 31 id. 464; Mills v. Graves, 38 id. 466; Blake v. Fash, 44 id. 302. But indispensable elements of an estoppel in pais are wanting. It is not shown the declarations were made with knowledge of the facts, or with the intention they would be acted upon, or that they were in fact acted upon, (Mayer v. Erhardt, 88 Ill. 452, People v. Brown, 67 id. 435, Flower v. Elwood, 66 id. 438, Knoebel v. Kircher, 33 id. 308, and Ball v. Hooten, 85 id. 159,) and so it is equally insufficient to arrest the running of the Statute of Limitations, as contended by counsel, as to pass a legal title. This \"is undoubtedly competent evidence on the fact of possession under color and claim of title, but nothing more. If appellee admitted that her property did not include the strip in controversy, it was the strongest of evidence that she was not in possession of it under color and claim of title. But in order that such.evidence shall be of any value, it ought to appear that it was made with full knowledge of her rights, and deliberately. If hastily made, and in ignorance of her rights, it amounts to nothing, and in all such cases, in weighing the evidence the jury should take all the circumstances throwing light on the admission into consideration.</p> <p id=\"b240-6\" pgmap=\"240(189) 241(147)\">\u25a0 The plat here was made by Ela, the county surveyor, at the instance of parties other than appellee. Her attention had not been directed to the subject until she was requested to sign it, and when she did sign it she says her attention was directed to other matters, and Ela did not call her attention to the particular effect of it. Whether in this latter statement she is entirely accurate, the circumstances were certainly not favorable to mature reflection, especially for an ignorant and uneducated person, as she was. She shows,\u2014 and in this is uncontradicted,\u2014that a large political meeting was being held. She was engaged in preparing a dinner for a number of those in attendance, and was also interesting herself in raising money for her church. In the discharge of these two-fold duties it became necessary to pass Ela\u2019s door, and when about to do so she stepped into his room to ask him to make a subscription in aid of her. church, when he presented the plat for her signature, and she signed it. On subsequent reflection she became dissatisfied with having signed the plat, and next morning requested Ela t,o take her name from it. He proceeded no further with the plat, and there is no pretense that appellant, or any one else, has ever been led to act in a way they would not otherwise have acted, upon the faith of appellee\u2019s signature. To take this party\u2019s -property away, or to close her mouth as to the truth in regard to the title, because of such an act, would bring the law into just and great reproach. What the truth was in regard to this line, and whether appellee knowingly and deliberately signed this plat, were proper questions for the jury, and upon which they have passed after hearing all the evidence that could be adduced on either side, and no artificial rule of law compelled them to believe in regard to it contrary to their senses.</p> <p id=\"b241-6\" pgmap=\"241\">The conversation with the Hodges is not recollected by appellee as it is by them. She says she was talking about the line back of her lot and east of h\u00e9r house, and not about the line south of her lot. The conversation, at best, appears to have been but casual. ' Appellee was not doing, nor required to do, any act in regard to her property, and it does not. appear that she was apprized that any importance would attach to her answers. All the circumstances considered, it is quite probable the parties mis\u00fanderstood each other, and we think the jury might well have so concluded. The declaration testified to by appellant is denied by appellee. We need but repeat, the effect of all the evidence upon the question of possession was for the jury, and we do not feel warranted in saying they palpably erred in that regard.</p> <p id=\"b241-7\" pgmap=\"241\">If, as appellee testifies, this strip was by her permission used, .in connection with other property adjoining it on the south, as a common driveway, by others and also by herself, her possession was not thereby impaired. Under such circumstances their use of the strip is not adverse to, but strictly in subordination to, her right of possession.</p> <p id=\"Ai2\" pgmap=\"242\">Appellant proposed to prove by a witness that once, while he. and one Hodge were looking at the .property in dispute, witness proposed to buy it of Hodge, but Hodge declined to sell it, for the reason that he wanted it for a driveway; but the court, on objection of appellee, refused to admit the evidence, and this ruling is now urged as error. It is patent that this evidence was not admissible on the ground that it was a part of the res gestee, nor on the ground that it was a declaration against interest; and the only other ground of which we are aware upon which it might be plausibly claimed that it was admissible, is, that it was the declaration of a party in possession as to the boundary line between himself and another. (See Noble v. Chrisman, 88 Ill. 186.) But it was not shown there was any dispute, then, in regard to tha boundary line between Hodge and-appellee, nor is it entirely clear that Hodge was then in possession, as owner, of any ground lying on that side of appellee\u2019s property. But be that as it may, the effect of the proposed evidence is not to settle a boundary line, but to give title,\u2014not to prove where the boundary line between Hodge and appellee was, but that Hodge owned the property in controversy.</p> <p id=\"b242-4\" pgmap=\"242(154) 243(21)\">The first payment for taxes made by appellee under her deed, was February 13, 1865. She then paid the taxes for 1864, which were not due until after she received her deed. On January 14, 1866, she paid the taxes for 1865, and on February 11, 1867, she paid the taxes for 1866. In each of the receipts for these payments the property is described as \u201cNorth side, S. W. \\ of block 2, Miller, Foster and others\u2019 addition to Bloomington.\u201d On March 10, 1868, she paid the taxes for 1867; March 30, 1869, she paid the taxes for 1868; January 31, 1870, she paid the taxes for 1869; February 21, 1871, she paid the taxes for 1870; and March 27, 1872, she paid the taxes for 1871. In each of these receipts the property is described as lot 4, block 2, Miller, Foster and others\u2019 addition to Bloomington. Appellee testifies that during these years, and for subsequent years, she paid all the taxes assessed on the ground she claims and then occupied.</p> <p id=\"b243-6\" pgmap=\"243\">But counsel insist the payments made in 1865, 1866, and 1867, were void because of the indefinite and imperfect description of the property. We can no,t concur in this view. It is not denied that if the description had been \u201cnorth half\u201d instead of \u201cnorth side, \u201d it would have been sufficient, and included the property in controversy. In Chiniquy v. People, 78 Ill. 570, we held that the words \u201ceast end\u201d meant \u201ceast half, \u201d and there is obviously equal or greater propriety in here holding that the word \u201cside\u201d means \u201chalf.\u201d The word \u201cside\u201d is, undoubtedly, often used to express the idea of a line, edge or surface, but it is also sometimes used to express the half or part lying on one side or the other of a central line, either actual or ipiaginary, drawn through a body, and it depends entirely upon the context whether one meaning or the other be intended. Thus, \u201cright side of the body, \u201d used in contradistinction to the left side, clearly means \u201cright half.\u201d Thus, Webster, in his Unabridged Dictionary, gives as the fourth definition of the noun \u201cside:,\u201d \u201cOne-half of the body (human or otherwise) considered as opposite to the other half; especially one of the halves of the body lying on either side of the.mesial plane,\u2014that is, of a plane passing from front to back through the spine.\u201d It may be admitted \u201cnorth side\u201d is an awkward and inapt way of describing the \u201cnorth half,\u201d but, in cases like the present, mathematical certainty is not indispensable, and descriptions are not to be rejected merely because they are awkwardly or inaptly expressed. If, taking the language in the connection in which it is used, the meaning is reasonably clear to the ordinary apprehension, it is sufficient.</p> <p id=\"b243-7\" pgmap=\"243(38) 244(322)\">In construing this language we must commence with the idea that the intention in using it was to describe a definite and tangible part of the designated lot, for the purpose was to designate,\u2014point out specifically,\u2014property against which taxes could be extended, and from which they could be collected by its sale. Manifestly, a line, edge or verge conveys no idea of property, and so, it is believed, it would be generally understood they could not have been intended. To embrace property, width as well as length was indispensable; and, this being conceded, it must follow that the \u201cnorth half, \u201d or width from the north line to the central east and west line, was intended, for there is no possible intermediate limit, and width, without tangible and definite limit, is as meaningless, in describing property, as is a single straight line. If it be. said A owns the north side of a given field, and B owns the south side of it, it is believed it will be universally understood that A and B own the whole field.\u2019 No definite space is left to be occupied by any one else. In such case no one could doubt where is the dividing line between A and B. It can be nowhere else than an east and west line, drawn through the center of the field,- dividing it into halves. The only difference here is, while the \u201cnorth side\u201d is expressed, its opposite or counterpart, \u201csouth side,\u201d is not expressed. If both were expressed in juxtaposition, there could be no doubt. How, then, can there be here reasonable doubt ? From that which is expressed, and as expressed, it is clear its use is in implied juxtaposition to that which is not expressed,\u2014that is, to say \u201cnorth side, \u201d implies a \u201csouth side, \u201d and, used to indicate width as well as length, the two necessarily imply an entire definite surface. We are satisfied no violence is done to the language, and that justice will best be promoted by holding that \u201cnorth side,\u201d in the connection in which the words are here used, means \u201cnorth half.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b244-6\" pgmap=\"244(51) 245(16)\">After the payment of 1867 the assessments were made, and the taxes paid,' in accordance with an assessor\u2019s plat, to which, so far as affects the present case, we perceive no substantial objection, and so we conclude, especially when the parol evidence showing an actual payment of taxes upon the property possessed by appellee is taken into consideration, the proof of payment of taxes is sufficient.</p> <p id=\"b245-6\" pgmap=\"245\">The rulings of the court in regard to the instructions are, in some respects, not entirely free from critical objection, but we perceive no error in that regard which, after- a full and careful consideration of the entire record, ought, in our opinion, to authorize a reversal. Assuming, as has been seen, we think the evidence warrants that the proof of payment of taxes and possession is ample, the verdict below is clearly right, and under no proper instructions ought a different result to have been reached.</p> <p id=\"b245-7\" pgmap=\"245\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b245-8\" pgmap=\"245\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
