Mollena (Mollena) and Patsyann H. Costa (Costa), appeal from the trial court orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>entered June 22, 1990, and July 13, 1990, respectively, denying their cross motions for summary judgment which requested that underinsured motorist coverage be implied, as a matter of law, under their respective motor vehicle insurance policies, and the granting of defendant-appellee, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company of Hawaii, Inc.\u2019s (Fireman\u2019s Fund), motions for summary judgment against Mollena and Costa. The two cases were consolidated for the purpose of this appeal. We vacate the judgment entered in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Mollena and Costa contend the trial court erred in denying their cross motions for summary judgment for several reasons: (1) the Fireman\u2019s Fund policyholder message is not a legally sufficient offer of optional underinsured motorist coverage under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 431^448, and therefore, underinsured motorist coverage should be implied as a matter of law; (2) Fireman \u2019 s Fund should have repeated this offer of underinsured motorist coverage each time it mailed renewal declarations to its insureds under HRS \u00a7 431-448; and (3) a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether or not Costa and Mollena actually received the policyholder message. Costa also argues Fireman\u2019s Fund should have obtained her written rejection of underinsured coverage under HRS \u00a7 431-448.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">On January 1,1986, HRS \u00a7 431^448(b) and (c) became effective. HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 448, in its entirety, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">\u00a7431^448. Automobile liability; coverage for damage by uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>(a) No automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle, shall be delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in this State, with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto, in limits for bodily injury or death set forth in section 287-7, under provisions filed with and approved by the insurance commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting therefrom, provided that the <em>coverage required under this section shall not apply where any insured named in the policy shall reject the coverage in writing. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">(b) Each insurer <em>shall offer </em>to each policyholder or applicant for a motor vehicle <em>liability policy optional additional insurance coverage </em>for loss resulting from bodily injury or death suffered by any person legally entitled <em>to recover damages from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">(c) The <em>term \u201cunderinsured motor </em>vehicle,\u201d as used <em>in this </em>section, means a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance, or use of which the sum of the limits of liability of all bodily injury liability insurance coverage applicable at the time of loss to which coverage afforded by such policy or policies applies is less than the liability for damages imposed by law. A motor vehicle <em>shall </em>also <em>be deemed uninsured within </em>the meaning of <em>this section </em>if, after the occurrence of a loss described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>this section, the owner or operator thereof is unknown. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 431-448(b), Fireman\u2019s Fund sent a letter entitled, \u201cPolicyholder Message,\u201d informing its insureds of the new optional underinsured motorist coverage. The relevant parts are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">TO ALL HAWAII AUTO POLICYHOLDERS Dear Policyholder,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Effective January 1, 1986, the state of Hawaii requires higher minimum limits of financial responsibility for Bodily Injury Liability and Uninsured Motorists Coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">The new minimum is $35,000 per person. If your policy provided less than the minimum limit mentioned above, it has been renewed with the higher limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Effective January 1, 1986 we are also required to offer you the option to purchase Underinsured Motorists Coverage. Underinsured Motorists Coverage includes Uninsured Motorists Coverage and the limit of liability is $35,000. Listed below are the annual premiums to be charged should you select this new coverage option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">UNDERINSURED/UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE $35,000 LIMIT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">ANNUAL PREMIUM GARAGING LOCATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">$61 OAHU</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABH\">$38 MAUI (Lanai, Maui and Molokai)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaD\">$42 KAUAI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5z\">$46 HAWAII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">Above premiums include $8 for basic uninsured motorists coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>If you have any questions about your insurance or wish to purchase Underinsured/Uninsured Motorists Coverage, contact your Fireman\u2019s Fund agent or Broker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">During the six month period between December 5,1985 and June 4,1986, this policyholder message was mailed along with the policy renewal declarations that are sent every six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Fireman\u2019s Fund had been providing motor vehicle insurance for Mollena since October 12,1980 and for Costa since September 17, 1984. Both Mollena and Costa allege they never received the policyholder message. Neither purchased underinsured motorist coverage. However, Fireman\u2019s Fund claims it mailed a policyholder message once to Mollena the week of February 17, 1986 and once to Costa on or about February 2, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Mollena and Costa were injured in separate motor vehicle accidents on October 22, 1987 and on October 31, 1986, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both received bodily injury liability policy limits of $35,000 from the third party tortfeasors involved in their respective accidents. Both claimed underinsured motorist benefits from their insurer, Fireman\u2019s Fund. Fireman\u2019s Fund denied their claims on the basis that their policies did not provide underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Mollena and Costa filed separate declaratory judgment actions against Fireman\u2019s Fund requesting the trial court to find the policyholder message was not a legally sufficient offer, and therefore, underinsured motorist coverage be implied as a matter of law. Fireman\u2019s Fund moved for summary judgment in both cases. Mollena and Costa filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund and denied Mollena\u2019s and Costa\u2019s cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">HRS \u00a7 43 l-448(b) requires that \u201c[e]ach insurer <em>shall offer </em>to each policyholder\u201d optional underinsured motorist coverage. (Emphasis added.) We interpret this language to mean the insurer must make a legally sufficient offer of underinsured motorist coverage under the four-part test which we endorse and which is set forth in <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>United Pacific Insurance Co., </em>318 N.W.2d 849 (Minn. 1982). <em>See also </em>(applying four-part test) <em>Cloninger </em>v. <em>National Gen. Ins. Co., </em>488 N.E.2d 548 (Ill. 1985); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wannamaker, </em>354 S.E.2d 555 (S.C. 1987). Under the four-part test, an offer is legally sufficient when all of the following are met: (1) if made other than face-to-face, the notification process must be commercially reasonable; (2) the limits of optional coverage must be specified and not merely offered in general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the insurer must apprise the insured that the optional coverage is available for a relatively modest increase in premium. <em>Hastings v. United Pac. Ins. Co., </em>318 N.W.2d 849 (Minn. 1982). Clearly, from the \u201cshall offer\u201d language of HRS \u00a7 431-448, the insurer has the burden of proving a legally sufficient offer was made. <em>Compare State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wannamaker, </em>354 S.E.2d 555, 556 (S.C. 1987). If the insurer cannot show that the four-part test has been met, then coverage is implied as a matter of law. Id.; <em>Kuchenmeister v. Illinois Farmers Ins. Co., </em>310 N.W.2d 86, 88 (Minn. 1981). <em>See Hastings v. United Pac. Ins. Co., </em>318 N.W.2d 849 (Minn. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>United Pacific Insurance Co., </em>318 N.W.2d 849 (Minn. 1982), pursuant to a Minnesota statute requiring the insurer to \u201coffer\u201d underinsured motorist coverage, the insurer sent a letter and option form informing its insureds of this new optional coverage. The letter explained that additional optional coverages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>and deductibles may be purchased if desired by completing the enclosed option form. The option form stated: \u201cunderinsured motorist coverage \u2018is offered as an option\u2019 with limits of $50,000 per person/$ 100,000 per occurrence or $100,000 per person/$300,000 per occurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851. After applying its four-part test, the <em>Hastings </em>court found the materials did not constitute a legally sufficient offer. The mailings were a commercially reasonable method of notification under part one of the test. Part two of the test was also satisfied. However, they did not explain the nature of underinsured coverage as required under part three of the test. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">[T]he technical language of insurance is not easily understood by many, if not most, purchasers of insurance. \u201cUnderinsured motorist coverage\u201d is an example of language that may not convey a clear message to the uninitiated insured, who might well understand it to be supplemental coverage for the insured whose own liability coverage for bodily injury to others is inadequate. To an insured with ample bodily injury liability coverage, the listing of \u201cunderinsured motorist coverage\u201d as an available option, without further explanation, does not constitute a meaningful offer sufficient to enable the insured to assess why the offer should be carefully considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 852. The court also held that part four of the test was not met because the mailings only stated coverage \u201cmay be purchased\u201d without any reference to a modest increase in premium. <em>Id. </em>at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Fireman\u2019s Fund argues that the <em>Hastings </em>four-part test is not applicable because the legislature did not intend HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 448 to be interpreted as requiring the insurer to make a legally valid offer. Fireman\u2019s Fund asserts insurers are only required to make underinsured motorist coverage available to insureds, but are not required to \u201coffer\u201d it to insureds. It bases this argument on the 1987 recodification (which was not intended to make any substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>changes) of HRS \u00a7 431^48 as HRS \u00a7 431:10C-302 where the legislature replaced the phrase \u201cshall offer\u201d with the phrase \u201cshall make available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">However, HRS \u00a7 431-448 was actually recodified as HRS \u00a7 431:10-213. <em>See </em>Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 215, in 1988 Senate Journal, at 675; Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 126-88, in 1988 House Journal, at 826. HRS \u00a7431:10-213 retains the \u201cshall offer\u201d language of HRS \u00a7 431-448. Thus, the line of cases applying the four-part test are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Here, the policyholder message clearly does not meet the four-part test for a legally sufficient offer. Under part one of the test, mailing the policyholder message with the renewal declarations was a commercially reasonable method of communicating with insureds about a business transaction. However, the three remaining parts of the test are not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Under part two of the test, the limits of coverage are not clearly specified. The language of the policyholder message which states \u201cUNDERINSURED/UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE $35,000 LIMIT\u201d misleadingly suggests there is a single $35,000 coverage to be split between the underinsured and uninsured motorist coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Under part three of the test, the policyholder message lacks any definition or examples or description of the nature of underinsured motorist coverage. In the policyholder message, the phrase \u201cUnderinsured Motorists Coverage includes Uninsured Motorists Coverage\u201d is very deceptive. As noted by Mollena and Costa, this court has already held that the legislature intended underinsured and uninsured motorist coverages to be \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d in <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Ferreira, </em>71 Haw. 341, 345, 790 P.2d 910, 913 (1990). Further, the phrase, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u201cUnderinsured/Uninsured Motorists Coverage,\u201d as used in the policyholder message is ambiguous and confusing, especially because the terms, underinsured and uninsured, are so similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Under part four of the test, Fireman\u2019s Fund fails to clearly inform its insureds of the premium for the underinsured motorist coverage. It lists the annual premium for \u201cunderinsured/uninsured motorists coverage\u201d at different garaging locations. At the bottom of that listing, it states the \u201c[a]bove premiums include $8 basic uninsured motorists coverage.\u201d It can be argued that the $8 should be subtracted from the annual premium at different garaging locations to arrive at the premium for underinsured motorist coverage. However, it is not readily apparent, nor is it clearly explained to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Fireman\u2019s Fund argues any difficulty in understanding is resolved by its instruction in the policyholder message that the insured contact his/her Fireman\u2019s Fund agent or broker to answer any questions. The burden, however, is on the insurer to provide the insured with a legally sufficient offer that contains relevant and pertinent information, and a clause instructing the insured to obtain that information by contacting his insurer does not suffice. <em>See Overbey v. Illinois Farmers Ins. Co., 525 </em>N.E.2d 1076, 1082 (Ill. App. 2d 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We find that the policyholder message is not a legally sufficient offer. Therefore, the question of whether or not Mollena or Costa actually received the \u201cpolicyholder message\u201d is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Costa argues that her written rejection of underinsured motorist coverage was required based on the language of HRS \u00a7 431-448 and its legislative history. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">HRS \u00a7 431-448 is divided into three subsections: subsection (a) relates to uninsured motorist coverage, the offer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>coverage, and written rejection; and subsections (b) and (c) relate to underinsured motorist coverage. The phrase \u201cunder this section\u201d and \u201cas used in this section\u201d in HRS \u00a7 431-448 (a) and (c), respectively, illustrate the fact that subsections (a) and (c) apply to the entire section (or statute), and not just within their respective subsections. As Costa notes, if the word \u201csection\u201d were replaced with \u201csubsection,\u201d HRS \u00a7 431-448 would be meaningless. Further, the legislature carefully distinguished between the use of \u201csection\u201d and \u201csubsection\u201d in Act 181. Asa part of Act 181, HRS \u00a7 431^148 was amended to add underinsured motorist coverage. <em>See </em>Act 181, \u00a7\u00a7 1-8, 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws 309-313. We conclude, therefore, that HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 448(a) which requires written rejection of uninsured coverage also applies to offers of underinsured motorist coverage described in HRS \u00a7 431-448 (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We recognize that other language in HRS \u00a7 431-448(a) has been made applicable to HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 448(b). Specifically, in <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Robinol, </em>699 F. Supp. 819 (D. Haw. 1988), the requirement under HRS \u00a7 431-448(a) that offers for coverage must be made when the policy \u201cshall be delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed\u201d was applied to HRS \u00a7 431-448(b). The <em>Robinol </em>court reasoned that since the underinsured provisions were made a part of the statute which contained offer of coverage provisions, the legislature intended that preexisting language be applied to underinsured motorist coverage as well. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Robinol, </em>699 F. Supp. 819, 822 (D. Haw. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Likewise, HRS \u00a7 43 l-448(a) also contained the written rejection requirement when the underinsured motorist coverage provision under HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 448(b) and (c) was added. It is clear that HRS \u00a7 431-448(b) and (c) should be read in conjunction with HRS \u00a7 431-448(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The subsequent amendment of HRS \u00a7 431-448 illustrates that the legislature originally intended an offer of underinsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>motorist coverage to be rejected in writing. The recodification of HRS \u00a7431-448 as HRS \u00a7431:10-213 was followed by an amendment in 1988. The amendment specifically provided for written rejection of underinsured motorist coverage and included this new provision in HRS \u00a7 431:10C-301 relating to uninsured and under-insured motorist coverage. <em>See </em>Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 215, in 1988 Senate Journal, at 675; Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 126-88, in 1988 House Journal, at 826. The legislature stated the purpose of this amendment was <em>\u201cclarifying </em>that written rejection of coverage against underinsured motor vehicles shall be applied in the same manner as is presently utilized for uninsured motor vehicles.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>It was concerned that insurers were not offering those coverages in accordance with Hawaii law, therefore, it clearly stated that the requirement of a written rejection provides \u201cgreater assurance\u201d that the consumer is sufficiently informed of the offer of both coverages. Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 194, in 1965 House Journal, at 583. <em>See </em>Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1150-88, in 1988 House Journal, at 1248. We agree that the rationale for the written rejection requirement is the same for both uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">HRS \u00a7 431-448(a) in conjunction with HRS \u00a7 431-448(b) requires that an offer be made for underinsured motorist coverage under any policy \u201cdelivered, issued for delivery, or renewed.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Robinol, </em>699 F. Supp. 819 (D. Haw. 1988). Costa asserts this means every policy renewal notice must contain the offer based on the plain language of the statute. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Fireman\u2019s Fund argues that requiring repeat offers in every renewal is cost prohibitive and contrary to the legislative intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>provide coverage at the lowest possible cost. That is, the increase in administrative costs will be transferred to the consumer. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJq\"><em>William Copulos (Ian L.
