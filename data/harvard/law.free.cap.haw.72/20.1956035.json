(HIG). HIG cross-appeals from an order denying attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the summary judgment in favor of HIG and reverse the order denying attorney\u2019s fees based on our finding that the complaint brought by Coll against HIG was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">In April 1985, while riding his moped, Coll was injured as a result of being struck by an automobile owned by Dawn Murray (Murray). At the time of the accident, Murray was insured under an insurance policy issued by HIG. As the operator of a moped, Coll was not required to have no-fault insurance coverage of his own. Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 294-4(1 )(A) (1985),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> HIG was required to assume the obligation as no-fault carrier for Coll.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Following the accident, Coll filed an application for no-fault benefits with HIG seeking to collect medical expenses totaling $ 15,663.30 as well as lost wages. Because Coil\u2019s claims exceeded the no-fault policy limit of $ 15,000.00, HIG tendered a lump sum payment of $15,000.00 to Coll by way of a draft made payable to him. The draft was forwarded to his then-attorney, Defendant William J. McCarthy (McCarthy),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and bore the following notation on its face: \u201cWHEN PROPERLY ENDORSED THIS DRAFT CONSTITUTES PAYMENT FOR: Maximum Limit of No-Fault Benefits payable under this policy.\u201d Coll then endorsed the draft to McCarthy, who deposited it into his client trust account at the Bank of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">HIG subsequently tendered payment of an additional $25,000.00 to Coll in settlement of Coil\u2019s claims based on Murray\u2019s liability and obtained a release of all claims arising out of the accident. The settlement draft was also deposited into McCarthy\u2019s client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Sometime thereafter, Coll was unable to pay medical expenses owing to the Queen\u2019s Medical Center (Queen\u2019s) for treatment of injuries received as a result of the accident. In an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>brought by Queen\u2019s, default judgment was entered against Coll in the amount of $13,259.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On February 9, 1988, Coll filed a complaint naming McCarthy and HIG as defendants. In his complaint, Coll alleged that HIG was negligent in paying the $15,000.00 no-fault benefits to McCarthy in violation of HRS Chapter 294, Hawaii Motor Vehicle Insurance Law. The allegations against McCarthy included accusations of conversion, fraud, and comingling of the amounts paid by HIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">HIG counterclaimed against Coll alleging that the complaint was frivolous and constituted an abuse of process. As part of the counterclaim, HIG alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">7. On September 18,1985, HIG sent draft #R23919 in the amount of $ 15,000 made payable, \u201cTo the order of EDWARD COLL\u201d to McCARTHY. Said payment was the no-fault insurance policy limits and said draft was endorsed by Coll and deposited into MCCARTHY\u2019S trust account at the Kona Branch of the Bank of Hawaii on September 20, 1985.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">In his Answer, Coll admitted the aforestated allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">On June 7, 1988, HIG filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that the no-fault benefits were paid to Coll, not McCarthy, and that the manner of payment (lump sum) did not violate HRS Chapter 294. Following a hearing on the motion, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment. Subsequently, HIG filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees on the grounds that Coil\u2019s claim was frivolous and, alternatively, that as the prevailing party, it was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court denied the motion and in finding that Coil\u2019s claim was not frivolous stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqQ\">Although this is a close question it would seem that the parties \u2014 the plaintiff made his claim in good faith. He may not have had the sufficient factual support to withstand the Motion for Summary Judgment, but the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>does not find that it is so clearly and palpably bad that no argument is able to convince the Court that the claim was without merit so the Court will deny the motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Transcript of Proceedings at 15. Both Coll and HIG timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On review of a summary judgment, the standard to be applied by the appellate court is identical to that employed by the trial court. Under Rule 56(c) of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), \u201ca summary judgment will be rendered only if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>First Hawaiian Bank, </em>61 Haw. 346, 349, 604 P.2d 39, 41 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u201cQuestions of negligence and proximate cause are ordinarily not susceptible to summary adjudication. But where the facts are undisputed or are susceptible of only one reasonable interpretation, the trial court is under a duty to rule upon the question of negligence or proximate cause as a matter of law.\u201d <em>De Los Santos </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 Haw. 608, 610-11, 655 P.2d 869, 871 (1982) (citing <em>Pickering v. State, </em>57 Haw. 405, 557 P.2d 125 (1976); <em>cf. Tsugawa </em>v. <em>Reinartz, </em>56 Haw. 67, 527 P.2d 1278 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Therefore, with respect to Coil\u2019s appeal, the question before us is whether Coll has raised any genuine issue of material fact that would cause us to reverse the summary judgment granted by the trial court. It is clear that Coll has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">In his complaint, Coll alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">48. Defendant <em>HIG paid to Defendant MCCARTHY </em>Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) representing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s maximum no-fault benefits, in violation of Chapter 294 Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant HIG\u2019s unlawful acts/omissions and/or negligence Plaintiff has suffered damages in an amount to be proven at the time of trial and as prayed for herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">(Emphasis added.) The record plainly reflects and Coll admits that HIG tendered the maximum amount of no-fault benefits under its insurance policy directly payable to Coll, who endorsed the draft which was then deposited in McCarthy\u2019s trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">However, Coll argued in opposition to HIG\u2019s motion for summary judgment that the action taken by HIG in tendering the maximum no-fault benefits in lump sum to him, as opposed to paying the medical providers directly, was in violation of HRS \u00a7 294-4(2) (1985). We find this argument to be totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">HRS \u00a7 294-4(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">Payment of no-fault benefits shall be made as the benefits accrue, except that in the case of death, payment of the benefits may, at the option of the beneficiary, be made immediately in a lump sum payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">In interpreting HRS \u00a7 294-4(2), as with any statute, we look to the plain and unambiguous language and give effect to the law according to its plain and obvious meaning. <em>Strouss </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>66 Haw. 32, 50, 657 P.2d 1004, 1016 (1982) (quoting <em>In re Hawaiian Tel. Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577-78, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980)). Nothing in HRS \u00a7 294-4(2), nor in any other provision of the Hawaii Motor Vehicle Insurance Law, requires an insurer to pay no-fault benefits directly to the medical provider. On the contrary, HRS \u00a7 294-4( 1)(A) contains the language, \u201cthe insurer shall pay ... to <em>the person </em>[injured] an amount equal to the no-fault benefits payable to the person as a result of the injury [.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) For this court to require that insurers pay benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>directly to the medical provider would be to fashion a requirement where the legislature has intended none.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Coll also argues that HRS \u00a7 294 \u2014 4(2) mandates that a lump sum payment be made only in the case of death. We acknowledge that the statute provides that no-fault benefits shall be paid as the benefits accrue except for instances of death. However, there is no prohibition of lump sum payments where the accrued medical benefits and wage loss exceed the maximum limits of the no-fault benefits at the time the claim is made. HRS \u00a7 294 \u2014 4(3) (1985) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">Payment of no-fault benefits shall be made within thirty days after the insurer has received reasonable proof of the fact and amount of benefits accrued, and demand for payment thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In this case, Coil\u2019s medical expenses and wage loss exceeded HIG\u2019s $15,000.00 maximum liability under the no-fault policy and were already accrued when he filed the application for no-fault benefits which was HIG\u2019s first notice of the claim. We find nothing in the statutory scheme prohibiting HIG from tendering the no-fault benefits to Coll in a lump sum payment under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Coll contends for the first time on appeal that factual issues exist as to whether no-fault benefits were sufficient to pay for his medical expenses and wage loss. Ordinarily, failure to raise or properly reserve issues at the trial level would be deemed waived. <em>Mizoguchi v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 66 </em>Haw. 373, 383, 663 P.2d 1071, 1077 (1983) (citing <em>Miller v. Leadership Hous. Sys., Inc., </em>57 Haw. 321, 325, 555 P.2d 864, 867 (1976), and <em>Fujioka v. Kam, </em>55 Haw. 7, 9, 514 P.2d 568, 570 (1973)). Although we are not required to consider Coil\u2019s contention made for the first time on appeal, we will briefly address this issue to negate any belief that a meritorious claim exists against HIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Coll argues that a health care provider, \u201cHMSA,\u201d paid certain billings by medical providers and therefore the outstanding balance of the medical bills as well as Coil\u2019s wage loss could have been satisfied by the no-fault benefits. Coll contends \u201c[i]t would have been a very simple matter for HIG to pay the medical care providers in the order that the respective billings were issued or the services were rendered. Had HIG done so, most or all of the outstanding medical bills would have been paid, in addition to allowing money to COLL for wage loss.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Coil\u2019s Opening Brief at 8-9. This argument defies logic as it would have been just as simple for Coll, who received the lump sum payment of $15,000.00, to pay the medical providers directly after HMSA\u2019s payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In its cross-appeal, HIG asserts that the trial court erred in denying its claim for attorney\u2019s fees on alternative grounds: (1) HIG, as the prevailing party in an assumpsit action should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees under HRS \u00a7 607-14 (1985),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or (2) Coil\u2019s claim against HIG was.frivolous thus justifying an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees under HRS \u00a7 431:1 OC \u2014 211 (d) (1987 spec, pamphlet) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or HRS \u00a7 607-14.5 (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that Coil\u2019s claim against HIG was \u201cmade in good faith\u201d and thus not frivolous presents mixed questions of fact and law. Where the court\u2019s conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case, the clearly erroneous standard of review applies. <em>Pacheco </em>v. <em>Hilo Elec. Light Co., </em>55 Haw. 375, 520 P.2d 62 (1974). <em>See also </em>Yoshii, <em>Appellate Standards of Review in Hawaii, </em>7 U. Haw. L. Rev. 273, 288-90 (1985). A finding is clearly erroneous where the court is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Aiea Lani Corp. v. Hawaii Escrow &amp; Title, Inc., </em>64 Haw. 638, 641, 647 P.2d 257, 259 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Makani Dev. Co. v. Stahl, 4 </em>Haw. App. 542, 670 P.2d 1284 (1983). Discretion is abused whenever the court, in exercising it, \u201cexceeds the bounds of reason, all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>circumstances before it being considered.\u201d <em>Ariyoshi </em>v. <em>Hawaii Pub. Employment Relations Bd., </em>5 Haw. App. 533, 542, 704 P.2d 917, 925 (1985) (citing <em>Berry v. Chaplin, </em>74 Cal. App. 2d 669, 169 P.2d 453, 456 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In addressing HIG\u2019s contention that it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, we first consider whether Coil\u2019s claim against HIG was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">This court in <em>R. W. Meyer, Ltd. v. McGuire, </em>36 Haw. 184, 187 (1942), stated that \u201c[f]or an assignment of error to be frivolous ... it must be manifestly and palpably without merit.\u201d In <em>Kawaihae </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance Companies, </em>1 Haw. App. 355, 619 P.2d 1086 (1980), the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), relying upon <em>McGuire, </em>defined a frivolous claim as a claim so \u201cmanifestly and palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on [the pleader\u2019s] part such that argument to the court was not required.\u201d 1 Haw. App. at 361, 619 P.2d at 1091. In <em>Kawaihae, </em>plaintiffappellee brought a claim for no-fault benefits as a dependent of the deceased who died in an automobile accident. The primary issue of dependency focused on whether the deceased had provided for over one-half of her support during that time. The jury in the trial below denied plaintiff\u2019s claim for no-fault benefits, but the court, upon motion pursuant to HRS \u00a7 294-30 (1985),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> awarded her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The appellate court determined that under HRS \u00a7 294-30 the trial court has the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to a losing claimant who files for no-fault benefits unless the trial court determines that the claim was fraudulent, excessive, or frivolous. Hawaiian Insurance Companies appealed arguing, in part, that plaintiff\u2019s claim was frivolous because plaintiff knew that she was in fact supporting the deceased, premised on the evidence showing that plaintiff received a greater dollar amount from welfare and wages than the deceased. The ICA looked outside the pleadings and affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s claim was not frivolous on the grounds that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the question as to whether deceased\u2019s additional contributions of food from hunting, fishing, and monies received therefrom would be of a value (with his welfare and wages) that exceeded one-half the support of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In the instant case, the facts are undisputed. Coil\u2019s specific allegation in his complaint was that HIG wrongfully paid the maximum no-fault benefits to McCarthy thereby violating the Hawaii Motor Vehicle Insurance Law. Since HRS \u00a7 294 \u2014 4(1)(A) requires payment to be made to \u201cthe person\u201d injured, a bonafide claim was stated. However, this bare allegation was, in fact, false when made as shown by Coil\u2019s admission to HIG\u2019s counterclaim that he received HIG\u2019s draft which was made payable to himself and that it was he who endorsed the draft over to McCarthy. It is difficult to conceive of a stronger case for frivolousness regarding this claim as defined by our courts. First, there was no need to look beyond the pleadings or to invite argument to conclude that \u201cthe claim is manifestly and palpably without merit.\u201d Secondly, bad faith is clearly indicated by Coil\u2019s knowledge at the time of the filing of the complaint that he was the payee on the draft and not McCarthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Although not apparent on its face, a second interpretation of the allegation in the complaint against HIG was argued at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>hearing on HIG\u2019s motion for summary judgment, that is, that the payment of the $ 15,000.00 was a \u201clump sum\u201d prohibited by Chapter 294 and an extension of that argument appeared for the first time on appeal. As we discussed under Section II of this opinion, such a claim was unfounded and totally without merit. Coll received the entire amount due and owing to him under Chapter 294 and conveyed it to McCarthy who allegedly mismanaged or misused the funds. Absent any statutory violation or rational argument indicating that HIG breached its duty to Coll, we are compelled under the circumstances to find that he knowingly advanced a claim \u201cunwarranted under existing law\u201d and which was unsupported \u201cby good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Common sense dictates that if Coll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>believed that the lump sum payment to him was in violation of the Hawaii Motor Vehicle Insurance Law, it was incumbent upon him to return it and request that HIG pay the medical providers directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We, therefore, conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in not finding Coil\u2019s claim against HIG to be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We turn now to the question of which of three alternative statutes urged by HIG applies as to the determination of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">First, HIG contends that as the prevailing party, it is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under HRS \u00a7 607-14. We disagree. HRS \u00a7 607-14 authorizes the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin all actions in the nature of assumpsit.\u201d At common law, assumpsit is a common form of action which allows for the recovery of damages for the non-performance of a contract, expressed or implied. <em>Schulz </em>v. <em>Honsador, </em>67 Haw. 433, 435, 690 P.2d 279, 281 (1984). HIG contends that the instant action is one of assumpsit because Coll was seeking recovery of no-fault insurance benefits under a contract, that is, HIG\u2019s policy. We need not discuss the import of Coll not being a party to the contract insofar as this is not a case involving a claim for no-fault benefits under the policy, but a claim for negligent payment of those benefits. Therefore, HRS \u00a7 607-14 was not applicable and the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees under said statute was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>HIG argues alternatively that two statutes authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the event Coil\u2019s claim is deemed frivolous. Review of HRS \u00a7431: IOC-211 (d) and HRS \u00a7 607-14.5 indicates that the former is inapplicable while the latter authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees against Coll.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">HRS \u00a7 431: IOC-211(d) allows an insurer to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in having to defend a claim for no-fault benefits which is determined to be fraudulent or frivolous. We reiterate that Coil\u2019s claim was not for no-fault benefits, which were fully paid, but alleged a claim in tort for consequential damages. Therefore, this provision is likewise inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">HRS \u00a7 607-14.5, on the other hand, specifically provides that an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees may be ordered where \u201call claims ... made by the party are frivolous and are not reasonably supported by the facts and the law in the civil action.\u201d We are mindful of the argument that statutes which allow the assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees may have a chilling effect in detering the filing of law suits based on innovative theories or to modify, extend, or reverse existing law. However, we must also heed the obvious legislative intent in enacting such statutes which is to \u201ccompensate parties in civil litigation who have been victimized by the frivolous claims of the opposing party in the course of litigation and thereby incurring unnecessary attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 81-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 997. We think that not to award HIG its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under the circumstances of this case would be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Based on the foregoing, the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor \u00f3f HIG is affirmed, the denial of HIG\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees is affirmed in part and reversed in part and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>case is remanded for action on HIG\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under HRS \u00a7 607-14.5.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AW\"><em>Glen J.

HRCP Rule 11, as amended, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant. If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
