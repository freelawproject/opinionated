The ICA held that Richard Yamell (appellant) was permanently totally disabled, and vacated and remanded the decision of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). Based on our analysis, the ICA opinion is affirmed in part and modified in part, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with the ICA opinion as modified by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">As the ICA opinion gives a detailed synopsis of the facts, we will only briefly outline the background. <em>Yarnell </em>v. <em>City Roofing, </em>Inc., 8 Haw. App. 543, 812 P.2d 1199(1991). Following a work-related injury in 1974, appellant went through various operations. There were several hearings as to what he should receive under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes. During the ensuing years, he received disability payments classified in varying degrees, and the LIRAB addressed the status of his case several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The decision which directly pertains to the instant case is the decision of April 28, 1988, amended on May 16, 1988, issued by the Director of the Disability Compensation Division, Department of Labor. In that decision, the Director determined that appellant had been temporarily and totally disabled (TTD) from October 1, 1982, through January 27, 1988. The Director also awarded him <em>25% </em>additional permanent partial disability (PPD) of the whole man, and a lump sum disfigurement award of $1,100.00. Appellant appealed that decision to the LIRAB, which affirmed on December 7, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">That affirmation generated this appeal. Although appellant presented four questions on appeal, the ICA dealt only with the first question. That question asked whether appellant was permanently totally disabled (PTD), and if so, as of what date. The ICA found that appellant was PTD, and remanded for determinations including the appropriate date and amount of benefit. The ICA\u2019s conclusion was based on the premise that the LIRAB misapplied the odd-lot doctrine. City Roofing, Inc. and Industrial Indemnity Company, Employer, Insurance Carrier-Appellee (Petitioner), applied to this court for a Writ of Certiorari to review the ICA\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">One of the more colorful, but apt, definitions of the odd-lot doctrine comes from Judge Cardozo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">He [the plaintiff] was an unskilled or common laborer. He coupled his request for employment with notice that the labor must be light. The applicant imposing such conditions is quickly put aside for more versatile competitors. Business has little patience with the suitor for ease and favor. He is the \u2018odd lot\u2019 man, the \u2018nondescript in the labor market.\u2019 Work, if he gets it, is likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>be casual and intermittent.... Rebuff, if suffered, might reasonably be ascribed to the narrow opportunities that await the sick and the halt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Jordan v. Decorative Co., </em>230 N.Y. 522, 525, 130 N.E. 634, 635-36 (1921) (cited in 2 A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 57.51 (b), at 10-164.89 (19-20)). Larson\u2019s text provides the following general rule on burden of proof for claimants under the odd-lot doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">If the evidence of degree of obvious physical impairment, coupled with other facts such as claimant\u2019s mental capacity, education, training, or age, places claimant <em>prima facie </em>in the odd-lot category, the burden should be on the employer to show that some kind of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">A. Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 57.61(c), at 10-178. The item missing from claimant\u2019s list of considerations is any evidence as to specific availability of employment. In other words, there is a presumption that, if claimant suffers physically, and bears the additional characteristics, then he has proved the <em>prima facie </em>case. The employer then has the burden to prove the existence of regular suitable employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The decision affirmed by the LIRAB does not specifically discuss the odd-lot doctrine, but the following holding is its finding as to that premise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">We find that Claimant is not permanently and totally disabled. Claimant\u2019s age, background, and work experience do not combine with his physical impairment to preclude him from work in the normal labor market. Claimant has not shown that he is unable to work as a result of the April 16,1974 injury. On the facts before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Claimant is found to be permanently and partially disabled, and not totally disabled. Accordingly, Employer/ Carrier shall pay an additional <em>25% </em>permanent partial disability of the whole man, pursuant to \u00a7 386-32, H.R.S.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The ICA took issue with this holding, stating that appellant\u2019s burden was only to establish the prima facie case to assert that the odd-lot category might be applied. The ICA held, and we agree, that appellant clearly met his burden. The prima facie case was established on the facts. The burden should then have shifted. However, the ICA went on to make a factual finding that, on the record, petitioner failed to prove the availability of steady work.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Briefly, petitioner\u2019s argument to this court is that the question of whether a claimant falls within the odd-lot category is a question of fact. Petitioner argues that the LIRAB made the proper factual findings which support determining that appellant does not fall within the odd-lot category. Therefore, there was no reason to even consider shifting the burden to petitioner to ascertain whether appropriate employment existed for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We take issue with the extent of the ICA opinion, but also find that petitioner\u2019s argument is not entirely convincing. Case law clearly establishes that it is a question of fact as to whether a person falls into an odd-lot category. <em>See Worker\u2019s Comp. Claim of Cannon </em>v. <em>FMC Corp., </em>718 P.2d 879, 885 (Wyo. 1986). However shifting the burden of proof is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The LIRAB finding, quoted above, specifically put the burden on appellant of proving that he was unable to work as a result of the 1974 injury. This is an error of law, and we agree with the ICA that it is reversible. There is nothing in the LIRAB decision which indicates that the petitioner either failed or succeeded in its burden of proof that there was suitable employment \u2014 a factual question. We agree with petitioner that the ICA exceeded its scope of review on this portion of the odd-lot test, by making its own determination. The standard of review for the ICA, on a factual finding, was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>clearly erroneous standard. Since there was no factual finding on this portion of the odd-lot test to review, the case should have been remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZY\"><em>Leroy T.
