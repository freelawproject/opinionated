Appellants also claim that the cumulative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks deprived them of a fair trial. We agree with appellants\u2019 contentions and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">On August 22, 1989, Holiday Mart store detective Mitchell Tam (Tam) observed appellants placing several cartons of cigarettes into a shopping cart. Tam then saw Soares place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>cigarettes into a large handbag. Appellants left the store, with Suratt carrying the bag, without paying for the cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Outside of the store, Tam approached appellants, identified himself, showed his badge, and told appellants that they were under citizen\u2019s arrest for shoplifting. As Soares turned towards him, Tam grabbed Soares. During their struggle, the back of Soares\u2019 head hit Tam in the mouth causing Tam to release Soares. Soares then fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">While struggling with Soares, Tam instructed Conway Marks (Marks), a Holiday Mart clerk who was assisting Tam, to stop Suratt from leaving the area. Marks blocked Suratt\u2019s escape by standing directly in front of her path. After unsuccessfully attempting to push Marks out of her way, Suratt tricked Marks into looking the other direction and then fled with the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Suratt was arrested by police after she returned to Holiday Mart a few minutes later without the bag. Neither the bag nor the cigarettes, however, were recovered. On May 22,1990, Suratt was charged with Robbery in the Second Degree. On December 14, 1989, Soares was charged with one count of Robbery in the Second Degree and one count of Theft in the Fourth Degree. Soares was arrested on January 17,1990. Upon the State\u2019s motion, appellants\u2019 trials were consolidated. After a jury trial, appellants were convicted of Robbery in the Second Degree. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Appellants argue that it was error for the court to submit an accomplice instruction to the jury where the charges against Soares and Suratt, respectively, specifically referred to the use of force by appellants against separate individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">As can be seen, the complaint against Suratt states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">On or about the 22d day of August, 1989, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, HOLLE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>SURATT while in the course of committing a theft, did use force against <em>Conway Marks, </em>a person who was present, with intent to overcome that person\u2019s physical resistance or physical power of resistance, thereby committing the offense of Robbery in the Second Degree in violation of Section 708-841 (l)(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The charge against Soares states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">COUNT I: On or about the 22d day of August, 1989, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, RONALD SOARES, while in the course of committing a theft, did use force against <em>Mitchell Tam, </em>a person who was present, with intent to overcome that person\u2019s physical resistance or physical power of resistance, thereby committing the offense of Robbery in the Second Degree in violation of Section 708-841 (l)(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">(Emphasis added and in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">While it is not necessary for the State to specifically charge a defendant as an accomplice, <em>State </em>v. <em>Apao, </em>59 Haw. 625, 646, 586 P.2d 250, 263 (1978), nevertheless, we hold that under the circumstances herein, where each defendant is charged separately and each charge involves different facts with different victims, an accomplice instruction should not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The Hawaii and the federal Constitutions as well as our rules of penal procedure clearly require that appellants be informed of the charges against them. Hawaii Const. art. I, \u00a7 14; U.S. Const. amend. VI; Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 7(d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jendrusch, </em>58 Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 (1977). Given that appellants were charged separately, it would only have been fair for the State to assert the circumstances in which appellants acted as accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We further conclude that the court\u2019s accomplice jury instruction was a misstatement of Hawaii law. The accomplice instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">All persons who are present and participate in the commission of a crime [are] responsible for the acts of each other done or made in furtherance of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">It is not necessary to prove that each one committed all of the acts of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Each person who does one act which is an ingredient of the crime or immediately connected with it is as guilty as if he or she committed the whole crime with his or her own hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Accomplice liability is specifically defined in our criminal statutes as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">(1) With the <em>intention </em>of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">(b) Aids or agrees or attempts to aid the other person in planning or committing it[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">HRS \u00a7 702-222 (1985) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">Section 702-222 requires that to be guilty as an accomplice, a person must act with the <em>intent </em>of promoting or facilitating the commission of the crime. The court\u2019s accomplice instruction clearly does not contain such a mens rea element. The court\u2019s instruction implies that a person merely needs to be present and participate in an act of the crime to be guilty as an accomplice. Under the court\u2019s accomplice instruction, the State is relieved from its burden of proving that appellants acted with the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Appellants also assert that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct substantially prejudiced their right to a fair trial. According to appellants, the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks during jury selection and his repeated misconduct during trial, by themselves, require reversal of their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We have repeatedly stated that \u201c[t]he duty of the prosecution is to seek justice, to exercise the highest good faith in the interest of the public and to avoid even the appearance of unfair advantage over the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>67 Haw. 121, 122, 680 P.2d 251, 253 (1984); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Pemberton, </em>71 Haw. 466, 476, 796 P.2d 80, 85 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Quelnan, </em>70 Haw. 194, 198, 767 P.2d 243, 246 (1989). In this case, the record contains numerous examples of the prosecutor\u2019s disregard for appellants\u2019 right to a fair trial. For example, during jury selection, the prosecutor asked a prospective juror her feelings about someone who did something wrong but did not have adequate counselling in his or her \u201cformative years.\u201d After Soares\u2019 counsel objected and asked the court to instruct the prospective jurors not to infer from any of the attorneys\u2019 questions that anyone had done anything wrong, the prosecutor remarked, \u201cif nobody has done anything wrong, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Further examples of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct include the prosecutor\u2019s repeated attempts to introduce evidence previously excluded by motion in limine, numerous \u201cspeaking objections,\u201d and leading questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Although no single instance of prosecutorial misconduct substantially prejudiced appellants\u2019 right to a fair trial, we find that the cumulative weight of the prosecutor\u2019s improper conduct was so prejudicial as to deny appellants a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kahalewai, </em>55 Haw. 127, 516 P.2d 336 (1973); <em>Pemberton, </em>71 Haw. 466, 796 P.2d 80 (1990). Upon review of the record, we are convinced that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the number of instances of improper conduct by the prosecutor created \u201c \u2018an atmosphere of bias and prejudice which no remarks by the trial court could erase. \u2019 \u201d <em>Kahalewai, </em>55 Haw. at 129, 516 P.2d at 338 (quoting <em>Scott </em>v. <em>State, </em>47 Ala. App. 509, 512, 257 So. 2d 369, 371 (Crim. App. 1972)).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ajl\"><em>Richard S.
