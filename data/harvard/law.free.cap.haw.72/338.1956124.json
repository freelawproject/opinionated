Rev. Stat. [(HRS)] \u00a7 431-448(a) (1985) [Hawaii\u2019s uninsured motorist statute] permits a government employee to recover uninsured motorist benefits for work related injuries, where that employee is statutorily barred by the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 <em>et seq., </em>from prosecuting a tort action against the uninsured tortfeasor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">As a condition precedent to recovery of uninsured motorist benefits under HRS \u00a7 431^448(a), a person must show that he or she is \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d from the uninsured tortfeasor. However, when the uninsured tortfeasor is the employer of such person, the requirement of HRS \u00a7 431-448(a) cannot be met since the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d provision of the workers\u2019 compensation statute would preclude a tort claim against the employer. We therefore answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On May 12, 1988, William G. Royston (Royston) was employed as a federal police officer for the Pearl Harbor Naval Base. While seated in his assigned patrol vehicle, which was owned by the United States government, Royston sustained personal injuries when the driver\u2019s seat he was adjusting collapsed backwards unexpectedly. As a result of the accident, Royston sought and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Royston made a claim for uninsured motorist benefits under his own automobile liability insurance coverage with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) based on his contention that the patrol vehicle assigned to him was \u201cuninsured\u201d because it was not covered under any automobile liability policy on the date of the accident. Royston argues that under FECA he will not recover all the damages that he could otherwise recover from an individual tortfeasor in a personal injury action, and therefore seeks uninsured motorist benefits with respect to such uncompensated elements of damages. Royston further argues that since the policy itself contemplates payment of uninsured motorist benefits in conjunction with the insured\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, he is entitled to such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Hawaii\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, HRS \u00a7 431-448(a), provides in pertinent part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">No automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy insuring against loss resulting from bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be delivered ... with respect to any motor vehicle... unless coverage is provided... for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are <em>legally entitled to recover damages from </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles </em>because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting therefrom. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">State Farm\u2019s uninsured motorist provision, which is consistent with HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 448(a), provides as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">We will pay damages for bodily injury an insured is <em>legally entitled to collect from the owner </em>or driver <em>of an uninsured motor vehicle. </em>The bodily injury must be caused by an accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of an uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In response to Royston\u2019s claim, State Farm filed a complaint for declaratory relief seeking a declaration that uninsured motorist coverage is not applicable to Royston\u2019s accident because its uninsured motorist provision and Hawaii\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 448(a), limit uninsured motorist benefits to those \u201cwho are legally entitled to recover damages from owners ... of uninsured motor vehicles.\u201d State Farm argues that FECA creates a federal employee\u2019s exclusive remedy for work-related injuries. FECA limits the federal government\u2019s liability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">The liability of the United States ... under this sub-chapter . . . with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States ... to the employee ... and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages, from the United States ... because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen\u2019s compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186(c). State Farm reasons that since FECA bars Royston from asserting a tort claim against the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>government, which owned the uninsured vehicle, he is not \u201clegally entitled to recover damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment, for which the determinative legal issue is the certified question set forth above. For purposes of this appeal, State Farm agrees that the government vehicle is \u201cuninsured.\u201d However, in its motion for summary judgment, State Farm reserved its right to argue at trial that the government vehicle was insured since the United States Government is a self-insurer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, for purposes of the discussion that follows, we presume that the government vehicle is \u201cuninsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">With one exception,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> every court that has decided the precise issue now before this court has concluded that uninsured motorist coverage is not available to a claimant whose tort action is barred by the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d provision of a workers\u2019 compensation statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are persuaded by the rationale of the overwhelming majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In the most recent case, <em>Kough </em>v. <em>New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association, </em>237 N.J. Super. 460, 568 A.2d 127 (1990), which echoes the majority view, claimant Kough was injured while riding in an automobile driven by an uninsured co-employee. Kough received benefits under New York\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, which immunized the negligent co-employee from a tort suit. Kough brought suit to compel her own insurer to arbitrate her claim for uninsured motorist benefits. The uninsured motorist insurance policy provision at issue in <em>Kough </em>and New Jersey\u2019s uninsured motorist statute are similar to State Farm\u2019s policy provision and Hawaii\u2019s uninsured motorist statute. Each permitted uninsured motorist recovery where the claimant was \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d damages from the uninsured motorist. Finding that Kough was not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d damages from the uninsured co-employee, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">Two rationales are generally relied on in cases holding in favor of the insurer. The first is that the express language of the policy (and usually the statute) requires that the insured be legally entitled to recover damages. Such coverage is considered \u201ccontingent upon there being liability\u201d by an uninsured motorist. Since a coemployee [sic] cannot be liable, neither can the insurer. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">The second and better rationale emphasizes the intention of the Legislature since most of the jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that have addressed the issue mandate [uninsured motorist] coverage by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><em>Rough, </em>237 N.J. Super, at 466-67, 568 A.2d at 131. Citing the rationale found in <em>Sayan </em>v. <em>United Services Automobile Association, </em>43 Wash. App. 148, 716 P.2d 895 (1986), the <em>Rough </em>court further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">in tracing the history of financial responsibility statutes, the <em>Sayan </em>court noted that [uninsured motorist] coverage was intended to fill a \u201cgap\u201d to compensate innocent automobile accident victims injured by drivers who violated the statutory requirement of carrying liability coverage. With regard to whether the innocent victim should have a more effective remedy against his [uninsured motorist] carrier than he would have against the negligent driver himself, who for some reason was immune from tort liability, the court concluded, after considering the statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">We see no evidence that the Legislature intended for the victim of an uninsured motorist to receive compensation that he could not obtain even were the negligent driver in compliance with the financial responsibility statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\"><em>Rough, </em>237 N.J. Super. at 467, 568 A.2d at 131 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Similarly, our review of the legislative history of Hawaii\u2019s uninsured motorist statute confirms our opinion that such coverage does not apply unless the uninsured owner or operator is liable in tort. When HRS \u00a7 431-448(a) was originally enacted in 1965, a House Standing Committee Report included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">An insurance company offering uninsured motorist protection engages to pay to the insured . . . sums . . . for any uncollectible <em>valid claim </em>or unsatisfied judgment for damages resulting from bodily injury or death, resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>automobile. <em>The claim becomes payable when the innocent victim shows that his claim is valid, that is, that there is legal liability on the person alleged to be responsible[.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">House Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 194, 1965 House Journal, at 582 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In the present case, Royston claims that the federal government, which owned the vehicle involved in the accident, is \u201cthe person alleged to be responsible.\u201d However, the alleged tortfeasor, his employer, is immune from suit and thus is not \u201clegally liable.\u201d Therefore, Royston does, not have a \u201cvalid claim\u201d within the meaning of the uninsured motorist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Under both State Farm\u2019s uninsured motorist provision and the language of HRS \u00a7 431-448(a), tort liability of the uninsured owner or operator is a prerequisite for recovery. <em>See Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. v. </em>Dodson, 235 Va. 346, 350-51, 367 S.E.2d 505, 508 (1988) (phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d interposes a condition precedent to uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s obligation, requirement that insured have legally enforceable right to recover damages from uninsured motorist). However, Royston argues that the Hawaii uninsured motorist statute should be broadly construed to apply even where tort immunity is conferred by other statutes. To adopt Royston\u2019s position would be to ignore the plain, unambiguous language of the insurance contract and the uninsured motorist statute. <em>See Perkins v. Insurance Co. of N. America, </em>799 F.2d 955, 962 (5th Cir. 1986) (phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d is \u201csimply too unambiguous to admit of judicially created exception.\u201d). Moreover, the adoption of Royston\u2019s position would be anomalous because it would place him in a better position by virtue of the fact that the federal government vehicle was uninsured. If the government vehicle had been insured, Royston would not have been able to recover against that insurance policy since FECA would have barred any tort action against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The expressed purpose of Hawaii\u2019s uninsured motorist statute is to \u201cpromote protection, through voluntary insurance, for persons who are injured by uninsured motorists who <em>cannot pay </em>for personal injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents.\u201d House Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 194, 1965 House Journal, at 582 (emphasis added). It is clear that our legislature intended to provide for those instances where persons have suffered personal injuries for which no compensation or recourse would be available to the injured party due to the financial irresponsibility of the guilty motorist. We see no need to \u201ctorture the meaning\u201d of the uninsured motorist statute to provide a remedy to Royst\u00f3n when he has already been provided with one. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. </em>Boynton, 486 So. 2d 552, 559 (Fla. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The sole exception to the majority view is found in <em>Barfield </em>v. <em>Barfield, </em>742 P.2d 1107 (Okla. 1987). In a sharply divided five to four decision, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the uninsured motorist carrier. The <em>Barfield </em>court held that the wife of an employee who was killed on the job could recover uninsured motorist benefits even though she had already received death benefits from her husband\u2019s employer pursuant to the provisions of Oklahoma\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Despite the language of the Oklahoma uninsured motorist statute, which is similar to Hawaii\u2019s, the court decided that the wife\u2019s claim was \u201cpurely contractual\u201d and that the \u201c[e]mployer-employee <em>tort </em>immunity under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not preclude recovery under one\u2019s own contract of insurance with an insurance carrier unrelated to the employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1111 (emphasis in original). The court interpreted the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d to mean simply that the insured be able to establish fault on the part of the uninsured motorist giving rise to damages and to prove the extent of those damages. Thus, the <em>Barfield </em>majority concluded that uninsured motorist coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201cmay be co-existent with the protection under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Relying on the majority\u2019s reasoning in <em>Barfield, </em>Royston asserts that the immunity imposed by workers\u2019 compensation should not preclude his recovery of uninsured motorist benefits pursuant to his contract with State Farm. We disagree. We believe that the dissenting opinion in <em>Barfield, </em>which is in accord with the majority of jurisdictions who have faced the same issue, expresses the better-reasoned view. Under the reasoning of the dissent, uninsured motorist coverage \u201cextends <em>only </em>to situations in which the offending motorist <em>lacks </em>insurance...; it does not apply when the owner or operator <em>is cloaked with immunity from liability. </em>In the latter event, the insured <em>cannot be </em>regarded as one who, within the meaning of [Oklahoma\u2019s uninsured motorist statute], stands \\ . . <em>legally entitled to recover damages </em>from . . .\u2019 the uninsured tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1113 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In light of the clear and unambiguous language \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d as well as the expressed purpose and intent of Hawaii\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, we decline to adopt the holding of the <em>Barfield </em>court, which disregards the plain meaning of Oklahoma\u2019s uninsured motorist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Royston further argues that \u201cthe standard form uninsured motorist endorsement contemplates payment of uninsured motorist benefits in conjunction with the insured\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d Royston points to the following provision contained in State Farm\u2019s policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">THERE IS NO [UNINSURED MOTORIST] COVERAGE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>2. TO THE EXTENT IT BENEFITS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">a. ANY WORKER\u2019S COMPENSATION OR DISABILITY BENEFITS INSURANCE COMPANY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">b. A SELF-INSURER UNDER ANY WORKER\u2019S COMPENSATION, OR DISABILITY BENEFITS OR SIMILAR LAW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Royston argues that \u201c[t]he clear import of such a provision is to attempt to avoid any lien a worker\u2019s compensation insurer or self-insured might have with respect to proceeds paid under the uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d State Farm agrees that this contractual provision, commonly referred to as the workers\u2019 compensation \u201cset-off\u2019 clause, is intended to preclude duplicative payment of uninsured motorist and workers\u2019 compensation benefits. However, State Farm argues, and we agree, that the set-off provision applies only in those cases where an insured was injured while in the course and scope of his employment, entitling him to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and where such injuries were caused by an uninsured stranger to the employment who was not protected by the workers\u2019 compensation immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">In <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>649 F. Supp. 1455 (E.D. Va. 1986), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>851 F.2d 736 (4th Cir. 1988), the federal court adopted the very argument advanced by Royston in this case and held that uninsured motorist benefits be paid to plaintiff with an offset for workers\u2019 compensation coverage. The Virginia Supreme Court, on a certified question from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, found that the condition precedent interposed by the unambiguous phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages\u201d was not met, thus rendering the question of set-off moot. <em>Aetna Casualty and Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Dodson, </em>235 Va. 346, 367 S.E.2d 505 (1988). Similarly, we find the set-off provision here to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>be inapplicable since Royston is not \u201clegally entitled\u201d to uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AbO\"><em>Richard B. Miller (William C. McCorriston, </em>with him on the brief, of McCorriston, Miho &amp; Miller) for Plaintiff-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aq0\"><em>Ian L. Mattoch (Henry R. Lohdell </em>with him on the brief) for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We acknowledge that Royston\u2019s recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits will not fully compensate him for the injuries received as a result of the accident. However, under the circumstances of this case, we simply see no intent on the part of the legislature to allow recovery of benefits under both the workers\u2019 compensation and uninsured motorist statutes. Under the current state of the law, such recovery is precluded and can only be afforded by legislative action amending the law. Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> Rule 13 of the Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">(a) When Certified. When a federal district or appellate court certifies to the Hawaii Supreme Court that there is involved in any proceeding before it a question concerning the law of Hawaii which is determinative of the cause, and that there is no clear controlling precedent in the Hawaii judicial decisions, the Hawaii Supreme Court may answer the certified question by written opinion.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> HRS \u00a7 431-448(a), the uninsured motorist statute in effect at the time of Royston\u2019s accident, did not define \u201cinsured motor vehicle.\u201d The question raised is whether an \u201cinsured motor vehicle\u201d is limited to vehicles covered by an insurance policy and excludes self-insured vehicles.
