Kipi (Kipi). The charges were based on the same conduct that supported a criminal contempt charge against Kipi for which he had already been convicted and sentenced by the family court. We find that double jeopardy principles bar the subsequent prosecution and therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">On October 11, 1989, at 4:00 a.m., Kipi entered the home of his ex-girlfriend, Linda Yamasaki (Yamasaki). While in the residence, Kipi threatened Yamasaki and two other persons, Sergio Chaulet (Chaulet), Yamasaki\u2019s boyfriend, and David Harris (Harris), Yamasaki\u2019s housemate. A complaint against Kipi was filed on October 24, 1989, for the offense of Burglary in the First Degree, in violation of HRS \u00a7 708-810(l)(c) (count I) and Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS \u00a7 707-717(1), based on the threats against Yamasaki, Chaulet and Harris (counts II, III and IV, respectively). On November 6,1989, Kipi pleaded not guilty to the charges in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Before the incident in question, Yamasaki had petitioned the family court for a temporary restraining order (TRO) for protection against Kipi. Yamasaki\u2019s petition was granted on August 7, 1989 and a TRO issued. On August 21, 1989, the family court extended the protective order, pursuant to a show cause hearing, until February 17,1990. Thus, the protective order was in effect at the time Kipi broke into Yamasaki\u2019s house on October 11, 1989. The protective order was a form order in which the following was checked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Petitioner(s) [Yamasaki] and Respondent(s) [Kipi] are mutually enjoined and restrained from contacting, threatening or abusing each other and anyone living with the other party (including but not limited to their home or place of employment) and maliciously damaging the property of the other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On October 12,1989, the day after Kipi\u2019s alleged burglary and threats, a police officer filed a family court petition against Kipi alleging that he had intentionally disobeyed the protective order and thereby committed the offense of Criminal Contempt of Court, in violation of HRS \u00a7 710-1077. On December 7,1989, the State was ready to proceed to trial in family court on the contempt charge against Kipi when he moved to change his plea to no contest. The State did not object to the change of plea, but asked that five months of incarceration be imposed upon Kipi because of the egregious nature of the offense. In responding to the court\u2019s request for particular facts constituting the protective order violation, the prosecutor stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">a. The violation of the Protective Order did arise out of an incident in which Defendant did contact Petitioner, Ms. Linda Yamasaki, at her home on October 11, 1989, very early in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">b. Ms. Linda Yamasaki was asleep at the time and awoke upon hearing the Defendant enter into her home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">c. Also awakened by Defendant\u2019s entrance into the home were Mr. David Harris, Mr. Serio [sic] Chaulet, and Ms. Rebecca Moore, all of whom reside with Ms. Yamasaki.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">d. At the time of the violation, the Defendant did make verbal threats to Ms. Linda Yamasaki, Mr. Serio Chaulet, and Mr. David Harris.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>In addition, the prosecutor noted on the record that he believed, based upon his reading of the police report, that additional criminal charges might be brought against Kipi. The State has stipulated that the prosecutor knew of the pending burglary and terroristic threatening charges that had been filed in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The family court accepted Kipi\u2019s plea of no contest and sentenced him to five months incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">On February 13, 1990, jury selection began for the burglary and terroristic threatening offenses. After the jury was selected but before the jurors were sworn, the defense orally moved to dismiss the entire complaint based on double jeopardy and HRS \u00a7 701-109, the compulsory joinder rule. The trial court agreed that Kipi was being retried for the same actions for which he was serving five months. However, the court dismissed only counts I and II, which involved Yamasaki, because the court believed that the family court order specifically dealt with her alone. The court declined to dismiss counts III and IV, which involved Chaulet and Harris, on the ground that these offenses were outside the jurisdiction of the family court when it ruled on the violation of the protective order. Trial on counts III and IV continued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury was unable to reach a decision and the court declared a mistrial. The State has not retried counts III and IV, and now appeals the dismissal of counts I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The State alleges that the trial court erred in ruling that Kipi\u2019s no contest plea in family court to a misdemeanor criminal contempt charge bars subsequent prosecution of the related burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and terroristic threatening charges in circuit court. In responding to the State\u2019s argument, we address the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">1. Is there a conflict between HRS \u00a7 701-109(2), the compulsory joinder rule, and HRS \u00a7 710-1077(4), which allows prosecution for substantive offenses in addition to contempt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">2. Can actions or evidence that supported a contempt prosecution also be used to support a subsequent prosecution on substantive criminal charges without violating the double jeopardy rules set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>110 S. Ct. 2084 (1990)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">A. Is there a conflict between HRS \u00a7 701-109(2), the compulsory joinder rule, and HRS \u00a7 710-1077(4), which allows prosecution for substantive offenses in addition to contempt?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) provides that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">a defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode, if such offenses are known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction of a single court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The Commentary to the statute notes that this subsection \u201crequires joinder of the trials of two or more offenses based on the same conduct,\u201d subject to the court\u2019s power to order severance if justice so requires. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 701-109(3). The rule reflects a policy \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>defendants should not have to face the expense and uncertainties of two trials based on essentially the same episode.\u201d HRS \u00a7 701-109 Commentary. This compulsory joinder of offenses requirement of \u00a7 701-109(2) acts as a procedural limitation on the State\u2019s power under \u00a7701-109(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to seek convictions for all offenses resulting from a single course of conduct. <em>State v. Aiu, </em>59 Haw. 92, 96, 576 P.2d 1044, 1047 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The criminal contempt statute, HRS \u00a7 710-1077, provides that when a contempt also constitutes another offense, the contemnor may be charged with and convicted of the other offense \u201cnotwithstanding the fact that he has been charged with or convicted of the contempt.\u201d HRS \u00a7 710-1077(4). This provision is consistent with HRS \u00a7 701-109(l)\u2019s provision that when the same conduct may establish an element of more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The compulsory joinder requirements of HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) would also apply to contempt charges. A contempt charge must therefore be tried with any other offense arising from the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>conduct, except where the other offense or the contempt offense was not known to the prosecuting officer at the time of the first trial, or the contempt offense is not within the jurisdiction of the same court as the other offense or offenses. The compulsory joinder statute is not inconsistent with the contempt statute, the former simply places limits on the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In the context of the present case, the compulsory joinder rule does not apply, because the contempt charge and the other charges were not within the jurisdiction of a single court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Family court had exclusive jurisdiction of the contempt charge and did not have original jurisdiction over the burglary and terroristic threatening charges, contrary to Kipi\u2019s argument that family court, as a division of circuit court, has the same general jurisdiction as circuit court. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 571-14(2) (family court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to try adults charged with any violation of an order issued by a family court judge). Although family court may waive its jurisdiction over an offense, such a waiver is discretionary and not mandatory. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court in this case had no jurisdiction to try the contempt charge unless the family court chose to waive its jurisdiction. Moreover, as a court of limited jurisdiction, the family court could not hear the burglary and terroristic threatening charges. Thus, HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) did not require compulsory joinder in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Resolution of this statutory issue, however, does not resolve the constitutional issue raised by Kipi below that double jeopardy bars any later prosecution based on the conduct supporting his conviction for criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>B. Can actions or evidence that supported a contempt prosecution also be used to support a subsequent prosecution on substantive criminal charges without violating the double jeopardy rule set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>110 S. Ct. 2084 (1990)?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Until recently, both federal and state double jeopardy law was an outgrowth of <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299 (1932), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the \u201cDouble Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits successive prosecutions for the same criminal act or transaction under two criminal statutes whenever each statute does not \u2018requir[e] proof of a fact which the other does not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grady, </em>110 S. Ct. at 2087. In the present case, the protective order restrained Kipi from \u201ccontacting, threatening, or abusing [Linda Yamasaki] and anyone living with [her].\u201d In order to prosecute the contempt charge, the State was required to prove that Kipi contacted, threatened, or abused Yamasaki or any of her housemates; that Kipi knew he was ordered not to do so; and that he intentionally disobeyed the order. HRS \u00a7 710-1077(g). To prosecute the burglary charge, the State would be required to prove that Kipi intentionally entered Yamasaki\u2019s house in reckless disregard that it was another\u2019s dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein. HRS \u00a7 708-810(1 )(c). To prove the terroristic threatening charge, the State would have to show that Kipi intentionally or recklessly threatened Yamasaki, Harris, and Chaulet. HRS \u00a7707-717. Thus, to prove the burglary and terroristic threatening charges, the State would be required to prove facts different from and additional to those it used to prove the criminal contempt charge in this case. Therefore, under the traditional <em>Blockburger </em>test, the subsequent prosecution of the burglary and terroristic threatening charges in this case would not have been barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>However, in May 1990 the Supreme Court broadened the scope of double jeopardy protection. In <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>110 S. Ct. 2084, 2093 (1990), the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">the Double Jeopardy Clause bars any subsequent prosecution in which the government, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In <em>Grady, </em>defendant Corbin\u2019s automobile struck oncoming vehicles, causing the death of one person and serious injury to another. Corbin was served with two misdemeanor traffic tickets, one charging him with driving while intoxicated and the other with failing to keep to the right of the median. He pleaded guilty to the traffic citations. The presiding judge, who was not informed of the fatality or pending homicide investigation, accepted the guilty plea and later imposed a sentence on Corbin of a $350 fine, a $10 surcharge, and a six-month license revocation. Two months after the sentencing on the traffic violations, a grand jury indicted Corbin, charging him with, among other violations, reckless manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and third-degree reckless assault. A bill of particulars identified three acts upon which the prosecution would rely to prove the charges: (1) operation of a motor vehicle on a public highway in an intoxicated condition; (2) failing to keep right of the median; and (3) driving at a speed too fast for the weather and road conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Corbin moved to dismiss the indictment on the constitutional ground of double jeopardy. The New York Court of Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the indictment, finding that the State\u2019s intention to rely on the prior traffic offenses as the acts necessary to prove the homicide and assault charges violated the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s dictum in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410 (1980). <em>Vitale </em>had suggested that, even if two successive prosecutions were not barred by the <em>Blockburger </em>test, the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>prosecution would be barred if the government sought to establish an essential element of the second crime by proving the conduct for which the defendant was convicted in the first prosecution. <em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. at 420. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Grady, </em>and adopted the \u201csame conduct\u201d suggestion from <em>Vitale. Grady, </em>110 S. Ct. 2084 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In reaching its holding in <em>Grady, </em>the Supreme Court \u201crejected the contention that the test of <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932) \u2014 which provides that cumulative penalties, and thus successive prosecutions, should not be barred if each offense charged requires proof of an element which the other does not \u2014 constituted the full extent of double jeopardy protection.\u201d <em>United States v. Gambino, </em>742 F. Supp. 855, 857 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>923 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). Under the <em>Grady </em>test, Kipi cannot be prosecuted for burglary or for terroristic threatening. The conduct that the State would use to prove those crimes is the identical conduct that the family court considered when it accepted Kipi\u2019s no contest plea, and particularly when it sentenced him to five months incarceration based on the egregiousness of the contempt violation. Kipi\u2019s entering of Yamasaki\u2019s house and his threats to her and two of her housemates was the exact conduct that constituted the offense of contempt with respect to the family court\u2019s protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In <em>Grady, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause embodies three protections: \u2018It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grady, </em>110 S. Ct. at 2090 (citation omitted). Here, under the <em>Grady </em>rule, Kipi must be protected from a second prosecution and multiple punishments for offenses based on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>conduct as the contempt offense for which he was charged, convicted, and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Apparently only one state supreme court to date has considered whether <em>Grady </em>applies to the prosecution of substantive criminal charges following a conviction for contempt based upon the same conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Magazine, </em>302 S.C. 55, 393 S.E.2d 385 (1990), the facts of which are virtually the same as in this case, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that a defendant who was charged with contempt for violating a family court restraining order by physically abusing his estranged wife could not be prosecuted for assault and battery based on the same incident. The court found that because defendant was ordered by family court to serve one year in prison or pay to the court a fine of $1,500, the contempt sanction was criminal in nature. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause applied to protect against a second prosecution based on the same conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court concluded that at defendant\u2019s trial for assault and battery, the State proved the same conduct for which the defendant had previously been criminally sanctioned by the family court. Thus, under the <em>Grady </em>test, the successive prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court specifically rejected the State\u2019s contention that prosecution in a court of limited jurisdiction such as family court does not bar a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>subsequent prosecution in a court of general jurisdiction. 302 S.C. at 58 n.4, 393 S.E.2d at 387 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In applying <em>Grady </em>to this case, we reach the same conclusion as did the South Carolina court. Kipi may not be subsequently prosecuted for the substantive offenses which were based on the same conduct that led to his contempt conviction. This point leads to a review of the Commentary to Hawaii\u2019s contempt statute, which states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Subsection (4) [of HRS \u00a7 710-1077] provides that contempts which constitute both contempt and another offense do not relieve the defendant of liability for the other offense merely because its commission was contemptuous of the court. For example, if a person were to cause disorder in the courtroom, during the course of proceedings, by assaulting another person, he would be guilty of contempt. He would also be guilty of an assault. The fact that the court imposed summary punishment for the contempt, or <em>the fact that he was put in jeopardy for the misdemeanor offense of criminal contempt of court, would not allow the defendant to plead double jeopardy </em>to a charge of assault based on the same conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">HRS \u00a7 710-1077 Commentary (emphasis added). After <em>Grady, </em>this commentary is no longer valid. Constitutional principles of double jeopardy would bar a second prosecution for assault after a defendant was put in jeopardy for the offense of criminal contempt based on the same conduct. The circumstances of Kipi\u2019s case are analogous to the hypothetical of the commentary, and the <em>Grady </em>test applies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>As pointed out in Justice Scalia\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Grady, </em>what the new double jeopardy test in effect requires is that prosecutors observe a rule previously rejected by the Supreme Court \u201cthat all charges arising out of a single occurrence must be joined in a single indictment.\u201d <em>Grady, </em>110 S. Ct. at 2096 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Based on the <em>Grady </em>rule, what a prosecutor should do in circumstances such as in the present case is to obtain a waiver from family court on the contempt charge and proceed in circuit court on all of the charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In addition, although the issue is not specifically now before this court, we conclude that the <em>Grady </em>rule bars the prosecution (following the mistrial) of the other two charges against Kipi that were not dismissed by the court below. The trial court believed that these terroristic threatening charges, based on Kipi\u2019s threats to Yamasaki\u2019s housemates, were not within the jurisdiction of the family court. However, that conclusion addresses only whether the charges should have been joined under HRS \u00a7 701-109(2). Because the protective order prohibited Kipi from contacting, threatening, or abusing not only Yamasaki but anyone living with her, and because the State informed the family court judge of Kipi\u2019s threats to the housemates, which the court apparently considered in entering the requested five-month jail sentence, double jeopardy principles bar a second prosecution based on those threats.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AvZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Patricia A.

In one <em>pre-Grady </em>case, the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed a court of appeals ruling that a nonadversarial summary contempt proceeding arising out of an incident in which the defendant struck the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>prosecutor with his fist and which resulted in a sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment did not involve the possibility of successive prosecutions and thus did not bar a subsequent indictment against the defendant for aggravated battery based on the same acts. <em>People v. </em>Totten, 118 Ill. 2d 124, 514 N.E.2d 959 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> Since the charges against Kipi were brought before <em>Grady </em>was decided, the prosecutor in the present case cannot be faulted for failing to obtain a waiver. In addition, the trial court\u2019s dismissal of charges that is now on appeal to this court occurred in February 1990, which means the court did not have <em>Grady </em>to rely on for law on double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
