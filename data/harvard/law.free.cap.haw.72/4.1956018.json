Appellant/ Cross-Appellee Heinz Gemer (Gemer) was the president and sole stockholder of a subsequently dissolved Hawaii corporation H.S. Bounty, Inc., which had a ten-year license to operate a seafood restaurant known as H.S. Bounty in the Whaler\u2019s Village on the island of Maui. The licensor was Amfac, Inc. During the term of the license, appellee/cross-appellant Trustees of the Estate of James Campbell, Deceased (Trustees) purchased the Whaler\u2019s Village <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>from Amfac, Inc. and thus became the licensor of the restaurant premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">When the license had approximately three years to run, the licensee corporation made an oral agreement with one William Fyke (Fyke) whereby he would purchase the license for the sum of $450,000 provided he could get a five-year extension of the license. The consent of the Tmstees was necessary to effectuate this agreement, and it was denied on the basis that the licensor felt that Fyke did not have enough restaurant experience. Subsequently, the licensee sold the restaurant and the license to Fyke for $100,000 with an agreement that if the license were extended, Fyke would pay an additional $50,000. The license was extended and the $50,000 payment made. Subsequently Fyke sold the premises and the extended license for $875,000 and shortly thereafter, Gemer filed this action, the corporation, in the meanwhile, having been dissolved under the laws of the State of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The complaint, filed October 14,1987, contained nine counts: Count I \u2014 promissory estoppel; Count II \u2014 breach of a written contract; Count III \u2014 interference with existing contractual relations; Count IV \u2014 interference with prospective economic advantage; Count V \u2014 breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing; Count VI \u2014 fraud, misrepresentation or deceit, a second Count VI \u2014intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress; Count VII \u2014 unfair business practices; and Count VIII \u2014 punitive damages. The record below consists of nine volumes and reflects both extensive discovery and extensive preliminary proceedings by way of motions. Eventually the court granted summary judgment to the Trustees on certain counts and ordered the rest to trial. After trial, the court granted a directed verdict for the appellees on the remaining counts and entered judgment for them. The appellees requested costs and attorneys\u2019 fees and the court made an award thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>From the judgment, Gemer took this appeal, claiming error in the granting of the summary judgments, and the directed verdicts, error in the exclusion of evidence, by way of orders in limine, and at trial, and error in the granting of attorneys\u2019 fees to the appellees. The appellees cross-appealed, alleging error in the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Upon a review of the record, we find no error in the evidentiary rulings complained of, no error in the orders granting summary judgment, no error in the orders granting directed verdict, and no error in the granting of attorneys\u2019 fees to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The only error we find in the record concerns the cross-appeal. The trial court, in its judgment recited that pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 607-14, it was granting the appellees attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $48,300. HRS \u00a7 607-14 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Attorneys\u2019 fees in actions in the nature of assumpsit. In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of assumpsit there shall be taxed as attorneys\u2019 fees, in addition to the attorneys\u2019 fees otherwise taxable by law, to be paid by the losing party and to be included in the sum for which execution may issue, a fee which the court determines to be reasonable but which shall not exceed the amount obtainable under the following schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">25 per cent on first $ 1,000 or fraction thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">20 per cent on second $1,000 or fraction thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">15 per cent on third $ 1,000 or fraction thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">10 per cent on fourth $1,000 or fraction thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">5 per cent on fifth $ 1,000 or fraction thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-12\">2.5 per cent on any amount in excess of $5,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The above fees shall be assessed on the amount of the judgment exclusive of costs and all attorney\u2019s fees obtained by the plaintiff, and upon the amount sued for if the defendant obtains judgment. The fees provided for by this section shall not be taxed in any action where the plaintiff obtains a judgment which includes attorneys\u2019 fees upon a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness, when the promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness contains a provision for the recovery of costs of collection or attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The license agreement between H.S. Bounty, Inc. and Amfac, Inc. provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">In case the Licensor shall, without fault on its part, be made a party to any litigation commenced by or against the Licensee arising out of the Licensee\u2019s occupancy of the licensed premises or any act of the Licensee concerning the licensed premises or this License Agreement. .. the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor all expenses incurred in connection therewith, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and court costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">HRS \u00a7 607-17 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">[Wjhere an action is instituted in the district or circuit court on a promissory note or other contract in writing which provides for an attorney\u2019s fee the following rates shall prevail and shall be awarded to the successful party, whether plaintiff or defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">(1) Where the note or other contract in writing provides for a fee of twenty-five per cent or more, or provides for a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, not more than twenty-five per cent shall be allowed;</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>R. Patrick Jaress (Shackley F. Rajfetto </em>on the briefs; Jaress <em>&amp; </em>Raffetto, of counsel) for Gemer.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AF\"><em>Rosemary Fazio {Adrian W. Rosehill </em>with her on the briefs; Ashford &amp; Wriston, of counsel) for Trustees and MacMillan.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">provided that the fee allowed . . . shall not exceed that which is deemed reasonable by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">With respect to the Trustees, as appellees, clearly HRS \u00a7 607-17 is the applicable statute, not \u00a7 607-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">As to appellee Stephen H. MacMillan (MacMillan), he was the Trustees\u2019 employee acting on their behalf. Since each count of the complaint re-alleges once more all of the paragraphs preceding it in the complaint, it is impossible to distinguish MacMillan\u2019s position from the Trustees\u2019 position. Moreover, since each count arises out of the existence of the license agreement, no apportionment of fees between the counts based on breach of the license agreement, and the other counts can reasonably be made. In these circumstances, therefore, HRS \u00a7 607-17 was the applicable statute as to MacMillan also.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">While both HRS \u00a7\u00a7 607-14 and -17 provide for the award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, they have differing maxima, HRS \u00a7 607-17 being the higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Where the case sounds in \u201cassumpsit\u201d but there is a specific contractual provision for attorney\u2019s fees, that provision, under HRS \u00a7 607-17, should be followed in awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">The judgment below is therefore affirmed, except as to the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and the matter is remanded to the circuit court to determine reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded to the appellees in accordance with the provisions of the license agreement and of HRS \u00a7 607-17. Affirmed in part and remanded in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
