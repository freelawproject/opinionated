The issue before us is whether the constitutional principle of double jeopardy bars the retrial of a defendant who had been charged with two counts of DUI pursuant to subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7291-4 but was \u201cacquitted\u201d of one of the counts. We find that under such circumstances there is no double jeopardy bar, and we reverse the ICA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Dow was charged with DUI under HRS \u00a7 291-4(a)(1) (driving under the influence) (count I) and \u00a7 291-4(a)(2) (driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.10 percent or more) (count II) and tried before a jury. After the State rested, Dow moved for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29(a) of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). The trial court granted the motion as to count I only, entered a \u201cjudgment of acquittal,\u201d and submitted the (a)(2) count to the jury. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on count II, and the court declared a mistrial. A second trial was scheduled on count II, and Dow filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion and trial commenced. The jury found Dow guilty of count II. After entry of the judgment of conviction, Dow appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The ICA reversed, finding that since the trial court \u201cacquitted\u201d Dow under HRS \u00a7 291 \u2014 4(a)(1) in the first trial, the second trial placed him twice in jeopardy for the same offense and thus violated the double jeopardy clauses of both the United States and Hawaii Constitutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>No. 13610 (Haw. App. Oct. 3, 1990). We granted the State\u2019s application for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy \u201cprotects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). The Double Jeopardy Clause applies to all acquittals, whether \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>jury verdict or by a direction of the court, either after the prosecution has completed its case or after all evidence is in.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bernhardt, </em>840 F.2d 1441, 1447 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 954 (1988). In this case, if Dow were tmly acquitted by the trial court during his first trial, a second trial would be prohibited. However, we find that Dow\u2019s acquittal was in form only; therefore the second trial, which led to his conviction, was constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The DUI statute, HRS \u00a7 291-^4(a) (1985), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">A person commits the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">(1) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of the operation of any vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">(2) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of the operation of any vehicle with 0.10 per cent or more, by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Previously, this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wacker, </em>70 Haw. 332, 770 P.2d 420 (1989), treated subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the DUI statute as two separate offenses. Wacker was charged under both HRS \u00a7 291-4(a)(1) and <em>-4(a)(2). </em>Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 701-109(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> both charges were tried together. At trial, Wacker was acquitted of the (a)(1) count, however, the jury was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>reach a verdict as to the (a)(2) count. Subsequently, the trial court dismissed the (a)(2) count based upon its belief that it was required to do so under HRS \u00a7 701 \u2014 111(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Wacker </em>court concluded that \u201c[t]he construction placed by the court below, on HRS \u00a7 701-111(1), leads to an untenable result, which frustrates the purpose of HRS \u00a7 701-109(2).\u201d 70 Haw. at 333, 770 P.2d at 421. The <em>Wacker </em>court further stated, \u201c[b]ut for [HRS \u00a7 701-109(2)], [Wacker] could have been tried separately on the <em>offenses </em>under HRS \u00a7 291-4(a)(1) and-4(a)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Following the rationale in <em>State </em>v. <em>Arakaki, 1 </em>Haw. App. 48, 744 P.2d 783 (1987),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this court concluded that double jeopardy did not bar a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>retrial of the (a)(2) count and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">More recently, this court has held that the DUI statute provides two alternative means of proving a single offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grindles, </em>70 Haw. 528, 531, 777 P.2d 1187, 1190 (1989). In <em>Grindles, </em>defendant was charged with violating HRS \u00a7 291 \u2014 4(a). At a bench trial, after the State\u2019s direct examination of the arresting officer, the court announced that it would bifurcate the hearing and take all testimony supporting the (a)(1) charge first. If the State made a case under that subsection, the court said it would not take evidence supporting the (a)(2) charge. The trial court found defendant guilty of violating HRS \u00a7 291 \u2014 4(a)(1), and the case was concluded without further evidence regarding the (a)(2) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">On appeal of <em>Grindles, </em>this court, in a footnote, declined to adopt the \u201cdictum\u201d from <em>Wacker </em>which indicated that HRS \u00a7 291 \u2014 4(a)(1) and \u20144(a)(2) are separate offenses. Following our pronouncement in <em>Grindles, </em>the statutory analysis employed in <em>Wacker </em>is no longer applicable. Therefore, to the extent that our opinion today is inconsistent with <em>Wacker, </em>we overrule the latter. We also overrule <em>Arakaki </em>to the extent that its analysis assumed that the separate counts under (a)(1) and (a)(2) represented two separate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In <em>Grindles, </em>this court found that the bifurcation of the two methods of proof provided in \u00a7 291-4(a) into separate trials violated defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. In another footnote, this court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">We also note that bifurcation of a DUI trial into two separate hearings under HRS \u00a7 291-4(a)(l) and-4(a)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>may subject the defendant to double jeopardy. In this case, jeopardy attached when the court began to hear the State\u2019s evidence. Appellant was not subjected to double jeopardy, however, since the trial court adjudicated him guilty at the conclusion of the State\u2019s proof under \u00a7 29 l-4(a)( 1), and did not proceed to hold a second hearing under \u00a7 291-4(a)(2). <em>However, in the event the defendant is acquitted under \u00a7 291-4(a)(1) and the court allows the State to proceed under \u00a7 291-4(a)(2), the defendant will have been twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense in violation of article I, section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution and the eighth [fifth] amendment to the US. Constitution.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">70 Haw. at 533 n.3, <em>777 </em>P.2d at 1191 n.3 (emphasis added). The ICA adopted this dictum from <em>Grindles </em>when it reversed Dow\u2019s conviction in the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In doing so, however, the ICA overlooked the procedural context in which <em>Grindles </em>was decided and misplaced its reliance on the footnote in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">This court in <em>Grindles </em>specifically disapproved of the bifurcation of the two methods of proof allowed by the DUI statute. While the trial court in <em>Grindles </em>erroneously bifurcated the DUI offense, defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy since the trial court adjudicated him guilty of the (a)(1) charge, thus negating a second hearing on the (a)(2) count. However, we predicted what the consequences of that error could have been: subjecting the defendant to double jeopardy if, after acquittal of one DUI count, there was a second trial on the other DUI count. The thrust of our decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Grindles </em>is that there should never be bifurcation, in any form, of the single offense of DUI. As this court held, DUI is one offense that must be tried at one time. Therefore, a trial court should not \u201cacquit\u201d a defendant of part of a DUI offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">This conclusion is buttressed by HRPP 29(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">Motions for directed verdict are abolished and motions for judgment of acquittal shall be used in their place. The court on motion of a defendant or of its own motion shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal <em>of one or more offenses </em>alleged in the charge after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction <em>of such offense or offenses. </em>If a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the prosecution is not granted, the defendant may offer evidence without having reserved the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">(Emphasis added.) Although Dow urges that the trial court\u2019s action operated as an acquittal of the entire offense of DUI, thus barring a second trial following the mistrial on the (a)(2) count, the rule makes clear that the court may not acquit a defendant of less than the entire offense of DUI. We find, therefore, that the trial court erred in entering a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Further, it is obvious from the record that the trial court did not intend to dismiss the entire offense since the case was submitted to the jury to consider the second method of proof. We find that the trial court did not acquit the defendant of anything. Instead, we conclude that the trial court made a factual finding, equivalent to a jury\u2019s special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Dow, however, focuses on the fact that the trial court entered a <em>\u201cjudgment </em>of acquittal\u201d instead of a finding of not gqilty. Since only one judgment may be entered under HRS \u00a7 291-4(a), Dow submits that retrial is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>To reach the same conclusion as the defense in this case would require us to interpret the judgment of acquittal in a hypertechnical manner, elevating form over substance. The United States Supreme Court has emphasized on several occasions that \u201cwhat constitutes an \u2018acquittal\u2019 is not to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571 (1977) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\"><em>Martin Linen </em>involved criminal contempt charges against defendant corporations. After the federal district court discharged a deadlocked jury, it granted defendants\u2019 motion and entered judgments of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court granted the motion on the ground that the Government had failed to prove facts constituting criminal contempt, and commented that the case was the weakest the court had ever seen. 430 U.S. at 571-72. The Government appealed the acquittals to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">At issue on appeal was whether the trial court\u2019s acquittals on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence triggered double jeopardy protection when there were no verdicts of acquittal formally returned by the jury. The Court of Appeals answered in the affirmative and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The United States Supreme Court, on appeal, affirmed specifically stating that \u201cit is plain that the District Court in this case evaluated the Government\u2019s evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d 430 U.S. at 572. The Supreme Court concluded that the judgments of acquittal entered by the district court \u201cwere \u2018acquittals\u2019 in substance as well as form.\u201d 430 U.S. at 571-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Moreover, the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201cvalid judgments of acquittal were entered on the express authority of, and strictly in compliance with Rule 29(c).\u201d 430 U.S. at 570. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>contrast, as we have explained above, the trial court in <em>Dow </em>did not have the authority under HRPP 29(a) to enter a judgment of acquittal as to less than the entire offense of DUI, and the judgment thus was not strictly in compliance with the rule. On this basis alone, Dow\u2019s judgment of acquittal was not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Of even greater importance is that in <em>Martin Linen, </em>the Supreme Court did not rely merely on the fact that <em>judgments </em>of acquittal had been entered as dispositive of whether double jeopardy was implicated; the Court looked beyond the judgments to determine their constitutional significance. 430 U.S. at 570-71. We are likewise compelled to examine the circumstances of the judgment in this case to decide whether the principle of double jeopardy proscribed further prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In deciding <em>Martin Linen, </em>the Supreme Court enunciated the test under which a defendant is deemed acquitted. A defendant is acquitted only when \u201cthe ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of <em>some </em>or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d 430 U.S. at 571 (emphasis added). Dow argues that the <em>Martin Linen </em>test is applicable in barring the retrial since by entering a judgment of acquittal on the (a)(1) count, the judge resolved \u201csome of the factual elements\u201d of the DUI offense. We disagree. The trial court\u2019s characterization of its action as an \u201cacquittal\u201d and the ICA\u2019s acceptance of such characterization does not necessarily make it so. We reiterate that the trial court, in \u201cacquitting\u201d Dow, only resolved the factual elements of one method of proving the DUI offense, which was not fatal to the State\u2019s case as there remained a completely separate method of proving the offense. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Grindles, </em>70 Haw. 528, <em>777 </em>P.2d 1187 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Martin Linen </em>did not have before it a charge that statutorily could have been proved in two independent ways. This distinction is critical to our determination that the test enunciated in <em>Martin Linen </em>is inapplicable to the instant case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>that the judgment of acquittal in Dow was in form only and not in substance.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4W\">On the brief: <em>Charlotte Jean Duarte, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for petitioner-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Al4\">On the brief: <em>Earle A. Partington </em>(Partington &amp; Foley) for respondent-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Dow was not twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense when he was retried following a mistrial on the (a)(2) count, despite the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment of acquittal on the (a)( 1) count. We therefore reverse the ICA\u2019s decision and remand the case to the ICA for consideration of the issues raised on appeal other than double jeopardy. .</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\"> The Double Jeopardy Clause of the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution provides in relevant part, \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d Article I, section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution provides, \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-12\"><em> </em>HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) (1985) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode, if such offenses are known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction of a single court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\"> HRS \u00a7 701-111(1) (1985) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Although a prosecution is for a violation of a different statutory provision or is based on different facts, it is barred by a former prosecution under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">(1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal which has not subsequently been set aside[.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\"> Defendant Arakaki was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle not insured under a no-fault policy and DUI. With respect to the DUI offense, Arakaki contended and the State conceded on appeal, that \u201cinsufficient foundation was laid for the admission of the intoxilyzer test result and the evidence was improperly admitted.\u201d 7 Haw. App. at 55, 744 P.2d at 787. The question that remained was whether the case should be remanded for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">At the original trial, the court specifically found Arakaki guilty of the DUI offense pursuant to subsection (a)(2), however, was silent regarding the (a)(1) charge. On appeal, the State requested that the case be remanded for a determination of Arakaki\u2019s guilt under the (a)(1) charge. Arakaki contended that such a remand would place him twice in jeopardy for the same offense. Keeping in mind that the ICA treated the (a)(1) and (a)(2) charges as separate offenses, it held that \u201cthe trial judge, the trier of fact, had full opportunity to render his decision on the HRS \u00a7 29 1-4(a)( 1) charge.\u201d 7 Haw. App. at 56, 744 P.2d at 788. Having failed to do so, the ICA concluded that Arakaki could not be retried on the (a)(1) charge insofar as his \u201cjeopardy for that offense came to an end at the conclusion of the bench trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The case, however, was remanded for retrial on the (a)(2) count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>based on the ICA\u2019s holding that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s admission of the intoxilyzer test result into evidence was a trial error.
