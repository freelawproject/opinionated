NO. 86-0347(3))</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b93-8\">FEBRUARY 15, 1991</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b93-9\">LUM, C.J., PADGETT, HAYASHI, WAKATSUKI, AND MOON, JJ.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT BY</p>\n<author id=\"AkS\">LUM, CJ.</author>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">In this appeal, we consider three issues: 1) whether the condition of drug-testing by urinalysis was properly imposed as one of the conditions for Appellant\u2019s probation; 2) whether the lower court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the urinalysis tests; and 3) whether the urinalysis tests violated Appellant\u2019s right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">We hold that the trial court was correct in concluding that there were sufficient circumstances which justified the imposition of the condition and that the court was clearly authorized by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 706-624(2) (Supp. 1989) to require the Appellant to refrain from use of any narcotic drugs and to submit to periodic urinalysis or similar testing procedure. Furthermore, we hold that Appellant was not subject to any warrant-less searches nor was his right against self-incrimination violated. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">In February of 1987, Appellant Ricky Kalani Morris entered a guilty plea to Burglary in the First Degree. There was no evidence that this offense was committed for drug use or that Appellant was presently addicted to drugs. However, Appellant admitted in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>presentence report that he smoked six joints of marijuana daily, with his last use being between 1984 and 1985. He also revealed that he started drinking at about age 12, drinking an average of 14 cans of beer a day. Although he reported that he stopped drinking in 1986, Appellant indicated that he had been drinking at the time of the offense; he had consumed about five beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">On April 22, 1987, he was sentenced to probation for five years. Two of the terms of the probation were that Appellant abstain from the use of alcohol and drugs, and that he submit to drug testing. Appellant did not object to these conditions at this time, nor did he ever object to the drug testing until his probation was revoked for testing positive for cocaine twice in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">On March. 9, 1989, Appellant took his fifth urinalysis and tested positive for cocaine. He then admitted that he had used cocaine a few days earlier and that he used cocaine every two weeks for the past two months. His probation officer advised Appellant to seek drug treatment; but a month later, Appellant tested positive for cocaine again.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The State sought to revoke Appellant\u2019s probation due to his two positive drug tests, and at the hearing, introduced the test results over Appellant\u2019s objection. The court revoked Appellant\u2019s probation and resentenced him to an indeterminate term of ten years imprisonment, despite the probation officer\u2019s recommendation that Appellant be incarcerated for one year, under HRS \u00a7 706-660(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Appellant contends that the condition of drug testing was not reasonably related or reasonably necessary to his offense since there was no evidence that his burglary was for the furtherance of drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The statute in question, HRS \u00a7 706-624(2) Conditions of Probation, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">(2) Discretionary conditions. The court may provide, as further conditions of a sentence of probation, to the extent that the conditions are reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 706-606 and to the extent that the conditions involve only deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in section 706-606(2), that the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">(i) Refrain from use of alcohol or any use of narcotic drugs or controlled substances without a prescription;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">(m) Submit to periodic urinalysis or other similar testing procedure; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">We recognize that the discretionary conditions must be reasonably related to the factors set out in \u00a7 706-606 and such conditions involve only deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably necessary for the purposes of \u00a7 706-606(2). Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence under HRS \u00a7 706-606 are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">[t]he court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">(2) The need for the sentence imposed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for law, and to provide just pun- . ishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">Appellant\u2019s argument seems to ignore that requiring that the probation condition of drug testing bear a reasonable relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>to the offense committed is only one of many factors the court must consider in imposing a sentence. Rather, the court must also consider Appellant\u2019s history of past drug use, as well as the need to reflect the seriousness of not using drugs while on probation, to encourage his respect for the law and to deter future criminal conduct. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not improperly impose drug testing as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Appellant also contends that, even if the court was authorized by the above statutes to impose drug testing, Appellant\u2019s probation officer had no reasonable suspicion to order him to submit to the urinalysis tests. Appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>State v. Fields, </em>67 Haw. 268, 686 P.2d 1379 (1984), is misplaced. As a prelude to our discussion <em>of Fields, </em>we begin by acknowledging that urinalysis drug testing is a search under the Hawaii Constitution. <em>McCloskey </em>v. <em>Honolulu Police Dep\u2019t, </em>71 Haw. 568, 799 P.2d 953 (1990). In <em>McCloskey, </em>while we implicated the Constitution, we held such searches to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In <em>Fields, </em>we overturned an overly broad probation condition requiring the defendant to \u201cbe subject at all times during her period of probation to a warrantless search of her person, property, and place of residence for illicit drugs and substances by any law enforcement officer including her probation officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 686 P.2d at 1384. The court in <em>Fields </em>did not address the specific issue of whether the condition of drug testing was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">As in <em>McCloskey, </em>we find that similarly those on probation have a diminished expectation of privacy with respect to the minimal intrusions of drug testing which are in furtherance of the State\u2019s reasonable interests set out in HRS \u00a7 706-606. While probationers have a right to enjoy a significant degree of privacy and liberty, as the court in <em>Fields </em>admitted, there is \u201climited freedom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>afforded someone who but for the grace of the sentencing court would be in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 686 P.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In particular, Appellant\u2019s situation does not involve, as <em>Fields </em>did, a \u201cnear total surrender of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 686 P.2d at 1387. Rather, the testing is carried out in a reasonable manner and is no more intrusive than needed. <em>Fields </em>is further distinguished from Appellant\u2019s situation since, at the time <em>Fields </em>was decided, HRS \u00a7 706-624 did not contain a specific condition authorizing the court to impose drug testing, as HRS \u00a7 706-624(2)(m) now does, but rather allowed the court to order any condition that would reasonably relate to the rehabilitation of the defendant and was not unduly restrictive. Here, the court acted within the authority provided by HRS \u00a7 706-624(2)(m) and, thus, no reasonable suspicion is required for conducting the tests and the evidence of the tests need not be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the probation officer must have reasonable suspicion to order such testing makes no sense in view of our ruling that the judge is allowed to impose such a condition and that such condition is reasonable. The probation officer is merely carrying out a mandate of the court, and a further condition to the performance of his duties is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Lastly, Appellant argues that the probation condition of drug testing and his admission of drug use during a meeting with his probation officer violated his right against self-incrimination. This argument is also without merit as Appellant fails to recognize the key distinction courts have made between \u201ctestimonial\u201d and physical evidence obtained from a defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">[T]he privilege against self-incrimination is not necessarily implicated whenever a person suspected of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>criminal activity is compelled in some way to cooperate in developing evidence which may be used against him.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AB8\"><em>Susan Arnett {Joyce K. Matsumori-Hoshijo </em>on the brief), Deputy Public Defenders, for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AG9\"><em>Simone Polak {James B. Takayesu </em>on the brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"At\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>67 Haw. 293, 302, 687 P.2d 544, 551 (1984) (citations omitted). The Court in <em>Wyatt </em>distinguished between \u201ccommunicative\u201d evidence from the defendant and making him the source of \u201creal or physical evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 687 P.2d at 551. Drug testing, like taking a blood sample, fingerprint comparisons and handwriting exemplars, does not infringe upon the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Appellant also claims that his admission to his probation officer of his drug use was not free and voluntary, and further claims that the sentencing judge abused his discretion in resentencing Appellant to a term of incarceration for ten years. We find both claims without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\">DISSENTING OPINION BY</p>\n<author id=\"Aur\">WAKATSUKI, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">I respectfully dissent from Part III of the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>67 Haw. 268, 686 P.2d 1379 (1984), this court held that a warrantless search of a probationer\u2019s person, property, and place of residence for illicit drugs is constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>valid in limited circumstances. One, the search must be initiated by a probation officer pursuant to a program of rehabilitation. Two, the search must \u201cbe justified by a reasonable suspicion supportable by specific and articulable facts that dangerous drugs and substances are being secreted by the probationer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 686 P.2d at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Fully recognizing that probationers have a diminished expectation of privacy, and that there is substantial governmental interest in programs designed for the rehabilitation of probationers, this court nonetheless stated that a probationer\u2019s \u201cinterest in privacy is [not] insignificant... that she may be subjected to searches at the supervisor\u2019s caprice or fancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 686 P.2d at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The State concedes in this case that it had no reasonable suspicion that Morris had ingested any illegal drug or substance. Pursuant to <em>Fields, </em>the search, i.e., the urinalysis, was then constitutionally invalid. Therefore, the fruits of that search should have been suppressed. Otherwise, any warrantless taking of urine from a probationer for analysis opens the door to harassment of the probationer at the whim of the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The majority attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Fields </em>by holding that urinalyses of probationers are reasonable searches not proscribed by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Recently, this court held that the urinalysis program conducted by the Honolulu Police Department on its own police officers constituted reasonable searches not proscribed by the constitution. <em>McCloskey v. Honolulu Police Dep\u2019t, </em>71 Haw. 568, 799 P.2d 953 (1990). In reaching that determination, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADe\">\u201cThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447, 481 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 578, 799 P.2d at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Relying on extensive evidence presented to the trial court, this court upheld warrantless urinalyses of police officers based on considerations that police carry firearms, that their duties place them in life-threatening situations requiring split-second judgment in use of firearms, and that police officers are often in use and control of motor vehicles. Furthermore, the integrity of the police department and public trust and confidence in police officers are legitimate state interests which weighed in the balance of requiring urinalyses of police officers. This court also considered the diminished expectation of privacy one has when employed as a police officer, the fact that the testing program was no more intrusive than needed and that the police department had no other practical and available means of responding to concerns of drug use in the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The same considerations which led this court in <em>McCloskey </em>to conclude that a urinalysis of a police officer is a reasonable search are not present in this case. Nonetheless, the majority perfunctorily states that \u201cthe testing is carried out in a reasonable manner and is no more intrusive than needed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statement is unexplained in the majority opinion and unsupported by the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"A2L\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The majority also claims that <em>Fields </em>is distinguishable because \u201cat the time <em>Fields </em>was decided, HRS \u00a7 706-624 did not contain a specific condition authorizing the court to impose drug testing, as HRS \u00a7 706-624(2)(m) now does[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\"><em>Fields </em>held that a warrantless search of a probationerwithout reasonable suspicion runs afoul of our constitution. A legislative enactment purporting to authorize that which is unconstitutional cannot stand. \u201cAn unconstitutional act is not a law; it binds no one, and protects no one.\u201d <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Worthen, </em>120 U.S. 97, 101-02 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">HRS \u00a7 706-624(2)(m) cannot be read as authorizing warrant-less urinalysis of a probationer absent reasonable suspicion. <em>Fields </em>is not distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">I would hold that the urinalysis conducted in this case was constitutionally invalid, and therefore, any evidence obtained therefrom should have been suppressed. The order revoking Morris\u2019 probation should be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\"> In <em>McCloskey, </em>this court deemed it important enough to note that the police officer was permitted to provide a urine sample in the privacy of an enclosed toilet stall without visual observation of a moniter. Conversely, in this case there was evidence that Morris had to produce his urine sample while under the direct visual observation of a probation official.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
