Medina, Jr. (Medina). The charge was dismissed because of the State\u2019s failure to personally serve the order as required by HRS \u00a7 586-6. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">On July 17, 1990, Sieglinde Laminman (Laminman) filed an ex parte petition for a temporary restraining order with the Family Court of the Third Circuit pursuant to HRS \u00a7 586-4, requesting that Medina be restrained from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing her. A restraining order was issued by the court but was never personally served on Medina.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">On September 4, 1990, the State petitioned the Family Court of the Third Circuit, alleging that by contacting Laminman, Medina had committed a misdemeanor under HRS \u00a7 586-11. Despite evidence that Medina had actual knowledge of the order the Family Court dismissed the petition, finding that personal service had not been made upon Medina.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">HRS \u00a7 586-6 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">Any order issued under this chapter shall be personally served upon the respondent unless the respondent was present at the hearing in which case the respondent may be served by regular mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">HRS \u00a7 586-11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">Whenever an order for protection is granted pursuant to this chapter and the respondent or person to be restrained knows of the order, violation of the order for protection is a misdemeanor. . ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">The State argues that legislative intent would be furthered if these provisions are read to allow prosecutions under \u00a7 586-11 in circumstances where the State has not complied with the personal service requirement of \u00a7 586-6 but where the person to be restrained \u201cknows of the order.\u201d We find this argument unconvincing.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aau\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Gilbert Halpern {Janet R. Garcia </em>on the briefs), Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys, for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4p\"><em>Rose Anne Fletcher, </em>Deputy Public Defender, for defendantappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">Where statutory language is plain and unambiguous, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive unless literal application would produce an absurd or unjust result clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palama, </em>62 Haw. 159, 612 P.2d 1168 (1980). The plain wording of HRS \u00a7 586-6 requires personal service of an order. The only stated exception is where the respondent is present at the hearing at which the order issues, in which case the order may be mailed. In all other cases we believe that the personal service requirement eliminates any chance of misunderstanding or confusion by providing assurance that a defendant prosecuted under the provisions of HRS \u00a7 586-11 has received a written copy of the order, and therefore, knows the exact content of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
