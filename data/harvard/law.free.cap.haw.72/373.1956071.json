Demand under DCRCP 38 was properly made. Therefore it was error for the district court to try and to decide the amount of damages arising from appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>breach of contract. We therefore uphold appellant\u2019s point of error no. 1 and vacate the judgment for damages arising out of breach of the lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In order to pass upon the summary possession issue, the district court had to determine whether appellee\u2019s exhibit C or appellant\u2019s exhibit 1 was the true lease. The court determined that exhibit C was the true lease. This is a finding of fact supported by substantial evidence and not clearly erroneous. It was a necessary finding in disposing of the possession claim. Therefore, in any further proceedings, it will be the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In addition, the court below had to find that appellant had breached the lease by failing to pay the rent as set forth therein. This was a finding of fact supported by substantial evidence and not clearly erroneous. It was a necessary finding in order to pass upon the possession action and therefore, in any further proceedings, it will be the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The amount of damages arising from appellant\u2019s breach of the lease was, however, a jury issue and will have to be tried again.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">As to the denial of the motion for new trial, that was within the discretion of the court, and we affirm the same. As to the matter of the alleged right of redemption under HRS \u00a7 666-14, we agree with appellee that any right of redemption was waived by the express provision therefor in the lease. Moreover, HRS \u00a7 666-14 deals actually with stays of judgments for summary possession and the record is devoid of any showing of compliance therewith by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Appellant complains of the trial court\u2019s finding of fraud but that finding does not affect either the right of appellee to summary possession, or the amount of damages for breach of lease which may be assessed on retrial. Accordingly, it is not necessary to pass upon it, one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part and remanded with instructions to the district court to transfer the trial of the issue of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>arising out of the breach of the lease to the circuit court for jury trial.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AvY\"><em>Dennis W.
