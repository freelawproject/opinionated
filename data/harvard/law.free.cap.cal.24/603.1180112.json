We conclude the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting the hearsay evidence. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">As stated by the Court of Appeal, the relevant facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">On an October evening in 1994, Leslie Sullivan was working at the computer in her home while her two children were down the hall sleeping. Suddenly, a barrage of bullets hit the house. Running toward the children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>room, Ms. Sullivan was struck in the thigh with an' assault rifle bullet. Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s deputies later found numerous shell casings and spent rounds, including some from a nine-millimeter weapon and some from a 7.62-millimeter assault rifle, in front of the Sullivan residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Police officers served search warrants at the residences of Eran Knox, William (Billy) Morris and defendant. At defendant\u2019s residence, the officers recovered a .22-caliber revolver, a 12-gauge shotgun, ammunition, gun cleaning kits and photographs of handguns. None of the recovered guns or ammunition matched those used in the attack at the Sullivan home. Defendant refused to talk to the police officers and was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">No evidence was recovered at Knox\u2019s residence, but he was handcuffed and transported to the police station. There, Knox told officers that, on the evening of the shooting, he, Morris and defendant met with friends at B orchard Park, where they smoked marijuana and drank rum. Defendant suggested they shoot at the residence of Tam Nguyen in retaliation for a shooting several months earlier. Knox and Morris initially refused, but defendant persuaded Morris to join him. Defendant, Morris and Gilberto Lopez left in Morris\u2019s car; Knox stayed behind. A short time later, Knox heard gunshots. Subsequently, Knox telephoned his brothers and asked them to pick him up at the park. As he was waiting for his brothers to arrive, Knox saw defendant, Morris and Lopez return. Knox also told officers he previously had seen at defendant\u2019s house a Tec-9 and an SKS assault rifle and ammunition for each of these firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">At Morris\u2019s residence, officers recovered ammunition for a nine-millimeter weapon and a 7.62-millimeter weapon and paraphernalia for an SKS assault rifle. Several 7.62-millimeter casings found in Morris\u2019s backpack were made the same year and by the same manufacturer as those found outside the Sullivan residence. Morris was arrested, waived his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], and spoke to the officers. During the interview, Morris incriminated himself and defendant, saying, among other things, that they had realized from news accounts that they had shot at the wrong house.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Defendant and Morris were tried separately, Morris first. Morris was convicted and sentenced to the care of the California Youth Authority. Knox and Morris both testified at defendant\u2019s first trial, which ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Several jurors subsequently indicated they had been concerned about the reliability of Knox\u2019s testimony, which had been impeached with his prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">At defendant\u2019s second trial, the subject of this appeal, Knox again testified, and again his testimony was extensively impeached. Witnesses identified omissions and inconsistencies in his statements relating to, e.g., who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>was in Borchard Park on the night of the shooting and at what time, events in the park that night, the time at which Knox heard gunshots, marijuana and rum consumption by those present, Knox\u2019s movements and the movements of others, who was in the car and where, what kinds of guns Knox saw (or did not see) at defendant\u2019s residence, and the \u201cslim jimming\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Morris invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify, an invocation the parties stipulated was valid due to his possible prosecution for perjury should he testify. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude any evidence of Morris\u2019s postarrest statements, ruling that the statements, redacted to omit any reference to Morris\u2019s companions, were admissible as being against Morris\u2019s penal interest (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230, hereafter section 1230) and were relevant to corroborate Knox\u2019s testimony. The statements were placed into evidence by Sergeant Frank O\u2019Hanlon, who testified about what Morris had said to him after he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">During deliberations, the jury inquired twice about Morris\u2019s statements (asking to see Morris\u2019s \u201cconfession ... in its entirety\u201d) and once about Knox\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Defendant was convicted of shooting at an inhabited dwelling (Pen. Code, \u00a7 246), conspiracy to shoot at an inhabited dwelling <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1), 246) and assault with a firearm (id., \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)). The jury also found true a personal-firearm-use enhancement <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1)). Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">On appeal, the Court of Appeal, one justice dissenting, held that the trial court erred in admitting Morris\u2019s redacted statements because they did not satisfy the reliability requirement of section 1230 and, in addition, their admission violated defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Finding that the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of the statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]), the Court of Appeal reversed defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">We granted the People\u2019s petition for review and now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Having invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself, Morris was, for hearsay rule purposes, not available as a witness. (Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (a)(1); <em>People v. Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1251 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251], overruled on another point in <em>People v. Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 835 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436].) Accordingly, at his second trial defendant was afforded no opportunity to cross-examine Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Defendant contends, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that the trial court erred in admitting under section 1230 Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s testimony relating Morris\u2019s postarrest statements. Defendant also contends that the Court of Appeal correctly reversed his conviction because it was obtained in contravention of the federal constitutional guarantee, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment <em>(Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400, 403-405 [85 S.Ct. 1065, 1067-1069, 13 L.Ed.2d 923]), that the accused in a criminal prosecution shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\u201cIt is well established that \u2018we do not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely required to do so to dispose of the matter before us.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leonard </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 183, 187 [193 Cal.Rptr. 171, 666 P.2d 28].) Accordingly, before addressing defendant\u2019s confrontation clause claim, we examine his claim of error respecting the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">A. <em>Evidence Code Section 1230</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">. Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s testimony relating Morris\u2019s postarrest statements, admitted for the truth of those statements, was hearsay. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200, subd. (a).) Unless it falls within an exception to the general rule, hearsay is not admissible. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) \u201cThe chief reasons for this general rule of inadmissibility are that the statements are not made under oath, the adverse party has no opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, and the jury cannot observe the declarant\u2019s demeanor while making the statements.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuentes </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 956, 960-961 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 237]; see also <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 594, 598-599 [114 S.Ct. 2431, 2434-2435, 129 L.Ed.2d 476] [discussing similar rationale underlying federal hearsay rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In California, \u201c[e]vidence of a statement by a declarant having sufficient knowledge of the subject is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness and the statement, when made, ... so far subjected him to the risk of . . . criminal liability . . . that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u201d (\u00a7 1230.) The proponent of such evidence must show that the declarant is unavailable, that the declaration was against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the declarant\u2019s penal interest when made and that the declaration was sufficiently reliable to warrant admission despite its hearsay character. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 462 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 525, 907 P.2d 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">There is no dispute that Morris was unavailable. The question, therefore, is whether the trial court correctly determined that Morris\u2019s declaration was both against his penal interest and otherwise sufficiently reliable to warrant admission despite its hearsay character.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">1. <em>Against declarant\u2019s penal interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Morris\u2019s postarrest statements to police, as related in Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s testimony, indisputably contained admissions that appear on their face to be contrary to Morris\u2019s interest in avoiding criminal liability or punishment. Among other things, Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon testified that, while sitting in the police car after his arrest for shooting at the Sullivan house a little over a month after the incident occurred, Morris stated he had committed a drive-by shooting in retaliation for an earlier shooting, but that the wrong house had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">At the police station a short time later, Morris provided details. The sergeant testified that Morris stated he had been at B orchard Park \u201changing out\u201d with friends when, against the urging of one of them, Eran Knox, he decided to do the shooting and armed himself with a Tec-9 semiautomatic machine gun having a long clip. Morris related that he left the park in his own car, went by the house twice and, upon observing a light in the window, fired about 30 shots at the house. These statements tended, generally, to implicate Morris in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Nevertheless, \u201cthe precedents in the hearsay area provide a persuasive reminder that declarations against penal interest may contain self-serving and unreliable information\u201d and, consequently, \u201can approach which would find a declarant\u2019s statement wholly credible <em>solely because </em>it incorporates an admission of criminal culpability is inadequate.\u201d( <em>People v. Campa </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 870, 883 [206 Cal.Rptr. 114, 686 P.2d 634], italics in original.) As scholars have observed, \u201c \u2018a self-serving statement lacks trustworthiness whether it accompanies a disserving statement or not.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 419, 439, fn. 15 [124 Cal.Rptr. 752, 541 P.2d 296] <em>(Leach), </em>quoting Jefferson, <em>Declarations Against Interest: An Exception to the Hearsay Rule </em>(1944) 58 Harv. L.Rev. 1, 60.) Moreover, that a hearsay statement may be facially inculpatory or neutral cannot always be relied upon to indicate whether it is \u201ctruly self-inculpatory, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>merely [an] attempt[] to shift blame or curry favor.\u201d <em>(Williamson v. United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 603 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2436].) Even a hearsay statement that is facially inculpatory of the declarant may, when considered in context, <em>also </em>be exculpatory or have a net exculpatory effect. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Coble </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 187, 191 [135 Cal.Rptr. 199].) Ultimately, as the high court has noted, \u201cwhether a statement is self-inculpatory or not can only be determined by viewing it in context.\u201d <em>(Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 603 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2436].)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In view of such concerns, and as the People concede, we long ago determined that \u201cthe hearsay exception should not apply to collateral assertions within declarations against penal interest.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 882.) In order to \u201c \u2018protect defendants from statements of unreasonable men if there is to be no opportunity for cross-examination, \u2019 \u201d we have declared section 1230\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule \u201cinapplicable to evidence of any statement or portion of a statement not itself specifically disserving to the interests of the declarant.\u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 441, fn. omitted; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Shipe </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 343, 354 [122 Cal.Rptr. 701] [\u201ca declaration against penal interest must be \u2018distinctly\u2019 against the declarant\u2019s penal interest\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Under the rule of <em>Leach, </em>a hearsay statement \u201cwhich is in part inculpatory and in part exculpatory (e.g., one which admits some complicity but places the major responsibility on others) does not meet the test of trustworthiness and is thus inadmissible.\u201d <em>(In re Larry C. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 62, 69 [184 Cal.Rptr. 505]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Coble, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d at p. 191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Pursuant to the foregoing principles, only those portions of Morris\u2019s statements that were \u201cspecifically disserving\u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 441) to his penal interests were admissible under section 1230. Therefore, in redacting Morris\u2019s statements, the court should have excised \u201cany statement or portion of a statement\u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>at p. 441) that was not specifically disserving to Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The record reveals that the redacted version of Morris\u2019s statements related by Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon, while perhaps less exculpatory of Morris than an unredacted version would have been, nevertheless retained a number of statements that, far from \u201cspecifically disserving\u201d Morris\u2019s penal interests, positively served those interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon testified, for example, that Morris, while admitting he had committed a drive-by shooting, stated he shot \u201cat the wrong house\u201d and that he did the shooting \u201cin retaliation for an earlier shooting.\u201d Pressed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Morris explained \u201cthat he saw on TV that a lady had been shot in the leg, and that he realized then it had been the wrong house\u201d and that he had intended to shoot \u201cthe house of a guy who had done a drive-by shooting in the past.\u201d Morris also said that he had used a Tec-9 gun, but that a clip police found in his apartment \u201cwasn\u2019t the one used in the shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Most significantly, Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cQ. What, if anything, did Mr. Morris tell you about the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201cA. He said that he had shot at the wrong house. He actually went by the house twice, but then he shot at the house, because he saw a light on in the front window. He also said he didn\u2019t want to kill anybody, or take a chance of hurting anybody, so he shot high, at the roof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Thus, among the hearsay declarations admitted against defendant were statements and portions of statements that suggested Morris only <em>by mistake </em>(repeated reference to \u201cthe wrong house\u201d) participated in the shooting of the Sullivan residence and, hence, contributed to any injuries suffered by its occupants. Admitted also were statements and portions of statements that tended to cast a more sympathetic light on Morris\u2019s motives (\u201cretaliation for an earlier shooting\u201d) and intentions (\u201che didn\u2019t want to kill anybody\u201d or even \u201ctake a chance of hurting anybody\u201d) than authorities or a jury might otherwise perceive. Most significantly, especially in light of other evidence revealing that Morris was not the only shooter and that Ms. Sullivan was struck by a bullet (which facts Morris, at the time of his statements, knew from having been present and from the news reports he mentioned), the court admitted Morris\u2019s statements suggesting that Morris\u2014because, assertedly, he \u201cshot high, at the roof\u2019\u2014was not the shooter responsible for injuring Ms. Sullivan and endangering her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">We conclude that these portions of Morris\u2019s statements cannot, considered either on their own or in their net effect with other evidence, properly be characterized as \u201cspecifically disserving\u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 441) of Morris\u2019s penal interests. Rather, they tended sympathetically to describe Morris\u2019s participation in the shooting of the Sullivan residence, to minimize his responsibility for the injuries caused thereby and to imply that others who were or might become implicated should bear a greater share of the responsibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the statements were not specifically disserving to Morris, the trial court erred in admitting them into evidence against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>2. <em>Indicia of trustworthiness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">While redaction, when properly employed, can help ensure that only the \u201cspecifically disserving\u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 441) and, hence, most reliable, portions of a particular hearsay declaration are actually admitted into evidence, redaction cannot enhance the underlying or general trustworthiness of a declaration as a whole. By its nature an after-the-fact process employed with respect to a previously existing declaration, redaction as a logical matter simply cannot bear on, let alone alter, the declarant\u2019s motives or any other circumstance that might affect a given declaration\u2019s fundamental reliability and inform a court\u2019s assessment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Thus, even when a hearsay statement runs generally against the declarant\u2019s penal interest and redaction has excised exculpatory portions, the statement may, in light of circumstances, lack sufficient indicia of trustworthiness to qualify for admission. (See <em>People v. Shipe, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d at p. 354 [to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1230, a declaration must be distinctly against the declarant\u2019s penal interest \u201cand must be clothed with indicia of reliability\u201d]; see generally 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (4th ed. 2000) Hearsay, \u00a7\u00a7 150, 151, pp. 861-864 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\u201cTo determine whether [a particular] declaration [against penal interest] passes [section 1230\u2019s] required threshold of trustworthiness, a trial court \u2018may take into account not just the words but the circumstances under which they were uttered, the possible motivation of the declarant, and the declarant\u2019s relationship to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 607 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].) We have recognized that, in this context, assessing trustworthiness \u201c \u2018requires the court to apply to the peculiar facts of the individual case a broad and deep acquaintance with the ways human beings actually conduct themselves in the circumstances material under the exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Frierson </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 730, 745 [280 Cal.Rptr. 440, 808 P.2d 1197].)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Several factors persuade us that, redaction aside, Billy Morris\u2019s postarrest statements implicating defendant, in light of the circumstances under which they were uttered and the possible motivation of the declarant <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frierson, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 745), simply were not \u201csufficiently reliable to warrant admission despite [their] hearsay character\u201d <em>(People v. Cudjo, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 607).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">First, examination of the full, unredacted version of Morris\u2019s postarrest statements implicating defendant reveals that, however incriminating of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Morris himself the statements may in a general sense have been, they unmistakably also were \u201cattempts to shift blame or curry favor\u201d <em>(Williamson v. United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 603 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2436]) with the authorities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">As defendant points out, in his unredacted postarrest statements to Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon, Morris claimed that the idea of doing the drive-by shooting was not his, but his \u201cfriend\u2019s,\u201d i.e., \u201cDannyfs],\u201d and that the motive was retaliatory; the idea \u201ccame up because . . . Danny, was telling me that some guy, you know, was all trying to shoot him\u201d in a earlier drive-by shooting that had occurred within the previous month. Morris asserted that Danny had \u201cproblems with this guy for a long time\u201d and that \u201cthis guy\u201d was a gang member. Morris claimed he had \u201cno idea\u201d how the guns for the shooting had been obtained, that he had no firearms training and that he was not a marksman. Morris further claimed that, while Danny had the idea for the shooting and, having been goaded, \u201cthought he had to prove himself,\u201d Morris himself had just been drunk. In fact, as defendant points out, Morris claimed he had been <em>very </em>drunk because he had consumed a great deal of 151-proof rum.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Morris blamed the targeting of the Sullivan residence on \u201cwrong directions\u201d given by a \u201c[s]tupid idiot at the time,\u201d \u201c[s]ome Mexican guy\u201d who drove the car and persuaded Morris and Danny, over Morris\u2019s doubts, into believing the Sullivan house was the residence of the gang member who previously had shot at Danny. According to Morris, he and Danny \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hurt anybody that was innocent,\u201d but the person who was supposed to point out where the gang member lived \u201cdeliberately gave us the wrong house on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In describing the shooting itself, Morris stated that Danny\u2019s shots did not sound like they were automatic and that Danny used an assault rifle, pulling the trigger \u201cone at a time.\u201d For his own part, Morris (as noted earlier) claimed, \u201cI didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t want to kill nobody. I didn\u2019t want to take that chance of hurting anyone, so I didn\u2019t fire directly, you know, I fired from a point to where nobody can get hurt\u2014at the roof.\u201d After the shooting, according to Morris, he and Danny sat and talked about their \u201c[h]ope that we got the right house.\u201d In fact, neither in the police car at the time of his arrest nor at the police station thereafter did Morris utter a single simple statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>confirming his own culpability without alluding to the culpability of others or to circumstances he apparently thought might elicit sympathy or be considered mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Morris\u2019s statement that he fired at the roof plainly implied that \u201cDanny\u201d\u2014as the only other shooter\u2014was the person who actually wounded Ms. Sullivan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, having identified \u201cDanny\u201d as the originator of the shooting plan and the one who shot the assault rifle, Morris also provided information sufficient to enable the authorities to confirm that defendant was the \u201cDanny\u201d of whom he spoke. Morris at one point pretended not to know defendant\u2019s name, but assented when specifically asked if \u201cDanny\u201d was indeed the name of the person he earlier had identified as having had the idea of the shooting and if Danny\u2019s name and telephone number could be found on lists police had found in Morris\u2019s apartment. At another point, Morris noted he knew \u201ca couple\u201d of Dannys and asserted (after Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon gave defendant\u2019s full name and suggested he rode a bicycle) that \u201cit isn\u2019t the same guy.\u201d However, after confirming that \u201cthis thing ain\u2019t gonna come out that I told you anything about Danny,\u201d Morris identified the \u201cone Danny that I\u2019m talking about\u201d as coming from Los Angeles, driving a motorcycle and attending both Conejo Valley Continuation High School and a night school in Thousand Oaks. Morris also claimed \u201cone of his [i.e., Danny\u2019s] friends\u201d retrieved the weapons used in the shooting from the ditch where he and Danny had discarded them on the night of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Thus, from start to finish, in his postarrest statements to Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon, Morris evidently was. \u201ctrying to fasten guilt\u201d on others, including defendant, while \u201ckeeping his own skirts as clean as possible\u201d <em>(People v. Coble, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d at p. 191) under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The People concede that Morris\u2019s statements that he did not want to kill or hurt anyone \u201cdo not, upon initial review, appear disserving.\u201d However, the People suggest, they demonstrate Morris was attempting to explain his criminal action and are disserving to the extent they acknowledge he was involved in the criminal act. Perhaps so, but such would be true of any attempt to \u201cshift blame\u201d <em>(Williamson v. United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 603 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2436]) without completely denying involvement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>People\u2019s attempt in their briefing to parse Morris\u2019s postarrest statements to isolate portions that facially incriminate him misses the point, as it runs contrary to the principles both of <em>Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 419, where we recognized that collateral statements are not made trustworthy by proximity to incriminating statements, and <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. 594, where the high court stated that whether a statement is truly self-inculpatory can only be determined by viewing it in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Second, Morris\u2019s statements implicating defendant were made to police shortly after he had been apprehended, arrested, and taken into custody. Thus, they were \u201cmade in the coercive atmosphere of official interrogation.\u201d <em>(Dutton v. Evans </em>(1970) 400 U.S. 74, 87 [91 S.Ct. 210, 219, 27 L.Ed.2d 213].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The police officer who arrested Morris initially indicated that the authorities already knew what had happened and who was involved, and that police were in the process of serving warrants at the residences of Morris\u2019s friends. The officer further suggested that if Morris cooperated he might avoid spending the rest of his life in jail. In addition, Morris knew that physical evidence linking him to the crime was discovered when the police searched his residence. Under these circumstances, Morris may have believed that the police had sufficient evidence to link him to the crimes, and that he had little to lose and perhaps something to gain by admitting his role while attempting to minimize his participation and shift primary responsibility to others. Eventually, as discussed, Morris provided sufficient information to identify defendant as the other shooter who first had the idea to attack the residence and who likely fired the bullet injuring Ms. Sullivan. The transcript of Morris\u2019s confession suggests that Morris actually identified a photograph of defendant. Morris also claimed that the physical evidence discovered at his residence was left there by defendant the morning after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">As we previously have observed, there is a \u201cvast difference between an informant who comes in off the street to confess complicity in a crime and identify his confederate, and one who, caught with inculpatory evidence, identifies someone else as the principal culprit. [^] Information received from sources who are themselves the focus of pending criminal charges or investigations is inherently suspect. \u2018All familiar with law enforcement know that the tips they provide may reflect their vulnerability to police pressure or may involve revenge, braggadocio, self-exculpation, or the hope of compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 882.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The People suggest that because Morris\u2019s postarrest statements were redacted to delete express references to anyone except Morris, \u201cthe inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>drawn from custodial questioning [i.e., that it tends to elicit unreliable answers] should be neutralized.\u2019\u2019 As previously discussed, however, redaction by its nature cannot add to a statement\u2019s circumstantial trustworthiness. This is not to say that a well-redacted statement in a future case inevitably should be excluded as untrustworthy merely because the original unredacted statement was custodial or contains some self-serving remarks. Courts applying section 1230 to determine the basic trustworthiness of a proffered declaration are, rather, to \u201cconsider all the surrounding circumstances to determine if a reasonable person in [the declarant\u2019s] position would have made the statements if they weren\u2019t true.\u201d <em>(People v. Rios </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 852, 867 [210 Cal.Rptr. 271].)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Our concurring and dissenting colleagues deem only \u201cminor\u201d (cone. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 622) the exculpatory aspects of the hearsay that was admitted against defendant. As we have explained in detail, we do not share that assessment. Accordingly, we disagree our holding will cause courts in future cases \u201cto exclude most police confessions by nontestifying accomplices <em>out of hand, </em>even those portions so clearly and strictly self-incriminatory when uttered that they are almost certain to be true\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 625, italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We have observed that the entire rationale underlying the against penal interest hearsay exception \u201cbreaks down in a situation where a declarant in police custody seeks to exculpate himself by implicating another suspect.\u201d <em>(People v. Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 882; see also <em>People v. Shipe, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d at p. 354 [postarrest statement admitting some complicity but ascribing greater culpability to coparticipant lacks indicia of reliability].)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that, as a matter of state evidentiary law, the trial court erred in admitting into evidence Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s testimony relating Morris\u2019s postarrest statements implicating defendant. Morris\u2019s statements, even as redacted, contained assertions that were not themselves \u201cspecifically disserving to the interests of the declarant\u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 441) and, redaction aside, lacked sufficient indicia of trustworthiness <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cudjo, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 607) to qualify for admission under section 1230\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">B. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Because the prosecution\u2019s case depended so heavily on the unreliable and impeached testimony of Eran Knox\u2014for the corroboration of which Morris\u2019s hearsay statements ostensibly were introduced\u2014we also conclude that the court\u2019s error in applying section 1230 cannot be dismissed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>harmless under <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836-837 [299 P.2d 243], the standard applicable to state law error in the admission of hearsay. (See <em>People v. Reed </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 217, 231 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 914 P.2d 184]; <em>People v. Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1121-1122 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1]; <em>Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">As the Court of Appeal noted, several jurors in defendant\u2019s first trial, which ended in a hung jury, expressed concern about the reliability of Knox\u2019s testimony after it was impeached by the defense with his prior inconsistent statements. At defendant\u2019s second trial, the jury twice during deliberations inquired about Morris\u2019s statements and once about Knox\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Without Morris\u2019s hearsay statements, the prosecution\u2019s case against defendant was exceedingly weak. No physical evidence tied defendant to the Sullivan residence, nor did he make any incriminating statements. Defendant\u2019s roommate, Scott Ramirez, testified that he saw and heard defendant at their joint residence near the time of the shooting. He also testified that, although he had lived with defendant for more than two years, he had never seen an SKS assault weapon or a Tec-9 pistol in defendant\u2019s room or in the house they shared. The only evidence directly implicating defendant was Knox\u2019s testimony, which in many aspects was impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">For example, Michael McKendry, a senior investigator for the district attorney in Ventura County, testified for the People that, in an interview, Knox told him that he and his brother Eric together \u201cslim jimmed\u201d (i.e., broke into; see, <em>ante, </em>fn. 1) Billy Morris\u2019s automobile at Borchard Park on the night of the shooting, but the parties subsequently stipulated that Eric Knox, if called, would testify that it was on an entirely different night that his brother telephoned him to come to the park and do the slim jimming. Investigator McKendry testified in detail, moreover, regarding numerous incomplete and conflicting statements that Knox had made about the events in question. Even the prosecutor stated, \u201cI grant Eran [Knox]\u2019s testimony requires corroboration\u201d and, while attempting to minimize their impact, acknowledged Knox \u201cdid make inconsistent statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">In light of the foregoing, especially the absence of an eyewitness to the shooting, the lack of physical evidence linking defendant to the crime, and the serious impeachment of Eran Knox, upon whose testimony the People\u2019s case primarily depended, we conclude it is \u201creasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached\u201d <em>(People v. Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 837) had not the trial court erred by admitting Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s testimony relating Morris\u2019s self-serving and unreliable hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Although the parties do not dispute that the trial court\u2019s admission of Morris\u2019s declaration at defendant\u2019s trial implicates the Sixth Amendment, because we have determined under state evidentiary law that the trial court erred prejudicially, we decline to address defendant\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">George, C.

Code, \u00a7 1230), because they were not \u201cspecifically disserving\u201d to the nontestifying Morris himself and thus lacked sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 419, 441 [124 Cal.Rptr. 752, 541 P.2d 296] <em>(Leach).) </em>If so, admission of these same fragments may also have violated the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause, because they neither fell within a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>nor otherwise exhibited \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d sufficient to dispense with cross-examination. (E.g., <em>Lilly v. Virginia </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 116, 124-125 [119 S.Ct. 1887, 1894, 144 L.Ed.2d 117] (plur. opn.) <em>(Lilly); Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 66 [100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597].) However, I believe any error in the admission of these isolated segments was harmless by any applicable standard. Contrary to the majority, I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and uphold defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I disagree vigorously with the majority\u2019s broader conclusion that Morris\u2019s statement was inadmissible <em>in any form. </em>The majority reason that even if Morris made some admissions strictly against his penal interest, his <em>entire </em>statement, <em>including </em>those portions incriminating only to Morris himself, is nonetheless disqualified as unreliable under the Evidence Code because the statement was given in police custody, identified coparticipants, and included Morris\u2019s efforts to present himself in a sympathetic light. On the contrary, I conclude Morris\u2019s basic description of his participation in a drive-by shooting at a particular time and place, as properly redacted to eliminate any hint of self-justification, blame shifting, or incrimination of others, is amply trustworthy. Its admission in that form would satisfy both the letter and the spirit of the Evidence Code, and of the confrontation clause as well. By attacking Morris\u2019s statement with a chain saw instead of a scalpel, the majority wrongly deprive the People of a reliable and important link in the circumstantial chain of proof that defendant committed the serious crimes charged against him. From this aspect of the majority\u2019s analysis, I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">At the outset, as the majority must concede, major efforts were made to remove all objectionable features from the version of Morris\u2019s statement the jury heard. In this version, as briefly presented by Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon, Morris appears to speak in the first person singular and to describe himself as acting alone. Throughout the entire statement, as redacted for trial, there is no suggestion that others were involved. In O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s redacted version, Morris candidly explained that <em>\u201che </em>[i.e., Morris] decided to go do a drive by [shooting]\u201d in retaliation against \u201ca guy who had done a drive by shooting in the past. <em>He </em>[i.e., Morris] armed <em>himself </em>and left [Borchard Park] in <em>his </em>car.\u201d (Italics added.) According to O\u2019Hanlon, Morris described the house where the shooting occurred (a one-story blue house in Newbury Park with a basketball hoop in front), the weapon <em>\u201c[h\\e </em>used\u201d (a Tec-9 pistol with a \u201clong clip\u201d), the number of shots <em>\u201che </em>fired\u201d (\u201cabout 30\u201d in semiautomatic mode), and what \u201che\u201d did after the shooting (went back to Borchard Park, then returned home). (Italics added.) The prosecutor asked O\u2019Hanlon whether Morris had said anything about the role of Eran Knox, the chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>prosecution witness, in the shooting. O\u2019Hanlon replied Morris had explained that \u201cEran remained in the park when he [i.e., Morris] left to do the drive by, and that Eran had tried to talk <em>him </em>[i.e., Morris] out of doing the shooting.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">These statements all appear specifically disserving to Morris by describing, without elaboration, his own active participation in a serious criminal enterprise. They reveal, in and of themselves, no effort by Morris to curry favor, minimize his personal culpability, identify accomplices, or shift the principal blame to others. Indeed, in redacted form, they impliedly <em>overstate </em>Morris\u2019s complicity by insinuating that he himself was the instigator of the incident, and that, having decided to act, he could not be dissuaded by Knox, who did <em>not </em>participate in the shooting. As to the basic events of the incident, and Morris\u2019s role therein, these statements so far incriminated rather than favored or exculpated Morris that \u201ca reasonable [person] in [Morris\u2019s] position would not have made [them] unless he believed [them] to be true.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, they were properly admissible under the statutory exception to California\u2019s hearsay rule. For the same reason, I believe, they exhibited particularized guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to satisfy the confrontation clause. (See, e.g., <em>Lilly, supra, </em>527 U.S. 116, 124-125 [119 S.Ct. 1887, 1894].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Arguably the redacted statement, as admitted in court, should not have included Morris\u2019s insistence that <em>he </em>fired high, at the roof, to avoid hurting anyone. Nor, perhaps, should the jury have heard Morris\u2019s claim that when <em>he </em>learned from television a lady had been wounded in the leg, <em>he </em>realized <em>he </em>had shot at the wrong house. These particular remarks might be viewed as attempts by Morris to portray his actions and intentions as sympathetically as possible. Seen in that light, they are not presumptively trustworthy as specifically disserving to Morris\u2019s penal interest, and are thus not within the narrow hearsay exception provided by the Evidence Code. For similar reasons, and to the same limited extent, a violation of the confrontation clause also may have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">But I fail to see any possibility of prejudice from these minor lapses. They cast no aspersions on defendant, and they were collateral to defendant\u2019s guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>or innocence of the charged crimes. That <em>Morris </em>disclaimed an intent to Mil or injure anyone, and expressed regret for shooting at the wrong (rather than the \u201cright\u201d) house, in no way insinuates that defendant, whose participation and role were excised from Morris\u2019s redacted statement, felt or acted more culpably.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The majority insist that by erroneously including Morris\u2019s claim \u201che\u201d fired high to avoid injuring the house\u2019s occupants, the redacted statement prejudiced defendant by implying, in context, that <em>defendant </em>did <em>not </em>fire high, and that <em>defendant's </em>bullet must therefore have struck Ms. Sullivan. This theory is speculative in the extreme. As the jury heard, Morris admitted he intentionally discharged some 30 bullets at a private residence, having reason to believe, because \u201che saw a light on in a front window,\u201d that the house was then occupied. His shots were fired from the window of a car on the street in front of the residence. Even if Morris hoped otherwise, no rational inference arises that Morris was <em>successful </em>in directing this profligate and indiscriminate attack away from inhabited areas of the target residence, and that the injurious bullet must thus have been fired by someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Nor, as indicated above, does the redacted statement imply that defendant, to whom all reference was omitted, acted differently from Morris, and, unlike Morris, took intentional aim at areas where people were likely to be injured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor made no attempt to exploit these aspects of Morris\u2019s statement to argue that defendant was the one who wounded Ms. Sullivan.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The prosecution did seek to link defendant to the injurious bullet. Moreover, the prosecution\u2019s theory depended by inference on another portion of Morris\u2019s statement as heard by the jury, i.e., Morris\u2019s disclosure that he used a nine-millimeter machine pistol, a Tec-9, in the assault. Other evidence suggested that the bullet which most likely wounded Ms. Sullivan came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>from a 7.62-millimeter assault rifle. The prosecutor urged, by process of elimination, that if Morris used the Tec-9, defendant must have fired the 7.62-millimeter weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">However, I see no basis for reversal in these facts, for I am convinced Morris\u2019s Tec-9 statement was presumptively reliable and thus admissible. In referring to the Tec-9, Morris was simply describing, without self-justification or blame shifting, the weapon he himself used to fire \u201cabout 30\u201d shots at the Sullivan home. The reference appears specifically disserving to Morris, and thus likely truthful. There is no indication that the reference was self-exculpatory in context, and thus might be a lie. (See, e.g., <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 594, 603 [114 S.Ct. 2431, 2436-2437, 129 L.Ed.2d 476] <em>(Williamson).) </em>Specifically, the record discloses no evidence that, <em>at the time Morris made the Tec-9 statement, </em>he had any reason to believe, or thought the police believed, the bullet which struck Ms. Sullivan came from any other weapon. Hence, there is no basis to infer that by identifying his own weapon as a Tec-9, Morris sought to curry favor or shift blame.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">For these reasons, I am persuaded that any improperly admitted excerpts from Morris\u2019s police statement caused no prejudice to defendant. (See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818-836-837 [299 P.2d 243].) I would therefore uphold defendant\u2019s convictions, and would overturn the reversal entered by the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">But the majority\u2019s analysis contains a far more serious flaw. The majority alternatively hold that defendant was prejudiced because <em>no part </em>of Morris\u2019s police statement was properly admissible. This is so, the majority insist, because Morris\u2019s statement occurred in police custody, with a motive to curry favor and shift blame, and included such self-exculpatory efforts. Hence, the majority conclude, even those portions of Morris\u2019s statement that were <em>specifically and solely self-incriminatory </em>are not trustworthy enough to allow their hearsay use against defendant. I am not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Many cases confirm that statements, particularly those made in circumstances where there is a motive to shade or distort the truth, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>necessarily credible, and thus admissible, <em>as a whole </em>simply because they <em>include </em>admissions of criminal culpability. (E.g., <em>People v. Campa </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 870, 883 [206 Cal.Rptr. 114, 686 P.2d 634].) It is certainly true that \u201c \u2018a <em>self-serving </em>statement lacks trustworthiness whether it accompanies a disserving statement or not.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 419, 439, fn. 15, quoting Jefferson, <em>Declarations Against Interest: An Exception to the Hearsay Rule </em>(1944) 58 Harv. L.Rev. 1, 60, italics added.) And context may reveal that a particular statement, though self-incriminatory on its face, actually has exculpatory meaning or purpose which undermines its trustworthiness. (E.g., <em>Williamson, supra, </em>512 U.S. 594, 603-604; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coble </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 187, 191 [135 Cal.Rptr. 199] <em>(Coble).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Hence, it has long been settled in California that the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest does not apply to <em>\u201ccollateral assertions within </em>declarations against penal interest.\u201d <em>(Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 419, 439, italics added.) If, for example, a statement, whether to the police or others, admits the declarant\u2019s culpability only in the context of limiting it, as by expressly or impliedly shifting major blame to others, it is inadmissible to that extent. (E.g., <em>Coble, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d 187, 191; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Bullard </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 764, 770 [142 Cal.Rptr. 473] [\u201cinseparable combination of exculpatory and inculpatory matter\u201d].) Only those <em>portions </em>of a hearsay statement that are \u201cspecifically disserving\u201d to the declarant <em>(Leach, supra, </em>at p. 441), i.e., \u201c \u2018distinctly\u2019 against the declarant\u2019s penal interest\u201d <em>(People v. Shipe </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 343, 354 [122 Cal.Rptr. 701]), and thus presumptively trustworthy, may be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">But the majority turn these truisms on their heads. They hold, contrary to logic, that ev\u00e9n if particular utterances were strictly disserving to the declarant when made and can easily be isolated from collateral or exculpatory aspects of the declarant\u2019s statement, the self-incriminatory utterances are still not trustworthy, and thus are not admissible as hearsay in an accomplice\u2019s separate trial, if they were accompanied by self-serving statements and were made under circumstances suggesting some general motive to lie or distort. The majority thus throw out the baby with the bathwater. The effect of the majority\u2019s rule is to exclude most police confessions by nontestifying accomplices <em>out of hand, </em>even those portions so clearly and strictly self-incriminatory when uttered that they are almost certain to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The majority cite no decision, and I am aware of none, that requires such a result. On the contrary, the law has assumed, at a minimum, that if collateral and self-exculpatory elements of a statement can be separated and redacted, such that no flavor of false self-justification or blame shifting remains, the strictly self-incriminatory portions may be admitted as trustworthy under the penal-interest exception to the hearsay rule. (See, e.g., <em>Leach, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 419, 439-441; <em>Williamson, supra, </em>512 U.S. 594, 598-604 [114 S.Ct. 2431, 2434-2437] (plur. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.); <em>id. </em>at pp. 605-606 [114 S.Ct. atp. 2438] (cone. opn. of Scalia, J.); <em>id. </em>at pp. 611-621 [114 S.Ct. at pp. 2440-2445] (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.) [construing federal penal-interest rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Similarly, because of the motive to shift blame falsely, and the consequent need to cross-examine the accuser, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause may most often prohibit the use against an accused of <em>directly incriminating statements against him </em>that were made by a nontestifying accomplice while in police custody. (See, e.g., <em>Lilly, supra, </em>527 U.S. 116, 130-139 [119 S.Ct. 1887, 1897-1901] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.); <em>id. </em>atp. 143 [119 S.Ct. at p. 1903] (cone. opn. of Scalia, J.); <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 530, 539-547 [106 S.Ct. 2056, 2061-2065, 90 L.Ed.2d 514]; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 415, 418-420 [85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076-1077, 13 L.Ed.2d 934]; cf. <em>Bruton v. United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476].) But again, similar suspicions do not logically attach to those portions of such a statement that were strictly self-incriminatory, even where, apart from any motive of the accomplice to shift blame or incriminate others, the accomplice\u2019s admission of his own participation may form an indirect or circumstantial link in the chain of evidence against the defendant. (Cf. <em>Williamson, supra, </em>512 U.S. 594; <em>Richardson v. Marsh </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 200, 208 [107 S.Ct. 1702, 1707-1708, 95 L.Ed.2d 176].)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Though Morris made some effort to present his case sympathetically to the authorities, his police statement also included candid admissions of his own substantial participation in a drive-by shooting at a particular time and place. For purposes of defendant\u2019s trial, these self-incriminatory disclosures could easily be separated from any collateral and self-exculpatory elements of Morris\u2019s statement. If properly redacted, I believe Morris\u2019s statement was admissible against defendant under both statutory and constitutional principles. The actual redaction here may not have been strict enough, and defendant\u2019s jury may have heard a bit too much. I find any such lapses harmless, however, and I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal. But even if I agreed with the majority that prejudice arose from an insufficient redaction, I would not deprive the People of all opportunity to use Morris\u2019s statement, as properly limited, in any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Kennard, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Circumstances may occasionally arise in which even a strictly and narrowly self-damning statement lacks sufficient indicia of trustworthiness to be admitted under the penal-interest exception. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Frierson </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 730, 744-746 [280 Cal.Rptr. 440, 808 P.2d 1197] [no abuse of discretion in rejecting defense hearsay evidence of third party\u2019s admission he committed the charged murder, where admission was made to defense investigator long after defendant was judged guilty, and likely motive was to help defendant with little personal risk].) But insofar as Morris, in police custody and facing criminal prosecution, admitted his participation in a drive-by shooting, his admissions exhibit patent indicia of reliability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The jury seems at least as likely to draw the contrary inference, i.e., that if defendant was also involved in the shooting, for similar reasons, he also sought to avoid injury to anyone, or at least anyone other than the intended target. Such an inference would be accurate in light of Morris\u2019s <em>unredacted </em>statement, which indicated that <em>\u201cwe </em>didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody that was innocent,\u201d that \u201cwe\" relied on the directions of a third participant, but that the group drove by the house twice because <em>\u201cwe </em>wanted to be sure\u201d it was the right house. (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Again, the jury was at least as likely to assume defendant acted similarly to Morris, and Morris\u2019s unredacted statement confirms that view. As noted above, Morris actually spoke in the plural voice when disclaiming intent to injure innocent persons, and, for the most part, he insisted that \u201cwe\u201d aimed high to avoid such injury. According to Morris, \u201cwe\u201d weren\u2019t sure it was the right house, and (apparently referring to the physical pattern of bullet holes he assumed the police had found) \u201cthat\u2019s why <em>the bullets </em>were high.\u201d (Italics added.) Confronted with O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s comment that \u201c[u]nfortunately, [they were] not high enough,\u201d Morris could only answer, \u201cYeah.\u201d It is true that at one point, O\u2019Hanlon pointedly asked Morris whether \u201cyou both aim[ed] high,\u201d and Morris responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he [i.e., defendant] did or not.\u201d But if this was an implied accusation of defendant, the jury never heard it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Nothing in the full transcript of Morris\u2019s November 23, 1994, interview at the East Valley sheriff\u2019s station indicates Morris was told anything about a specific type or caliber of bullet that struck the victim. At trial, Sergeant O\u2019Hanlon testified he had a brief earlier conversation with Morris, in a police car, just after Morris\u2019s arrest. After reading Morris his rights, O\u2019Hanlon asked whether, having these rights in mind, Morris wished to talk about what happened. Morris replied \u201cthat he understood his rights, but that he didn\u2019t understand the situation,\u201d whereupon O\u2019Hanlon \u201cexplained the situation to him\u201d and Morris asked if he could talk to O\u2019Hanlon \u201clater\u201d at the station. Nothing in this exchange indicates O\u2019Hanlon apprised Morris of such details as the type of weapon that fired the injurious bullet.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
