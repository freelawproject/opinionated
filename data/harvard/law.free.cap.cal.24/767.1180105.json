Valladoli </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 590, 608, footnote 4 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 695, 918 P.2d 999] <em>(Valladoli): </em>whether a postverdict amendment to an information to add prior conviction allegations is permissible before sentencing but after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>jury has been discharged. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude it is not permissible. Under Penal Code section 1025, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a defendant has the statutory right to have the same jury decide both the issue of guilt and the truth of any prior conviction allegations. Because the jury in this case was discharged before the prosecution amended the information to add additional priors, defendant did not have the same jury, as required under section 1025, subdivision (b). We conclude the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by permitting the postdischarge amendment to the information. Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment affirming that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The facts are taken largely from the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Police arrested defendant Robert Tindall after they saw him drop a plastic baggie containing what was later determined to be a usable quantity of rock cocaine. The information charged defendant with possession of rock cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)) and alleged that he was convicted in 1983 for possession for sale of rock cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378) and in 1992 for possession for sale of rock cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351.5), each conviction disqualifying him for probation. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203, subd. (e)(4).) The information also alleged that defendant had served a prior prison term for the 1992 conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)), which also disqualified him for probation under Health and Safety Code section 11370, subdivisions (a) and (c). The trial on the prior conviction allegations was bifurcated.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On December 18, 1996, the jury returned a guilty verdict, and defendant waived jury trial on the prior conviction allegations. The trial court then discharged the jury. The matter was continued to January 16, 1997, for preparation of a probation report, a court trial on the priors, and sentencing. The probation report later revealed that, in addition to numerous Missouri misdemeanor and felony convictions, defendant had three 1985 federal convictions for bank robberies committed in California, and was currently on federal parole for those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">At the January 16 hearing, the prosecution moved to amend the information to add the three prior felony bank robbery convictions as \u201cstrikes\u201d (\u00a7 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and to add allegations that defendant had served prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) for those convictions and for the 1983 conviction for possession for sale of rock cocaine. The trial court granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>motion without prejudice to defendant to renew his opposition. It also granted defendant a continuance. Defendant invoked his right to a jury trial on the strike allegations. The trial court allowed defendant to withdraw his previous waiver of jury trial on the prior convictions originally alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">After hearing further argument on the motion to amend the information, the trial court reaffirmed its ruling granting the motion over defendant\u2019s continuing objection. On March 24, 1997, trial commenced on the strike allegations before a new jury. After the trial court declared a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the truth of the prior convictions, it impaneled a new jury, which found true the three alleged prior bank robbery convictions. Defendant was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">On appeal, as relevant here, defendant argued that the amendment adding the priors after the first jury had been discharged violated his constitutional right against double jeopardy, and that under <em>Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 590, a late amendment under section 969a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is permissible only until a jury is discharged. (\u00a7\u00a7 1025, 1164, subd. (b).) The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s order allowing the postverdict, postdischarge amendment. Recognizing that we did not decide this issue in <em>Valladoli, </em>the Court of Appeal applied our reasoning in that case to conclude that section 969a permits a postverdict amendment even after a jury has been discharged, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the amendment in this case. The Court of Appeal relied on both <em>Monge v. California </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 721 [118 S.Ct. 2246, 141 L.Ed.2d 615], and <em>Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at page 609, to dispose of defendant\u2019s double jeopardy challenge to the section 969a amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for review to decide one issue\u2014whether a postverdict amendment to an information to add previously unalleged prior convictions is permissible after a jury has been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Section 1025, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cthe question of whether or not the defendant has suffered the prior conviction shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>be tried by the jury that tries the issue upon the plea of not guilty . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 969a, however, states that prior conviction allegations may be added \u201c[wjhenever it shall be discovered that a pending indictment or information does not charge all prior felonies . . . .\u201d We interpreted section 969a to permit the prosecution, on order of the court, to amend the information until sentencing so long as the court has not discharged the jury. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 605, 608, fn. 4; see <em>id. </em>at p. 610 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.) [\u201csection 969a authorizes postverdict amendments at least until the trial court discharges the jury\u201d].) Notwithstanding section 969a, defendant argues that section 1025, subdivision (b), prohibits the prosecution from amending the information to allege prior convictions after the jury that decided the guilt issue has been discharged. For reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In construing section 1025, \u201cwe must \u2018ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 597.) We first look at the actual words of the statute, \u201cgiving them a plain and commonsense meaning.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIf there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u2018then the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Where the statute is clear, courts will not \u201cinterpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Lennane v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 263, 268 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 563, 885 P.2d 976].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Preliminarily, we find that the pertinent language of section 1025 is straightforward and clear: if a defendant pleads not guilty to the underlying offense, and a jury decides the issue of guilt, that same jury shall decide whether the defendant \u201csuffered the prior conviction,\u201d unless the defendant waives jury trial. (\u00a7 1025, subd. (b); see also <em>Kelii, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 454 [trial court, not jury, determines whether a prior conviction is serious for purposes of \u00a7 1025]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vera </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 269, 276 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 754, 934 P.2d 1279] <em>(Vera) </em>[defendant may forfeit the right to a jury trial on prior conviction allegations by failing to timely object to discharge of the jury that decided defendant\u2019s guilt on the underlying offenses]; <em>People v. Wiley </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 580, 592 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>889 P.2d 541] <em>(Wiley) </em>[trial court, not jury, determines whether allegations of multiple prior convictions were brought and tried separately]; <em>People v. Saunders </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 580, 590 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 638, 853 P.2d 1093] <em>{Saunders)-, </em>cf. \u00a7 1025, subd. (c) [notwithstanding subd. (b) of \u00a7 1025, trial court, not jury, determines whether the defendant is the person who suffered the prior conviction].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Notwithstanding the seemingly clear language of section 1025, subdivision (b), a conflict arises when this provision and section 969a both apply in a case. In other words, when section 1025, subdivision (b) and section 969a compel different results, which statute controls? Although we have explained that section 969a\u2019s purpose is \u201ctowards effectuating the Legislature\u2019s expressed view that all known prior felony convictions of an accused be pleaded\u201d <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 602), section 1025, subdivision (b), requires further elucidation. (See <em>Vera, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 276 [\u201c \u2018same jury\u2019 provision reflects the statute\u2019s unitary trial procedure, and does not constitute a statutory entitlement separate from the jury trial right itself\u2019].) That is, what are the reasons for, or benefits of, having the same jury decide both the issue of a defendant\u2019s guilt and the truth of alleged prior convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Because section 1025 was enacted over a century ago <em>{Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 587, fn. 2), our review of its legislative history sheds no light on the purpose behind the same-jury requirement, which existed from the time of the statute\u2019s 1874 enactment. (Code Amends. 1873-1874 (Pen. Code), ch. 614, \u00a7 50, p. 439; <em>Saunders, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 587-588.) However, we do perceive a possible and obvious reason for the same-jury requirement\u2014judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">By requiring the same jury to decide both issues of guilt and alleged prior convictions, section 1025, subdivision (b) saves the state courts the additional time and cost of having to impanel <em>two </em>juries in countless criminal trials. (See <em>People v. Owens </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 441, 447 [169 Cal.Rptr. 359].) The savings in time and cost are no doubt significant compared to the \u201clittle, if any, time\u201d saved from having a unitary rather than a bifurcated trial. <em>(People v. Calderon </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 69, 77 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 333, 885 P.2d 83] <em>(Calderon) </em>[in a bifurcated trial, a not guilty verdict obviates the need for later proving the alleged prior conviction].) Indeed, we believe that the aggregate savings from all criminal trials subject to section 1025 must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>staggering. Thus, we find the \u201cstate\u2019s legitimate interest in conserving judicial resources\u201d sufficiently explains, and perhaps justifies, the same-jury requirement under section 1025, subdivision (b). <em>(Calderon, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">However, a defendant\u2019s interests, which obviously are not in saving the state time or money, may not be advanced by having the same jury. Frequently, a defendant would prefer <em>not </em>to have the same jury under section 1025, subdivision (b). \u201cIn most instances, a defendant is benefitted by having a new jury determine the truth of alleged prior convictions, because the new jury will not have heard the evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s conviction of the current charges.\u201d <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 596.) Moreover, in a unitary trial, where a jury decides the truth of alleged prior convictions at the same time it decides the issue of guilt, \u201c \u2018there is the serious danger that the jury will conclude that defendant has a criminal disposition and thus probably committed the presently charged offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Calderon, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Although the same-jury requirement under section 1025, subdivision (b) may not particularly inure to defendant\u2019s benefit, we cannot conclude thereby that defendant has no right to invoke the statute. <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 591.) Nowhere does section 1025 provide that only at the prosecution\u2019s request, or through the trial court\u2019s order or exercise of discretion, shall the same jury decide both the issue of guilt and the truth of alleged prior convictions. <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 591-592.) The statute is clear in its procedural instructions\u2014the same jury that decides the issue of guilt shall also decide the truth of the alleged prior convictions, unless jury trial is waived. (\u00a7 1025, subd. (b).) Indeed, because a defendant may forfeit the right to have the same jury under section 1025 <em>(Saunders, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 591), he thus possesses that right and may forfeit, waive, or <em>invoke </em>it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Moreover, as noted, section 1025 has been part of this state\u2019s framework of criminal procedure for over a century. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 773.) Even though the Legislature has amended several times (in addition to repealing and reenacting) the statute, it has not eliminated the same-jury requirement. (See <em>Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 587, fn. 2; see also <em>Kelii, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 457.) To the contrary, the Legislature has taken steps to ensure that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>court does not prematurely discharge the jury. In 1988, the Legislature amended section 1164 to add subdivision (b), which requires the trial court, before discharging the jury, to first verify that the jury has decided all issues before it. (Stats. 1988, ch. 413, \u00a7 1, p. 1780.) \u201cNo jury shall be discharged until the court has verified on the record that the jury has either reached a verdict or has formally declared its inability to reach a verdict on all issues before it, <em>including, but not limited to, .. . the truth of any alleged prior conviction </em>whether in the same proceeding or in a bifurcated proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 1164, subd. (b), italics added.) Section 1164 \u201cis expressly qualified by the need to retain the jury to decide the truth of prior felony allegations.\u201d <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We are not persuaded by the mandatory-directory distinction the dissent raises. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 784-786.) We do not perceive a clear legislative intent that section 1025, subdivision (b)\u2019s requirement that the same jury decide both the issue of guilt and the truth of any priors is directory, particularly in light of other statutes which further ensure compliance with the same-jury requirement (\u00a7 1164, subd. (b)), and without readily dismissing the laudable \u201cpublic purpose\u201d of judicial economy in this situation. <em>(Morris v. County of Marin </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 901, 910 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606].) Indeed, whether a statute imposes a sanction for its noncompliance is not dispositive in this context, which does not concern specific time limits. (See e.g., <em>California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1145 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 693, 899 P.2d 79] [\u201c \u2018cases have suggested that a time limitation is deemed merely directory \u201cunless a consequence or penalty is provided for failure to do the act within the time commanded\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Malengo v. Municipal Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 813, 816 [17 Cal.Rptr. 10, 366 P.2d 453] [\u00a7 1050, \u201cproviding for the time for trial of criminal cases, is directory only and contains no provision for the dismissal of a case when its terms are not complied with\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1930) 209 Cal. 540, 546 [289 P. 629] [same]; <em>Ray v. Superior Court </em>(1929) 208 Cal. 357, 359 [281 P. 391] [same]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1978) 90 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 9 [152 Cal.Rptr. 896] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Likewise, we are not convinced by the dissent\u2019s reliance on a portion of the legislative history of section 969a, which originally allowed the prosecution to file a supplemental information adding prior conviction allegations after' sentencing as long as a defendant\u2019s sentence had not yet expired. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th atpp. 603-604; dis. <em>opn.,post, </em>atp. 786.) Given this was \u201can aspect of the 1927 version of the statute that did not survive to the present day,\u201d but was eliminated shortly thereafter in 1931 <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 603), we do not ascribe the same importance as does the dissent to this aspect of the original statute for purposes of the present controversy. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 786-787.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that in light of section 1025, subdivision (b), the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by permitting the amendment to add previously unalleged prior convictions after discharging the jury. (See <em>Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].)  A court acts in excess of its jurisdiction when \u201cit has no \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 (or power) to act except in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Contrary to the Court of Appeal\u2019s assertion, a defendant\u2019s right to have the same jury under section 1025, subdivision (b) is not a statutory <em>preference, </em>but a \u201cprocedural requirement.\u201d <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 590.)  Therefore, although the prosecution may amend an information to add alleged prior convictions on the trial court\u2019s order until sentencing <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 605-606), the court may not permit such an amendment if the jury has been discharged, unless the defendant waives or forfeits the right to have the same jury try both guilt and priors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1025, subd. (b); <em>Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In this case, the Court of Appeal disregarded the \u201cprocedural requirement\u201d of section 1025 <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 590), instead finding nothing in the plain language of section 969a that prohibited the trial court from allowing the information to be amended after the jury was discharged. Relying on <em>Valladoli, </em>the Court of Appeal applied an abuse of discretion standard to determine whether the postdischarge amendment was proper. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 607-608, fn. omitted.) It concluded that \u201cunder <em>Saunders </em>and <em>Valladoli </em>that right [under section 1025] is not absolute where there was good cause to empanel a different jury.\u201d Neither <em>Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 590, nor <em>Saunders, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th 580, compels this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In contrast to this case, the jury in <em>Valladoli </em>had not been discharged when the prosecution moved after the verdict to add the prior felony conviction enhancements that were inadvertently omitted from the information. After finding section 969a to be controlling, and examining its plain language and legislative history, we concluded in <em>Valladoli </em>that section 969a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>authorized postverdict, presentencing amendments to charge prior felony convictions that were previously known, newly discovered, or omitted through clerical error. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 605-606.) However, we also recognized a trial court has the discretion to permit or deny such an amendment. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 606, fn. 3, 607.) To guide trial courts in exercising this discretion, we urged them to scrutinize five nonexclusive factors. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 607-608.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Citing section 1025, we included among these factors whether the jury had already been discharged. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 607-608.) Indeed, in rejecting defendant Valladoli\u2019s due process claim, we observed that \u201c[significantly, at the time of amendment the jury had not yet been discharged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 608, fn. 4, and see accompanying text.) Contrary to respondent Attorney General\u2019s contention, we did not suggest jury discharge to be \u201cimmaterial\u201d in <em>Valladoli, </em>which was consistent with our declining to express an opinion on whether section 969a amendments are limited by other statutes, such as section 1025. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 608, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\"><em>Saunders, </em>which did not involve previously unalleged prior convictions, also does not help the Attorney General\u2019s position. In <em>Saunders, </em>the defendant requested that the trial of the substantive offenses be bifurcated from the prior conviction allegations. After the jury returned a guilty verdict on the burglary charge, the trial court discharged it and continued the case to the next day. <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 586.) The defendant, who was represented by substitute counsel at that time, did not object to the jury\u2019s discharge. The following day, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel appeared, and the defendant waived jury trial on the prior conviction allegations. After the court found the allegations true, defense counsel learned that the jury had been discharged before the defendant waived jury trial. Defense counsel objected, claiming she would not have advised the defendant to waive jury trial had she known the jury was discharged after returning its verdict. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 586-587.) The trial court permitted the defendant to withdraw his waiver, and a newly impaneled jury found the prior conviction allegations true. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 587.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">We found the trial court violated sections 1025 and 1164, subdivision (b), by discharging the jury before it determined the truth of the prior conviction allegations. <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 591-592.) However, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to relief based on his section 1025 right to have the same jury that decided the guilt issue. <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 591.) \u201cHe forfeited that right by failing to object in a timely fashion when the jury was discharged.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We emphasized that \u201ca defendant may not complain on appeal of a departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>from this procedural requirement unless the error has been brought to the attention of the trial court by means of a timely and specific objection.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 590.) However, we did not suggest that, in the absence of the defendant\u2019s forfeiture or waiver, his statutory right to have the same jury decide both the guilt issue and the sentencing allegations was ineffectual or unprotected,  Defendant here did not fail to object, but lodged a continuing objection to the postdischarge amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The Attorney General, however, emphasizes that section 969a\u2019s underlying policy allowing permissive amendments\u2014to ensure a defendant will not \u201c \u2018escape the consequences\u2019 \u201d of his or her prior conduct\u2014will be undermined by prohibiting postdischarge amendments. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 603.) He contends section 969a and former section 969\u00bd (now \u00a7 969.5)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> should be interpreted similarly \u201cto prevent the creation of anomalous rules and improper incentives for convicted defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">For instance, section 969.5, as a parallel provision to section 969a, applies when a defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to the underlying offense. (See <em>Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 601-602 [interpreting former \u00a7 969\u00bd in part].) Section 969.5, subdivision (b) states, in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he question of whether or not the defendant has suffered the prior conviction shall be tried by a jury impaneled for that purpose unless a jury is waived, in which case it may be tried by the court.\u201d In contrast to section 969a, section 969.5 is not limited by section 1025, subdivision (b)\u2019s requirement that the same jury decide both the issue of guilt and the truth of any prior conviction allegations. The reason for this is simple: when a defendant enters a guilty, or nolo contendere plea, there is no jury \u201cthat tries the issue upon the plea of not guilty\u201d that could be prematurely discharged before deciding the prior conviction allegations. (\u00a7 1025, subd. (b); see also \u00a7 1164.) Therefore, if a defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere, the prosecution may, on the court\u2019s order, amend the information to add previously unalleged prior convictions until sentencing. (\u00a7 969.5, subd. (a); see <em>Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The same result may occur if a defendant waives a jury trial on the charged offense and/or on the alleged prior conviction or admits the latter. (\u00a7 1025, subds. (b) &amp; (e).) In these circumstances, section 1025 does not prohibit amendment of the information before sentencing because an impaneled jury is not required to decide <em>both </em>the issue of guilt and the truth of any prior conviction allegations. There is no risk that a jury will be prematurely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>discharged in contravention of section 1025 and section 1164. (See also \u00a7 1025, subd. (c); <em>Kelii, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 454; <em>Wiley, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 592.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">However, we do not find the foregoing situations constitute <em>anomalies, </em>which may result from the interpretation of section 969a and section 1025, subdivision (b), in this case. As noted, depending on a defendant\u2019s plea or waiver of a jury, the prosecution may or may not be permitted to add prior conviction allegations after a jury is discharged. These resulting differences, however, are not anomalies based on perceived internal inconsistencies between related statutes that must be construed together and reconciled accordingly. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 601-602.) Rather, any divergence results from the factual circumstance that a defendant pleads not guilty and does not waive jury trial of alleged prior convictions, which may implicate section 1025, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">We are also not persuaded by the Attorney General\u2019s contention that prohibiting postdischarge amendments will give defendants \u201can incentive to waive their jury trial right quickly to prevent their being correctly sentenced.\u201d (See <em>Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 602.) In other words, those defendants who know the prosecution has not alleged all of their prior convictions will waive a jury trial on the priors, causing the guilt phase jury to be discharged. If the prosecution seeks to amend the information to add the prior conviction allegations, the defendants will assert that they waived a jury without full knowledge of the alleged prior convictions, and they will seek to withdraw the. waiver and impanel another jury. Consequently, they will not have the same jury, as required under section 1025, subdivision (b). Under defendant\u2019s interpretation of this provision, the prosecution may not be permitted to add previously unalleged prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Though not entirely without merit, the Attorney General\u2019s argument loses force when we consider the realities of this incentive. To take unfair advantage of section 1025, subdivision (b), a defendant must plead not guilty, undergo the trial of the alleged underlying offenses, and be found guilty. During this entire time, the prosecution must fail to allege all of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. Only then does a defendant\u2019s incentive to waive jury trial on the priors arguably become manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">In contrast, a defendant would have a clear motivation and effective means to prevent being correctly sentenced by quickly pleading guilty, \u201cthereby limiting the amount of time the prosecutor has to investigate, discover, and charge the accused\u2019s prior felony convictions.\u201d <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 602 [interpreting former \u00a7 969\u00bd].) In that situation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>where a defendant\u2019s incentive is obvious and problematic, section 1025, subdivision (b) does not otherwise limit an amendment before sentencing. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 778-779.) However, we do not find a defendant\u2019s incentive to waive jury trial on prior conviction allegations similarly compelling to justify disregarding section 1025, subdivision (b)\u2019s limitation. Contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s suggestion, prohibiting a postdischarge amendment still gives the prosecution a fair opportunity\u2014until the conclusion of the guilt phase trial\u2014to add previously unalleged prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Moreover, we agree that although defendants are most familiar with their own criminal records, they are not likely to alert the prosecution that it has failed to allege some prior convictions, which invariably would increase their sentences. <em>(In re Yurko </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 857, 862 [112 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519 P.2d 561].) However, a defendant who takes advantage of the prosecution\u2019s omission by waiving jury trial on the prior conviction allegations will also have to forgo the \u201cvarious procedural guaranties\u201d that accompany the right to a jury trial under section 1025 <em>(People v. Monge </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 826, 833-834 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 941 P.2d 1121] (plur. opn. of Chin, J.) <em>(Monge), </em>affd. <em>sub nom. Monge v. California, supra, </em>524 U.S. 721 [reasonable doubt standard for proving prior conviction allegations, privilege against self-incrimination, application of rules of evidence, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses]), which the jury will have heeded with its \u201cfull and independent consideration.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 75, 91 [180 Cal.Rptr. 76] [discussing in part a defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict].) Thus, we hesitate to characterize a defendant\u2019s incentive to waive the right to a jury trial as without adverse consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The Attorney General also argues that the reasoning of <em>Monge </em>compels the conclusion that the postdischarge amendment made here is proper. We disagree. In <em>Monge, </em>we considered only state and federal double jeopardy protections and whether they applied to proceedings on prior conviction allegations. <em>(Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 843-845.) Rejecting defendant Monge\u2019s constitutional claims, we expressed no view on whether section 1025 or any other applicable section precluded retrial of prior conviction allegations. <em>(Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 845.) Moreover, Monge\u2019s circumstance of a retrial on prior conviction allegations is a procedural posture arguably distinguishable from this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we do not find <em>Monge </em>lends support on the present statutory issue\u2014whether an amendment to add prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>conviction allegations may be made after a jury has been discharged. (See \u00a7 1025, subd. (b); <em>Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 592, fn. 8 [\u201c \u2018an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">-f</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Moreover, we observe that in this case, section 1025\u2019s limitation on a postdischarge amendment was not accomplished by way of a \u201cprocedural trap.\u201d <em>(Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 590.) Here, defendant waived jury trial before the prosecution amended the information to add three prior felony convictions. This amendment increased his possible sentence from four years to 25 years to life in prison. As noted, the trial court allowed defendant to withdraw his previous waiver \u201c[o]ut of a sense of fairness.\u201d In contrast, the defendant in <em>Saunders </em>did not face previously unalleged prior convictions. He simply \u201cchanged his mind\u201d about waiving jury trial on advice of counsel, and the trial court permitted him to withdraw his waiver. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Although section 969a may allow amendments until sentencing on court order <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 605), other applicable provisions may limit these amendments. A contrary interpretation would suggest that amendments under section 969a are mandatory until sentencing, which is contradicted by the provision\u2019s discretionary term \u201cmay,\u201d and the requirement that amendments \u201cshall be made upqn the order of the court\u201d (\u00a7 969a), guided by factors we articulated in <em>Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pages 607-608. Although prohibiting postdischarge amendments will prevent the prosecution in certain cases from charging defendants with all their prior convictions (\u00a7 969), we do not find this circumstance distinctly unjust, when the prosecution has what we consider a fair opportunity, i.e., until the conclusion of the guilt phase trial, to discover and charge the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Notwithstanding section 969a\u2019s intent \u201cthat all known prior .felony convictions of an accused be pleaded\u201d <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 602), we decline to adopt any interpretation that would deny a defendant\u2019s long-established statutory right under section 1025, subdivision (b), which we recently reaffirmed in <em>Vera, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at page 276 (\u201cSection 1025 establishes a defendant\u2019s right to jury trial of alleged prior convictions by the same jury which determines guilt of the substantive offenses\u201d). Without clear legislative intent to the contrary, we choose not to allocate greater significance to section 969a over section 1025, or vice versa. (See <em>Nickles-berg v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 288, 298 [285 Cal.Rptr. 86, 814 P.2d 1328] [\u201cstatutes should be interpreted in such a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>as to make them consistent with each other, rather than obviate one another\u201d].) In this regard, prohibiting postdischarge amendments strikes a fair balance between section 1025 and section 969a. To add previously unalleged prior convictions under section 969a\u2014where a defendant has not waived or forfeited his or her right to a jury trial on the prior conviction allegations\u2014 the prosecution has until the conclusion of the guilt phase trial to do so upon court order, consistent with section 1025, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Whether the Legislature considered the single-jury requirement in subdivision (b) of section 1025 to be of less importance in light of a recent amendment to <em>another </em>subdivision in that section and case law concerning separate, distinct issues (dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 787), is not apparent. Thus, we must interpret section 1025, subdivision (b) as we find it, requiring the same jury to decide both the issue of a defendant\u2019s guilt and the truth of any prior conviction allegations in the absence of a defendant\u2019s waiver or forfeiture. (See <em>Kelii, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 459.) Moreover, although section 667, subdivision (b) provides that it is the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cin enacting subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment\u201d for those defendants with prior convictions, we doubt that this necessarily includes an intent that the provision, along with section 969a, trump all other statutory directives such as section 1025, subdivision (b). Indeed, our interpretation of section 1025, subdivision (b) does not entirely nor substantially prohibit the prosecution from amending an information to add prior conviction allegations. Our interpretation, however, sets a reasonable time frame within which the prosecution may find and charge a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that in the absence of a defendant\u2019s forfeiture or waiver, section 1025, subdivision (b) requires that the same jury that decided the issue of a defendant\u2019s guilt \u201cshall\u201d also determine the truth of alleged prior convictions. Because a jury cannot determine the truth of the prior conviction allegations once it has been discharged (see <em>People v. Hendricks </em>(1987) 43.Cal.3d 584, 597 [238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 737 P.2d 1350]), it follows that the information may not be amended to add prior conviction allegations after the jury has been discharged. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, we find that the postdischarge amendment, which increased defendant\u2019s prison sentence from four years to 25 years to life, was erroneous. The prejudice to defendant is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Finally, we disagree with defendant\u2019s suggestion that we adopt a due diligence standard\u2014whether or not the jury has been discharged\u2014that the prosecution must satisfy before it may amend the information.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the Attorney General correctly notes, this due diligence standard does not comport with our decision in <em>Valladoli. </em>Although we did not decide the section 1025 issue in that case <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 608, fn. 4), we observed that the prosecution may amend the information under section 969a to charge prior convictions that were previously known, newly discovered, or omitted through clerical error. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 606; see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 776-777.) Plainly, a due diligence standard is not required. Contrary to defendant\u2019s suggestion, we see no basis to reconsider <em>Valladoli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Moreover, because we find the postdischarge amendment was improper under section 1025, subdivision (b), we decline to consider defendant\u2019s claims that such amendment also violated defendant\u2019s protection against double jeopardy, and his rights under the due process clause of the state and federal Constitutions. (See <em>De Lancie v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 865, 877, fn. 13 [183 Cal.Rptr. 866, 647 P.2d 142] [\u201ccourts should avoid resolving constitutional issues if a case can be decided on statutory grounds\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">For reasons set forth above, we conclude the trial court erred by allowing a section 969a amendment after discharging the jury, in violation of section 1025, subdivision (b). Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment affirming that order and remand this action to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">George, C. J., Mosk, J., Kennard, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b829-9\">BROWN, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">The majority has created a jurisdictional mountain out of a procedural molehill. A statute enacted almost a century ago\u2014 most likely, as the majority concedes, for reasons of judicial economy-\u2014now categorically forecloses the prosecution from alleging belatedly discovered serious prior convictions simply because the trial court discharged the jury that tried the underlying issues of guilt. The prosecution is thus foreclosed despite the unambiguous statutory authorization to make such allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\u201c[w]henever it shall be discovered that a pending indictment or information does not charge all prior felonies of which the defendant has been convicted either in this State or elsewhere . . . (Pen. Code, \u00a7 969a (hereafter all unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code).) The majority\u2019s holding also contravenes \u201cthe intent of the People of the State of California ... to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994) text of Prop. 184, p. 64.) I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of section 1025 depends upon a narrow and incomplete reading of the text. Inferentially, the majority concludes that \u201cshall\u201d denotes a mandatory requirement and on that basis invokes a jurisdictional bar for failure\u2014in the absence of waiver or forfeiture\u2014to have a single jury decide both guilt and prior conviction allegations. This conclusion is unsupported by the terms of the statute and likely legislative intent, particularly when considered in light of section 969a, the three strikes law, and the recent amendments to section 1025. It is also at odds with recent decisional authority of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">To begin, unlike some codes (see, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 14), the Penal Code does not dictate that \"shall\u201d is always mandatory. Rather, apart from words and phrases specifically defined, which do not include \u201cshall,\u201d section 7, subdivision 16 provides that \u201c[wjords and phrases must be construed according to the context and the approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law, must be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Contrary to the majority, I find \u201cshall\u201d in this context more reasonably construed as directory rather than mandatory. \u201c[T]he \u2018directory\u2019 or \u2018mandatory\u2019 designation does not refer to whether a particular statutory requirement is \u2018permissive\u2019 or \u2018obligatory,\u2019 but instead simply denotes whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will or will not have the effect of invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.\u201d <em>(Morris v. County of Marin </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 901, 908 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606]; see generally 1A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th ed. 1993) pp. 763-769.)

Section 1050 states the trial court \u201cshall\u201d proceed according to specified directives with respect to trial setting and continuances. For example, section 1050, subdivision (e) currently provides that \u201c[continuances shall be granted only upon a showing of good cause.\u201d The statute also formerly directed that \u201c[t]he court shall set all criminal cases for trial for a date not later than thirty days after the date of entry of the plea of the defendant.\u201d (Stats. 1927, ch. 600, \u00a7 1, p. 1036.) Nevertheless, appellate courts have uniformly construed this language as \u201cnot mandatory, but . . . directory only\u201d because it contains no sanction for noncompliance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1978) 90 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 9 [152 Cal.Rptr. 896]; <em>Malengo </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 813, 816 [17 Cal.Rptr. 10, 366 P.2d 453]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1930) 209 Cal. 540, 546 [289 P. 629]; <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1929) 208 Cal. 357, 358-359 [281 P. 391].) By contrast, section 1382, subdivision (a), requires that the court \u201cshall order the action to be dismissed\u201d for noncompliance with specified time limits for commencing trial and has been construed as mandatory in light of the express sanction for noncompliance. <em>(Flores, </em>at p. Supp. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">By any of the foregoing measures, section 1025 is more reasonably construed as directory rather than mandatory. While the statute may set forth a \u201cprocedural requirement\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saunders </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 580, 590 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 638, 853 P.2d 1093]), it does not prescribe <em>any </em>remedy for noncompliance much less a jurisdictional bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The majority\u2019s analysis is also inconsistent with this court\u2019s recent decisional authority. In <em>People v. Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 580, the court held that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to discharge of the jury prior to its determination of any prior convictions waived the statutory right to have a single jury resolve both guilt and priors issues. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 589; cf. \u00a7 1164 [precluding discharge until the court has verified the jury has reached or is unable to reach a verdict on all issues including the truth of any alleged priors].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Vera </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 269, 272 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 754, 934 P.2d 1279], the court determined that the trial court did not violate section 1025 by failing to obtain an \u201cexpress, personal waiver\u201d of the statutory right to jury trial on prior conviction allegations when the defendant did not object to discharge of the jury that determined his guilt on the underlying offenses. <em>(Vera, </em>at p. 274.) The court reached this conclusion in part because the right to a jury trial of prior conviction allegations is statutory only and does not implicate any constitutional guarantees. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 276-279; see <em>People v. Wiley </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 580, 585-586 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 889 P.2d 541].) A jurisdictional bar generally will not accommodate waiver or forfeiture. (Cf. <em>Cowan v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 367 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 458, 926 P.2d 438].)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s holding conflicts with the legislative history of section 969a as outlined in <em>People </em>v. <em>Valladoli </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 590, 602-606 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 695, 918 P.2d 999]. There, the court noted that as originally enacted, section 969a not only mandated amendment to include additional prior conviction allegations but authorized such amendment after sentencing as long as the defendant\u2019s sentence had not yet expired. <em>(Valladoli, </em>at pp. 603-604.) At the same time, the Legislature was presumptively aware section 1025 provided for a single jury to decide both guilt and prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>conviction allegations. Implicitly, the Legislature could not have intended \u201cshall\u201d in section 1025 to be mandatory while allowing for the addition of priors allegations after discharge of the original jury. Harmonizing section 1025 with the original provisions of section 969a, the only reasonable conclusion is that the Legislature understood \u201cshall\u201d to be directory, with no sanction for failure to provide a unitary jury in this circumstance..</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">With respect to the legislative intent of section 1025, as the majority acknowledges, a plausible purpose in having the same jury try both guilt and prior conviction allegations was to conserve judicial resources, not to benefit defendants. (Cf. \u00a7 1098 [statutory preference for joint trials].) Thus, the \u201c \u2018material\u2019 \u201d matter or \u201c \u2018substance\u2019 \u201d of the statute <em>(Francis v. Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d at p. 28) does not require a single jury; no legislative goal is displaced or compromised by having a second jury determine the truth of prior conviction allegations. The same result would be necessary if the original jury could not reach a unanimous verdict as to the priors. The primary benefit to defendants, i.e., \u201c \u2018the essence of the thing to be accomplished\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>was most likely according <em>any </em>right to jury trial on the truth of the priors. This intent is accommodated as long as some jury, whether original or subsequent, resolves the issue of prior conviction allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Counter to the majority\u2019s holding, the Legislature, seconded by the voters, has of late made clear its intent \u201cto ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (b).) To this end, section 969a ensures that the indictment or information may, in the trial court\u2019s discretion, be amended to allege prior convictions \u201c[w]henever it shall be discovered\u201d they have been omitted. (See also \u00a7 667, subd. (g); <em>People v. Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 602-603.) As this case illustrates, the majority\u2019s reasoning fundamentally undermines this goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The Legislature has also narrowed the jury\u2019s function with respect to determining the truth of prior conviction allegations. Section 1025, subdivision (c) now provides that \u201cthe court without a jury\u201d shall decide \u201cwhether the defendant is the person who has suffered the prior conviction . . . .\u201d The court also determines whether prior serious felony convictions were brought and tried separately <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wiley, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 592) and whether a prior felony conviction qualifies as a \u201cserious felony\u201d for purposes of the three strikes law <em>(People v. Kelii </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 452, 454 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 674, 981 P.2d 518]). These limitations further minimize the likelihood a single-jury requirement was of paramount legislative concern. (See also <em>id. </em>at pp. 457-458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>The right to jury trial on priors allegations is wholly statutory; it assumes no constitutional dimension. (See <em>People v. Vera, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 277; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wims </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 293, 303-309 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 895 P.2d 77].) Nor does the impaneling of a second jury to determine added prior conviction allegations implicate the prohibition against double jeopardy. <em>(People v. Saunders, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 592-596.) To the extent particular circumstances may raise due process concerns, the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to permit or deny belated amendment (\u00a7 969a; see <em>People v. Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 606, fn. 3)\u2014guided by the considerations identified in <em>People v. Valladoli, supra, </em>at pages 607-608, and any other relevant factors\u2014adequately safeguards the defendant\u2019s interests in fair notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Without analysis, the majority assumes \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory and from that assumption infers the only remedy for noncompliance is to bar consideration of any prior allegations added after discharge of the jury that determined the defendant\u2019s guilt. These assumptions do not follow from either the statutory language or any decisional authority cited by the majority. Nor is a bar necessary to effectuate legislative intent to confer a statutory right to jury trial for prior convictions. That right may be preserved even if the original jury is discharged prior to amendment. Here, defendant received his jury trial. He offers only speculation and conjecture in support for his assertions of prejudice because the same panel did not determine both guilt and the priors, and logic suggests none.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Baxter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Section 969a provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever it shall be discovered that a pending indictment or information does not charge all prior felonies of which the defendant has been convicted either in this State or elsewhere, said indictment or information may be forthwith amended to charge such prior conviction or convictions, and if such amendment is made it shall be made upon order of the court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Because defendant\u2019s crimes and sentencing preceded the January 1, 1998, effective date of the 1997 amendment (Stats. 1997, ch. 95, \u00a7 1), the issue here is governed by the preamendment version of section 1025, which was not divided into subdivisions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelii </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 452, 457 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 674, 981 P.2d 518] <em>(Kelii).) </em>As relevant here, the prior version of the statute provided: \u201c[T]he question whether or not [the defendant] has suffered such previous conviction must be tried by the jury which tries the issue upon the plea of not guilty, or in case of a plea of guilty, by a jury impaneled for that purpose, or by the court if a jury is waived.\u201d (Stats. 1951, ch. 1674, \u00a7 88, p. 3844.) In order to provide future guidance and assistance, we shall refer to the <em>current </em>version of section 1025, which does not differ in any material respect from the prior version as relevant to the issue presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">In this case, we do not consider whether a postdischarge amendment is proper after the guilt phase jury has been discharged, when the only contested issue in a defendant\u2019s trial on the alleged prior convictions is an issue to be decided by the court, and not the jury. (See \u00a7 1025, subd. (c); see also <em>Kelii, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 454; <em>Wiley, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 592.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">We are not confronted with, and thus do not consider, the situation where a defendant waives or forfeits the right under section 1025, subdivision (b), but the trial court and/or the prosecution seek to invoke that provision. Whether the same jury <em>must </em>decide both the issue of guilt and the truth of alleged prior convictions, in the face of a defendant\u2019s waiver or forfeiture, is a question for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, this is not a case where a court lacks fundamental subject matter jurisdiction, which cannot be conferred by waiver, estoppel, or consent. (4 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Jurisdiction and Venue, \u00a7 1822, p. 2159.) In contrast, a court\u2019s act in excess of its jurisdiction is valid until set aside, and a party may be precluded from setting it aside, due to waiver, estoppel or the passage of time. <em>(People v. Mendez </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1773, 1781 [286 Cal.Rptr. 216].) Thus, because a violation based on section 1025 <em>will </em>accommodate the circumstance of a defendant\u2019s forfeiture or waiver, our decision is entirely consistent with our recent decisions, <em>Saunders </em>and <em>Vera. </em>(Cf. dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 786.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In 1998, section 969\u00bd was amended and renumbered section 969.5.

The term \u201c[w]henever\u201d is limited by the term \u201cpending,\u201d which we concluded meant until sentencing. <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 598, 604-605.) We specifically did not consider, however, any further limitations to section 969a under section 1025, subdivision (b). <em>(Valladoli, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 608, fn. 4.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Defendant requests judicial notice of a letter from the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office (Bureau of Management and Budget), which responds to defendant\u2019s inquiry regarding the office\u2019s budget for the fiscal year 1996-1997.
