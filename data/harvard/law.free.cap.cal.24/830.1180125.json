We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In July 1998, the City of Los Angeles put into effect the Los Angeles Housing Code. It is codified as article 1 of chapter XVI of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (\u00a7 161.101 et seq.). Later that month, plaintiffs sued the city for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Los Angeles Municipal Code section 161.352, imposing an inspection fee on private landlords, is unenforceable because it was enacted without complying with section 6 of article XIII D. The city demurred. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the fee was not subject to the constitutional requirements. It entered judgment for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">In its statement of decision, the trial court recognized that the inspection fee \u201cappears arguably to fall within the wide range of assessments which Proposition 218 was apparently written to encompass.\u201d But it added, \u201cIn <em>Pennell v. City of San Jose </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 365, 375 [228 Cal.Rptr. 726, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>721 P.2d 1111], the California Supreme Court held that a fee charged to cover the costs of operating San Jose\u2019s rent control ordinances, and not used to raise general revenue, is not subject to Article XIII A of the California Constitution. The City\u2019s ordinance here fits squarely within both the reason and rule of <em>Pennell. </em>The ordinance levies only property used for residential apartment rentals, and the money is used only to pay for regulatfing such] rentals to insure, among other things, that they do not degenerate into what is commonly called \u2018slum conditions.\u2019 The assessment is not imposed on all property owners\u2014only a subset of owners who rent apartments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the state constitutional provision invalidated the city ordinance. The court wrote: \u201cThere is nothing in Proposition 218 that exempts regulatory fees imposed on residential rental properties. It thus adds nothing to say, as does the City, that the fees are not \u2018imposed upon property owners in general, but only those who voluntarily engage in the business of renting, generate the risks of slum housing, and specially benefit from regular inspections as they contribute to the overall reputability and safety of the housing provided.\u2019 Quite plainly, Proposition 218 applies to any \u2018fee\u2019 or \u2018charge,\u2019 both of which are defined to mean \u2018any levy other than an ad valorem tax, a special tax, or an assessment, imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u2019 (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (e) . . . .) However well intentioned the City\u2019s program to abolish slum housing may be, we find it impossible to say that a fee imposed upon the owners of rental units so the City can locate and eradicate substandard housing is anything other than a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u201d (Italics and fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Section 161.102 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code states the reason for enacting the Los Angeles Housing Code: \u201cIt is found and declared that there exist in the City of Los Angeles substandard and unsanitary residential buildings and dwelling units the physical conditions and characteristics of which render them unfit or unsafe for human occupancy and habitation, and which conditions and characteristics are such as to be detrimental to or jeopardize the health, safety and welfare of their occupants and of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">\u201cIt is further found and declared that the existence of such substandard buildings as dwelling units threatens the physical, social and economic stability of sound residential buildings and areas, and of their supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>neighborhood facilities and institutions; necessitates disproportionate expenditures of public funds for remedial action; impairs the efficient and economical exercise of governmental powers and functions; and destroys the amenity of residential areas and neighborhoods and of the community as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Los Angeles Municipal Code section 161.301, entitled Scope, declares that the Los Angeles Housing Code applies to \u201call residential rental properties with two or more dwelling units on the same lot, the land, buildings and structures appurtenant thereto,\u201d but not to owner-occupied units, on-campus dormitory housing, hotels, motels, or certain other types of housing also specifically exempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Division 3.5 of the Los Angeles Housing Code (\u00a7 161.351 et seq.) is entitled Housing Inspection Fees. Section 161.351 limits the scope of division 3.5 to \u201cresidential rental properties with two or more dwellings subject to the provisions of this Code.\u201d Those properties \u201cwill be subject to regular inspection by the General Manager or an authorized representative. Inspections may also be complaint-based.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Section 161.352 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, at issue here, sets forth the inspection fee schedule. It provides, in its entirety: \u201cOwners of all buildings subject to inspection shall pay a service fee of $12.00 per unit per year. The fee will be used to finance the cost of inspection and enforcement by the Housing Department. Should the owner fail to pay the required fee, the City of Los Angeles will recover it, plus accrued interest, utilizing any remedies provided by law including nuisance abatement or municipal tax lien procedures established by ordinance or state law. This fee shall be known as the \u2018Systematic Code Enforcement Program Fee.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">In November 1996 the voters approved Proposition 218, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act. (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996) text of Prop. 218, \u00a7 1, p. 108; reprinted as Historical Notes, 2A West\u2019s Ann. Cal. Const. (2001 supp.) foil. art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, p. 33.) The proposition amended the California Constitution, adding article XIH D. Section 3, subdivision (a)(3) of article XIII D provides that, with certain exceptions not relevant here, \u201cNo tax, assessment, fee, or charge shall be assessed by any agency upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except: ra \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ra \u2022 \u2022 . as provided by this article.\u201d An agency is a local or regional governmental entity. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (a); Cal. Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Section 1 of article XIIID provides that it applies to \u201call assessments, fees and charges, whether imposed pursuant to state statute or local government charter authority.\u201d Fees and charges are defined in subdivision (e) of section 2 thereof. \u201c \u2018Fee\u2019 or \u2018charge\u2019 means any levy other than an ad valorem tax, a special tax, or an assessment, imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">\u201cProperty-related service\u201d is further defined. It \u201cmeans a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Thus, and in summary, article XIII D applies, with certain exceptions not relevant here, to \u201cany levy . . . upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u201d (Art. XIIID, \u00a7 2, subd. (e).) As will appear, the outcome of this case turns on the meaning of this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Before us is \u201ca question of law for the appellate courts to decide on independent review of the facts.\u201d <em>(Sinclair Paint Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 866, 874 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 447, 937 P.2d 1350].) Though our reasoning turns on the language of the constitutional stricture, it may be helpful to explain, as did the Court of Appeal in <em>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Riverside </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 679 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 592] <em>(Howard Jarvis), </em>the reasons that led to placing Proposition 218 on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">\u201cProposition 218 can best be understood against its historical background, which begins in 1978 with the adoption of Proposition 13. \u2018The purpose of Proposition 13 was to cut local property taxes. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] Its principal provisions limited ad valorem property taxes to 1 percent of a property\u2019s assessed valuation and limited increases in the assessed valuation to 2 percent per year unless and until the property changed hands. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">\u201cTo prevent local governments from subverting its limitations, Proposition 13 also prohibited counties, cities, and special districts from enacting any special tax without a two-thirds vote of the electorate. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 4; <em>Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 1, 6-7 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 490, 820 P.2d 1000].) It has been held, however, that a special assessment is not a special tax within the meaning of Proposition 13. <em>(Knox </em>v. <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number><em>Orland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 132, 141 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 159, 841 P.2d 144], and cases cited.) Accordingly, a special assessment could be imposed without a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">\u201cIn November 1996, in part to change this rule, the electorate adopted Proposition 218, which added articles XIII C and XIII D to the California Constitution. Proposition 218 allows only four types of local property taxes: (1) an ad valorem property tax; (2) a special tax; (3) an assessment; and (4) a fee or charge. (Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 3, subd. (a)(1)-(4); see also <em>[id.], </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (a).) It buttresses Proposition 13\u2019s limitations on ad valorem property taxes and special taxes by placing analogous restrictions on assessments, fees, and charges.\u201d <em>(Howard Jarvis, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th 679, 681-682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The Court of Appeal explained the parties\u2019 differing views of the effect of article XIIID on the city ordinance. \u201cAs viewed by [plaintiffs], the fee is imposed \u2018upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership\u2019 and is, therefore, subject to the procedural requirements of Proposition 218. As viewed by the City, the fee is imposed upon a business activity (the rental of residential dwellings), separate and apart from property ownership, and purely for regulatory purposes, and it is therefore not subject to Proposition 218.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Adhering before us to their point of view, plaintiffs contend that \u201cnothing in Proposition 218 . . . supports] the contention that [it] was not meant to affect the ability of local governments to impose and collect business \u2018regulatory fees.\u2019 \u201d The city also adheres to its position, devoting much of its briefing to an argument that because its inspection fee is a regulatory fee on business operations, it falls outside the purview of article XIIID. Examining the ballot arguments for and against Proposition 218 and the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis of the measure, the city also contends that article XIII D was intended only to restrict fees imposed directly on property owners in their capacity as such. A regulatory fee imposed on residential rental businesses, the city argues, necessarily falls outside article XIII D\u2019s ambit, even if the fee bears some relation to ownership of real property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">As will appear, neither party is entirely correct. The relevant language of article XIII D does not compel a conclusion in plaintiffs\u2019 favor; rather, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>compels the opposite. The city also misses the mark when it contends (or at least implies) that a regulatory fee or a levy on the operation of a business necessarily falls outside the scope of article XIII D.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">But both parties are partly correct. Plaintiffs accurately state that the constitutional provision does not speak of regulatory fees or levies on business operations. Hence, the mere fact that a levy is regulatory (as this inspection fee clearly is) or touches on business activities (as it clearly does) is not enough, by itself, to remove it from article XIII D\u2019s scope. But the city is correct that article XIII D only restricts fees imposed directly on property owners in their capacity as such. The inspection fee is not imposed solely because a person owns property. Rather, it is imposed because the property is being rented. It ceases along with the business operation, whether or not ownership remains in the same hands. For that reason, the city must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Section 2 of Proposition 218 stated the measure\u2019s purpose. \u201cThe people of the State of California hereby find and declare that Proposition 13 was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases. However, local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax, assessment, fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases, but also threaten the economic security of all Californians and the California economy itself. This measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 218, \u00a7 2, p. 108; reprinted as Historical Notes, 2A West\u2019s Ann. Cal. Const., <em>supra, </em>foil. art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The repeated references to taxes and taxpayers suggest an intent to prohibit unratified exactions imposed on property owners as such, rather than on the business of renting or leasing apartments\u2014i.e., \u201cresidential rental properties with two or more dwellings\u201d (L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 161.351).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">As explained in <em>Howard Jarvis, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th 679, Proposition 218 is Proposition 13\u2019s progeny. Accordingly, it must be construed in that context. <em>(People ex rel. Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>294, 301 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042].) Specifically, because Proposition 218 was designed to close government-devised loopholes in Proposition 13, the intent and purpose of the latter informs our interpretation of the former. Proposition 13 was directed at taxes imposed on property owners, in particular homeowners. The text of Proposition 218, the ballot arguments (both in favor and against), the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis, and the annotations of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which drafted Proposition 218, all focus on exactions, whether they are called taxes, fees, or charges, that are directly associated with property ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis, printed in the November 1996 ballot pamphlet, is illustrative. It explained that Proposition 218 \u201cwould constrain local governments\u2019 ability to impose fees, assessments, and taxes,\u201d meaning \u201cproperty-related\u201d fees, including fees for water, sewer and refuse collection, but excluding gas and electricity charges (see Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 3, subd. (b)) and development fees (see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1, subd. (b)). (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis, p. 73.) It did not refer to levies linked more indirectly to property ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The ballot arguments for Proposition 218 are also illustrative. \u201cProposition 218 guarantees your right to vote on local tax increases\u2014even when they are called something else, like \u2018assessments\u2019 or \u2018fees\u2019 and imposed on homeowners.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 218, p. 76.) \u201cAfter voters passed Proposition 13, politicians created a loophole in the law that allows them to raise taxes without voter approval by calling taxes \u2018assessments\u2019 and \u2018fees.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThere are now over 5,000 local districts which can impose fees and assessments without the consent of local voters. Special districts have increased assessments by over 2400% over 15 years. Likewise, cities have increased utility taxes 415% and raised benefit assessments 976%, a ten-fold increase.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cTo confirm the impact of fees and assessments on you, look at your property tax bill. You will see a growing list of assessments imposed without voter approval. The list will grow even longer unless Proposition 218 passes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The ballot arguments identify what was perhaps the drafter\u2019s main concern: tax increases disguised via euphemistic relabeling as \u201cfees,\u201d \u201ccharges,\u201d or \u201cassessments.\u201d But in fairness to plaintiffs, it cannot be denied that the text of article XIIID does not limit its scope to taxes and taxpayers. We turn to the definitive language: restrictions on <em>any </em>levy imposed \u201cupon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership.\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">The foregoing language means that a levy may not be imposed on a property owner as such\u2014i.e., in its capacity as property owner\u2014unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>meets constitutional prerequisites. In this case, however; the fee is imposed on landlords not in their capacity as landowners, but in their capacity as business owners. The exaction at issue here is more in the nature of a fee for a business license than a charge against property. It is imposed only on those landowners who choose to engage in the residential rental business, and only while they are operating the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The contrary reasoning of the Court of Appeal, and of plaintiffs, stems from a reliance on the word \u201cincident,\u201d leaving aside that the constitutional provision does not refer to fees imposed <em>on </em>an incident of property ownership, but on a parcel or a person <em>as </em>an incident of property ownership. As amicus curiae for the city persuasively argue, the distinction is crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Were the principal words <em>parcel </em>and <em>person </em>missing, and were <em>as </em>replaced with <em>on, </em>so that article XIII D restricted the city\u2019s ability to impose fees \u201con an incident of property ownership,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 argument might have merit. (4) For among the incidents<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of estates in land are the so-called bundle of rights that flow from such tenure. (31 C.J.S. (1996) Estates \u00a7 12, pp. 28-30; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 14, pp. 32, 34; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 31, p. 58.) Among them is the fundamental right to alienate one\u2019s property held in fee simple. (E.g., <em>id., </em>\u00a7 12, p. 30; <em>Holien v. Trydahl </em>(N.D. 1965) 134 N.W.2d 851, 856; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Geyer </em>(1942) 151 Fla. 362, 369 [9 So.2d 727, 728]; <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Galloway </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>(1892) 111 N.C. 519, 523 [15 S.E. 890]; see also <em>Yee v. City of Escondido </em>(1992) 503 U.S. 519, 528 [112 S.Ct. 1522, 1528-1529, 118 L.Ed.2d 153].) That incident, or right, has been called \u201cinseparable\u201d <em>(Holien, supra, </em>134 N.W.2d at p. 856; <em>Hardy, supra, </em>15 S.E. at p. 890), \u201cindispensable\u201d <em>(Dukes v. Crumpton </em>(1958) 233 Miss. 611, 620 [103 So.2d 385, 388]), and \u201cnecessary\u201d <em>(Re Collier </em>(Nfld. 1966) 60 D.L.R.2d 70, 75 [52 M.P.R. 211, 216] (per Puddester, J.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The power to alienate property or a property right is not limited to the right to sell or assign it. It means generally the power \u201cto transfer or convey [it] to another.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 73, col. 1.) The conveyance need not be the whole fee. The right of alienation applies when fee holders seek to convey lesser estates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[T]he power or right of alienation\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018incident to the ownership of an estate in fee-simple\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018include[s] the power or right to dispose of property held in fee . . . by <em>lease, </em>mortgage, or other mode of conveyance ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Porter v. Barrett </em>(1925) 233 Mich. 373, 379-380 [206 N.W. 532, 535], quoting <em>Manierre v. Welling </em>(1911) 32 R.I. 104, 140 [78 A. 507, 522], italics added here.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Accordingly, <em>if </em>article XIII D restricted the city\u2019s ability to impose a \u201ctax, assessment, fee, or charge on an incident of property ownership\u201d (cf. <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2, subd. (e), 3), plaintiffs\u2019 argument might be persuasive. The business of renting apartments is an incident of owning them, an activity necessarily dependent on that ownership but not vice versa. One can own apartments without renting them, but no one can rent them without owning them. (See fn. 2, <em>ante, </em>at p. 840.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">But the language of article XIII D is materially dissimilar. As stated, article XIII D, section 3 provides that \u201c[n]o tax, assessment, fee, or charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>shall be assessed by any agency upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except. . .

In other words, taxes, assessments, fees, and charges are subject to the constitutional strictures when they burden landowners <em>as landowners. </em>The ordinance does not do so: it imposes a fee on its subjects by virtue of their ownership of a business\u2014 i.e., because they are <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What plaintiffs ask us to do is to alter the foregoing language\u2014changing \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d to \u201con an incident of property ownership.\u201d But to do so would be to ignore its plain meaning\u2014namely, that it applies only to exactions levied solely by virtue of property ownership. We may not interpret article XIII D as if it had been rewritten. (Accord, <em>People ex rel. Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 294, 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The language of article XIII D, sections 2, subdivision (e), and 3, shows that it applies to levies imposed on a person or on property strictly as an incident of property ownership. Had the law included levies imposed on incidents of the ownership or use of residential real property (as relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>here, the exercise of the right to rent one\u2019s property), its text would have said so. But it did not. And although the plain language of the relevant constitutional provisions requires us not to consider extrinsic evidence of the voters\u2019 intent, we reiterate, purely as an aside, that neither the ballot arguments nor the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis suggested that article XIIID was intended to encompass fees of the type at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The subordinate clause in section 2, subdivision (e), of article XIII D, as clarified in section 2, subdivision (h), supports our conclusion. It may be recalled that among the fees or charges covered by article XIII D, section 2, subdivision (e), is \u201ca user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u201d Such a service \u201cmeans a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (h).) In this case, the relationship between the city\u2019s inspection fee and property ownership is indirect\u2014it is overlain by the requirement that the landowner be a landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">As stated, the foregoing clause is subordinate. It does not include all possible fees and charges that fall within the ambit of article XIII D.  gut ft does provide additional evidence of the scope of the constitutional provision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">At oral argument, plaintiffs emphasized article XIII D\u2019s exemptions for existing development fees and all charges to provide gas and electrical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>service. (Art. XIII D, \u00a7\u00a7 1, subd. (b), 3, subd. (b).) They assert that a developer fee is a fee on an incident of property\u2014the right to improve it\u2014and that there would have been no need to exempt such fees if other fees imposed on incidents of property did not fall within article XIII D\u2019s scope. Similarly, they argue that one can own property without having utility service, and that if article XIII D applied strictly to levies that are imposed solely on the basis of property ownership, there would have been no need to exempt such utility charges in the constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We note, however, that the provision regarding development fees refers only to those existing at the time of article XIII D\u2019s enactment. Moreover, it is unclear to us whether a fee to provide gas or electricity service is the same as a fee imposed on the consumption of electricity or gas. In any event, we believe that the aforementioned exemptions may have been included in an abundance of caution in case court interpretations of article XIII D similar to the Court of Appeal\u2019s should prevail. Finally, we do not believe that any incongruity can trump the plain language we have discussed herein. In short, we are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Similarly unpersuasive is plaintiffs\u2019 contention, also emphasized at oral argument, that the city\u2019s ability to enforce payment of the inspection fee by imposing a lien on the property shows that the fee is property-related, not business-related. The fact is that the city is simply availing itself of all possible means to collect the fee. Property liens may be precipitated by at least one cause unconnected to land ownership (except ownership of the land on which the lien is imposed): the cost of removing graffiti. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 38772.) A lien may be imposed on parents\u2019 land to defray the cost of removing graffiti their child has scrawled on that belonging to another. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Plaintiffs also advert to section 5 of Proposition 218, which requires that \u201c[t]he provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 218, \u00a7 5, p. 109; reprinted as Historical Notes, 2A West\u2019s Ann. Cal. Const., <em>supra, </em>foil. art. XIII C, p. 33.)

The trial judge ruled that this \u2018is not a <em>necessary </em>incident to the operation of a common carrier,\u2019 and that as to it \u2018the plaintiff is not a motor common carrier, but is engaged in a special and distinct business in the City of Vidalia, and is taxable as such.\u2019 This formula interpolates before the word \u2018incidents,\u2019 used in the statute, the word \u2018necessary\u2019 so as to require, as a condition of tax immunity, that the operation be a necessary incident of the business of a motor common carrier. This appears to us to be erroneous. [Rather,] ... an incident of the business of a motor common carrier of freight would be something naturally associated as pertinent to such transportation and necessarily dependent upon it, but without which the business of transportation might nevertheless be carried on. In other words, the incidental operation would be necessarily dependent upon the transportation, but the business of transportation would not be necessarily dependent upon the incidental operation. ...

They are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"APq\">In <em>Sinclair </em>we held that an exaction on sources of lead contamination to remediate the effects of lead poisoning was a fee, not a tax. In <em>Pennell, </em>we held that a $3.75 charge on each residential rental unit, imposed by a rent control ordinance to fund its hearing process, also was a fee, not a tax. In <em>Sinclair </em>and <em>Pennell, </em>we defined such fees, which are similar to the city\u2019s inspection charge, as regulatory in nature. Regulatory fees are those \u201c \u2018 \u201ccharged in connection with regulatory activities!,] which fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the activity for which the fee is charged and which are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Sinclair Paint Co. v.

Indeed, in <em>Sinclair </em>we cautioned that \u201cWe are not here concerned with issues arising under constitutional amendments effected by a recent initiative measure (Proposition 218) adopted at the November 5, 1996, General Election.

Nothing in the ballot arguments in favor of or against Proposition 218 or in the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis implies that a different rule should obtain with respect to \u201cincident,\u201d or that the voters intended it to have other than a plain meaning. The dictionary defines an \u201cincident\u201d as \u201csomething incident to something else,\" that is, \u201cdependent upon or involved in something else.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New World Dict.

In other words, if the imposition of a fee depends upon one\u2019s ownership of property, it comes within the purview of article XIII D unless otherwise excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The fee at issue here plainly meets this definition. Pursuant to its police powers, the City of Los Angeles (City) enacted a Housing Code (L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 161.101 et seq.), which provides that residential rental properties are subject to regular inspection for substandard and unsanitary conditions. Under the Housing Code, funding for these inspections devolves to a particular class of property owners, the landlords of the rental units, who must pay a $12 fee for every unit owned. <em>(Id,, </em>\u00a7 161.352.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the majority acknowledges, \u201cno one can rent [apartments] without owning them.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 841; see also <em>Nash </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 97, 105 [207 Cal.Rptr. 285, 688 P.2d 894].) And no one is subject to the rental inspection fee without owning them. This exaction is thus imposed \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d (art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (e)); that is, it is dependent upon such ownership. (Cf. Off. of Legis. Analyst, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996) p. 30 [\u201cGenerally, we think these fees would be considered property-related if there were no practical way that the owner could avoid the fee, short of selling the property or fundamentally changing its use\u201d].) Moreover, \u201c[s]hould the owner fail to pay the required fee, the City of Los Angeles will recover it, plus accrued interest, utilizing any remedies provided by law including nuisance abatement or municipal tax lien procedures established by ordinance or state law.\u201d (L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 161.352.) The use of tax lien procedures is a typical enforcement mechanism for delinquent levies imposed against property.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The majority avoids this result in part by finding the City \u201cimposes a fee on its subjects by virtue of their ownership of a business\u2014i.e., because they are landlords.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 842.) The last portion of this statement proves too much: Landlords are property owners. Imposition of the fee is an incident of, i.e., depends upon, that status and thereby runs afoul of article XIIID. As for the first portion of the statement, it ignores or disregards what the majority elsewhere concedes, that the business at issue is inseparable from property ownership. No amount of parsing can change that ineluctable fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>The majority also concludes \u201cneither the ballot arguments nor the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis suggested that article XIII D was intended to encompass fees of the type at issue here.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 843.) Ultimately, the terms of the measure as enacted control our interpretation (see <em>Kopp v. Fair Pol. Practices Com. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 607, 673 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 108, 905 P.2d 1248] (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.)); and their plain meaning does not support the majority\u2019s reasoning. But the ballot materials also belie the majority\u2019s conclusion. While those materials do not specifically mention rental inspection fees, such an intention is readily discemable from any fair reading. The Legislative Analyst warned generally that \u201c[t]his measure would constrain local governments\u2019 ability to impose fees\u201d and \u201c[rjeduce the amount of fees . . . businesses pay.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996), analysis of Prop. 218 by the Legis. Analyst, p. 73 (Ballot Pamphlet).) More particularly, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s list of \u201cmost likely fees and assessments affected by these provisions\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 74) easily encompasses this type of exaction: \u201cpark and recreation programs, fire protection, lighting, ambulance, business improvement programs, library, and water service.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The argument in favor of Proposition 218 reminded the electorate that \u201c[a]fter voters passed Proposition 13, politicians created a loophole in the law that allows them to raise taxes without voter approval by calling taxes \u2018assessments\u2019 and \u2018fees.\u2019 \u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 218, p. 76.) \u201cProposition 218 guarantees your right to vote on local tax increases\u2014even when they are called something else, like \u2018assessments\u2019 or \u2018fees\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The argument did not limit the type of \u201cfee\u201d that would be subject to a vote under article XIII D but instead promised, \u201cProposition 218 . . . stops politicians\u2019 end-runs around Proposition 13.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 218, p. 77.) Particularly in light of its timing, the City\u2019s rental inspection fee appears to be just the kind of evasive maneuver at which proponents aimed Proposition 218. (See generally <em>Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency v. Martin </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 100, 105 [211 Cal.Rptr. 133, 695 P.2d 220] [purpose, in part, of Prop. 13 was \u201cto prevent the government from recouping its losses from decreased property taxes by imposing or increasing other taxes\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In this regard, the majority also fails to accord any significance to two important provisions of Proposition 218. In any action challenging imposition of a new or increased fee or charge, the initiative assigns to the agency \u201cthe burden ... to demonstrate compliance with this article\u201d (art. XIII D, \u00a7 6, subd. (b)(5)), thereby reversing the usual deference accorded governmental action in such matters and making it more difficult to defend its legitimacy. (See Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 218 by the Legis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Analyst, p. 74; see also art. XIIID, \u00a7 4, subd. (f) [imposing same burden for assessments].) The voters also expressly provided that Proposition 218 \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 218, \u00a7 5, p. 109, also reprinted as Historical Notes, 2A West\u2019s Ann. Cal. Const. (2000 supp.) foil. art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, p. 25.) The majority\u2019s construction frustrates both these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The City argues that conditioning imposition of its rental inspection fee on compliance with the procedures set forth in article XIII D would allow landlords to defeat regulation of their businesses. This argument misses two critical points: First and generally, since the City has decided its rental inspections are necessary to eradicate \u201csubstandard and unsanitary residential buildings and dwelling units the physical conditions and characteristics of which ... are such as to be detrimental to or jeopardize the health, safety and welfare of their occupants and of the public\u201d (L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 161.102), it can reasonably expect the public to pay for the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Second and specifically, the Los Angeles Municipal Code already provides substantial enforcement authority to prosecute landlords who violate the City\u2019s Housing Code. If a property owner fails to correct violations, the City may recover its administrative as well as abatement costs (L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 161.206.2), may seek criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 161.206.3), and may pursue civil remedies as provided in the Health and Safety Code (L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 161.206.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">When the voters passed Proposition 13 in 1978, they sought to restrict the ability of government to impose taxes and other charges on property owners without their approval. For almost two decades, however, they witnessed politicians evade this constitutional limitation. The message of Proposition 218 is that they meant what they said. With the majority turning a deaf ear to that message, we may well expect a future effort to \u201cstop[] politicians\u2019 end-runs around Proposition 13.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 218, p. 77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Baxter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Los Angeles Municipal Code section 161.352 provides: <em>\u201cOwners </em>of all buildings subject to inspection shall pay a service fee of $12.00 per unit per year. The fee will be used to finance the cost of inspection and enforcement by the Housing Department. Should the <em>owner </em>fail to pay the required fee, the City of Los Angeles will recover it, plus accrued interest, utilizing any remedies provided by law including nuisance abatement or municipal tax lien procedures established by ordinance or state law. This fee shall be known as the \u2018Systematic Code Enforcement Program Fee.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
