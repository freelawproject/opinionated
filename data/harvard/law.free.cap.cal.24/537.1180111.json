Odegaard </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 312, 350 [94 S.Ct. 1704, 1722, 40 L.Ed.2d 164] (dis. opn. of Brennan, J.).) In November 1996, the California voters added yet another chapter to the long and tortuous history of this question when they approved Proposition 209, which amended our Constitution to prohibit the state and its political subdivisions from \u201cdiscriminating] against, or granting] preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 31.) Subsequent to the approval of Proposition 209, the City of San Jose adopted a program that requires contractors bidding on city projects to utilize a specified percentage of minority and women subcontractors or to document efforts to include minority and women subcontractors in their bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">The question before the court is whether this program contravenes article I, section 31 of the California Constitution. Although the precise issue is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>narrow one, the electorate did not approve Proposition 209 in a vacuum. Quite the contrary. Thus, while it may be possible to resolve the matter, as do the Chief Justice and Justice Kennard, simply by relying on differences between Proposition 209 and title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or on the plain meaning of the initiative\u2019s language, we can discern and thereby effectuate the voters\u2019 intention only by interpreting this language in its historical context. Viewing the provisions of article I, section 31 from this perspective, it is clear the voters intended to adopt the original construction of the Civil Rights Act and prohibit the kind of preferential treatment accorded by this program.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The salient facts, which are not in dispute, are drawn from the opinion of the Court of Appeal. In 1983, the City of San Jose (City) established a program to encourage public works projects participation by minority business enterprises (MBE\u2019s) and women business enterprises (WBE\u2019s).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For each contract, the City set a \u201cparticipation goal\u201d based on the \u201cavailability and ability of the MBE and WBE to do the work to be contracted.\u201d To qualify as a \u201cresponsible bidder,\u201d a contractor had to meet or exceed this goal or demonstrate \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to obtain MBE/WBE participation. \u201cReasonable efforts\u201d entailed documenting written notice to at least four MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s soliciting them for the project, follow-up contact to determine their interest in bidding, and written reasons justifying rejection of an MBE\u2019s or WBE\u2019s low bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co. </em>(1989) 488 U.S. 469, 498-507 [109 S.Ct. 706, 724-729, 102 L.Ed.2d 854] <em>(Croson), </em>that a state government could not implement a program designed to remedy past discrimination absent a factual predicate substantiating an inference of prior discriminatory exclusion. Following <em>Croson, </em>in 1990 the City suspended its MBE/WBE program and commissioned a study to identify any statistically significant disparity in the number and dollar value of contracts and subcontracts awarded to MBE\u2019s and WBE\u2019s. The resulting report established such a disparity as to the amount of contract dollars awarded MBE subcontractors. In response, the City adopted the \u201cMBE/WBE Construction Program\u201d to encourage nondiscriminatory subcontracting. Like its predecessor, the new program included participation goals and required documentation of good faith efforts to meet them.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">After the passage of Proposition 209, the City\u2019s Office of Affirmative Action/Contract Compliance became the Office of Equality Assurance. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>City also adopted the Nondiscrimmation/Nonpreferential Treatment Program Applicable to Construction Contracts in Excess of $50,000 (Program) at issue here. The Program reaffirms the findings of the 1990 disparity study and attempts to clarify the City\u2019s policy of nondiscrimination and nonpreference in the subcontracting of its construction projects to \u201censure that the historical discrimination does not continue.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">As with the 1983 version, the Program requires contractors bidding on City projects to fulfill either an outreach or a participation component. The \u201cDocumentation of Outreach\u201d option entails maintaining records of written notice, or \u201csolicitation letters,\u201d to four certified MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s for each trade area identified for the project. Copies of the notice or letters must accompany the bid. The contractor must document at least three attempts to contact the MBE/WBE firms to determine their interest in participating in the project. If any MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s express interest, the contractor must negotiate in good faith. It may not unjustifiably reject any bids prepared by MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s and must specify the reasons for doing so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to the \u201cDocumentation of Participation\u201d option, the City determines for each project the number of MBE/WBE subcontractors that would be expected in the absence of discrimination. If a contractor lists a sufficient number of MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s in the bid to meet this \u201cevidentiary presumption\u201d of nondiscrimination, it will satisfy the participation alternative, and the City will not require any documentation of outreach.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">A bid failing to document either MBE/WBE outreach or participation is rejected as \u201cnonresponsive,\u201d and the contractor is deemed not a \u201cresponsible\u201d bidder. The Program\u2019s requirements apply to all contractors, including MBE\u2019s, WBE\u2019s, and those not planning to subcontract any portion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In 1997, the City solicited bids on a project for which plaintiff Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc. (Hi-Voltage), a general contracting firm, was the low bidder. Because it intended to utilize entirely its own work force, it failed to comply with either the MBE/WBE outreach or participation requirement. The City therefore rejected its bid. Joined by plaintiff Allen Jones, a City taxpayer, Hi-Voltage initiated this litigation challenging the Program as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>violation of article I, section 31 of the California Constitution (section 31) because it required contractors to accord \u201cunlawful preferences\u201d to minority and women subcontractors by giving them \u201cspecial assistance and information\u201d not provided non-MBE/WBE subcontractors. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction preventing continuation of the Program. The trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding that both components of the Program constituted race- and sex-based classifications that violated section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed. Considering the language of section 31 in light of the ballot materials accompanying Proposition 209, the court concluded \u201cthat the term \u2018preferential treatment\u2019 . . . , viewed in its ordinary, natural sense, refers to any kind of treatment favoring one group or individual over another. The prohibition is not limited to set-asides, quotas, and \u2018plus factors,\u2019 but extends to all preferences granted to the target groups. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d The court found section 31, as thus defined, invalidated the Program\u2019s MBE/WBE outreach option because it does more than \u201cencourag[e] contractors to include MBE/WBE\u2019s in soliciting subcontractor bids.\u201d It requires them \u201cto give personal attention to and consideration of minority and women businesses that need not be given to non-MBE/WBE\u2019s. Furthermore, the contractor may not \u2018unjustifiably reject as unsatisfactory bids prepared by any [MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s].\u2019 This requirement alone grants a distinct preference to MBE/WBE businesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">With respect to the participation option, the court determined the evidentiary presumption established an impermissible goal for including MBE/ WBE firms in a contractor\u2019s bid. It found unpersuasive the City\u2019s contention that the evidentiary presumption is not discriminatory or preferential because its purpose is \u201conly to \u2018screen\u2019 for discrimination, \u2018not to have contractors achieve some predetermined objective\u2019 . . . .\u201d In the court\u2019s view, \u201c[n]either the text of Proposition 209 nor its accompanying ballot materials suggest that a violation occurs only when the government <em>intentionally </em>discriminates or grants preferences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We granted the City\u2019s petition for review to settle this important question of state constitutional law. To properly measure the relevant analytical context, we trace back almost 150 years before the passage of Proposition 209 and find recurring patterns in the law as to the appropriate role of government concerning questions of race.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This extended perspective both illuminates the meaning and purpose of Proposition 209 and guides its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The United States was founded on the principle that \u201call men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d (Declaration of Independence.) Yet, our history reflects a continuing struggle to enable every individual to fully realize this \u201cself-evident\u201d article of faith. (See <em>University of California Regents v. Bakke </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 265, 387-395 [98 S.Ct. 2733, 2797-2802, 57 L.Ed.2d 750] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Marshall, J.) <em>(Bakke II).) </em>That struggle demarcates the historical and cultural context within which we decide the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">While the courts have been instrumental in effecting positive change in the quest for equality, their involvement in articulating a coherent vision of the civil rights guaranteed by our Constitution has not been without its low points. (See <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 279, 343-344 [107 S.Ct. 1756, 1793-1794, 95 L.Ed.2d 262] (dis. opn. of Brennan, J.); <em>Fullilove </em>v. <em>Klutznick, </em>supra, 448 U.S. at p. 516 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2794] (conc. opn. of Powell, J.).) The nadir was perhaps the <em>Dred Scott </em>decision, in which the United States Supreme Court denied citizen status to African-Americans, \u201cwhether emancipated or not.\u201d <em>(Dred Scott </em>v. <em>Sandford </em>(1856) 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 405 [15 L.Ed. 691, 700] <em>(Dred Scott).) </em>The true vice of <em>Dred Scott </em>lies not so much in the fact it \u201ctreated prohibition of slavery in the Territories as nothing less than a general assault on the concept of property.\u201d <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 702, 770 [117 S.Ct. 2258, 2284, 134 L.Ed.2d 772] (conc. opn. of Souter, J.); see <em>Dred Scott, supra, </em>60 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>pp. 449-452 [15 L.Ed. at pp. 719-720].) Rather, a majority of the United States Supreme Court endorsed the then-prevailing societal view that African-Americans\u2014whether slave or free\u2014were \u201caltogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations\u201d; and \u201chad no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\u201d <em>(Dred Scott, supra, </em>60 U.S. at p. 407 [15 L.Ed. at p. 701]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1854) 4 Cal. 399, 404-405 [holding as a matter of \u201cpublic policy\u201d under state statute that Chinese, \u201ca race of people whom nature has marked as inferior,\u201d were precluded from testifying against White persons].) In legitimating this pernicious concept, the court set the stage not only for the cataclysm of the Civil War but for the contentiousness that continues to this day over government\u2019s proper role with respect to race.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Following the Civil War, Congress overturned the <em>Dred Scott </em>decision when it adopted the Fourteenth Amendment expressly defining citizenship and forbidding any state from \u201cdeny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Nevertheless, in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson </em>(1896) 163 U.S. 537, 552 [16 S.Ct. 1138, 1143-1144, 41 L.Ed. 256] <em>(Plessy), </em>the Supreme Court validated government-initiated racial restrictions and gave its imprimatur to legally enforced segregation on the theory that \u201c[i]f one race be inferior to the other socially, the Constitution of the United States cannot put them upon the same plane.\u201d The court approved \u201cseparate but equal\u201d <em>(ibid. </em>(dis. opn. of Harlan, J.)) accommodations as a valid exercise of the state\u2019s \u201cpolice power\u201d to prevent racial strife. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 544 [16 S.Ct. at pp. 1144-1145].) Although speaking only for himself at the time, Justice Harlan vigorously dissented: \u201cOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 559 [16 S.Ct. at p. 1146] (dis. opn. of Harlan, J.).) \u201cThe destinies of the two races, in this country, are indissolubly linked together, and the interests of both require that the common government of all shall not permit the seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 560 [16 S.Ct. at p. 1147] (dis. opn. of Harlan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Justice Harlan\u2019s view would not prevail for more than half a century. But, in <em>Brown v. Board of Education </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 483 [74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, 38 A.L.R.2d 1180], a unanimous Supreme Court acknowledged the invidious effect of separating individuals solely because of their race. \u201c \u2018The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494 [74 S.Ct. at p. 691].) Repudiating <em>Plessy, </em>the court concluded that \u201cin the field of public education the doctrine of \u2018separate but equal\u2019 has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal [and] deprive[] [those affected] of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 495 [74 S.Ct. at p. 692].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>347 U.S. 483, concerned state-imposed segregation in education, but the courts did not hesitate to apply its animating principle in other contexts. (See Van Alstyne, <em>Rites of Passage: Race, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution </em>(1979) 46 U. Chi. L.Rev. 775, 783, fn. 24, and cases cited therein (Van Alstyne).) In summarizing the common thread of these cases, Professor Van Alstyne observed that in the years between 1955 and 1976 following <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>347 U.S. 483, \u201cvirtually every other race-related decision by the Supreme Court appeared to convey\u201d Justice Harlan\u2019s conviction \u201cthat the Civil War amendments altogether \u2018removed the race line from our governmental systems.\u2019 \u201d (Van Alstyne, <em>supra, </em>46 U. Chi. L.Rev. at p. 783.) \u201cTo the reasonably discerning, this appeared true even in instances involving highly controversial judicial decrees that paired racially identifiable schools, redrafted attendance lines, or mandated busing. In each instance, the fulcrum of judicial leverage was an <em>existing governmental </em>race line, which the particular judicial order sought to remove. The object was thus to disestablish particular, existing uses of race, not to establish new ones.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 783-784, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Although a landmark decision, <em>Brown v. Board of Education </em>was not singular. Both before and after, the United States Supreme Court was actively developing a \u201ccolor-blind\u201d jurisprudence. <em>Hughes v. Superior Court </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 460 [70 S.Ct. 718, 94 L.Ed. 985] involved an injunction against picketers seeking to have a supermarket hire African-American grocery clerks at a particular location proportionate to the number of African-American customers at that store. This court upheld a judgment of contempt for violation of the injunction, and the high court affirmed. The picketers had claimed a deprivation of due process for infringement of their right to free speech. The Supreme Court rejected the argument, noting \u201cthat it would encourage discriminatory hiring to give constitutional protection to petitioners\u2019 efforts to subject the opportunity of getting a job to a quota system.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 463 [70 S.Ct. at p. 720]; cf. <em>DeFunis v. Odegaard, supra, </em>416 U.S. at p. 336 [94 S.Ct. at p. 1716] (dis. opn. of Douglas, J.) [\u201cThere is no constitutional right for any race to be preferred\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Greenville </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 244 [83 S.Ct. 119, 10 L.Ed.2d 323], the high court struck down a city ordinance requiring restaurant and hotel proprietors to maintain segregated facilities. When a state \u201cpasses a law compelling persons to discriminate against other persons because of race,\u201d it commits \u201ca palpable violation of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 248 [83 S.Ct. at p. 1121].) <em>Reitman v. Mulkey </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 369 [87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830] concerned a state constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>amendment that, while facially neutral, encouraged and facilitated racial discrimination in the rental and sale of residential property. As in analogous decisions, the state had violated the right of equal protection because it \u201chad taken affirmative action designed to make private discriminations legally possible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 375 [87 S.Ct. at p. 1631].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Professor Alexander Bickel referred to these cases as \u201cthe great decisions of the Supreme Court\u201d whose lesson \u201cand the lesson of contemporary history have been the same for at least a generation: discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, immoral, unconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of democratic society.\u201d (Bickel, The Morality of Consent (1975) p. 133 (Bickel).) For Professor Van Alstyne, \u201cthe message is commendably even stronger. Laws that divide and index people to measure their civil rights by race are unconstitutional. Laws that encourage others to do so are similarly invalid. And laws attempting to advance either policy even in disguise will likewise be struck down whenever it is within the capacity of conscientious courts to see beneath their cellophane wrappers.\u201d (Van Alstyne, <em>supra, </em>46 U.

Nevertheless, the court stressed, \u201cCongress did not intend by Title VII, however, to guarantee a job to every person regardless of qualifications. . . . Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed. What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 430-431 [91 S.Ct. at p. 853].)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Equally clear in the court\u2019s view, \u201cTitle VII . . . prohibits the discharge of \u2018any individual\u2019 because of \u2018such individual\u2019s race,\u2019 [citation].

Consistent with the broad equitable powers conferred by Congress, Title VII courts may even, under limited circumstances, award seniority to persons who had never actually applied for a job. \u201cA consistently enforced discriminatory policy can surely deter job applications from those who are aware of it and are unwilling to subject themselves to the humiliation of explicit and certain rejection.\u201d <em>(Teamsters, </em>at p. 365 [97 S.Ct. at p. 1870].) Such a violation may not be unduly attenuated, however. The claimant must \u201cshow that he was a potential victim of unlawful discrimination\u201d and discharge \u201cthe not always easy burden of proving that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those practices.

[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2951].) Thus, \u201ccourts may not impose such a remedy on an employer at least until a violation of Title VII has been proved . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 578 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2950].)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s early interpretation of Title VII emphasized several factors: The purpose of Title VII was to ensure equal opportunity for all. Thus, discriminatory practices were forbidden irrespective of the victim\u2019s race. Relief could take the form of restitution to individual victims, including those establishing that an employer\u2019s pattern and practice of discrimination deterred their applications for employment. It could also be remedial, to eradicate the effects of specific discriminatory practices, but courts had no obligation or authority to require any particular affirmative hiring or other employment practices. In other words, consistent with congressional intent, the court\u2019s construction confirmed and reinforced the role of government as color-blind in these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The analytical framework of Title VII jurisprudence underwent substantial modification in 1979 when the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Steelworkers v. Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. 193 <em>(Weber). </em>In <em>Weber, </em>the employer voluntarily instituted a training program as part of an effort to eliminate a conspicuous racial imbalance in its craftworkers. Selection for the program was based on seniority, with the proviso that at least half of the trainees chosen be African-Americans \u201cuntil the percentage of black skilled craft-workers in the . . . plant approximated the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 199 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2725].) A White employee who had been denied entry despite greater seniority than some African-Americans admitted into the program brought suit under Title VII. A majority of the court found no violation. \u201cExamination of [the legislative history of Title VII and the historical context from which the Act arose] makes clear that an interpretation . . . that forbade all race-conscious affirmative action would \u2018bring about an end completely at variance with the purpose of the statute\u2019 and must be rejected. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Weber, </em>at pp. 201-202 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2726].) Because \u201cCongress\u2019 primary concern in enacting the prohibition against racial discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was with \u2018the plight of the Negro in our economy\u2019 \u201d <em>(Weber, </em>at p. 202 [99 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>at pp. 2726-2727]) and \u201cprivate and voluntary affirmative action efforts [were] one method of solving this problem\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 203 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2727]), Congress could not have meant to ban them absolutely. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 206 [99 S.Ct. at pp. 2728-2729].) The court further interpreted Title VII to permit race-conscious action \u201cwhenever the job category in question is \u2018traditionally segregated.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Weber, </em>at p. 212 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2731] (conc. opn. of Blackmun, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Although concurring, Justice Blackmun admitted, \u201cThe Court\u2019s expansive approach is somewhat disturbing for me because, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist points out, the Congress that passed Title VII probably thought it was adopting a principle of nondiscrimination that would apply to blacks and whites alike. While setting aside that principle can be justified where necessary to advance statutory policy by encouraging reasonable responses as a form of voluntary compliance that mitigates \u2018arguable violations,\u2019 discarding the principle of nondiscrimination where no countervailing statutory policy exists appears to be at odds with the bargain struck when Title VII was enacted.\u201d <em>(Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. 193, 212-213 [99 S.Ct. 2721, 2732] (conc. opn. of Blackmun, J.).) Justice Blackmun also expressed concern that under the majority\u2019s rule, \u201c[t]he individual employer need not have engaged in discriminatory practices in the past.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 213 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2732].) Nevertheless, he discerned some analytical support for the result and concluded that \u201cif the Court has misperceived the political will, it has the assurance that because the question is statutory Congress may set a different course if it so chooses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 216 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2734]; but see <em>DeRonde v.

The Chief Justice criticized the majority\u2019s apparent reversal of settled law: \u201cUntil today, I had thought the Court was of the unanimous view that \u2018[d]iscriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed\u2019 in Title VII.\u201d <em>(Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. 193, 218 [99 S.Ct. 2721, 2735] (dis. opn. of Burger, C.

In his view, the legislative history established that the Civil Rights Act \u201cwas conceived and enacted to make discrimination against <em>any </em>individual illegal, and I fail to see how \u2018voluntary compliance\u2019 with the no-discrimination principle that is the heart and soul of Title VII as currently written will be achieved by permitting employers to discriminate against some individuals to give preferential treatment to others.\u201d <em>(Weber, </em>at p. 218 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2735].)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Justice Rehnquist recounted the numerous cases in which the court had \u201cnever wavered in our understanding that Title VII \u2018prohibits <em>all </em>racial discrimination in employment, without exception for any group of particular employees.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. 193, 220 [99 S.Ct. 2721, 2736] (dis. opn. of Rehnquist, J.), quoting <em>McDonald, supra, </em>427 U.S. at p. 283 [96 S.Ct. at p. 2580].)

For example, \u201cSenator Humphrey [one of the bipartisan floor managers of the entire civil rights bill in the Senate] . . . stated that \u2018nothing in the bill would permit any official or court to require any employer or labor union to give preferential treatment to any minority group.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 237 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2744], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Senator Kuchel, the other bipartisan floor manager explained: \u201c \u2018Employers and labor organizations could not discriminate <em>in favor of or against </em>a person because of his race, his religion, or his national origin.

(See also <em>Firefighters </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 501 [106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405] [consent decree requiring race-conscious promotions did not violate Title VII even though beneficiaries had not suffered discrimination].) In reaching this result, a plurality of the court construed Title VII not only to guarantee equal employment opportunities but to \u201cfoster\u201d them as well. <em>(Sheet Metal Workers, supra, </em>478 U.S. at p. 448 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 3035-3036].) \u201c[E]ven where the employer or union formally ceases to engage in discrimination, informal mechanisms may obstruct equal employment opportunities.

Notwithstanding the lack of any evidence the agency had actually discriminated against women, the court found the plan justified by a \u201c \u2018conspicuous . . . imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 630 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1451].) Departing from the burden-shifting procedures of <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra, </em>411 U.S. 792, and <em>Furnco, supra, </em>438 U.S. 567 (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 550, fn. 7), the court concluded \u201c[a] manifest imbalance need not be such that it would support a prima facie case against the employer . . . since we do not regard as identical the constraints of Title VII and the Federal Constitution on voluntarily adopted affirmative action plans.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 632 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1452], fn. omitted; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 633, fn. 10 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1452].)

In relying on this justification, it replaced individual right of equal opportunity with proportional group representation. Although pursued for the purpose of eliminating invidious discrimination, history reveals that this prevailing social and political norm had its parallel in laws antedating the Civil Rights Act, when government could legally classify according to race.

[\u00b6] Proposition 209 is called the California Civil Rights Initiative because it restates the historic Civil Rights Act . . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . .

Moreover, preferences, for any purpose, are anathema to the very process of democracy.\u201d <em>(Price, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 257, 299 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">By virtue of the initiative process, the California electorate \u201cset a different course\u201d from that charted by the courts since <em>Weber </em>and <em>Price. (Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. 193, 216 [99 S.Ct. 2721, 2733-2734] (conc. opn. of Black-mun, J.).) \u201cRather than classifying individuals by race or gender, Proposition 209 <em>prohibits </em>the State from classifying individuals by race or gender.\u201d <em>(Coalition for Economic Equality </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 122 F.3d 692, 702 <em>(Coalition II); </em>see also <em>Johnson, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 658 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1465-1466] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)  The ballot arguments\u2014from which we draw our historical perspective\u2014make clear that in approving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Proposition 209, the voters intended section 31, like the Civil Rights Act as originally construed, \u201cto achieve equality of [public employment, education, and contracting] opportunities\u201d <em>(Griggs, supra, </em>401 U.S. at p. 429 [91 S.Ct. at p. 853]) and to remove \u201cbarriers [that] operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431 [91 S.Ct. at p. 853].) In short, the electorate desired to restore the force of constitutional law to the principle articulated by President Carter on Law Day 1979: \u201c \u2018Basing present discrimination on. past discrimination is obviously not right.\u2019 \u201d ((May 15, 1979) 47 U.S.L. Week 2726.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Considering the entirety of our discussion, we remain persuaded the City\u2019s Program violates section 31. Because the City rejects any bid that fails to comply with one or the other requirement, both of which are race and sex based, the essential structure of the Program discriminates on an impermissible basis against prime contractors that neither engage in outreach nor meet the evidentiary presumption, and it grants preferential treatment to those that do. (See <em>Monterey Mechanical Co. v. Wilson </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 125 F.3d 702, 707, 710 <em>(Monterey Mechanical); </em>see also <em>Coalition I, supra, </em>946 F.Supp. at pp. 1495-1496.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The outreach component requires contractors to treat MBE/WBE subcontractors more advantageously by providing them notice of bidding opportunities, soliciting their participation, and negotiating for their services, none of which they must do for non-MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s. The fact prime contractors are not precluded from contacting non-MBE\u2019 s/WBE\u2019s is irrelevant. The relevant constitutional consideration is that they are compelled to contact MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s, which are thus accorded preferential treatment within the meaning of section 31. (See <em>Monterey Mechanical, supra, </em>125 F.3d at p. 711; see also <em>Furnco, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 577 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2949] [\u201cThe central focus of the inquiry ... is always whether the employer is treating \u2018some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u2019 [citation].\u201d]; cf. <em>Mulkey v. Reitman, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at pp. 540, 542; <em>Anderson v. Martin, supra, </em>375 U.S. at p. 403 [84 S.Ct. at p. 456]; <em>Peterson v. Greenville, supra, </em>373 U.S. at p. 248 [83 S.Ct. at p. 1121].)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The participation component authorizes or encourages what amounts to discriminatory quotas or set-asides, or at least race- and sex-conscious numerical goals. (See <em>Monterey Mechanical, supra, </em>125 F.3d at p. 711; <em>Bras </em>v. <em>California Public Utilities Com\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 59 F.3d 869, 875 (Bras); see generally <em>Mulkey </em>v. <em>Reitman, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 541; <em>Anderson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>Martin, supra, </em>375 U.S. 399.) A participation goal differs from a quota or set-aside only in degree; by whatever label, it remains \u201ca line drawn on the basis of race and ethnic status\u201d as well as sex. <em>(Bakke II, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 289 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 2747-2748], fn. omitted; see <em>Bras, supra, </em>59 F.3d at pp. 874-875.) Thus understood, such a goal plainly runs counter to the express intent of the historic Civil Rights Act and, concomitantly, the intent of Proposition 209. As members of Congress were repeatedly assured regarding Title VII, the Act \u201c \u2018provides no preferential treatment for any group of citizens. <em>In fact, it specifically prohibits such </em>treatment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. at p. 248 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2750], some italics added (dis. opn. of Rehnquist, J.), quoting remarks of Sen. Saltonstall, Chair of the Republican Conf. of Sens. (110 Cong. Rec. 12691 (1964).). While perhaps less explicit in the Act itself, the same may be said for the race- and sex-conscious outreach at issue here, in that it effectively provides an advantage to members of the targeted groups. For example, in <em>Furnco, supra, </em>438 U.S. 567, the Supreme Court rejected a requirement that an employer alter its race-neutral hiring practices and institute a method that allowed it \u201cto consider the qualifications of the largest number of minority applicants.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 576 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2949].) \u201cWe think the imposition of that . . . simply finds no support either in the nature of the prima facie case or the purpose of Title VII.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 576-577 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2949]; see <em>id. </em>at p. 578 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2950].)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The City\u2019s Program essentially places on a contractor the burden of disproving a negative. Without any prima facie proof of past misconduct, a contractor must establish its responsibility as a bidder by showing it does not discriminate on an impermissible basis in its subcontracting. As with any requirement that utilizes preferences, this completely inverts the normal procedures for making discrimination claims. (See, e.g., <em>Furnco, supra, </em>438 U.S. at pp. 577-578 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 2949-2950] [describing the burden-shifting procedure for complainants under Title VII]; cf. <em>Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. 469, 516 [109 S.Ct. 706, 733] (conc. opn. of Stevens, J.) [\u201c[I]t is only habit, rather than evidence or analysis, that makes it seem acceptable to assume that every white contractor covered by the ordinance shares, in that guilt [of past discrimination]\u201d]; <em>Sheet Metal Workers, supra, </em>478 U.S. at p. 494 [106 S.Ct. at p. 3059] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.) [\u201cit is completely unrealistic to assume that individuals of each race will gravitate with mathematical exactitude to each employer or union absent unlawful discrimination\u201d].) Furthermore, a contractor may show nondiscrimination only in the manner designated by the City, either according to a fixed participation goal or by prescribed outreach to MBE\u2019s and WBE\u2019s. In other words, it can only prove it does not discriminate against minorities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>women by discriminating or granting preferences in their favor. (See <em>Johnson, supra, </em>480 U.S. 616, 675-676 [107 S.Ct. 1442, 1474-1475] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.); <em>Bras, supra, </em>59 F.3d at p. 874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Contrary as well to the principles of the Civil Rights Act, listing a sufficient number of MBE/WBE subcontractors to meet the evidentiary presumption may potentially give cover to discrimination committed after a contractor has met the established goal. In <em>Furnco, supra, </em>438 U.S. at page 579 [98 S.Ct. at pages 2950-2951], the Supreme Court made clear, \u201cA racially balanced work force cannot immunize an employer from liability for specific acts of discrimination.\u201d \u201c[T]he obligation imposed by Title VII is to provide an equal opportunity for <em>each </em>applicant regardless of race, without regard to whether members of the applicant\u2019s race are already proportionately represented in the work force. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">To summarize, the City\u2019s own description of its Program\u2014requiring that a responsive bid contain either a sufficient number of MBE/WBE subcontractors or documentation of outreach\u2014demonstrates its invalidity under section 31. (See <em>Coalition I, supra, </em>946 F.Supp. at pp. 1495-1496.) Satisfying the participation option discriminates against non-MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s on the basis of race and sex in the operation of public contracting to the extent the prime contractor utilizes sufficient MBE/WBE subcontractors to meet the City\u2019s evidentiary presumption. Satisfying the outreach option grants preferential treatment because prime contractors must notify, solicit bids from, and negotiate with MBE\u2019s and WBE\u2019s, but may exclude non-MBE\u2019s/WBE\u2019s. If a contractor fails to satisfy either option, the City discriminates on the basis of race and sex by rejecting its bid out of hand even, as in this case, when that bid is the lowest otherwise responsive submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">This result is precisely what the voters were told Proposition 209 would prohibit. \u201cPrograms designed to ensure that all persons\u2014regardless of race or gender\u2014are informed of opportunities and treated with equal dignity and respect will continue as before.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 209, p. 33.) By implication, programs such as the City\u2019s that disseminate information on a selective basis would not continue. The Legislative Analyst also explained that \u201cthe measure would eliminate programs that give preference to women-owned or minority-owned companies on public contracts. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [B]idders on contracts no longer would need to show \u2018good faith efforts\u2019 to use minority-owned or women-owned subcontractors. Thus, state and local governments would save money to the extent they otherwise would have rejected a low bidder\u2014because the bidder did not make a \u2018good faith effort\u2019\u2014and awarded the contract to a higher bidder.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>Legis.

Our holding is necessarily limited to the form at issue here, which requires prime contractors to notify, solicit, and negotiate with MBE/WBE subcontractors as well as justify rejection of their bids. Plainly, the voters intended to preserve outreach efforts to disseminate information about public employment, education, and contracting not predicated on an impermissible classification.

The Attorney General has added nothing, omitted nothing and the words used are all subject to common understanding.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court then went on to note that \u201c \u2018 \u201caffirmative action\u201d \u2019 \u201d had no commonly agreed-upon definition and that \u201c[m]ost definitions of the term would include not only the conduct which Proposition 209 would ban, i.e., discrimination and preferential treatment, but also other efforts such as outreach programs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">From this single observation, which appears unnecessary to the holding (see <em>Lungren, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th 435, 443 (conc. opn. of Sims, J.)), the City extrapolates that the voters must have understood and intended that the outreach component of its program would not run afoul of Proposition 209. The simple answer is that the Court of Appeal in <em>Lungren </em>was not considering the constitutionality of the City\u2019s Program or the meaning of \u201cdiscriminate\u201d or \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d as those terms apply to the Program. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>court also did not refer to \u201ctargeted\u201d or \u201cfocused\u201d outreach or to programs formulated to take into account race and sex. Moreover, both the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis and the arguments against Proposition 209 indicated outreach would likely be eliminated by the initiative to the extent it operated on the basis of race or sex. (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 31; <em>id., </em>argument against Prop. 209, p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The City also relies on the fact the ballot argument in favor of Proposition 209 did not indicate the initiative would prohibit \u201ctargeted\u201d outreach. We do not read the ballot arguments as an exhaustive catalogue of the specific programs and measures that would fall under section 31. Rather, they spoke genetically, emphasizing that <em>any </em>action that discriminates or grants preferential treatment on the basis of race or sex would be forbidden. By the same token, they assured voters Proposition 209 \u201callows any program that does not discriminate, or prefer, because of race or sex, to continue.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 209, p. 32.) \u201cAffirmative action programs that don\u2019t discriminate or grant preferential treatment will be Unchanged.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 209, p. 33.) Impliedly, those programs that do discriminate would be illegal. Moreover, the opponents warned that the initiative \u201c \u201cputs at risk every outreach program ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>argument against Prop. 209, p. 33, quoting Gen. Colin Powell.) These indicia of voter intent leave no room for the City\u2019s outreach requirement, which is overtly predicated on race and sex preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The City and some amici curiae contend \u201cfocused\u201d outreach is not a \u201cpreference\u201d as that term is presently construed under Title VII and the equal protection clause. Considering the historical context of Proposition 209, this contention reflects a fundamental misperception of the electorate\u2019s intent to \u201crestate[] the historic Civil Rights Act . . . .\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 209, p. 32.) As we have explained, those who supported and enacted \u201cthe historic Civil Rights Act\u201d sought to ensure equal opportunity for all and eliminate race and sex from decisionmaking in employment and other areas. By 1996, however, judicial construction of both the Act and the equal protection clause had engrafted a series of qualifications permitting race- and sex-conscious programs formulated to remediate the lingering effects of past discrimination or conspicuous imbalance in the work force. If the electorate had determined merely to reiterate this status quo, an initiative amending the state Constitution would be unnecessary. Rather, we have concluded the \u201csomething more\u201d the voters intended <em>(Coalition I, supra, </em>946 F.Supp. at p. 1489) was essentially a repudiation of the decisional authority that permitted such discrimination and preferential treatment, notwithstanding antecedent statutory and constitutional law to the contrary. (See also <em>Coalition II, supra, </em>122 F.3d at p. 709, fn. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The City\u2019s assertion that its outreach requirement merely \u201cexpands the applicant pool\u201d is both misleading and irrelevant. To the extent it automatically eliminates bids that fail to document outreach or meet the evidentiary hiring presumption, it reduces the number of otherwise qualified bids it considers responsive. Even if it did accomplish its purported goal, a benign motivation cannot sanction a requirement that conflicts with the proscription against discrimination and preferential treatment on the basis of race and sex. Moreover, the Civil Rights Act was intended only to remove the barriers to equal opportunity <em>(Griggs, supra, </em>401 U.S. at pp. 430-431 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 853-854]), not maximize the number of applicants actually considered. <em>(Furnco, supra, </em>438 U.S. at pp. 577-578 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 2949-2950].) Cases cited by the City as examples of impermissible programs more overtly preferential are equally beside the point. At best, they illustrate what would suffice, not what is necessary, to violate section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In a related vein, the City and its amici curiae argue that equal protection does not preclude race-conscious programs. While true, this point has no bearing on our construction of section 31. Equal protection allows discrimination and preferential treatment whenever a court determines they are justified by a compelling state interest and are narrowly tailored to address an identified remedial need. (See, e.g., <em>United States v. Paradise, supra, </em>480 U.S. at pp. 185-186 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1073-1074] [approving racial quotas].) It does not, however, preclude a state from providing its citizens greater protection against both. (Cf. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Reno </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 630, 654 [113 S.Ct. 2816, 2830-2831, 125 L.Ed.2d 511] [with respect to equal protection, \u201ccourts must bear in mind the difference between what the law permits and what it requires\u201d].)  Unlike the equal protection clause, section 31 categorically prohibits discrimination and preferential treatment. Its literal language admits no \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d exception; we find nothing to suggest the voters intended to include one sub silentio.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The fact that as currently interpreted Title VII and title VI allow outreach of the type the City requires misses the mark for the same reason. Rather than incorporate the judicial gloss of <em>Weber </em>and its progeny, the voters intended to remove it. \u201cLet\u2019s . . . return[] to the fundamentals of our democracy: individual achievement, equal opportunity and <em>zero tolerance for discrimination against\u2014or for\u2014any individual.\u201d </em>(Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 209, p. 32.) As originally implemented, \u201cTitle VII tolerate[d] no racial discrimination, subtle or otherwise.\u201d <em>(McDonnell Douglas, supra, </em>411 U.S. at p. 801 [93 S.Ct. at p. 1824].) It was applied to \u201cremove barriers that have operated ... to favor an identifiable group . . . over other employees.\u201d <em>(Griggs, supra, </em>401 U.S. at pp. 429-430 [91 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>p. 853].) With the approval of Proposition 209, the electorate chose to reassert the principle of equality of individual opportunity as a constitutional imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Finally, the City and several amici curiae, including the United States, contend the Program is necessary to discharge the City\u2019s duty under federal law to eradicate the discrimination against subcontractors documented by its disparity study. (See, e.g., <em>Wygant, supra, </em>476 U.S. 267, 291 [106 S.Ct. 1842, 1856] (conc. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.); see also <em>Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at p. 509 [109 S.Ct. at p. 730].) At oral argument, however, the San Jose City Attorney conceded the Program is \u201cnot constitutionally required\u201d and \u201cnot federally mandated.\u201d Even without this concession, we are unpersuaded of the argument for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">First, the United States Supreme Court \u201cnever has held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification. Rather, the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classification in order to remedy such discrimination.\u201d <em>(Wygant, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 274 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1847].) Thus, the only constitutional obligation is the \u201c \u2018affirmative duty to desegregate\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 276 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1848], quoting <em>Swann v. Board of Education </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 1, 31-32 [91 S.Ct. 1267, 1283-1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 554]), also referred to as the duty to \u201cdisestablish\u201d the results of intentional discrimination. <em>(Board of Education v. Swann </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 43, 46 [91 S.Ct. 1284, 1286, 28 L.Ed.2d 586]; see also <em>Assoc. Gen. Contr. of Cal. v. City &amp; County of S. F. </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 813 F.2d 922, 929; <em>Associated Gen., etc. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Sch. </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 616 F.2d 1381, 1386.) Where the state or a political subdivision has intentionally discriminated, use of a race-conscious or race-specific remedy necessarily follows as the only, or at least the most likely, means of rectifying the resulting injury. <em>(Board of Education v. Swann, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 46 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1286]; see Van Alstyne, <em>supra, </em>46 U. Chi. L.Rev. at pp. 783-784.) The City\u2019s disparity study, at best, creates only an inference of discrimination against MBE/WBE subcontractors by prime contractors; it does not establish intentional acts by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Second, this argument ignores the distinction between actions the federal Constitution allows and those it demands. As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals observed in finding that Proposition 209 did not violate federal equal protection, \u201cTo hold that a democratically enacted affirmative action program is constitutionally permissible because the people have demonstrated a compelling state interest is hardly to hold that the program is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>constitutionally required. The Fourteenth Amendment, lest we lose sight of the forest for the trees, does not require what it barely permits.\u201d <em>(Coalition II, supra, </em>122 F.3d at p. 709; see <em>Shaw v. Reno, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 654 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2830-2831].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">There is also no duty under federal statutory law to take corrective action in the absence of discrimination. The Supreme Court in <em>Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. 193, and <em>Johnson, supra, </em>480 U.S. 616, only determined Title VII does not preclude an employer from utilizing race- and sex-conscious programs under certain circumstances. It did not find Title VII mandates such programs. In fact, Title VII expressly provides for the supremacy of state law \u201cother than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice under this sub-chapter.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-7.) Moreover, the federal courts have held Proposition 209 does not conflict with Titles VI, VII, or IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <em>(Coalition II, supra, </em>122 F.3d at pp. 709-719 [Title VII]; <em>Coalition I, supra, </em>946 F.Supp. at pp. 1517-1519 [Titles VI and IX].) \u201cThe mere fact that affirmative action is permissible under the Title VI and IX regulations, and some judicial interpretation, does not require preemption of a state law that prohibits affirmative action.\u201d <em>(Coalition I, supra, </em>946 F.Supp. at p. 1518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Third, if it were determined the City had violated federal constitutional or statutory law, the supremacy clause as well as the express terms of Proposition 209 would dictate federal law prevails: \u201cIf any part or parts of [section 31] are found to be in conflict with federal law or the United States Constitution, the section shall be implemented to the maximum extent that federal law and the United States Constitution permit.\u201d (\u00a7 31, subd. (h); see also <em>id., </em>subds. (d) [preserving preexisting court orders and consent decrees] &amp; (e) [preserving any action necessary to establish or maintain eligibility for federal funding].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Finally, we question the City\u2019s implicit premise that its Program meets the federal equal protection standard. As the Supreme Court explained in Wyg<em>ant, supra, 476 </em>U.S. 267, \u201cthe means chosen to accomplish the State\u2019s asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose. [Citation.] \u2018Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 280 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1850], fn. omitted.) The disparity study is not part of the record in this case. Without it, the court has no basis for measuring the fit between the Program and the goal of eliminating a disparity in the amount of contract dollars awarded MBE\u2019s in comparison to non-MBE\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Mosk, J., Baxter, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">An MBE is defined as a business with at least 51 percent ownership or control by one or more minority persons, as the City\u2019s municipal code defines \u201cminority.\u201d A WBE must be 51 percent owned by a woman or women, who also control and operate it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Also by local ordinance, a contractor may not \u201cdiscriminate or grant preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, age, religion, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or national origin, in the selecting of any subcontractor for work on a city or agency contract.\u201d (San Jose Mun.

Prime contractors submitting bids on city projects must certify they have not unlawfully discriminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The City apparently interprets these latter requirements as prohibiting a prime contractor from rejecting a subcontractor\u2019s proposal based upon race or sex. It is unclear, however, how it makes this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Section 31 proscribes discrimination and preferential treatment on the basis of sex as well as race. (See <em>post, </em>at p. 559, fn. 12.) Our preliminary discussion focuses on the development of legal and philosophical norms concerning governmental actions relating to race because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>history of racial discrimination is the genesis of all we discuss here. At the same time, we do not ignore or discount the reality that women were long denied equality, albeit often for different reasons than racial or ethnic minorities.

It defines the \u201cState\u201d to \u201cinclude, but not necessarily be limited to, the State itself, any city, county, city and county, public university system, including the University of California, community college district, school district, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the State.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>art.

(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">Stated negatively, section 31 prohibits governmental actors from improperly burdening or benefiting any individual or group in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. The prohibition is not limited to barring such actors from improperly assigning burdens or benefits themselves. Rather, it extends to barring them from enabling, facilitating, encouraging, or requiring private parties to do so as well. For the operation of each of the indicated activities involves private parties as well as governmental actors\u2014in other words, the <em>operation </em>of each entails the <em>cooperation </em>of both. One of section 31\u2019s purposes is to preclude any invidious barrier or privileged entrance to participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Stated positively, section 31 commands governmental actors to treat all individuals and groups equally in the operation of public employment, public education, and public contracting. The command is not limited to compelling governmental actors to afford equal treatment themselves. Rather, it extends to compelling governmental actors to enable, facilitate, encourage, and require private parties to do so as well. Again, the operation of each of the indicated activities involves private parties as well as governmental actors, the <em>operation </em>of each entailing the <em>cooperation </em>of both. One of section 31\u2019s purposes is to remove all invidious barriers and privileged entrances to participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Neither section 31\u2019s prohibition against the improper assigning of any burden or benefit in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting, nor its command of equal treatment therein, is limited solely to ends. Rather, both extend to means as well. Thus, one may not assign any burden or benefit improperly in an attempt to assign some other burden or benefit properly. Similarly, one may not afford treatment that in any respect is unequal in an attempt to afford treatment that in some other respect is equal. For section 31 at least, the end does not justify the means. Rather, means and end must each justify itself in light of section 31\u2019s prohibition and command.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">On October 21, 1997, through its city council, the City of San Jose adopted its \u201cNondiscrimination/Nonpreferential Treatment Program\u201d applicable to public contracts for construction projects in excess of $50,000. It did so in response to \u201cevidence that discriminatory practices existed in construction subcontracting\u201d for public works on the part of prime contractors and evidently the city itself with regard to subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups. It sought to remedy the effects of past discrimination and preferential treatment, and to prevent present or future discrimination or preferential treatment, in the operation of public subcontracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The city\u2019s program requires a prime contractor bidding on a covered public works contract, among other things, \u201cto demonstrate nondiscrimination/nonpreferential treatment. . . in the hiring of subcontractors\u201d before he can become eligible to be awarded the contract in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Specifically, the city\u2019s program requires the prime contractor to make a demonstration of nondiscrimination/nonpreferential treatment by providing, as he may choose, either \u201cdocumentation of outreach\u201d or \u201cdocumentation of participation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Under the documentation-of-outreach component, which is relatively more burdensome, the prime contractor <em>must </em>\u201cprovide[] written notice . . . of his . . . interest in bidding on the contract\u201d in question \u201cto not less than four\u201d subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups \u201cin each appropriate trade or area of work or supply ... at least 10 calendar days prior to the opening of bids\u201d; <em>must </em>\u201cfollow!] up\u201d such \u201cwritten notices by contacting\u201d each such firm \u201cto determine with certainty whether\u201d it is \u201cinterested in proposing to perform specific items of the project,\u201d \u201cdocumenting] the name of an individual employee of each . . . firm with whom\u201d he \u201cspoke concerning the project or the date and time of at least three . . . attempts during regular business hours to contact each . . . firm\u201d; and <em>must </em>\u201cnegotiate[] in good faith with\u201d each such firm and \u201cnot unjustifiably reject\u201d any ensuing bid \u201cas unsatisfactory.\u201d (Underscoring omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">By contrast, under the documentation-of-participation component, which is relatively less burdensome, the prime contractor <em>must </em>\u201cdocument[] the participation of\u2019 subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups meeting the \u201cpercentage of\u2019 such firms that the city has \u201cestablishe[d], as an evidentiary presumption,\u201d as the \u201cpercentage . . . that would be expected to be included . . . in the absence of discrimination\u201d or preferential treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">After review, it becomes evident that, in both its documentation-of-outreach and its documentation-of-participation components, the city\u2019s program violates section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">To be sure, the end that the city\u2019s program seeks is altogether legitimate and even necessary under section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The purpose of the city\u2019s program accords with, and is indeed compelled by, the purpose of section 31. As stated, the program\u2019s object is to remedy the effects of past discrimination and preferential treatment, and to prevent present or future discrimination or preferential treatment, in the operation of public subcontracting. As also stated, section 31\u2019s object is to remove and preclude any and all invidious barriers and privileged entrances to participation in the operation of activities including public contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Nevertheless, despite the legitimacy and even necessity of its end, the means that the city\u2019s program employs offend section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The documentation-of-outreach component of the city\u2019s program, with which a prime contractor who so chooses must comply in order to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>eligibility, requires the prime contractor to grant preferential treatment to subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups. As explained, it requires him to provide written notice of his interest in bidding on the contract in question to no fewer than four subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups in each pertinent trade or area of work or supply at least 10 calendar days prior to the opening of bids, to follow up such written notice with documentation of his efforts, and to negotiate in good faith and not unjustifiably reject as unsatisfactory any bid that may be forthcoming. It does not require him to take any of these steps otherwise. It thereby skews the process in favor of subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups. Not only does it invite those firms into the process, it also guarantees that they will be dealt with well during its course, and will not be ushered out without reason at its end. It does not do the same for others.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The documentation-of-participation component of the city\u2019s program, with which a prime contractor who so chooses must comply in order to establish eligibility, at least encourages the prime contractor to grant preferential treatment to subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups. As explained, it requires him to meet the \u201cevidentiary presumption\u201d that the city has established as the percentage of such firms that would be expected to be included in the absence of discrimination or preferential treatment. It at least encourages him to select such firms in such percentage when all other things are equal\u2014and even when they are not\u2014in order to avoid the need to comply with the more burdensome documentation-of-outreach component. It thereby skews the outcome in favor of subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups. Inclusion of those firms can help the prime contractor obtain award of the contract in question. Inclusion of others cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In sum, the means that the city\u2019s program employs through its documentation-of-outreach and documentation-of-participation components offend section 31 because they either require or at least encourage a prime contractor to grant preferential treatment to subcontracting firms that are owned by women or members of minority groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Although I agree with the court in the substance of its analysis, on a single point I would go farther than it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">In a strict sense, it is sufficient to read section 31 soundly and apply it to the city\u2019s program correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>But, as a practical matter, to do so is hardly enough. It gives scant guidance to the city itself or to other governmental actors. Some such guidance seems appropriate and even needed. Passivity is not demanded by section 31. Nor can it even be tolerated. Not only does section 31 prohibit governmental actors from improperly burdening or benefiting any individual or group in the operation of activities including public contracting, in order to preclude any invidious barrier or privileged entrance to participation. But it also commands such actors to treat all individuals and groups equally, in order to remove all such barriers and entrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">By way of guidance, we may perhaps use the city\u2019s program as a template for a measure that would satisfy section 31 in both its end and its means by retaining only its documentation-of-outreach component, and by modifying that component as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">A prime contractor would have to provide written notice of his interest in bidding on the contract in question to no fewer than, say, 10 subcontracting firms of his own choosing in each pertinent trade or area of work or supply at least 10 calendar days prior to the opening of bids, noting the identity of the owner or owners of each such firm\u2014all to be reflected on a form to be filed as a public record. He would have to follow up such written notice with documentation of his efforts\u2014again, all to be reflected on a form to be filed as a public record. And he would have to negotiate in good faith and not unjustifiably accept as satisfactory, or reject as unsatisfactory, any bid that may be forthcoming, stating his reasons for accepting or rejecting each\u2014yet again, all to be reflected on a form to be filed as a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Such a documentation-of-outreach component would be consistent with section 31\u2019s prohibition that governmental actors must not themselves improperly burden or benefit any individual or group in the operation of activities including public contracting, or enable, facilitate, encourage, or require private parties to do so. It would also be consistent with section 31\u2019s command that such actors must themselves treat all individuals and groups equally, and enable, facilitate, encourage, and require such parties to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">A documentation-of-outreach component like the above might prove to be an effective mechanism for prophylaxis. It would cause the prime contractor, one would hope, to rationalize his subcontracting conduct and thereby afford the commanded equal treatment and avoid the prohibited improper benefiting or burdening.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Furthermore, a documentation-of-outreach component like the above might prove to be an effective mechanism for monitoring. It would cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>prime contractor to make a public record of his subcontracting conduct and thereby provide evidence of compliance or noncompliance, as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">It is true that such a documentation-of-outreach component would require the prime contractor to note the identity of the owner or owners of each subcontracting firm to which he chooses to provide written notice. But it would hardly require him to improperly benefit any such firm or burden any other or to afford treatment that is at all unequal\u2014or even encourage, facilitate, or enable him to do so. For it would work solely as a prophylactic and monitoring device, furthering the component\u2019s prophylactic and monitoring function.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In conclusion, concurring as I do in the opinion of the court, I concur in its judgment affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b621-9\">KENNARD, J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A-lq\">I concur in the judgment without joining Justice Brown\u2019s majority opinion, Justice Mosk\u2019s concurring opinion, or the Chief Justice\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">At issue is whether a public contracting program of the City of San Jose violates article I, section 31 of the California Constitution, enacted by initiative in 1996, which declares that \u201c[t]he State shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d I agree with the majority that the ordinary plain meaning of \u201cpreferential\u201d is \u201c \u2018priority or advantage to one person . . . over others.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 560.) Both the majority and the Chief Justice review the ballot materials that explained the constitutional initiative measure to the voters (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 559-562; conc. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 582-587), and I agree with the majority that nothing in those materials suggests that those who enacted this constitutional provision intended the word \u201cpreferential\u201d to have other than its common and accepted meaning. Applying this common meaning of \u201cpreferential,\u201d I agree with the majority, the Chief Justice, and Justice Mosk that the challenged program of the City of San Jose grants preferential treatment on the basis of race and sex in the operation of public contracting. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 562; conc. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 572-573; conc. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 592, 596.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Because the issue presented is readily resolved by reference to the ordinary meaning of the constitutional text and a review of the ballot materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>submitted to the voters who enacted the constitutional provision, I see no need to discuss potentially divisive matters, such as the history of judicial construction of federal constitutional equal protection and statutory civil rights provisions as applied to racial distinctions (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 545-558), possible modifications of the City of San Jose\u2019s program to \u201csatisfy section 31 in both its end and its means\u201d (conc. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 573-575), or commonly offered justifications for race-conscious affirmative action programs (conc. &amp; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 576-579). But I join the majority, Justice Mosk, and the Chief Justice in affirming the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b622-5\">GEORGE, C. J., Concurring and Dissenting.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">I agree with all of my colleagues that the particular features of the affirmative action program that are challenged in this case violate article I, section 31, of the California Constitution\u2014the section added to the California Constitution in 1996 by the voters\u2019 passage of Proposition 209\u2014because these features grant \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d to individuals or groups on the basis of race or gender as proscribed by this newly added constitutional provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">I cannot join the majority opinion, however, because in my view the major portion of that opinion\u2019s discussion is not only unnecessary to the resolution of the issue before us, but is likely to be viewed as less than evenhanded. Particularly in a case involving an initiative measure that is as sensitive and potentially divisive as Proposition 209, I believe it is essential that this court speak through an opinion whose language and analysis clearly demonstrate to the parties and to the public that the court appreciates that its task is simply to interpret and apply the initiative\u2019s language so as to effectuate the electorate\u2019s intent. Viewing the majority opinion as a whole, I believe it falls short of this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">There can be no dispute that discrimination on the basis of race, gender, color, ethnicity, and national origin has played a pernicious role in the history of both our nation and our state. This historical discrimination has left our society with a woeful legacy that has proven difficult to overcome. Persons of goodwill hold widely differing, and very strongly felt, views regarding both the morality and the efficacy of utilizing race- or gender-conscious policies or programs as remedial tools to combat the lingering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>effects of past discrimination and to attempt to avoid the perpetuation of such discrimination in the present and into the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In resolving the issue presented in the case now before us, there is no reason for this court to revisit and reassess past judicial decisions, rendered prior to the passage of Proposition 209, that considered the general validity of utilizing race- or gender-conscious measures as part of an affirmative action program, or to engage in an extended inquiry into whether such measures are or are not consistent with our nation\u2019s and our state\u2019s constitutional tradition. Our role, rather, is simply to interpret and apply the language of the new state constitutional provision so as to effectuate the intent of the voters who adopted the measure. In my view, the majority opinion departs from that role in a number of respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">First, a substantial portion of the majority opinion is devoted to a lengthy discussion of past decisions of the United States Supreme Court and this court that involve either racially discriminatory practices that unquestionably had no remedial purpose or effect, or affirmative action programs that predate the passage of Proposition 209. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 554-558.) The majority opinion\u2019s lengthy discussion of these cases culminates in a general critique of a number of past decisions of the United States Supreme Court and of this court that have concluded that (in some circumstances) neither the federal nor the state equal protection clause, nor title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.) (hereafter Title VII) or its California counterpart, precludes Congress, a state, or private parties from voluntarily adopting an affirmative action program that, for remedial purposes, explicitly takes race or gender into account. (See, e.g., <em>University of California Regents v. Bakke </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 265 [98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750]; <em>Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Weber </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 193 [99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480]; <em>Johnson v. Transportation Agency </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 616 [107 S.Ct. 1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615]; <em>Price v. Civil Service Com. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 257 [161 Cal.Rptr. 475, 604 P.2d 1365].) The overall tenor of the majority opinion\u2019s discussion of these decisions\u2014including its repeated and favorable quotation from dissenting opinions in these cases and from academic commentators critical of these decisions\u2014leaves little doubt that the majority opinion embraces the view that the types of affirmative action programs at issue in these past decisions <em>always </em>have violated the provisions of the federal and state equal protection clauses and Title VII, and that the numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court and this court that reached a contrary conclusion were wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The issue before us in this case, however, is <em>not </em>the validity of past decisions interpreting or applying <em>other </em>constitutional or statutory provisions\u2014such as the federal or state equal protection clauses or Title VII\u2014but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>rather the proper interpretation and application of article I, section 31, the provision added to the California Constitution by Proposition 209 (hereafter article I, section 31). This newly added constitutional provision is by its terms limited specifically to <em>governmental </em>actions \u201cin the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting,\u201d and does not purport to affect constitutional or statutory doctrine outside this specified realm. In view of the limited issue before us, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to use this case as an occasion in which to attack the analysis and conclusions of pre-Proposition 209 decisions of either the United States Supreme Court or this court construing <em>other </em>constitutional or statutory provisions, and thereby to throw into doubt the continued applicability of those decisions outside the realm addressed by article I, section 31. The devotion of so much of the majority opinion\u2019s discussion to criticism of the currently prevailing interpretation of both Title VII and the equal protection clause, can serve only to undermine confidence in the opinion\u2019s analysis of the legal question actually presented by this case, i.e., the proper interpretation and application of article I, section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Second, by using misleading and unflattering slogans to characterize past judicial decisions upholding race-conscious and gender-conscious affirmative action programs\u2014describing such decisions as \u201creplac[ing] individual right of equal opportunity with <em>proportional group </em>representation\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 555, italics added) and as endorsing a change \u201cfrom protection of equal opportunity for all individuals to <em>entitlement based on group </em>representation\u201d <em>(ibid., </em>italics added)\u2014the majority opinion, in my view, will be widely and correctly viewed as presenting an unfair and inaccurate caricature of the objective or justification of the overwhelming majority of race- or gender-conscious affirmative action programs. Nowhere does the majority opinion consider alternative rationales for affirmative action programs\u2014grounds that cannot be as easily disparaged when not saddled by the catchphrases (\u201cproportional group representation,\u201d \u201centitlements based on group representation\u201d) employed by the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The terminology employed by the majority opinion ignores the circumstance that, in many instances, race or gender has been utilized as a \u201cplus\u201d factor in the affirmative action setting\u2014not because of any belief in group entitlement or proportional representation, but rather to obtain the benefits that are anticipated to flow from the inclusion of one or more persons from groups that are not currently represented in a given entity or organization. For example, at a time when no woman or member of a racial minority ever had served on the United States Supreme Court, if a President, in choosing among equally qualified candidates for a seat on the court, were to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>taken into consideration a candidate\u2019s race or gender as a factor in the decision whom to appoint, the use of race or gender could not accurately be characterized as based on group entitlement or proportional representation, but rather likely would rest on the belief that such a characteristic of the candidate would bring something worthwhile to the court as a whole, both in terms of the public\u2019s relative confidence in the institution and because members of such previously unrepresented groups might add something distinctive and valuable to the court\u2019s deliberations and decisionmaking. Similarly, when a college or university whose student body has been and continues to be almost all White voluntarily decides to institute an affirmative action policy under which qualified minority applicants are given special consideration, the justification for the policy may not be based upon any notion of \u201centitlement based on group representation\u201d or \u201cproportional group representation,\u201d but instead may well stem from a genuine belief on the part of the institution that an integrated student body will provide a better education for all students attending the school. And a comparable justification may underlie many of the affirmative action programs voluntarily instituted in recent years by those large corporations that have concluded that an integrated work force (including management) enables the organization to better serve its diverse clientele.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Another common justification for the adoption of an affirmative action program is that it may serve as a means of taking into account or remedying the continuing effects of past discrimination. For example, with regard to a job category (such as the construction trades) from which women traditionally have been excluded, an employer might conclude that when two applicants (one a man, one a woman) perform equally well on a qualifying test, the woman\u2019s performance actually might demonstrate that she has greater potential because she has managed to attain her current skill level despite the lack of general societal or cultural support for such an endeavor. Again, the use of gender-conscious affirmative action in this manner does not necessarily reflect a belief in group entitlement or proportional representation, but rather a more benign justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Of course, the circumstance that the objective or justification for a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action program is not group entitlement or proportional representation but some other, more defensible, purpose does not necessarily mean that the program is constitutional, either under pre-Proposition 209 or post-Proposition 209 principles. But the majority opinion\u2019s characterization of past judicial decisions upholding race- or gender-conscious affirmative action as based in general upon a view that emphasizes group entitlement or proportional representation is not an objective description, and the opinion\u2019s resort to these highly charged slogans undermines the credibility of its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Finally, in my view, the general theme that runs throughout the majority opinion\u2019s historical discussion\u2014that there is no meaningful distinction between discriminatory racial policies that were imposed for the clear purpose of establishing and preserving racial segregation, on the one hand, and race-conscious affirmative action programs whose aim is to break down or eliminate the continuing effects of such segregation and discrimination, on the other\u2014represents a serious distortion of history and does a grave disservice to the sincerely held views of a significant segment of our populace. As is demonstrated by the numerous and lengthy past judicial decisions that have considered race- and gender-conscious affirmative action programs, the legal questions posed by such programs have been widely understood as difficult and close, but the majority opinion\u2019s presentation does not do justice to the legal and historical arguments that have been articulated on both sides of the issue. In this respect, as well, I believe the majority opinion\u2019s approach cannot help but detract from the persuasiveness and credibility of its ultimate ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In the ballot pamphlet distributed to registered voters prior to the November 1996 election, the analysis prepared by the Legislative Analyst described as follows the effect of the adoption of Proposition 209: \u201cThis measure would eliminate state and local government affirmative action programs in the areas of public employment, public education, and public contracting to the extent these programs involve \u2018preferential treatment\u2019 based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. The specific programs affected by the measure, however, would depend on such factors as (1) <em>court rulings on what types of activities are considered \u2018preferential treatment\u2019 </em>and (2) whether federal law requires the continuation of certain programs.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996) Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 30, italics added (Ballot Pamphlet).) The issue presented by this case is whether <em>the particular affirmative action program </em>here at issue \u201cdiscriminates against\u201d or \u201cgrants preferential treatment to\u201d any individual or group on the basis of race or gender within the meaning of article I, section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">To resolve that question, it is unnecessary to venture back to the beginnings of our nation\u2019s history, as the majority opinion does. Instead, I believe it is appropriate to turn first to the language of article I, section 31, and its contemporary background (as reflected in the ballot pamphlet materials that were before the voters when they were considering the measure), and then to review the specifics of the city\u2019s challenged affirmative action program to determine whether the program violates this state constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Article I, section 31, subdivision (a)\u2014the principal substantive provision of the initiative measure\u2014provides in full: \u201cThe State shall not discriminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d Subdivision (f) of section 31 provides in turn: \u201cFor purposes of this section, \u2018State\u2019 shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the State itself, any city, county, city and county, public university system, including the University of California, community college district, school district, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the State.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The city acknowledges that the provisions of article I, section 31, are applicable to the recently adopted public contracting affirmative action program that is challenged in this case. The city maintains, however, that the challenged aspects of its affirmative action program do not \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d or \u201cgrant preferential treatment to\u201d any individual or group on the basis of the enumerated characteristics, as these quoted terms are used in article I, section 31. That constitutional measure contains no express definition of the terms \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d or \u201cgrant preferential treatment to\u201d as used in the section, and, in deciding how that language properly should be interpreted, it is appropriate to consider the material relating to Proposition 209 contained in the ballot pamphlet that was distributed to all voters prior to the election to determine whether that material provides any guidance as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>to how the voters are likely to have understood the meaning and effect of these terms. (See Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>pp. 30-33.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">I begin with the item in the ballot pamphlet materials that voters are most likely to have viewed as objective and impartial and to have consulted as a reliable indicator of the proposition\u2019s meaning and effect\u2014the in-depth analysis of Proposition 209 prepared by the Legislative Analyst. (See Elec. Code, \u00a7 9087.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Past cases establish that a court properly may look to the analysis of the Legislative Analyst in determining the voters\u2019 intent. (See, e.g., <em>Legislature v. Eu </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 492 [286 Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309]; <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 245-246 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281].)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The initial section of the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis of Proposition 209, entitled \u201cBackground,\u201d reads in full: \u201cThe federal, state, and local governments run many programs intended to increase opportunities for various groups-\u2014including women and racial and ethnic minority groups. These programs are commonly called \u2018affirmative action\u2019 programs. For example, state law identifies specific goals for the participation of women-owned and minority-owned companies on work involved with state contracts. State departments are expected, but not required, to meet these goals, which include that at least 15 percent of the value of contract work should be done by minority-owned companies and at least 5 percent should be done by women-owned companies. The law requires departments, however, to reject bids from companies that have not made sufficient \u2018good faith efforts\u2019 to meet these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\u201cOther examples of affirmative action programs include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201c\u2022 Public college and university programs such as scholarship, tutoring, and outreach that are targeted toward minority or women students.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201c\u2022 Goals and timetables to encourage the hiring of members of \u2018underrepresented\u2019 groups for state government jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u201c\u2022 State and local programs required by the federal government as a condition of receiving federal funds (such as requirements for minority-owned business participation in state highway construction projects funded in part with federal money).\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 30.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">After setting forth this background, the analysis goes on to describe the proposal embodied in Proposition 209: \u201cThis measure would eliminate state and local government affirmative action programs in the areas of public employment, public education, and public contracting to the extent these programs involve \u2018preferential treatment\u2019 based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. <em>The specific programs affected by the measure, </em>however, <em>would depend on such factors as (1) court rulings on what types of activities are considered \u2018preferential treatment\u2019 </em>and (2) whether federal law requires the continuation of certain programs.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 30, italics added.) Although this passage makes it clear that were the proposition to be adopted, a court applying the measure would be required to determine whether or not a specific affirmative action program or policy granted \u201cpreferential treatment,\u201d this initial passage does not identify any criteria, or provide any examples, to aid in determining that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Subsequent passages of the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis, however, provide more guidance on this point. In discussing the potential fiscal effect of the passage of Proposition 209, the analysis contains separate sections discussing the measure\u2019s effect upon state and local programs in the areas of (1) public employment and contracting, (2) public schools and community colleges, and (3) the University of California and the California State University. Each section identifies some types of affirmative action programs that, according to the analysis, likely would be affected by the passage of the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">With regard to public employment and contracting, the analysis states: \u201cThe measure would eliminate affirmative action programs used to increase hiring and promotion opportunities for state or local government jobs, where sex, race, or ethnicity are preferential factors in hiring, promotion, training, or recruitment decisions. In addition, the measure would eliminate programs that give preference to women-owned or minority-owned companies on public contracts. Contracts affected by the measure would include contracts for construction projects, purchases of computer equipment, and the hiring of consultants. . . . [\u00b6] The elimination of these programs would result in savings to the state and local governments. These savings would occur for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>two reasons. First, government agencies no longer would incur costs to administer the programs. Second, the prices paid on some government contracts would decrease. This would happen because bidders on contracts no longer would need to show \u2018good faith efforts\u2019 to use minority-owned or women-owned subcontractors. Thus, state and local governments would save money to the extent they otherwise would have rejected a low bidder\u2014because the bidder did not make a \u2018good faith effort\u2019\u2014and awarded the contract to a higher bidder.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">With regard to public schools and community colleges, the analysis states that \u201cthe measure could eliminate, or cause fundamental changes to, voluntary desegregation programs run by school districts\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 31, italics omitted), observing that \u201c[e]xamples of desegregation spending that could be affected by the measure include the special funding given to (1) \u2018magnet\u2019 schools (in those cases where race or ethnicity are preferential factors in the admission of students to the schools) and (2) designated \u2018racially isolated minority schools\u2019 that are located in areas with high proportions of racial or ethnic minorities. . . . [\u00b6] In addition, the measure would affect a variety of public school and community college programs such as counseling, tutoring, outreach, student financial aid, and financial aid to selected school districts in those cases where programs provide preferences to individuals or schools based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national origin. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Finally, with regard to the University of California and the California State University, the analysis states: \u201cThe measure would affect admissions and other programs at the state\u2019s public universities. For example, the California State University (CSU) uses race and ethnicity as factors in some of its admissions decisions. If this initiative is passed by the voters, it could no longer do so. . . . [\u00b6] Both university systems also run a variety of assistance programs for students, faculty, and staff that are targeted to individuals based on sex, race, or ethnicity. These include programs such as outreach, counseling, tutoring, and financial aid. The two systems spend over $50 million each year on programs that probably would be affected by passage of this measure.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">One additional passage of the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis also sheds light upon the voters\u2019 likely understanding and intent with regard to the types of affirmative action programs that would be affected by the measure. After observing that its calculations suggest that the measure could affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>state and local programs that currently cost well in excess of $125 million annually, the analysis cautions that the actual amount of this spending that might be saved as a result of the passage of the measure could be considerably less than that amount for a variety of reasons, including the circumstance that \u201csome programs we have identified as being affected might be changed to use factors other than those prohibited by the measure. For example, a high school outreach program operated by the UC [University of California] or the CSU [California State University] that currently uses a factor such as ethnicity to target spending could be changed to target instead high schools with low percentages of UC or CSU applications.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In addition to the analysis of Proposition 209 prepared by the Legislative Analyst, the ballot pamphlet contained arguments in favor of and against Proposition 209 as well as accompanying rebuttal arguments submitted by the proponents and the opponents of the proposition. As a general matter, of course, ballot pamphlet arguments are intended as advocacy pieces, and voters undoubtedly are aware that such arguments may tend to overstate or exaggerate the benefits or detriments of a proposition and often are written in broad rhetorical terms that do not necessarily reflect the specific language or effect of the measure itself. As a consequence, a court must be cautious in considering such arguments and in attempting to gauge what weight the arguments properly should bear in the court\u2019s interpretation of a proposition\u2019s language. Nonetheless, because the pro and con arguments are part of the materials that were presented to the voters in the ballot pamphlet, it is appropriate to take note of the arguments to the extent they speak to the question before us. (See, e.g., <em>Legislature </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 492, 505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The argument in favor of Proposition 209 begins: \u201cA generation ago we did it right. We passed civil rights laws to prohibit discrimination. But special interests hijacked the civil rights movement. Instead of equality, governments imposed quotas, preferences, and set-asides. [\u00b6] Proposition 209 is called the California Civil Rights Initiative because it restates the historic Civil Rights Act and proclaims simply and clearly: \u2018The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group, on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u2019 \u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 209, p. 32.) The argument in favor of Proposition 209 goes on to state: \u201cToday, students are being rejected from public universities because of their Race. Job applicants are turned away because their Race does not meet some \u2018goal\u2019 or \u2018timetable.\u2019 Contracts are awarded to high bidders because they are of the preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Race, [\u00b6] That\u2019s just plain wrong and unjust. Government should not discriminate. It must not give a job, a university admission, or a contract based on race or sex. Government must judge all people equally, without discrimination.\u201d The argument further states: \u201cDiscrimination is costly in other ways. Government agencies throughout California spend millions of your tax dollars for costly bureaucracies to administer racial and gender discrimination that masquerade as \u2018affirmative action.\u2019 They waste much more of your money awarding high-bid contracts and sweetheart deals based not on the low bid, but on unfair set-asides and preferences.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, the argument states: \u201cReal \u2018affirmative action\u2019 originally meant no discrimination and sought to provide opportunity. That\u2019s why Proposition 209 prohibits discrimination and preferences and allows any program that does not discriminate, or prefer, because of race or sex, to continue, [ft The only honest and effective way to address inequality of opportunity is by making sure that <em>all </em>California children are provided with the tools to compete in our society. And then let them succeed on a fair, color-blind, race-blind, gender-blind basis.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As these excerpts indicate, although the argument in favor of Proposition 209 identified some types of affirmative action programs at which the measure was directed, the argument did not purport to define with any degree of specificity the factors that should be considered in determining whether a program \u201cdiscriminates against\u201d or \u201cgrants preferential treatment to\u201d an individual or group on the basis of the prohibited characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In urging voters to vote against the proposition, the argument against Proposition 209 states: \u201cCalifornia law currently allows tutoring, mentoring, outreach, recruitment, and counseling to help ensure equal opportunity for women and minorities. Proposition 209 will eliminate affirmative action programs like these that help achieve equal opportunity for women and minorities in public employment, education, and contracting.\u201d The argument asserts that \u201c[t]he initiative\u2019s language is so broad and misleading that it eliminates equal opportunity programs including: [\u00b6] [1] tutoring and mentoring for minority and women students; [\u00b6] [2] affirmative action that encourages the hiring and promotion of qualified women and minorities; [\u00b6] [3] outreach and recruitment programs to encourage applicants for government jobs and contracts; and [\u00b6] [4] programs designed to encourage girls to study and pursue careers in math and science.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>argument against Prop. 209, p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In the rebuttal to the argument against Proposition 209, the proponents of the measure took issue with the opponents\u2019 characterization of the scope of the initiative, stating: \u201cDon\u2019t let them change the subject. Proposition 209 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>bans discrimination and preferential treatment\u2014period. Affirmative action programs that don\u2019t discriminate or grant preferential treatment will be Unchanged. Programs designed to ensure that all persons\u2014regardless of race or gender\u2014are informed of opportunities and treated with equal dignity and respect will continue as before. [\u00b6] Note that Proposition 209 doesn\u2019t prohibit consideration of economic disadvantage. Under the existing racial-preference system, a wealthy doctor\u2019s son may receive a preference for college admission over a dishwasher\u2019s daughter simply because he\u2019s from an \u2018underrepresented\u2019 race. That\u2019s Unjust. The state must remain free to help the economically disadvantaged, but not on the basis of race or sex.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 209, p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">This overview of the ballot pamphlet materials relating to Proposition 209 makes several points clear. First, the measure\u2019s principal purpose clearly was to limit the types of affirmative action programs that governmental entities could employ in three areas\u2014public employment, public education, and public contracting. Second, the measure was not intended to preclude all governmental affirmative action programs within these areas, but rather was intended to prohibit only those affirmative action programs that discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race or gender. Third, although neither article I, section 31, nor the accompanying ballot materials, expressly define the terms \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d or \u201cgrant preferential treatment to,\u201d the ballot materials identify a variety of affirmative action programs, then currently employed by governmental entities, that it was anticipated probably would be prohibited were the initiative measure to be adopted. These examples afford helpful guidance in determining how the language of article I, section 31, should be interpreted in order to effectuate the voters\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">As already noted, the city\u2019s basic contention is that the affirmative action measures at issue in this case do not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group within the meaning of article I, section 31. To resolve that question, it is necessary to examine the specifics of the program at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">In the wake of the passage of Proposition 209, the City of San Jose revised its prior public contracting affirmative action program by adopting a new program incorporating a number of elements. Only a portion of the city\u2019s program is challenged in this case, but it is useful to review the overall program in order to place the challenged provisions in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>As part of its revised public contracting affirmative action program, the city itself assumed a greater and more active role in conducting a variety of general outreach activities in order to make information about bidding opportunities on public contracts more available and accessible to all contractors and subcontractors in the community. The city\u2019s current general outreach efforts include the following actions: (1) The city places the legal \u201cNotice to Contract\u201d in two local newspapers of general circulation, the San Jose Mercury News and the San Jose Post Record. (2) The city also places notices of the solicitation of bids for each project in <em>all </em>local builders\u2019 exchanges, trade papers, and contractor and subcontractor organization papers. (3) In addition, the city places information in local builders\u2019 exchanges and other locations, indicating which general contractors are intending to bid a particular project and are soliciting bids from subcontractors. (4) The city posts on the Internet additional information on the projects that are out to bid and on the general contractors that are soliciting subcontract bids. (5) Finally, the city operates a \u201cBid Hotline\u201d to provide information on projects out to bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In addition to these general outreach measures that are conducted by the city itself to increase knowledge of and access to the public contracting process, the city determined that\u2014in light of a earlier study of the local public contracting process that documented a historical pattern of discrimination by prime contractors against minority-owned and women-owned subcontractors (referred to as MBE and WBE subcontractors) with regard to public contracts awarded by the city\u2014it was appropriate to adopt a \u201cNondiscrimination/Nonpreferential Treatment Program.\u201d This program imposes a number of requirements on prime contractors that wish to submit bids on public works construction contracts having a cost estimate in excess of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">First, the program requires each prime subcontractor to submit, along with its bid, a signed statement attesting that \u201c[i]n listing subcontractors in this bid, I have not discriminated against or given any preference to any firm based on race, sex, color, age, religion, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or national origin\u201d and acknowledging that any such discrimination or preference would violate a city ordinance. Second, to more particularly address the historical discrimination against MBE/WBE subcontractors, the program requires all prime contractors to satisfy a separate requirement by providing either \u201cDocumentation of Outreach\u201d or \u201cDocumentation of Participation.\u201d It is the legal validity of these two components\u2014the Documentation of Outreach component and the Documentation of Participation component\u2014to which the challenge in this case is directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In order to satisfy the Documentation of Outreach option, a prime contractor must send written notice to not less than four MBE/WBE subcontractors in each appropriate trade area identified for the project, informing the notified subcontractors of the prime contractor\u2019s interest in bidding on the contract. This notice must be sent to the MBE/WBE subcontractors at least 10 days prior to the opening of bids. In addition, the prime contractor must follow up the written notice by contacting, or by making at least three attempts to contact, each of the MBE/WBE subcontractors to determine whether the subcontractor is interested in participating in the project. Finally, if any MBE/WBE subcontractor expresses interest in participating, the prime contractor must negotiate in good faith with the subcontractor and may not unjustifiably reject any bid prepared by an MBE/WBE subcontractor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the program, a prime contractor need submit with its bid only copies of the required written notices that it has provided to the requisite number of MBE/WBE subcontractors. Although the program also requires the prime contractor to document its compliance with the remaining requirements of this option (i.e., the follow-up contacts with MBE/WBE subcontractors, and the contractor\u2019s reason for rejecting a proposal made by the MBE/WBE subcontractors it has contacted), that additional documentation need not be submitted with the prime contractor\u2019s bid and need only be produced by the prime contractor in the event of a subsequent investigation by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">As an alternative to fulfilling the demands of the Documentation of Outreach option, a prime contractor instead may satisfy the requirements of the Documentation of Participation component. Under this option, for each public works construction contract that falls within the reach of the Nondiscrimination/ Nonpreferential Treatment Program, the city\u2019s Office of Equality Assurance \u201cestablishes, as an evidentiary presumption,\u201d the percentage of MBE/WBE firms \u201cthat would be expected to be included in the Base Bid . . . in the absence of discrimination.\u201d A prime contractor satisfies the Documentation of Participation option by listing in its bid a sufficient number of MBE/WBE subcontractors to satisfy this \u201cevidentiary presumption.\u201d If a prime contractor decides to use a sufficient number of MBE/WBE subcontractors in its bid to meet the figure established by the city, the prime contractor is not required either to undertake or to document any steps with regard to outreach.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>As already noted, the legal challenge in this case is directed only to the Documentation of Outreach or Documentation of Participation elements of the city\u2019s program. The city maintains that neither of these elements \u201cdiscriminates against\u201d or \u201cgrants preferential treatment to\u201d any subcontractor within the meaning of article I, section 31. I address each component separately, beginning with the Documentation of Participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">With regard to the Documentation of Participation component, plaintiff contends that this feature of the city\u2019s program operates in a fashion similar to a set-aside or quota and clearly is invalid under article I, section 31. The city, by contrast, defends the participation option as an appropriate means of establishing a presumption of nondiscrimination that warrants relieving a contractor of the obligations imposed by the outreach component. In support of its position, the city maintains that the participation component, by utilizing an evidentiary presumption, is analogous to affirmative action programs that have been found to be permissible under Title VII. (See, e.g., <em>Associated Pennsylvania Constructors v. Jannetta </em>(M.D.Pa. 1990) 738 F.Supp. 891, 892-893.) As I shall explain, I agree with plaintiff\u2019s claim that the Documentation of Participation component grants \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d within the meaning of article I, section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">To begin with, the city\u2019s reliance upon the similarity of the participation component to programs that have been found permissible under Title VII clearly is without merit. Although the city points to a few passages in the ballot arguments in favor of Proposition 209 that it suggests support the position that article I, section 31, should be interpreted consistently with Title VII,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in reality, as explained below, the language of article I, section 31, differs significantly from that of Title VII. Indeed, the entire background of article I, section 31\u2014as reflected in the ballot pamphlet materials\u2014demonstrates that the principal purpose of Proposition 209 was to prohibit governmental entities in California, in the areas of public employment, public education, and public contracting, from utilizing many of the kinds of affirmative action programs that had been held permissible under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">By their explicit terms, the principal statutory provisions of Title VII prohibit employers and labor unions only from \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>persons on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin; these provisions do not refer specifically to granting preferential treatment to persons on the basis of race or gender. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000c-2(a), 2000c-2(d).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Weber, supra, </em>443 U.S. 193 <em>(Weber), </em>the United States Supreme Court relied in part on the absence in Title VII of an explicit statutory prohibition on granting preferential treatment on the basis of race in concluding that Title VII should not be interpreted to bar private employers from voluntarily implementing affirmative action programs that rely upon race-conscious preferences to attempt to overcome a substantial disparity in employment positions from which minorities and women historically have been excluded. As noted by the court in <em>Weber, </em>although the principal provisions of Title VII refer only to discrimination and not to preferential treatment, a separate provision of Title VII specifically addresses the question of preferential treatment, and provides simply that \u201c[n]othing contained in this subchapter shall be interpreted <em>to require </em>any employer <em>... to grant preferential treatment </em>to any individual or to any group because of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin employed by any employer . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000c-2(j), italics added.) Observing that \u201c[h]ad Congress meant to prohibit all race-conscious affirmative action, as respondent urges, it easily could have . . . provided] that Title VII would not require or <em>permit </em>racially preferential integration efforts\u201d (443 U.S. at p. 205 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2728], italics in original), and noting that this latter provision \u201cdoes <em>not </em>state that \u2018nothing in Title VII shall be interpreted to <em>permit\u2019 </em>voluntary affirmative efforts to correct racial imbalances\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 206 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2728], italics in original), the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Weber </em>concluded that \u201c[t]he natural inference is that Congress chose not to forbid all voluntary race-conscious affirmative action.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, the high court ultimately held in <em>Weber </em>\u201cthat Title VII\u2019s prohibition . . . against racial discrimination does not condemn all private, voluntary, race-conscious affirmative action plans.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 208 [99 S.Ct. at p. 2729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The proponents and drafters of Proposition 209 unquestionably intended to incorporate into the California Constitution a rule different from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>which the United States Supreme Court in <em>Weber </em>concluded is embodied in Title VII. Unlike Title VII, article I, section 31, expressly prohibits governmental entities from <em>either </em>\u201cdiscriminat[ing] against\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cgrant[ing] preferential treatment to\u201d any person or group on the basis of race or gender. Thus, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s argument, the circumstance that a particular type of affirmative action program has been found permissible under Title VII does not provide a sound basis for concluding that the program also is permissible under article I, section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Looking to the specifics of the particular Documentation of Participation component at issue, it appears clear that in practice this option will operate to create a strong incentive for prime contractors, in selecting among subcontractors, to grant preferential treatment to at least some MBE and/or WBE subcontractors in order to meet the percentage figure specified by the city. A prime contractor will be encouraged to follow such a course both in order to avoid the necessity of complying with the somewhat burdensome procedural requirements of the outreach component and also in order to avoid the potentially significant adverse sanctions (such as the loss of the right to bid on city projects for a specified period of time) that might be imposed under the outreach option if a contractor is found to have unjustifiably rejected the proposal of an MBE/WBE subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Although the city maintains that, by requiring the contractor to certify that it has neither discriminated against nor granted preference to any firm on the basis of race or gender, its program guards against the risk that a prime contractor might grant preferential treatment to an MBE/WBE subcontractor, in view of the practical difficulty of policing such self-serving representations it is unrealistic to suggest that that the certification process affords an adequate safeguard. When the participation component is viewed from a practical and commonsense perspective, I believe it is clear that the Documentation of Participation component is likely to operate in a manner analogous to a prescribed set-aside or goal\u2014one of the basic types of affirmative action measures at which article I, section 31, was directed. Accordingly, I conclude that the Documentation of Participation component violates article I, section 31, because it effectively operates to grant \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d to subcontractors on the basis of race or gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In defending the validity of the alternative Documentation of Outreach component, the city maintains that the term \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d in article I, section 31, should be interpreted to preclude only preferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>treatment in the actual selection process itself, as occurs, for example, in programs that designate race or gender a \u201cplus\u201d factor in evaluating candidates or in programs that establish goals or set-asides specifying the percentage or number of applicants or candidates expected to be hired for a job, awarded a government contract, or admitted to a school. The city asserts that the term \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d should not be interpreted to apply to outreach programs (including \u201ctargeted\u201d outreach programs) that simply expand the pool of candidates or applicants who are provided access to opportunities in public employment, public contracts or a public school but that do not afford preferential treatment on the basis of race or gender in the actual selection process itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In support of its position, the city heavily relies upon <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 435, 442 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 690] <em>(Lungren). </em>The <em>Lungren </em>decision, which was handed down three months prior to the vote on Proposition 209, involved a preelection challenge to the wording of the Attorney General\u2019s title and summary of Proposition 209 that was to appear on the election ballot. In <em>Lungren, </em>the challengers contended that the Attorney General\u2019s summary was potentially misleading because it simply tracked the language of Proposition 209 and did not specifically state that the measure would prohibit affirmative action programs conducted by state and local government. The trial court agreed with the challengers that the summary was misleading in failing to \u201c \u2018reflect that the chief purpose of the measure is to prohibit affirmative action programs by public entities that are inconsistent with the prohibition in the measure\u2019 \u201d (48 Cal.App.4th at p. 437) and ordered a change in the ballot title and summary. The Court of Appeal, however, acting in an expedited writ proceeding, overturned the trial court\u2019s determination, concluding that the failure to include the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d in the Attorney General\u2019s title and summary of Proposition 209 did not render the title or summary improper or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In reaching its conclusion in <em>Lungren, </em>the Court of Appeal observed that the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d is ambiguous and that \u201c[m]ost definitions of the term would include not only the conduct which Proposition 209 would ban, i.e., discrimination and preferential treatment, but also other efforts <em>such as outreach programs. </em>[Citations.] Accordingly, any statement to the effect that Proposition 209 repeals affirmative action programs would be overinclusive and hence \u2018false and misleading.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lungren, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 442, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The city, seizing upon the italicized language in the above quoted passage, asserts that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>Lungren </em>constitutes a definitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>judicial ruling that <em>no </em>outreach program falls within the reach of article I, section 31. The city argues that when the voters thereafter approved Proposition 209, they must be presumed, under established legal principles, to have done so in light of the interpretation of the measure adopted in <em>Lungren. </em>Accordingly, the city argues that article I, section 31, should be interpreted as inapplicable to <em>any </em>outreach program.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In my view, the city\u2019s argument plainly rests on an inaccurate and overbroad reading of the language used by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lungren. </em>In stating that most definitions of affirmative action would include not only programs that discriminate against or grant preferential treatment, but also outreach programs, <em>Lungren </em>did not suggest that <em>no </em>outreach program properly could be found to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment within the meaning of article I, section 31. Reasonably interpreted, the quoted passage in <em>Lungren </em>simply explains that because there are some affirmative action programs, including some outreach programs, that do not involve discrimination or preferential treatment on the basis of race or gender, a title and summary of Proposition 209 that indicated the initiative generally would repeal affirmative action programs would itself be over-broad and misleading. The quoted passage in <em>Lungren </em>does not refer to, much less purport to decide, whether a \u201ctargeted outreach\u201d program, i.e., an outreach program directed solely to individuals or groups on the basis of race or gender, would constitute discrimination or preferential treatment within the meaning of the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The city maintains, however, that it is disingenuous to suggest that a program that does not involve race-conscious or gender-conscious components would be viewed or understood to be an \u201caffirmative action\u201d program. I strongly disagree. The term \u201caffirmative action\u201d has been employed in a general way to describe a great variety of proactive programs instituted by an entity in an attempt to remedy segregated programs or to overcome a legacy of discrimination or exclusion. (See, e.g., Holzer &amp; Neumark, <em>Assessing Affirmative Action </em>(Sept. 2000) 38 J. Econ. Literature 483, 484.) Such proactive efforts need not necessarily involve race-conscious or gender-conscious measures, but rather can include efforts relating to broad, general outreach to the entire community, including portions of the community that have not been solicited or granted access in the past. The outreach program that was before this court in <em>Domar Electric, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 161 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 885 P.2d 934], requiring contractors bidding on public contracts to undertake \u201creasonable good faith outreach to all types of subcontractor enterprises\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 174), provides a good example of a general, nontargeted outreach program that ordinarily would be considered an affirmative action program.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Accordingly, I conclude that the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion in <em>Lungren, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th 435, does not support the city\u2019s claim that the Documentation of Outreach component of its program cannot properly be considered as granting preferential treatment under article I, section 31, simply because its provisions do not require a contractor to grant preferential treatment to MBE/WBE\u2019s in the selection process but instead impose only an obligation of targeted outreach.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Indeed, contrary to the city\u2019s suggestion that the electors who voted in favor of Proposition 209 should be presumed to have understood that the passage of the measure would <em>not </em>affect the validity of targeted outreach efforts in the areas\u2014public employment, public education, and public contracting\u2014covered by the measure, the materials relating to Proposition 209 contained in the ballot pamphlet provided a rather clear indication that outreach efforts that are targeted toward individuals or groups on the basis of race or gender were likely to fall within the reach of the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">As noted above, in discussing the probable fiscal effect of the passage of Proposition 209, the analysis prepared by the Legislative Analyst discussed a number of then existing affirmative action programs that likely would be affected by the measure. Regarding the effect on public schools and community colleges, the analysis stated in part: \u201c[T]he measure would affect a variety of public school and community college programs such as counseling, tutoring, <em>outreach, </em>student financial aid, and financial aid to selected school districts in those cases <em>where the programs provide preferences to individuals or schools based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national origin. </em>Funds spent on these programs total at least $15 million each year.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 31, italics added.) Similarly, in discussing the effect of the measure on the University of California and the California State University, the analysis stated: \u201cBoth university systems also run a variety of assistance programs for students, faculty, and staff <em>that are targeted to individuals based on sex, race, or ethnicity. </em>These include programs such as <em>outreach, </em>counseling, tutoring, and financial aid. The two systems spend over $50 million each year on programs that probably would be affected by passage of this measure.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Finally, in cautioning that its estimate of the total savings that would result from passage of the initiative could be considerably less for a variety of reasons, the analysis pointed to the following as one such circumstance: \u201c[S]ome programs we have identified as being affected might be changed to use factors other than those prohibited by the measure. For example, a high school <em>outreach program </em>operated by the UC or the CSU <em>that currently uses a factor such as ethnicity to target spending </em>could be changed to target <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>instead high schools with low percentages of UC or CSU applications.\u201d (Ibid., italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In light of the analysis of Proposition 209 contained in the ballot pamphlet, it is clear that the voters reasonably would have believed that an outreach program targeted to specific individuals or groups on the basis of their race or gender would be considered a program that grants preferential treatment within the meaning of article I, section 31. Interpreting the language of article I, section 31, to effectuate the voters\u2019 intent, we must conclude that an outreach program directed to an audience on the basis of its members\u2019 race or gender constitutes a program that grants preferential treatment for purposes of article I, section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In view of this conclusion, it is clear that the Documentation of Outreach component that is challenged in this case violates the newly enacted constitutional provision. As noted, the outreach component in question places an obligation on prime contractors to solicit bids from, and make follow-up contacts to, a specified number of MBE or WBE subcontractors, but the provision places no similar obligation on prime contractors to undertake outreach efforts to non-MBE or non-WBE subcontractors. This aspect of the outreach component in itself grants preferential treatment to subcontractors on the basis of race and gender. Moreover, the city\u2019s outreach component contains an additional feature that requires a prime contractor to negotiate in good faith with\u2014and to justify any rejection of an offer made by\u2014any one of the MBE/WBE subcontractors that expresses an interest in participating in the project, while the provision places no similar requirements upon a prime contractor with regard to proposals made by a non-MBE or non-WBE subcontractor. These additional features of the outreach component similarly grant preferential treatment to subcontractors on the basis of race or gender, and indeed, as a practical matter, may well create a significant incentive for a prime contractor to grant preferential treatment to an MBE/WBE subcontractor that expresses interest in participating in the project, in order to avoid a claim that the contractor\u2019s negotiation or justification for rejection was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Accordingly, I conclude that the Documentation of Outreach component of the city\u2019s program is invalid under article I, section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Although this court has concluded that the two components of the city\u2019s public contracting program that are challenged in this case violate article I, section 31, this determination should not obscure the important point that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>this constitutional provision does not prohibit <em>all </em>affirmative action programs or preclude governmental entities in this state from initiating a great variety of proactive steps in an effort to address the continuing effects of past discrimination or exclusion, and to extend opportunities in public employment, public education, and public contracting to all members of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Indeed, the numerous additional features of the public contracting outreach program that the city recently has put in place, and that have not been challenged in this proceeding, provide ready examples of just a few of the many forms of affirmative action that clearly are consistent with the provisions of article I, section 31. Expanding advertising of public contract bidding opportunities in newspapers of general circulation and special trade journals, establishing public contract hotlines, and creating Web sites to disseminate information to previously nonparticipating subcontractors in order to facilitate the submission of proposals to prime contractors who are contemplating submitting a bid on a project\u2014all these are permissible means by which a governmental entity may attempt to expand the pool of persons to whom public contracts are awarded. In addition, there are many other strategies that may be implemented by governmental entities that similarly appear to present no danger of running afoul of the precepts embodied in article I, section 31, such as dividing large public contracts into smaller segments in order to facilitate participation by new or more modest enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Furthermore, a public contracting program that imposes an obligation on a prime contractor to engage in reasonable, good faith outreach to all types of subcontractor enterprises in a community, like the outreach program upheld by this court prior to the adoption of Proposition 209 in <em>Domar Electric, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>supra, 9 Cal.4th 161, represents another example of a permissible affirmative action outreach program that does not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment on the basis of race or gender.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the proponents of Proposition 209 made clear in their rebuttal to the argument</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>against the initiative measure: \u201cProposition 209 bans discrimination and preferential treatment\u2014period.

Thus, state and local governments would save money to the extent they otherwise would have rejected a low bidder\u2014because the bidder did not make a \u2018good faith effort\u2019\u2014and awarded the contract to a higher bidder.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Analyst\u2019s analysis of Prop. 209, p. 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"AO1\">This comment cannot properly be interpreted to suggest that <em>every </em>affirmative action program that includes an outreach element requiring a good faith effort by a prime contractor would violate article I, section 31. The comment in the analysis relates solely to programs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>which the required good faith effort is directed at individuals or firms on the basis of race or gender. Because article I, section 31, prohibits only those actions that discriminate or grant preferential treatment to persons of groups on the basis of these prohibited categories, an outreach program (such as the program addressed in <em>Domar) </em>that is not based on those characteristics would not violate the constitutional provision, even if it contains a good faith effort component.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
