It is not necessary to decide in this case whether all such agreements are enforceable regardless of the circumstances of the parties at the time enforcement is sought. We conclude that no policy of this state makes an agreement like that entered into by the parties to this action per se unenforceable, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Candace Pendleton and Barry I. Fireman married on July 13, 1991. On July 1, 1991, they had executed a premarital agreement which provided, inter alia: \u201c[Bjoth parties now and forever waive, in the event of a dissolution of the marriage, all rights to any type of spousal support or child support from the other; . . .\u201d The agreement acknowledged that each party had been represented by independent counsel in the negotiation and preparation of the agreement, that counsel had advised each of the meaning and legal consequences of the agreement, and that each party had read and understood the agreement and its legal consequences. Their respective counsel certified that this had been done and that their clients understood the meaning and legal consequences of the agreement and executed it freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The couple separated in 1995, and on April 3, 1996, Candace filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage and subsequently sought spousal support. Candace acknowledged the existence of a premarital agreement in a declaration that accompanied her request for spousal support, stating that she was then investigating its validity. At the time the dissolution petition was filed, each party had a net worth of approximately $2.5 million. Candace, who had two children from a prior marriage, held a master\u2019s degree and was an aspiring writer. Barry, who held a doctorate in pharmacology and a law degree, was a businessman with ownership interests in numerous companies and business ventures. Candace declared that her monthly gross income was $5,772, consisting of $1,352 in Social Security benefits for two children from a prior marriage, $2,000 from a brokerage account, and $2,420 in rental income. Her net monthly income was $4,233.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Barry sought to strike the pleading seeking support or to have a separate trial on the validity of the prenuptial agreement. The court denied the motion for separate trial, concluding that discovery on the issue of validity would overlap that on other issues and would not result in saving time or litigation costs. The court ruled that the waiver of spousal support was against public policy and thus was unenforceable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> noted that the couple had maintained a lifestyle in the high $20,000 to $32,000 per month range, and ordered Barry to pay temporary spousal support of $8,500 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>On Barry\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed the order for temporary spousal support. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Legislature had deleted subdivision (a)(4) from section 3 of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (Uniform Act) prior to adopting the act in 1985.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The omitted subdivision would have expressly permitted the parties to a premarital agreement to contract with respect to modification or elimination of spousal support. (See 9B West\u2019s U. Laws Ann. (1987) U. Premarital Agreement Act (1983) \u00a7 3, pp. 373-374.) The Court of Appeal concluded, however, that the Legislature intended to leave the question of whether spousal support waivers in premarital agreements violate public policy to the courts and that there was presently no authority governing the public policy question. In reaching the latter conclusion, the court reasoned that the question had not been reconsidered after the adoption of the Family Law Act of 1969 (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 4000 et seq.), which repealed the law permitting divorce only on a showing of fault, or in light of current law that gives both spouses equal control over management and control of community property (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1100-1103) and mandates equal division on dissolution (Fam. Code, \u00a7 2550). In the view of the Court of Appeal, the current state of family law is one that \u201cshould not per se prohibit premarital spousal support waivers or limitations. All the protection the parties need is expressly provided by the California [version of the Uniform] Act.\u201d The Court of Appeal therefore remanded the matter to the trial court which, in the belief that such waivers were per se unenforceable, had not determined whether this agreement was enforceable under the rules set forth in section 1615 and the policies underlying the Uniform Act and the California version thereof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Article 2 of the California Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (\u00a7 1610 et seq.) governs premarital agreements. A premarital agreement is \u201can agreement between prospective spouses made in contemplation of marriage and to be effective upon marriage.\u201d (\u00a7 1610, subd. (a).) Section 1612 specifies the permissible objects of a premarital agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201c(a) Parties to a premarital agreement may contract with respect to all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\u201c(1) The rights and obligations of each of the parties in any of the property of either or both of them whenever and wherever acquired or located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\u201c(2) The right to buy, sell, use, transfer, exchange, abandon, lease, consume, expend, assign, create a security interest in, mortgage, encumber, dispose of, or otherwise manage and control property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">\u201c(3) The disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">\u201c(4) The making of a will, trust, or other arrangement to carry out the provisions of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">\u201c(5) The ownership rights in and disposition of the death benefit from a life insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">\u201c(6) The choice of law governing the construction of the agreement. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">\u201c(7) Any other matter, including their personal rights and obligations, not in violation of public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">\u201c(b) The right of a child to support may not be adversely affected by a premarital agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">As noted, <em>ante, </em>the California version of the Uniform Act omits subdivision (a)(4) of section 3 of the Uniform Act (subdivision (a)(4)). When first introduced on March 7, 1985, Senate Bill No. 1143 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill 1143), the California version of the Uniform Act, included subdivision (a)(4), and thus listed among the permissible subjects of a premarital agreement \u201cthe modification or elimination of spousal support.\u201d The spousal support waiver provision was deleted by amendment. (Assem. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 1143 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 28, 1985.) The amendment of Senate Bill 1143 that deleted subdivision (a)(4) simultaneously deleted a provision, subdivision (b) of section 6 of the Uniform Act, which provided: \u201cIf a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution, a court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility.\u201d (Sen. Bill No. 1143 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 7, 1985; Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 1143 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 28, 1985.) As enacted, Senate Bill 1143 became Civil Code former section 5315, now Family Code section 1612.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The Court of Appeal held that neither the Legislature\u2019s deletion from the legislation of express authorization for premarital waivers of spousal support, nor past cases refusing to enforce waivers of spousal support, preclude such waivers today. The court reasoned that the legislative history of section 1612 suggested that, in omitting subdivision (a)(4) of the Uniform Act, the Legislature intended to leave the enforceability of spousal support waivers to the courts. It found support for that conclusion in two reports by the Assembly Subcommittee on Administration of Justice. The first was prepared for an August 19, 1985, hearing on Senate Bill 1143. Senate Bill 1143 repealed prior statutory law governing premarital agreements and enacted the Uniform Act. In the first report staff advised that California courts did not permit enforcement of premarital agreements on spousal support and recommended deletion \u201cto allow California case law to continue to prevail on the issue of spousal support in premarital agreements.\u201d (Assem. Subcom. on Admin, of Justice, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1143 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) for Aug. 19, 1985, hearing, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The second report, prepared after the amendment passed, stated that as a result of the amendment \u201cCalifornia case law would . . . prevail on the issue of spousal support in premarital agreements. fl[] There is a split in authority among the states as to whether a premarital agreement may control on the issue of spousal support. Some states, such as California, do not permit a premarital agreement to control this issue. See <em>In re Marriage of Dawley, </em>17 Cal.3d 342 [131 Cal.Rptr. 3, 551 P.2d 323] (1976), in which the court notes that the enforcement- of provisions in premarital contracts to waive or limit spousal support rights is barred because such provisions are considered promotive of divorce.\u201d (Assem. Subcom. on Admin, of Justice, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1143 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 28, 1985, p. 3.) The Court of Appeal understood this history to mean that the Legislature recognized that enforceability of spousal support waivers is a question for the courts, not the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>At the time the California version of the Uniform Act was adopted, this court had held that agreements waiving the right to spousal support were unenforceable as being against public policy if the waiver would promote or encourage dissolution. This court had held in <em>In re Marriage of Higgason </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 476, 485 [110 Cal.Rptr. 897, 516 P.2d 289] <em>(Higgason), </em>speaking of both spousal support and property division, that to be valid, premarital agreements must be made \u201cin contemplation that the marriage relation will continue until the parties are separated by death. Contracts which facilitate divorce or separation by providing for a settlement only in the event of such an occurrence are void as against public policy. [Citations.] <em>m </em>Insofar as an antenuptial agreement relates to the disposition of the property of the respective parties, and does not seek to alter support obligations imposed by law, it will be upheld.\u201d At issue in <em>Higgason </em>was an agreement in which both husband and wife waived all interest in the property of the other party as well as the right to support. The court concluded that a purported waiver was invalid as against public policy insofar as the agreement sought to alter the wife\u2019s statutory obligation to support the husband during marriage. The court also held that the agreement did not preclude exercise of the court\u2019s discretionary power to award post-dissolution support. (10 Cal.3d at pp. 487-488.) Although the basis for the latter holding is not made clear in the opinion, it appears to be that married persons assume, by means of the marriage contract, an obligation for support that continues throughout the lifetime of the parties regardless of whether they live together or apart, and any agreement to waive that obligation is also unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">When the issue of enforceability of premarital agreements next arose in <em>In re Marriage of Dawley </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 342 [131 Cal.Rptr. 3, 551 P.2d 323] <em>(Dawley), </em>where the parties had agreed before marriage that the earnings and property acquired during marriage would be held as separate property, the court concluded that <em>Higgason </em>had misstated the law in stating that premarital agreements must be made in contemplation that the marriage would continue throughout the lifetime of the parties and disapproved that <em>Higgason </em>dictum. <em>(Dawley, </em>at p. 352.) We also explained that, apart from <em>Higgason, </em>\u201cCalifornia courts have uniformly held that contracts offend the state policy favoring marriage only\u201d if, objectively viewed, by its terms the contract promotes dissolution of marriage. <em>(Dawley, </em>at p. 350.) We noted in <em>Dawley </em>that in two cases <em>(Barham </em>v. <em>Barham </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 416 [202 P.2d 289] and <em>Whiting v. Whiting </em>(1923) 62 Cal.App. 157 [216 P. 92]) provisions in agreements that waived or limited spousal support rights had been invalidated on the basis that they promoted divorce, while other provisions containing property divisions were enforced; but <em>Dawley </em>did not endorse or otherwise approve those decisions. <em>(Dawley, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 351.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Notably, in <em>Dawley </em>we did not distinguish premarital agreements governing property rights and those governing spousal support. Our discussion of the enforceability of premarital agreements in no way suggested that spousal support waivers were per se unenforceable. The rule we stated was: \u201c[A]n antenuptial agreement violates the state policy favoring marriage only insofar as its terms encourage or promote dissolution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 352.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The parties have not called our attention to any legislative history other than the two legislative reports, the latter of which did not accurately state the holding of this court in <em>Dawley,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and neither of which adequately explains the legislative purpose in omitting subdivision (a)(4). Two possible interpretations of the Legislature\u2019s intent in omitting express authority for premarital waivers of spousal support come to mind. The Legislature may have intended to deny couples the right to enter into any premarital agreement regarding spousal support by adopting what the committee report erroneously described as the existing case law under which premarital waivers would be per se unenforceable. Alternatively, the Legislature may have concluded that policy governing spousal support agreements, having been established by the court in the past, should continue to evolve in the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The public policy under which waivers of spousal support once were held unenforceable was explained in <em>Loveren </em>v. <em>Loveren </em>(1895) 106 Cal. 509, 512 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>[39 P. 801], quoting <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Thorp </em>(1883) 10 Or. 494, 496-497 [1883 WL 1110]: \u201c \u2018The authorities are uniform in holding that any contract between the parties having for its object the dissolution of the marriage contract, or <em>facilitating that result, </em>such as an agreement by the defendant in a pending action for divorce to withdraw his or her opposition and to make no defense, is void as <em>contra bonos </em>mores\u2019; and that courts \u2018will esteem it their duty to interfere, <em>upon their own motion, </em>Whenever it appears the dissolution is sought to be effected by the connivance or collusion of the parties.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See also <em>Pereira v. Pereira </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 1, 5 [103 P. 488].) Another concern was that a man should not be able to contract before marriage against the liability to his wife that he would incur should he commit offenses against the wife during the marriage. (See <em>Barham v. Barham, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at p. 428.) The rule those decisions implemented found its origin in the common law, but the policy had been declared by the Legislature in 1872 with the adoption of the Civil Code. Former section 159 of the Civil Code then provided: \u201cA husband and wife cannot, by any contract with each other, alter their legal relations, except as to property, . . . and except that they may agree to an immediate separation, and may make provision for the support of either of them and of their children during such separation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Barry suggests, and we agree, that changes in the law governing the spousal relation warrant reexamination of the assumptions and policy underlying the refusal to enforce waivers of spousal support. We may not do so, however, if the Legislature intends that section 1612 control the permissible subjects of a premarital agreement and that public policy with respect to waiver of spousal support no longer be governed by the common law subject to reconsideration and development by the courts. (Cf. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 382, 394 [115 Cal.Rptr. 765, 525 P.2d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">It is clear that the Legislature understood that the omission of authorization for premarital waivers of spousal support in section 1612 would leave the law as it was in 1985. The subcommittee reports reflect that understanding. We do not agree with respondent and the dissent, however, that in so doing the Legislature thereby abrogated the role of the courts in developing the law governing premarital waivers of spousal support. We will not presume that the Legislature intended that the law remain static. It would be unreasonable to assume that the Legislature intended the common law of the 19th century to govern the marital relationship in the 21st century. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>most reasonable understanding of the Legislature\u2019s purpose when it omitted subdivision (a)(4) is that it was satisfied with the evolution of the common law governing premarital waivers of spousal support and intended to permit that evolution to continue. Had the Legislature intended to forbid spousal support waivers, it is logical to assume that it would have done so by expressly including' spousal support in subdivision (b) of section 1612, which reads: \u201cThe right of a child to support may not be adversely affected by a premarital agreement.\u201d We agree with the Court of Appeal, therefore, that the court is free to reexamine the assumptions that underlie the common law rule that premarital spousal support waivers promote dissolution and for that reason contravene public policy.  Having done so, we also agree with the Court of Appeal that the common law policy, based on assumptions that dissolution of marriage is contrary to public policy and that premarital waivers of spousal support may promote dissolution, is anachronistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Some 41 jurisdictions have already abandoned the common law restrictions on premarital waivers of spousal support. In 21 jurisdictions, premarital waivers of spousal support are authorized by statutes that either adopt all or substantially all of the provisions of the Uniform Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One jurisdiction (New York) had other statutory authorization for such waivers,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and in another 18 the right to enforce a premarital waiver of spousal support exists pursuant to judicial <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The changes in public policy and the attitude toward marriage, already reflected in <em>Dawley, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 342, are made manifest by contrasting the current statutory treatment of marriage and premarital agreements with an early decision of the Oregon Supreme Court that reflects the 19th-century view of public policy regarding marriage. \u201cThe welfare of society is so deeply interested in the preservation of the marriage relation, and so fraught with evil is regarded whatever is calculated to impair its usefulness, or designed to terminate it, that it has long been the settled policy of the law to guard and maintain it with a watchful vigilance. Although marriage, in the eye of the law, is a civil contract, unlike any other civil contract, it cannot be rescinded or annulled by consent of the parties to it. By mutual consent, if the parties are of the proper age and capacity, the marriage relation may be created and receive the sanction of the law, but it cannot dissolve or terminate it. That high office can only be performed by a court of competent jurisdiction, for some specified cause prescribed by law, upon proof taken in a suit for that purpose. The good order and well being of society, as well as the laws of this state, require this. And so strict and careful are courts in the administration of this justice, out of regard for the public morals and the general welfare of society, that they will esteem it their duty to interfere upon their own motions whenever it appears the dissolution is sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>effected by the connivance or collusion of the parties; and all contrivances or agreements, having for their object the termination of the marriage contract, or designed to facilitate or procure it, will be declared illegal and void as against public policy. . . . \u2018 . And when the marriage relation has been assumed, it is equally the policy of the law to sustain and uphold it. It, therefore, holds all contracts void which contemplate or provide for the future separation of the parties ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Thorp, supra, </em>10 Or. at pp. 495-496.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">California statutory law of the time reflected these policies and values. In 1872, divorce could be granted only on the grounds of adultery, extreme cruelty, willful desertion, willful neglect, habitual intemperance, or conviction of a felony, and could be denied on grounds, inter alia, of connivance or collusion\u2014the \u201ccorrupt consent\u201d by one party to the other\u2019s commission of an act constituting cause for divorce or an agreement between the parties that one should commit, appear to commit, or represent to the court that one had committed such an act. (Civ. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 92, 111-114.) The husband had exclusive control of the community property with \u201cabsolute power of disposition (other than testamentary) as he ha[d] of his separate estate\u201d (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 172) and a wife could not contract for the payment of money. (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 167.) The court was empowered to order the husband to pay alimony on divorce if the divorce was granted for an offense of the husband (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 139), but had no power to order a wife to pay alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The assumptions underlying the refusal to enforce premarital waivers of spousal support were that the state had a vital interest in and should act to ensure the permanency of the marriage relation <em>(Pereira </em>v. <em>Pereira, supra, </em>156 Cal. at p. 5), and that this interest was undermined by such waivers, assumptions reflected in statutory law governing marriage, dissolution, and property rights. In <em>Dawley, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at page 353, however, we emphasized that only agreements that on their face promote dissolution violate the public policy favoring marriage. We recognized there that contemporary attitudes toward the marriage relationship are more pragmatic: \u201cIn recent years, however, an increasing number of couples have executed antenuptial agreements in order to structure their legal relationship in a manner more suited to their needs and values. (See generally, Weitzman, <em>Legal Regulation of Marriage: Tradition and Change </em>(1974) 62 Cal.L.Rev. 1169.) Neither the reordering of property rights to fit the needs and desires of the couple, nor realistic planning that takes account of the possibility of dissolution, offends the public policy favoring and protecting marriage. It is only when the terms of an agreement go further\u2014when they promote and encourage dissolution, and thereby threaten to induce the destruction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>marriage that might otherwise endure\u2014that such terms offend public policy.\u201d <em>(Dawley, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Both public attitude and contemporary official policy have changed substantially over the past century. Public policy continues to favor and encourage marriage, but it now acknowledges that lifetime commitment is no longer the norm. When legitimate grounds for dissolution exist, dissolution does not contravene public policy, but is the preferred solution. <em>(Glickman v. Collins </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 852, 858-859 [120 Cal.Rptr. 76, 533 P.2d 204, 93 A.L.R.3d 513].) The adoption of the California Uniform Premarital Agreement Act itself reflects recognition that permanency is no longer a dominant characteristic of modem marriage. The Family Law Act of 1969 (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 4000 et seq.) permitted, and now the Family Code permits, no-fault dissolution. (\u00a7 2310.) A stipulation governing division of community property, once held in reliance on <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Thorp, supra, </em>10 Or. 494, to be collusive and to violate public policy <em>(Loveren v. Loveren, supra, </em>106 Cal. at p. 512), today is expressly allowed (\u00a7\u00a7 2550, 2554), encouraged, and no longer condemned as facilitating dissolution. <em>(Dawley, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 350, fn. 5.) Spouses who are separated have long been permitted to contract with regard to division of property and to include provisions for spousal support on dissolution, even when community property was evenly divided and thus the division was not consideration for the modification of spousal support rights. <em>(Dexter v. Dexter </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 36, 43-44 [265 P.2d 873].) The right of husband and wife to agree in writing to separate and provide for spousal support both during separation and on dissolution of the marriage continues to be expressly recognized by statute. (\u00a7 3580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Legal recognition also has been given to the changing position of married women who, in increasing numbers, are employed outside the home and have been given equal right to management of the property of the community as well as primary right to manage businesses they are operating. (\u00a7 1100.) Public policy toward spousal support has also changed. While spouses must support each other during marriage (\u00a7 4300), the court has been given greater discretion in marital dissolutions to deny spousal support altogether or to limit such support in an amount and duration that reflects the ability of both parties in contemporary unions to provide for their own needs. (\u00a7\u00a7 4330, 4320.) The changing attitudes are reflected in the 1969 repeal of former section 139 of the Civil Code (enacted 1872), which authorized the court to award lifetime support if a divorce was based on an offense of the husband. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1608, \u00a7 3, p. 3313.) The underlying theory, we explained was then \u201c \u2018that the husband entered upon an obligation which bound him to support his wife during the period of their joint lives, that by his own wrong he has forced her to sever the relation which enabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>her to compel the performance of this duty, and that he is required to make compensation for the offense committed by him which has deprived her of the benefit of the obligation.\u2019 <em>(Arnold </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>[(1946)] 76 Cal.App.2d 877, 885-886 [174 P.2d 674].)\u201d <em>(Webber v. Webber </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 153, 157-158 [199 P.2d 934].) Today, however, a court ordering spousal support must consider, inter alia, \u201c[t]he goal that the supported party shall be self-supporting within a reasonable period of time.\u201d (\u00a7 4320, subd. (k).) The law has thus progressed from a rule that entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support to one that entitles either spouse to postdissolution support for only so long as necessary to become self-supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">These changes in the relationship between spouses and support obligations in particular, accurately described by the Court of Appeal as \u201cdramatic\u201d and by a legal commentator as a \u201csea change\u201d (Ellman, <em>The Theory of Alimony </em>(1989) 77 Cal. L.Rev. 1, 7), clearly warrant reassessment of what remains of the rule that premarital waivers of spousal support may promote dissolution and, if they do so, are unenforceable. Public policy, to the extent that it is reflected in these legislative acts, no longer reflects concern that premarital waivers of property rights threaten the marriage relationship. Section 1612 expressly permits the parties to contract with regard to numerous property rights, including \u201c[t]he disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event.\u201d (\u00a7 1612, subd. (a)(3).) No basis appears on which to distinguish premarital waivers of spousal support from agreements governing property rights insofar as either has a potential for promoting dissolution. As the Court of Appeal recognized, today the availability of an enforceable premarital agreement \u201cmay in fact encourage rather than discourage marriage.\u201d We agree with the Court of Appeal, therefore, that, when entered into voluntarily by parties who are aware of the effect of the agreement, a premarital waiver of spousal support does not offend contemporary public policy. Such agreements are, therefore, permitted under section 1612, subdivision (a)(7), which authorizes the parties to contract in a premarital agreement regarding \u201c[a]ny other matter, including their personal rights and obligations, not in violation of public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We need not decide here whether circumstances existing at the time enforcement of a waiver of spousal support is sought might make enforcement unjust.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is enough to conclude here that no public policy is violated by permitting enforcement of a waiver of spousal support executed by intelligent, well-educated persons, each of whom appears to be self-sufficient in property and earning ability, and both of whom have the advice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>counsel regarding their rights and obligations as marital partners at the time they execute the waiver. Such a waiver does not violate public policy and is not per se unenforceable as the trial court believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., Hastings, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\">The right to spousal support is statutory. Family Code section 4330, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cIn a judgment of dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties, the court may order a party to pay for the support of the other party an amount, for a period of time, that the court determines is just and reasonable, based on the standard of living established during the marriage, taking into consideration the circumstances as provided in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 4320).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references herein are to the Family Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The order explained: \u201cAssuming arguendo that the validity and enforceability of the waiver of spousal support provision of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement can be tested in a motion to strike, the court denied this motion on the ground that a waiver of spousal support in a premarital agreement is void and unenforceable as against California public policy. The court is persuaded that the legislative history of the statute dealing with the permissible subjects of premarital agreements indicated that the Legislature intended to omit a provision in the California version of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (UPAA) that allowed for a premarital waiver of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"Aix\">\u201cThe court is further persuaded that the pre-UPAA cases that hold that premarital agreements that diminish or waive a party\u2019s obligation to pay spousal support to the other party to the marriage are unenforceable as against public policy and would continue to be so held after the passage of the UPAA.</p>\n<p id=\"AoT\">\u201cAt least one purpose of a policy that a spousal support waiver will be unenforceable in this state is to protect the state, not just a party to the marriage. A person\u2019s financial circumstances can change markedly from those found just prior to that person\u2019s marriage. A valid premarital spousal support waiver could produce spouses who at the time of their marriage have assets and earning capacity to support themselves without spousal support, but by the time of the dissolution of their marriages may be unable to support themselves and in need of financial support. The state has an interest in having such needy spouses supported by their spouses if possible. Just as the state has a serious fiscal interest in not paying for support of children if there is a parent with the capacity to support that parent\u2019s children, the state has a fiscal interest in seeing that it not be forced to support needy former spouses if the non-needy former spouse is able to contribute to the support of the needy former spouse and if ordering the payment of such support is warranted, pursuant to the principles of Family Code \u00a7 4320. Thus the same principles and policies that underlie the public policy against permitting a binding waiver of child support would apply to premarital waivers of spousal support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The California version of the Uniform Act was enacted in 1985 as Civil Code section 5300 et seq., which was repealed in 1992, effective January 1, 1994, and reenacted as part of the new Family Code section 1600 et seq.

(1987) U. Premarital Agreement Act (1983) p. 369.) Uniform acts are drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws \u201cto promote uniformity in state law, on all subjects where uniformity is desirable and practicable, by voluntary action of each state government.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p.

The bill proposed adopting the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act in its entirety. On August 28, 1985, however, the bill was amended to <em>delete </em>these two provisions of the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">Section 3, subdivision (a)(4), allowing spousal support to be modified or eliminated through premarital agreements (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 1143 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 28, 1985),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">Section 6, subdivision (b), providing that if, as a result of having entered into an a premarital agreement waiving spousal support, a spouse at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>of separation or marital dissolution becomes impoverished and eligible for public assistance, then a court retains the authority to award support \u201cto the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility\u201d (Assem.

Aug. 28, 1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">When the Legislature deleted these two provisions from Senate Bill No. 1143, two decisions of this court, <em>In re Marriage of Higgason, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 476, and <em>In re Marriage of Dawley, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 342, had held roughly a decade earlier that premarital agreements waiving spousal support violated California\u2019s public policy and were therefore invalid. At the time of the deletion and until today\u2019s decision by the majority, it was the trial court that determined whether to award spousal support, depending on the circumstances existing at the time of separation or dissolution of the marriage. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7 4320 [circumstances trial court should consider in awarding spousal support].)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Does the Legislature\u2019s deletion of the provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support establish its intent to preclude such waivers? The answer is \u201cyes,\u201d as I explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">On point is this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 603 [7 Cal.Rptr. 129, 354 P.2d 657] <em>(Kusior). </em>There, as here, the Legislature was considering the adoption of a uniform act. There, the Legislature had refused to enact into law a provision of the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity allowing blood tests to show that the husband was not the father of the child. <em>(Kusior, supra, </em>at p. 618.) There, as here, California decisional law was contrary to the proposed provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">This court in <em>Kusior </em>observed that \u201c[statutes are to be interpreted by assuming that the Legislature was aware of the existing judicial decisions.\u201d <em>(Kusior, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at p. 618.) We then held that in omitting from its adoption of the uniform act at issue a provision directly at odds with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>state\u2019s decisional law, the Legislature\u2019s omission \u201cmust be deemed\u201d an intent to approve and retain the decisional law. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Similarly, here the Legislature\u2019s express rejection of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act\u2019s provision allowing premarital spousal support waivers, in the face of decisional law to the contrary, \u201cmust be deemed\u201d an intent to approve and retain the existing law. (See also <em>Estate of Sanders </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 462, 473-474 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 536] [\u201c \u2018[t]he rejection by the Legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>Kusior, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 603, is dispositive here. Under the reasoning of that decision, our Legislature\u2019s express rejection of the proposed uniform law provision allowing waivers of spousal support was a decision to approve and retain California\u2019s rule prohibiting such waivers. By now deciding that premarital spousal support waivers do not violate California\u2019s public policy, the majority has invaded the legislative domain, judicially enacting in substance a provision that the Legislature intended to reject, and judicially abrogating the rule that the Legislature intended to retain.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Our Legislature\u2019s decision not to enact into law the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act\u2019s provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support, while adopting other provisions of the act, reflects sound public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Such waivers do not allow for changed circumstances between execution of the premarital agreement and separation or dissolution of the marriage. An agreement equitable at the time of the marriage may later become inequitable and unjust. For example, the health, earning capacity, or financial resources of a spouse may change markedly during the marriage, especially one that is lengthy. An elderly spouse or one in poor health may be left destitute. The earning capacity of a spouse may be impaired by the obligations of caring for children produced by a marriage of short duration. After the marriage one spouse may elect to give up his or her career to raise the children of the marriage or to move to another location in the interest of furthering the career of the other spouse. And a spouse may substantially deplete his or her financial resources to advance the other spouse\u2019s education, training, or career during the marriage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">These considerations are reflected in the Legislature\u2019s enactment of Family Code section 4320, which sets forth spousal support guidelines for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>trial courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They are also reflected in the Legislature\u2019s express declarations that spousal support is a \u201cserious legal obligation[]\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4250, subd. (a)) and that it \u201cis the policy of the State of California\u201d to \u201censure fair and sufficient\u201d spousal support awards (id., \u00a7 2100, subd. (a)). In rejecting the proposed provision to allow premarital waivers of spousal support, the Legislature must have recognized the serious potential for injustice at the time of dissolution of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>That concern was succinctly expressed in a letter the Women Lawyers\u2019 Association of Los Angeles wrote on June 6, 1985 to Elihu Harris, the Chair of the Assembly Judiciary Committee, stating its opposition to that part of Senate Bill No. 1143 proposing adoption of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act\u2019s provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support: \u201cThe bill would change existing California law, which does not enforce premarital waivers of spousal support, to allow such waivers under certain conditions. Current California law allows spouses to waive spousal support only at the time of separation, when they are much more aware of what they have contributed to and sacrificed for the marriage as well as their prospects for self-support following the separation. California law regards the duty to support one\u2019s spouse as an essential incident of marriage and refuses to confer the benefits of marriage on those who would avoid this obligation. Although numerous states have adopted the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, California\u2019s position represents sounder public policy and should not be sacrificed to achieve uniformity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In a letter to the Legislature on August 14, 1985, the Family Law Section of the State Bar of California echoed that concern. In opposing the proposed provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support, the Family Law Section warned that such an enactment \u201cwould be a major change in California law\u201d and \u201ca great step backward in terms of assuring that the financial consequences of a dissolution of marriage are borne by both spouses in an equitable manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In sharp contrast to the thoughtful action by the Legislature, which after the letters quoted above deleted the proposed provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support, the majority ignores the significant public policy considerations that prompted the Legislature to retain our existing law prohibiting such waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">After repudiating the existing law of this state prohibiting all premarital waivers of spousal support, the majority abdicates its responsibility to articulate guidelines for the bench and bar explaining when, if ever, such waivers are enforceable. The majority declares that it will <em>not </em>decide \u201cwhether all such agreements [premarital agreements waiving spousal support] are enforceable regardless of the circumstances of the parties at the time enforcement is sought\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 41) and that it will <em>not </em>decide \u201cwhether circumstances existing at the time enforcement of a waiver of spousal support is sought might make enforcement unjust\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 53, fn. omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Given the majority\u2019s \u201cholding\u201d that such provisions may or may not be enforceable depending upon circumstances the majority refuses to discuss, what guidance is there for attorneys preparing a premarital agreement to decide whether to include a waiver of spousal support? And what guidance is there for trial courts in determining the enforceability of such agreements? If enforcement of a premarital waiver of spousal support results in a spouse\u2019s becoming eligible for public assistance, should the trial court order spousal support limited to the amount necessary to avoid such eligibility, as provided for in the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act? (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 56, fn. 2.) Or should the trial court in that instance continue to apply the considerations the Legislature has specified in Family Code section 4320? (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 58, fn. 3.) The majority\u2019s silence on these important questions does a disservice to the public, the bar, and the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied November 1, 2000.

Laws Ann., <em>supra, </em>at p. 376.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The issues I address here are not presented in <em>In re Marriage of Bonds </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 1 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 252, 5 P.3d 815] <em>(Bonds), </em>a unanimous decision of this court filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>simultaneously with this decision, although both concern premarital agreements and both require interpretation of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act. The main issue in <em>Bonds </em>is whether one spouse voluntarily entered into the premarital agreement, an issue not presented here. Also, the focus of the dispute in <em>Bonds </em>appears to be the premarital waiver of community property rights, not spousal support. This distinction is crucial because the Legislature, when it enacted the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, deliberately omitted the provision authorizing spousal support waivers while approving and enacting the provision authorizing waivers of community property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"ATX\">The Legislature\u2019s decision to permit waiver of community property rights, but not spousal support, may be explained on policy grounds. A spouse who has waived community property rights, but not spousal support, retains effective protection against a sudden, drastic, and inequitable loss of income resulting from dissolution of marriage, and may have recourse either to former community property or to separate property to enforce a spousal support order (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4338). By contrast, a spouse who has lost the right to spousal support may well have no recourse except public assistance. Thus, the inequities that may result from premarital spousal support waivers are much graver than those that may result from a premarital waiver of community property rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Family Code section 4320 provides: \u201cffl In ordering spousal support under this part, the court shall consider all of the following circumstances: [511 (a) The extent to which the earning capacity of each party is sufficient to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage, taking into account all of the following: [f] (1) The marketable skills of the supported party; the job market for those skills; the time and expenses required for the supported party to acquire the appropriate education or training to develop those skills; and the possible need for retraining or education to acquire other, more marketable skills or employment.
