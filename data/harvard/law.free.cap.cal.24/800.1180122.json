Unlike, the typical case where an employee wishes to sue his or her employer or workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, this case involves a group of medical providers that wish to sue a group of workers\u2019 compensation insurers. In their novel complaint, the medical providers allege the insurers conspired to put them out of business by intentionally mishandling their lien claims before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) and seek <em>only </em>to recover the damage to their businesses. We now consider whether the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA) preempt the statutory and tort claims asserted by these medical providers and conclude that these provisions bar some claims but not others.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Because \u201c[t]his case comes to us after the sustaining of a general demurrer . . . , we accept as true all the material allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>(Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 7 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054, 20 A.L.R.5th 1016] <em>(Shoemaker).) </em>The following facts appear from the allegations of the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Plaintiffs are (1) licensed medical groups that provided medical-legal services to employees with workers\u2019 compensation claims, and (2) medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>management companies under contract to the medical groups.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To provide these services, plaintiffs employed or contracted with physicians to treat and evaluate employees injured in the workplace. After promptly paying these physicians, plaintiffs would seek compensation from the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier of the employee\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Defendants are workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At a meeting in 1991, defendants decided to put plaintiffs out of business by delaying payment or refusing to pay for services rendered by plaintiffs to injured workers. As part of their scheme, defendants agreed to keep the meeting secret and to deny the existence of their plan to eliminate plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">In subsequent meetings, defendants discussed strategies and distributed \u201chit lists\u201d of targeted medical providers, including plaintiffs. Reminiscent of the methods used by Great Benefit Insurance Company, the villain in the John Grisham thriller, The Rainmaker (Doubleday, 1995), defendants developed procedures for delaying or avoiding payment to plaintiffs using \u201cfalse, fraudulent and frivolous objections.\u201d Defendants incorporated these procedures into their claims manuals and training protocols. Defendants also misled plaintiffs into believing they would promptly pay all valid lien claims. Meanwhile, they publicly accused plaintiffs of being \u201cfraud mills\u201d and advised other insurance carriers not to pay plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Due to the \u201cno pay\u201d or \u201cslow pay\u201d tactics of defendants, plaintiffs suffered heavy business losses. Because plaintiffs promptly paid the treating physician even if they failed to receive timely compensation, plaintiffs were especially susceptible to a disruption in cash flow. Not surprisingly, defendants\u2019 tactics were quite effective, as \u201cthe average time from billing to payment rose dramatically\u201d and \u201cthe percentage collected [by plaintiffs] of the amount billed steadily declined.\u201d These tactics eventually forced plaintiffs out of business, and plaintiffs \u201cnow exist only to collect outstanding accounts receivable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants, alleging: (1) abuse of process; (2) fraud; (3) violations of the Cartwright Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16700 et seq.); (4) violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c)); (5) conspiracy to violate RICO <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 1962(d)); (6) intentional and negligent interference with ongoing businesses; (7) intentional and negligent interference with contractual and prospective economic relations; and (8) violations of the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.). Plaintiffs based their claims on defendants\u2019 alleged scheme to wrongfully delay or avoid payment on plaintiffs\u2019 lien claims and sought to recover the damage to their businesses. In doing so, plaintiffs declined to seek recovery of any amount owed on their individual lien claims against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Defendants filed a demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, alleging, among other things, that the exclusive remedy provisions of the WCA bar plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The first trial court judge overruled the demurrer on exclusivity grounds, but dismissed with leave to amend on other grounds. After plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, defendants filed another demurrer, again alleging that workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity bars plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The same judge overruled the demurrer again and held that \u201c[t]his is not an action to adjudicate medical liens in Worker\u2019s Compensation cases\u201d and plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cuse of the liens does not impinge on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">After the first judge retired, a new judge took over. Two defendants subsequently added to the complaint filed a demurrer, contending once again that plaintiffs could only recover the remedies provided by the workers\u2019 compensation system. After plaintiffs amended their complaint a third time, the second judge sustained the demurrer solely on exclusivity grounds. Concluding that \u201cthe gravamen of the complaints is . . . delay or refusal to pay medical liens,\u201d the judge held that \u201cexclusive jurisdiction is with the WCAB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeal affirmed for the reasons cited in its unpublished opinion in <em>FWHC Medical Group v. CNA Casualty of California </em>(June 18, 1998, B113493), a companion case with identical allegations and issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the court concluded that (1) section 5300 of the Labor Code<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> establishes that the WCAB has exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 claims; (2) defendants did not act outside their proper roles as insurers as understood in <em>Unruh v. Truck Insurance Exchange </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 616, 630 [102 Cal.Rptr. 815, 498 P.2d 1063] <em>(Unruh); </em>and (3) plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not fall within the public policy exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity stated in <em>Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1100 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680] <em>(Gantt), </em>overruled on other grounds by <em>Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 80, footnote 6 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046],</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">We granted review to determine whether the claims asserted by these medical providers, alleging that various workers\u2019 compensation insurers conspired to intentionally mishandle plaintiffs\u2019 lien claims in order to drive them out of business, are barred by workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Article XIV, section 4 of the California Constitution gives the Legislature \u201cplenary power ... to create, and enforce a complete system of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d Pursuant to this authority, the Legislature enacted the WCA\u2014a comprehensive statutory scheme governing compensation given to California employees for injuries incurred in the course and scope of their employment. (\u00a7 3201 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Under this statutory scheme, an employee injured in the workplace may request workers\u2019 compensation benefits by delivering a claim form to the employer within 30 days of the injury. (See \u00a7\u00a7 5400, 5401.) Benefits include compensation for medical treatment and other services \u201creasonably required to cure or relieve [the employee] from the effects of the injury.\u201d (\u00a7 4600; see also \u00a7 3207.) The employee may also obtain compensation for medical-legal evaluations necessary to establish his or her entitlement to benefits. (\u00a7 4621.) If the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer accepts coverage, then the insurer substitutes for the employer and assumes liability for benefits owed to the employee under the WCA. (\u00a7\u00a7 3755, 3757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Ordinarily, the insurer must pay all medical or medical-legal bills of an injured employee within 60 days of receiving the bill. (\u00a7\u00a7 4603.2, subd. (b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>4622, subd. (a).) If the insurer, however, contests the bill, then the insurer has to pay the contested portion of the bill only after the WCAB orders payment. (See \u00a7\u00a7 4603.2, subd. (b), 4622, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Medical providers that treat employee injuries covered by the WCA may file a lien claim for the costs of their services directly with the WCAB. (\u00a7\u00a7 4903, 5300.) Any such provider is a \u201cparty in interest\u201d to the WCAB proceeding <em>(Independence Indent. Co. v. Indus. Acc. Com. </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 397, 408 [41 P.2d 320] <em>(.Independence Indemnity)), </em>and receives full due process rights, including an opportunity to be heard (see <em>Beverly Hills Multispecialty Group, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 789, 803-804 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 293]).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The underlying premise behind this statutorily created system of workers\u2019 compensation is the \u201c \u2018compensation bargain.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16.) Pursuant to this presumed bargain, \u201cthe employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability. The employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but, in exchange, gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">To effectuate this theoretical bargain, the Legislature enacted several provisions limiting the remedies available for injuries covered by the WCA (the exclusive remedy provisions). (See <em>Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16.) Although the trade-off appears straightforward, \u201cthis court and the Courts of Appeal have struggled with the problem of defining the scope\u201d of the compensation bargain. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15.) Indeed, the unabated flow of published decisions <em>clarifying </em>the scope of workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity suggests considerable confusion as well as innovative lawyering.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Nonetheless, we glean several guiding principles from the case law. In determining whether exclusivity bars a cause of action against an employer or insurer, courts initially determine whether the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions. Where the alleged injury is \u201ccollateral to or derivative of\u2019 an injury compensable by the exclusive remedies of the WCA, a cause of action predicated on that injury may be subject to the exclusivity bar. <em>(Snyder v. Michael\u2019s Stores, Inc. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 991, 997 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 476, 945 P.2d 781] <em>(Snyder).) </em>Otherwise, the cause of action is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">If the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions, then courts consider whether the alleged acts or motives that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>establish the elements of the cause of action fall outside the risks encompassed within the compensation bargain. \u201c[I]n some exceptional circumstances the employer is not free from liability at law for his intentional acts even if the resulting injuries to his employees are compensable under workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d <em>(Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 473 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948, 9 A.L.R.4th 758] (Johns-Manville).) Where the acts are \u201ca \u2018normal\u2019 part of the employment relationship\u201d <em>(Fermino v. Fedco, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 701, 717 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 872 P.2d 559] <em>(Fermino)), </em>or workers\u2019 compensation claims process (see <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1, 10-11 [259 Cal.Rptr. 733, 774 P.2d 762] <em>(Marsh)), </em>or where the motive behind these acts does not violate a \u201cfundamental policy of this state\u201d <em>(Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1100), then the cause of action is barred. If not, then it may go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">With these principles in mind, we conclude that, while the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions, some of the alleged acts and motives do not. Thus, we bar plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims on exclusivity grounds, but not their Cartwright Act and RICO claims. We also bar in part and allow in part plaintiffs\u2019 tortious interference and UCL claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">A. <em>The Alleged Injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The starting point of our analysis is the alleged injury underlying plaintiffs\u2019 claims. This injury is collateral to or derivative of a personal \u201cinjury sustained and arising out of the course of employment\u201d (a compensable injury). <em>(Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 160 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743] <em>(Cole).) </em>Therefore, it falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Because workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity is statutory in nature, we begin with the pertinent statutory provisions. (See <em>American Psychometric Consultants, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1626, 1638 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 254] <em>(American Psychometric Consultants).) </em>Subdivision (a) of section 3600 provides in relevant part: \u201cLiability for the compensation provided by this division, <em>in lieu of any other liabilityM\u00bfhatsoever to any person . . . </em>shall, without regard to negligence,,, exist against_an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employ ees.arising~out-of and in the course of the employment and for the death of any employee.J\u00a3_the injury proximately causes death, in those cases where the . . . conditions of compensation concur . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The \u201cconditions of compensation\u201d applicable to this case include: \u201c(1) Where, at the time of the injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>both the employer and the employee are subject to the compensation provisions of this division. [^] (2) Where, at the time of the injury, the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and is acting within the course of his or her employment. [^] (3) Where the injury is proximately caused by the employment, either with or without negligence.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Subdivision (a) of section 3602 then provides that: \u201cWhere the conditions of compensation set forth in Section 3600 concur, the right to recover such compensation is . . . the <em>sole and exclusive remedy </em>of the employee . . . against the employer . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Finally, section 5300, subdivision (a) states that proceedings \u201c[f]or the recovery of compensation, or concerning any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto\u201d \u201cshall be instituted before the [WCAB] and <em>not elsewhere, </em>except as otherwise provided in Division <em>4 ... .\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The Legislature has extended the protection of these exclusive remedy provisions to workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers by defining the term \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cinsurer.\u201d (\u00a7 3850, subd. (b).) Thus, these insurers \u201cretain immunity from lawsuit as the \u2018alter ego\u2019 of the employer.\u201d <em>(Unruh, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 625, italics omitted.) Employees may, however, \u201cbring suit against any person other than [their] employer [or their employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer] who proximately caused [their] injury.\u201d <em>(Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 6, italics omitted; see also \u00a7 3852.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Together, these provisions establish that the liability of employers and insurers for \u201cindustrial injury which results in occupational disability or death\u201d is limited to workers\u2019 compensation remedies. <em>(Livitsanos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 752 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195], italics omitted <em>{Livitsanos).) </em>Where \u201cthe essence of the wrong is personal physical injury or death, the action is barred by the exclusiveness clause no matter what its name or technical form if the usual conditions of coverage are satisfied.\u201d <em>(Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 160.) In other words, the exclusivity provisions encompass all injuries \u201ccollateral to or derivative of\u2019 an injury compensable by the exclusive remedies of the WCA. <em>(Snyder, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 997.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Thus, the trigger for workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity is a compensable injury. An injury is compensable for exclusivity purposes if two conditions exist. First, the statutory conditions of compensation must concur. (See \u00a7 3600, subd. (a).) For example, if the injury arises \u201cout of and in the course of the employment, the exclusive remedy provisions apply notwithstanding that the injury resulted from . . . intentional conduct . . . even though the . . . conduct might be characterized as egregious.\u201d <em>(Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Second, the injury must cause a \u201cdisability or the need for medical treatment.\u201d <em>(Gomez </em>v. <em>Acquistapace </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 740, 748 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 821] <em>(Gomez).) </em>\u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 includes any injury or disease . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 3208.) Therefore, \u201cthe exclusive remedy provisions apply <em>only </em>in cases of such industrial personal injury or death,\u201d and the workers\u2019 compensation system subsumes all statutory and tort remedies otherwise available for such injuries. <em>(Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Where the alleged injury is neither collateral to nor derivative of an injury that satisfies both of these conditions, then it is not subject to exclusivity. (See <em>Snyder, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 997.) Thus, a cause of action predicated on an injury where \u201cthe basic conditions of compensation\u201d are absent is not preempted. <em>(Livitsanos, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 754.) For example, courts have allowed tort claims in cases where the alleged injury\u2014the aggravation of an existing workplace injury\u2014did not occur in the course of an employment relationship. (See, e.g., <em>Weinstein v. St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1235-1236 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 461] [allowing a medical malpractice claim against the employer because the resulting aggravation of the workplace injury did not arise out of the employment relationship].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Causes of action seeking to recover \u201c[e]conomic or contract damages incurred <em>independent </em>of any\u201d workplace injury are also exempt from workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. <em>(Pichon v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 488, 501 [260 Cal.Rptr. 677], italics added <em>(Pichon).) </em>Indeed, only injuries \u201cto the worker\u2019s <em>person, </em>as opposed to his <em>property,\u201d </em>are compensable. <em>(Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1273, 1287 [286 Cal.Rptr. 855] <em>(Coca-Cola).) </em>Thus, courts have refused to bar spoliation <em>of </em>evidence or fraud claims where the alleged injury\u2014the loss of a prospective lawsuit against a third party\u2014was not collateral to or derivative of an injury to the worker\u2019s person. (See <em>Gomez, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at pp. 749-750 [spoliation of evidence]; <em>Coca-Cola, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1288-1289 [same]; <em>Ramey v. General Petroleum Corp. </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 386, 400-401 [343 P.2d 787] [fraud]; but see <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 156, 162 [235 Cal.Rptr. 260].) Courts have also allowed an employee to recover economic damages on a wrongful termination claim because the damages arose out of the act of termination\u2014and not out of an injury to the employee\u2019s person. (See. <em>Pichon, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at pp. 500-501.) Finally, courts have exempted defamation claims from exclusivity because an injury to reputation does not depend on a personal injury. (See <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Balma </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 899, 904 [192 Cal.Rptr. 286].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">On the other hand, courts have regularly barred claims where the alleged injury is collateral to or derivative of a compensable workplace injury. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>example, courts have barred employees from suing for psychic injuries caused by their termination (see <em>Semore v. Pool </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1087, 1104-1105 [266 Cal.Rptr. 280]), or their employer\u2019s abusive conduct during the termination process (see <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Trans Video Corp. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 196, 199-201, 206 [155 Cal.Rptr. 486]).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Courts have also consistently held that injuries arising out of and in the course of the workers\u2019 compensation claims process fall within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions because this process is tethered to a compensable injury. Indeed, every employee who suffers a workplace injury must go through the claims process in order to recover compensation. Thus, we have barred all claims based on \u201cdisputes over the delay or discontinuance of [workers\u2019 compensation] benefits\u201d <em>(Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 7), including those claims seeking to recover economic or contractual damages caused by the mishandling of a workers\u2019 compensation claim (see <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Western Employers Ins. Co. </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 165, 168-169, 172 [245 Cal.Rptr. 820] <em>(Stoddard) </em>[barring claims where the employee alleged economic damages due to delays in benefit payments]; <em>Mottola </em>v. <em>R.L. Kautz &amp; Co. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 98, 109 [244 Cal.Rptr. 737] <em>(Mottola) </em>[barring a breach of contract claim based on the refusal to pay benefits]). Likewise, claims seeking compensation for services rendered to an employee in connection with his or her workers\u2019 compensation claim fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the WCAB. (See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Samaritan Medical Clinic, Inc. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 486, 490 [131 Cal.Rptr. 582] [physician may not sue to recover fees for services rendered to an injured employee]; <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. v. Small Claims Court </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 643, 647 [111 Cal.Rptr. 6] [physician may not sue to recover fees for testimony at a WCAB hearing].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">In this case, plaintiffs seek to recover the economic damage to their businesses resulting from the failure to receive full and timely payment on their lien claims before the WCAB. These damages arise out of the alleged mishandling of plaintiffs\u2019 lien claims. Plaintiffs concede that their underlying lien claims sought to recover compensation for medical services provided to workers injured in the course of their employment. Thus, the alleged injury underlying all of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action is collateral to or derivative of a compensable workplace injury and falls within the scope of the exclusivity provisions. (See <em>Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 7-8; <em>Stoddard, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at pp. 168-169, 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 narrow interpretation of the exclusive remedy provisions. The mere fact that plaintiffs are medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>providers, and not employees, does not preclude the application of these provisions. The rights of lien claimants \u201cderive from\u201d the rights of injured employees. <em>(Fox </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1204 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 252].) Therefore, plaintiffs stand in the place of the employees with respect to claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and plaintiffs\u2019 rights cannot exceed employees\u2019 rights. Because employees are limited to WCA remedies for <em>all </em>injuries caused by wrongful delays or refusals to pay (see, e.g., <em>Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 7-8; <em>Stoddard, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 172; <em>Mottola, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 109), plaintiffs are limited to the same. Indeed, we established long ago that the WCAB \u201chas exclusive jurisdiction over <em>all </em>claims for compensation against an employer or insurance carrier involving medical, surgical and hospital treatment to injured employees . . . .\u201d <em>(Independence Indemnity, supra, </em>2 Cal.2d at p. 406, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 decision to forgo recovery on their individual lien claims and to seek only economic damages also does not insulate their claims from the exclusivity provisions. Unlike the economic damages alleged in <em>Coca-Cola, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pages 1288-1289, and <em>Pich\u00f3n, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at, pages 500-501, the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 businesses was proximately caused by the alleged mishandling of lien claims before the WCAB. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury was not \u201cindependent\u201d of a compensable injury. <em>(Pichon, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 501.) In any event, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed distinction is meaningless. Every time an insurer fails to timely pay a valid lien claim, the aggrieved medical provider suffers economic damages. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action do not fall outside the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions by virtue of the remedy- they seek. (See <em>Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 7-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">A contrary result would create a huge loophole in the workers\u2019 compensation system and eviscerate the compensation bargain. Employees often suffer economic damages when they suffer workplace injuries or fail to receive prompt payment of their medical bills. Under plaintiffs\u2019 logic, these employees could circumvent the workers\u2019 compensation system by asserting claims for economic damages even though their claims derive from their workplace injuries. This circumvention of the system, if allowed, would destroy the careful balancing of employee-employer rights created by the WCA and effectively breach the compensation bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Finally, our recent decision in <em>City of Moorpark </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1143 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 959 P.2d 752] <em>(City of Moorpark) </em>is inapposite. In <em>City of Moorpark, </em>an employee alleged that her employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>terminated her because of her physical disability and asserted, among other things, violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.), and wrongful termination in violation of public policy <em>(Tameny </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 167, 178 [164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 9 A.L.R.4th 314]) <em>(Tameny </em>claim). The employer demurred, contending that section 132a was the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy. The trial court overruled the demurrer. The Court of Appeal denied the employer\u2019s petition for writ of mandate, and we affirmed. <em>(City of Moorpark, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 1149, 1161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In concluding that FEHA and <em>Tameny </em>claims fall outside the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions, we observed that \u201cthe existence of a workers\u2019 compensation remedy does not by itself establish that the remedy is exclusive.\u201d <em>(City of Moorpark, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1154.) Only remedies found in division 4 of the Labor Code are exclusive. Because section 132a is located in division 1, we concluded it does not provide the exclusive remedy for disability discrimination. <em>(City of Moorpark, </em>at pp. 1154-1155.) We also held that section 5300 only makes the WCAB \u201cthe exclusive <em>forum </em>for pursuing a section 132a claim\u201d and \u201cdoes not establish that the section 132a claim is the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy.\u201d <em>(City of Moorpark, </em>at pp. 1155-1156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Here, unlike section 132a, the provisions that create the remedies for the mishandling of workers\u2019 compensation claims\u2014sections 4603.2, 4622 and 5814\u2014are located in division 4. These remedies are therefore exclusive. (See <em>City of Moorpark, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 1154-1155.) Sections 4603.2 and 4622 give medical providers their sole remedy for delayed payment and impose a 10 percent penalty plus interest if the employer fails to pay their medical bills within 60 days under certain conditions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See <em>American Psychometric Consultants, supra, 36 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1640, fn. omitted [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Legislature enacted sections 4603.2 and 4622 in order \u201cto ensure that the bills of medical providers were promptly paid, and that protests or objections to the bills were promptly raised and adjudicated\u201d].) Section 5814 then provides the exclusive remedy for employees \u201c[w]hen [the] payment of compensation has been <em>unreasonably delayed or refused\u2019 </em>and states that \u201cthe full amount of the [WCAB] order, decision or award shall be increased by 10 percent . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Section 5300 further states that the WCAB is the exclusive forum for resolving disputes relating to the remedies provided in division 4. Consequently, \u201cthe workers\u2019 compensation system encompasses <em>all </em>disputes over coverage and payment.\u201d <em>(Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 8, italics added; see also <em>Schlick </em>v. <em>Comeo Management, Inc. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 974, 981 [242 Cal.Rptr. 241] <em>(Schlick) </em>[\u201cWhere compensation is available under [division 4 of] the act for the alleged misconduct, . . .the [WCAB] has exclusive jurisdiction\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The existence of a penalty provision covering defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct does not alter our analysis. Section 129.5, found in division 1, does not create a remedy against workers\u2019 compensation insurers. Instead, it gives the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation (DWC) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the power to impose an \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201ccivil penalty\u201d on insurers who unreasonably delay or refuse payment of compensation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Potential penalties include \u201ca civil penalty, not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)), and revocation of an insurer\u2019s \u201ccertificate of authority.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d)(4).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The director may impose these penalties in addition to any other remedy available under the WCA, including the penalties provided by sections 4603.2, 4622, and 5814. Thus, section 129.5 does not affect the exclusivity of remedies in division 4. Indeed, the Legislature\u2019s enactment of a penalty provision\u2014as opposed to a remedy provision\u2014equally suggests an intent to have the DWC, rather than private litigants, address the type of insurer misconduct alleged here. Accordingly, the alleged injury underlying plaintiffs\u2019 claims falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">B. <em>The Alleged Acts and Motives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Even if the exclusivity provisions cover the alleged injury, plaintiffs may still pursue their causes of action if they fit within the \u201cnarrow exception to the WCAB\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d established in <em>Unruh, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pages 629-631. <em>(Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 6.) (5) This exception focuses on the alleged acts or motives that establish the elements of the cause of action and considers whether these acts or motives constitute \u201ca risk reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>encompassed within the compensation bargain.\u201d <em>(Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16.) If they do, then the exclusive remedy provisions govern and bar the cause of action. If they do not, then the exclusive remedy provisions are inapplicable because the malfeasor is <em>no longer </em>acting as an \u201cemployer,\u201d as understood in these provisions. (\u00a7\u00a7 3600, 3602, 3850.) Here, plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims do not fall within this exception, but their Cartwright Act and RICO claims do. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 tortious interference and UCL claims escape preemption to the extent they are predicated on the conspiratorial acts of defendants\u2014and not on the individual misdeeds of each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Since <em>Unruh, </em>courts have struggled to define the contours of this exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. Throughout the years, we have identified various circumstances where the exception precludes application of the exclusive remedy provisions. For example, we have held that conduct \u201chaving a \u2018questionable\u2019 relationship to the employment\u201d is not protected by the exclusivity rule. <em>(Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 161; see also <em>Magliulo v. Superior Court </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 760, 779 [121 Cal.Rptr. 621] <em>(Magliulo).) </em>We have also stated that conduct going \u201cbeyond the normal role of an insurer in a compensation scheme intended to protect the worker\u201d is exempt from exclusivity. <em>(Unruh, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 630; see also <em>Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 11 [only conduct \u201cso extreme and outrageous that\u201d the defendant \u201cin effect stepped out of its role as\u201d an insurer precludes the application of workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Despite these vague pronouncements, several guiding principles are clear. When determining whether the exception applies to a cause of action, courts first determine whether the alleged acts that give rise to that cause of action are \u201cof the kind that [are] within the compensation bargain.\u201d <em>(Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 718.) In making this determination, courts may consider only those acts that relate to an element of the cause of action. Where these acts are \u201ca normal part of the employment relationship\u201d <em>(Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 160) or the workers\u2019 compensation claims process (see <em>Mitchell v. Scott Wetzel Services, Inc. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1474, 1480-1481 [278 Cal.Rptr. 474] <em>(Mitchell)), </em>the cause of action is subject to exclusivity. Otherwise, it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">For this initial determination, courts consider only the acts themselves\u2014 and not the motive behind the acts. (See <em>Fermino, supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 722-723.) In the exclusivity context, motive refers to the purpose or reason behind the acts and <em>not </em>the intentional or negligent nature of these acts. (See <em>ibid.) </em>Thus, courts should disregard any alleged intent beyond the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>do the acts that establish the elements of the cause of action when determining whether these acts are encompassed within the compensation bargain. Such a focus is necessary in order to preserve the compensation bargain. Indeed, permitting civil claims based on conduct that \u201cappeared on its face to be a normal part of the employment relationship [or claims process] . . . merely because the mental state . . . rendered the conduct intentionally or knowingly tortious\u201d undermines the premise behind the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 713.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Thus, typical employer actions \u201csuch as demotions, promotions, criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances\u201d do not, by themselves, exempt a cause of action from exclusivity. <em>(Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 160.) Similarly, termination, a known risk of any employment relationship, does not, by itself, insulate a cause of action from the exclusive remedy provisions. (See <em>Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 20.) \u201c[Reasonable attempts to investigate employee theft, including employee interrogation, are [also] a normal part of the employment relationship\u201d and cannot give rise to a court action against the employer. <em>(Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 717.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Insurer activity intrinsic to the workers\u2019 compensation claims process is also a risk contemplated by the compensation bargain. Thus, insurer actions \u201cclosely connected to the payment of benefits\u201d fall within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions. <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 1481.) For example, a claims investigation, by itself, does not exempt a cause of action from exclusivity. (See <em>Unruh, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 628-629; <em>Teague v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1148, 1153 [214 Cal.Rptr. 773] <em>(Teague).) </em>Because denying or objecting to claims for benefits is also a normal part of the claims process, misconduct stemming from the delay or \u201cdiscontinuance of payments ... is properly addressed by the WCAB.\u201d <em>(Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 11.) Indeed, California courts have invariably barred statutory and tort claims alleging that an insurer unreasonably avoided or delayed payment of benefits even though the insurer committed fraud and other misdeeds in the course of doing so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Of course, an employer or insurer may not use the exclusive remedy provisions as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card by characterizing its acts as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>normal employer or insurer activity. \u201cWhat matters ... is not the label that might be affixed to the . . . conduct. . . .\u201d <em>(Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 718.) Rather, the critical issue is whether the alleged acts, bereft of their motivation, \u201ccan ever be viewed as a normal aspect of the employer relationship\u201d or claims process. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where the tortious act is not closely connected to a normal employer or insurer action, it is not subject to exclusivity. (See <em>Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 10 [\u201cOnly when the entity commits tortious acts independent of its role as a provider of workers\u2019 compensation benefits may an employee maintain a private cause of action under Unruh\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Thus, courts have permitted fraud claims against an employer when the employer conceals the existence of an employee\u2019s workplace injury because such concealments cannot be linked to a normal employer action. (See <em>Johns-Manville, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 477.) Involuntary confinement is not closely connected to a typical employment action even when committed in the course of an investigation of employee theft. Therefore, a claim of false imprisonment, by definition, falls \u201coutside the scope of the compensation bargain.\u201d <em>(Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 723.) Indeed, violent and coercive criminal conduct committed against an employee\u2019s person is <em>always </em>illegal regardless of the employer\u2019s state of mind and is <em>never </em>subject to the exclusive remedy provisions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 723, fn. 7; see also <em>Iverson v. Atlas Pacific Engineering </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 219, 227-228 [191 Cal.Rptr. 696] [physical assault and false imprisonment]; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Graphic Arts International Union </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 176, 178-179 [151 Cal.Rptr. 597] [assault and battery, false imprisonment, and rape]; <em>Magliulo, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d at pp. 763, 779 [assault and battery].)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">With respect to insurers, courts have permitted fraud claims when the insurer denies the existence of a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy, because such denials are not a normal part of the claims process. (See <em>Jablonski v. Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 379, 391 [251 Cal.Rptr. 160].) Trespassing is also an atypical insurer activity even when committed in the course of a claims investigation. Therefore, it falls outside the compensation bargain. (See <em>Teague, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 1153.) Finally, assault and the formation of a romantic relationship with an injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>employee are not closely connected to the claims process and are exempt from exclusivity. (See <em>Unruh, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 627-628, 630-631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In addition to the acts themselves, the motive element of a cause of action may insulate that cause of action from the purview of the exclusive remedy provisions. This exception to exclusivity, however, is quite limited. \u201c[A]ny inquiry into an employer\u2019s motivation is undertaken not to determine whether the employer intentionally or knowingly injured the employee, but rather to ascertain whether the employer\u2019s conduct violated public policy and therefore fell outside the compensation bargain.\u201d <em>(Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pp. 714-715.) In other words, the motive element of a cause of action excepts that cause of action from exclusivity <em>only if </em>it violates a fundamental public policy of this state. (See <em>Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1100.) Thus, we have refused to bar both statutory and tort claims where their motive element violates such a policy. (See, e.g., <em>City of Moorpark, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 1155, 1161 [FEHA claim]; <em>Gantt, </em>at p. 1100 <em>[Tameny </em>claim]; <em>Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 22-23 [whistleblower claim under Gov. Code, former \u00a7 19683].)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">We now apply these principles to plaintiffs\u2019 specific claims and allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">1. <em>Abuse of process and fraud claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">After reviewing the acts and motives that give rise to plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims, we conclude these claims do not fit within the <em>Unruh </em>exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. Thus, they are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims, in essence, allege that each defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of delaying or denying payments in bad faith. For example, the abuse of process claims allege that defendants misused the claims process by making frivolous objections, filing sham petitions and documents with the WCAB, issuing unnecessary subpoenas, and improperly threatening to depose plaintiffs\u2019 physicians. Similarly, the fraud claim states that each individual defendant made false statements about and during its processing of plaintiffs\u2019 lien claims. All of these alleged acts are closely connected to a normal insurer activity\u2014the processing and payment of medical lien claims. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims are encompassed within the compensation bargain. (See <em>Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 9-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to shield these claims from preemption by including superfluous allegations unrelated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>elements of the cause of action. For example, plaintiffs claim defendants committed abuse of process by advising other insurers not to pay plaintiffs\u2019 claims, distributing hit lists of medical providers and conducting training sessions on how to delay or avoid payments on plaintiffs\u2019 claims. These acts do not, however, support an abuse of process claim because they do not involve the use of a procedure \u201cincident to litigation.\u201d <em>(Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 104, fn. 4 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817] <em>(Barquis).) </em>Consequently, they cannot shield plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process claims from the reach of the exclusive remedy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of defendants\u2019 acts of fraud as a \u201cscheme\u201d suffers from the same defect. Fraud does not require a scheme, and a scheme does not establish an element of a fraud claim. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1709.) Thus, the existence of a scheme cannot insulate plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim from preemption. In any event, the mere allegation of a conspiracy is not enough where, as here, the alleged acts in furtherance of the conspiracy\u2014i.e., the fraudulent statements\u2014are closely connected to claims processing, a normal insurer activity. (See <em>Hazelwerdt v. Industrial Indent. Exchange </em>(1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 759, 763 [321 P.2d 831] <em>(Hazelwerdt).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The fact that the misdeeds alleged in the abuse of process and fraud claims may constitute crimes under Insurance Code sections 1871 and 1871.4 does not alter our conclusion. Unlike \u201cthose classes of intentional . . . crimes against the employee\u2019s person by means of violence and coercion, such as those crimes numerated in part 1, title 8 of the Penal Code,\u201d regulatory crimes like the ones cited by plaintiffs do not \u201cviolate the employee\u2019s reasonable expectations and transgress the limits of the compensation bargain.\u201d (Fe<em>rmino, supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th at p. 723, fn. 7; see also <em>Up-Right, Inc. </em>v. <em>Van Erickson </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 579, 582-584 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 34] <em>(Up-Right) </em>[criminal violations of child labor laws do not support an exception to exclusivity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Finally, neither abuse of process nor fraud contains a motive element that violates a fundamental public policy. Abuse of process claims merely require malice, which \u201cmay be inferred from the wilful abuse of the process.\u201d <em>(Tranchina </em>v. <em>Arcinas </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 522, 526 [178 P.2d 65].) This malice element does not violate a fundamental public policy. Meanwhile, fraud requires only an \u201cintent to induce\u201d another \u201cto alter his position to his injury or risk\u201d and not an intent that violates a public policy rooted in a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1709.) Because the acts and motives underlying plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims fall within the risks contemplated by the compensation bargain, these claims are barred. (See <em>Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>2. <em>Cartwright Act claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Although we find plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims barred on exclusivity grounds, we reach a contrary conclusion as to their Cartwright Act claim. Because the wrongful acts and motives that give rise to plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim fall outside the compensation bargain, it is not subject to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">We begin with the alleged acts that give rise to plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim. The Cartwright Act \u201cmakes unlawful any \u2018trust.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 93, 118 [81 Cal.Rptr. 592, 460 P.2d 464] <em>(Jones); </em>Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16726.) To establish that defendants comprised a trust, plaintiffs allege that defendants combined their \u201ccapital, skill and acts\u201d in order to drive them \u201cout of business.\u201d As part of this combination, each defendant not only mishandled lien claims filed against it, but also; (1) encouraged other insurers to deny plaintiffs\u2019 claims; (2) distributed hit lists of medical providers; and (3) exchanged strategies for delaying or avoiding payments to plaintiffs. This concerted effort by insurers to interject themselves into lien claims <em>they did not insure </em>is <em>not </em>a normal part of the claims process. Indeed, only the insurer that has insured a claimant\u2019s employer\u2014and no other insurer\u2014is typically involved in that claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. By conspiring to influence the processing of claims it did not insure, each defendant stepped outside its proper role as an insurer and became \u201ca \u2018person other than the employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Unruh, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 630.) In doing so, each defendant stripped itself of the protection afforded by the exclusive remedy provisions of the WCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The motive element of a Cartwright Act claim also makes the exclusivity bar inapplicable. A \u201ccause of action for restraint of trade under the Cartwright Act. . . must allege ... a purpose to restrain trade.\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 119; see also Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16726.) By imposing such a requirement, \u201c[t]he Cartwright Act merely articulates in greater detail a public policy against restraint of trade that has long been recognized at common law.\u201d <em>(Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 34, 44 [172 P.2d 867] <em>(Speegle).) </em>Because a Cartwright Act claim requires a motive that violates a fundamental public policy rooted in a statutory provision, it is not reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\"><em>Hazelwerdt </em>does not compel a contrary result. In <em>Hazelwerdt, </em>the plaintiff alleged that an insurer and a physician employed by that insurer to treat the plaintiff conspired to mishandle the plaintiff\u2019s medical treatment. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>of Appeal barred the plaintiff\u2019s civil conspiracy claim because the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were closely connected to a normal insurer activity\u2014the provision of medical treatment for a workplace injury. (See <em>Hazelwerdt, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.2d at p. 763.) Unlike the conspiracy claim in <em>Hazelwerdt, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim alleges that each defendant conspired with parties that had <em>no </em>role in the handling of that defendant\u2019s claims and sought to influence lien claims filed against <em>other unrelated </em>insurers. Thus, defendants\u2019 conspiratorial acts cannot be linked to a normal insurer action during the claims process. (See <em>Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 718.) Moreover, a Cartwright Act claim, unlike a civil conspiracy claim, requires a motive that violates a fundamental public policy. (Compare <em>Speegle, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d at p. 44, with <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Security Pacific Nat. Bank </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1019 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 174].) Accordingly, <em>Hazelwerdt </em>is inapposite, and we decline to bar plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim on exclusivity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">3. <em>RICO claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">We reach a similar conclusion with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claims. The pattern of racketeering activity necessary to establish a RICO enterprise always falls outside the scope of the compensation bargain. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claims are exempt from the exclusivity bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that defendants violated and conspired to violate 18 United States Code section 1962(c). A violation of 18 United States Code section 1962(c) requires \u201c(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>(Sedima, S.P.R.L. </em>v. <em>Imrex Co., Inc. </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 479, 496 [105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346], fn. omitted.) To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, plaintiffs must allege at least two predicate acts that \u201c \u2018are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics\u2019 \u201d <em>(H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co </em>(1989) 492 U.S. 229, 240 [109 S.Ct. 2893, 2901, 106 L.Ed.2d 195] <em>(H.J. Inc.)) </em>and \u201camount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 239 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2900].) \u201c[T]he threat of continuity is sufficiently established where the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating as part of a long-term association that exists for criminal purposes\u201d or \u201cwhere it is shown that the predicates are a regular way of conducting defendant\u2019s ongoing legitimate business ... or of conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO \u2018enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 242-243 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2902], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Here, plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claims allege that defendants conducted or conspired to conduct various enterprises through numerous acts of mail and wire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>fraud. Because these predicate acts of mail and wire fraud allegedly form a pattern of racketeering activity, they, by definition, cannot be closely connected to a normal insurer activity. The compensation bargain anticipates that an insurer may commit various misdeeds during the claims process, including some criminal acts. (See <em>Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 723, fn. 7; <em>Vuillemainroy v. American Rock &amp; Asphalt, Inc. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1280, 1286-1287 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 269] [involuntary manslaughter does not support an exception to exclusivity]; <em>Up-Right, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 582-584.) It does not contemplate that an insurer will engage in systematic and long-term criminal activities bound by common \u201c \u2018purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(H.J. Inc., supra, </em>492 U.S. 229, 240 [109 S.Ct. 2893, 2901], quoting 18 U.S.C. former \u00a7 3575(e).) Indeed, such organized and systemic criminal misconduct is <em>always </em>illegal, regardless of the employer\u2019s state of mind. (See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962.) Accordingly, RICO claims are never subject to the exclusive remedy provisions, and we refuse to bar them here. (See <em>Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 723, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">4. <em>Tortious interference and UCL claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">We now turn to plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims\u2014tortious interference with business relations and violations of the UCL. These claims encompass a wide range of misconduct due, in part, to the breadth of these causes of action and some haziness in the pleadings. After reviewing the alleged misconduct, we conclude these claims are barred to the extent they focus on the individual misdeeds of each defendant. They, however, are not precluded to the extent they are predicated on the conspiratorial misconduct of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">As an initial matter, we note that neither tortious interference nor the UCL requires a motive that violates a fundamental public policy. Tortious interference claims encompass \u201cwrongful\u201d interferences and do not require an improper motive. <em>(Della Penna </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 376, 392-393 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 436, 902 P.2d 740] <em>(Della Penna).) </em>The UCL focuses solely on conduct and prohibits \u201c \u2018anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u2019\u201d <em>(Barquis, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 113, quoting Note, <em>Unlawful Agricultural Working Conditions as Nuisance or Unfair Competition </em>(1968) 19 Hastings L.J. 398, 408-409.) \u201cAs a result, to state a claim under the [UCL] one need not plead and prove the elements of a tort. Instead, one need only show that \u2018members of the public are likely to be deceived.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1267 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>833 P.2d 545], quoting <em>Chern v. Bank of America </em>(1976) 15 Cal. 3d 866, 876 [127 Cal.Rptr. 110, 544 P.2d 1310].) Thus, these claims only escape preemption if the underlying acts fall outside the scope of the compensation bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">An examination of the alleged acts underlying plaintiffs\u2019 tortious interference and UCL claims yields mixed results. These acts fit into two categories: (1) individual acts of a defendant that establish a pattern or practice of mishandling plaintiffs\u2019 lien claims; or (2) acts in furtherance of a conspiracy among defendants to mishandle plaintiffs\u2019 lien claims. As explained below, we find plaintiffs\u2019 tortious interference and UCL claims barred to the extent they are predicated on the first category of misconduct but permissible to the extent they are based on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The first category of misconduct covers the wrongful acts of each individual defendant during the claims process and is virtually identical to the misconduct alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and fraud claims. The mere fact that an individual insurer has a pattern or practice of bad faith delays or denials of payment is not enough to insulate a cause of action from preemption where, as here, each wrongful act is closely connected to a normal insurer activity\u2014the processing of medical lien claims. Indeed, such misconduct is indistinguishable from the insurer misconduct alleged in the claims barred by <em>Marsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pages 9-11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">In contrast, the second category involves far more than the pattern or practice of an individual insurer. This misconduct consists of a conspiracy among multiple insurers to coordinate the economic destruction of plaintiffs through the mishandling of their lien claims. By joining this conspiracy, each individual defendant necessarily became involved in claims <em>it did not insure. </em>Thus, the second category of misconduct is almost identical to the misconduct underlying plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim and cannot be connected to a normal insurer activity. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 tortious interference and UCL claims are not barred to the extent they are predicated on defendants\u2019 conspiratorial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">In closing, we stress that our decision today merely holds that some of plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the WCA. We make <em>no </em>judgment as to the viability of these claims, and defendants are free to challenge them on any other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">George, C. J., Mosk, J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b875-8\">WERDEGAR, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AvG\">I agree with the disposition and much of the reasoning of the majority opinion. I write separately only to distance myself from the suggestion that <em>Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680] created a free-floating exception to the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3600, 3602) applicable whenever a court determines that the motive behind an employer\u2019s tortious acts violates a fundamental public policy. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 810, 812, 823.) To interpret <em>Gantt </em>this way is to elevate its broad rhetoric to positive law. Properly and narrowly read, <em>Gantt </em>does not purport to create such an exception. Instead, the case holds simply that an employer that interfered with an official investigation of sexual harassment, by firing an employee who spoke with investigators of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, thereby committed \u201cmisconduct [that] cannot under any reasonable viewpoint be considered a \u2018normal part of the employment relationship\u2019 <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>[(1987)] 43 Cal.3d [148,] 160 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743]) or a \u2018risk reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain.\u2019 <em>(Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Myers </em>[(1990)] 52 Cal.3d [1,] 16 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054, 20 A.L.R.5th 1016].)\u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance, </em>at p. 1100.) In other words, the gravamen of the <em>Gantt </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim was not an interest protected by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. \u201c[T]he fundamental basis of workers\u2019 compensation is an injury sustained in and arising out of the course of employment when the injury is \u2018personal physical [or emotional] injury or death.\u2019 <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., </em>[at p.] 160.) Conversely, the exclusive remedy provisions apply <em>only </em>in cases of such industrial personal injury or death.\u201d <em>(Shoemaker v. Myers, </em>at p. 16, italics in original.) When a lawsuit does not implicate the employee\u2019s interest in recovering for such injuries, the act simply has nothing to say. The same is true here. No one can seriously argue the Legislature intended the act to protect health care providers against combinations in restraint of trade. Because the act and its exclusivity provisions do not apply, we need not speak of exceptions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Plaintiffs request judicial notice of a verified complaint filed by one of the defendants in an unrelated case.
