Plaintiff John Guz, a longtime employee of Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI), was released at age 49 when his work unit was eliminated and its tasks were transferred to another Bechtel office. Guz sued BNI and its parent, Bechtel Corporation (hereinafter collectively Bechtel), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>alleging age discrimination, breach of an implied contract to be terminated only for good cause, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The trial court granted Bechtel\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. In a split decision, the Court of Appeal reversed. The majority found that Bechtel had demonstrated no. grounds to foreclose a trial on any of the claims asserted in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Having closely reviewed the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reach the following conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">First, the Court of Appeal used erroneous grounds to reverse summary judgment on Guz\u2019s implied contract cause of action. The Court of Appeal found triable evidence (1) that Guz had an actual agreement, implied in fact, to be discharged only for good cause, and (2) that the elimination of Guz\u2019s work unit lacked good cause because Bechtel\u2019s stated reason\u2014a \u201cdownturn in.'. . workload\u201d\u2014was not justified by the facts, and was, in truth, a pretext to discharge the unit\u2019s workers for poor performance without following the company\u2019s \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d policy. We acknowledge a triable issue that Guz, like other Bechtel workers, had implied contractual rights under specific provisions of Bechtel\u2019s written personnel policies. But neither the policies, nor other evidence, suggests any contractual restriction on Bechtel\u2019s right to eliminate a work unit as it saw fit, even where dissatisfaction with unit performance was a factor in the decision. The Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling on Guz\u2019s implied contract claim must therefore be reversed. The Court of Appeal did not reach the additional ground on which Guz claims a contractual breach\u2014i.e., that Bechtel failed to follow its fair layoff policies when, during and after the reorganization, it made individual personnel decisions leading to Guz\u2019s release. Accordingly, we leave that issue to the Court of Appeal on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Second, the Court of Appeal erred in restoring Guz\u2019s separate cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Here Guz claims that even if his employment included no express or implied-in-fact agreement limiting Bechtel\u2019s right to discharge him, and was thus \u201cat will\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 2922), the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied by law in every contract, precluded Bechtel from terminating him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>arbitrarily, as by failing to follow its own policies, or in bad faith. But while the implied covenant requires mutual fairness in applying a contract\u2019s actual terms, it cannot substantively <em>alter </em>those terms. If an employment is at will, and thus allows either party to terminate for <em>any or no reason, </em>the implied covenant cannot decree otherwise. Moreover, although any breach of the actual terms of an employment contract also violates the implied covenant, the measure of damages for such a breach remains solely contractual. Hence, where breach of an actual term is alleged, a separate implied covenant claim, based on the same breach, is superfluous. On the other hand, where an implied covenant claim alleges a breach of obligations beyond the agreement\u2019s actual terms, it is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Finally, we disagree with the Court of Appeal that Guz\u2019s claim of prohibited age discrimination has triable merit. Bechtel presented evidence, largely undisputed, that the reasons for its personnel decisions leading to Guz\u2019s release had nothing to do with his age. In the face of this showing, evidence cited by Guz that certain workers preferred over him were substantially younger is insufficient to permit a rational inference that age played any significant role in his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and will remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">In October 1994, Guz sued Bechtel, challenging the June 1993 termination of his Bechtel employment. The complaint alleged causes of action for breach of an implied employment contract (see <em>Foley v. Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373] <em>(Foley)), </em>breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and age discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA; Gov. Code, \u00a7 12941).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">After extensive discovery, Bechtel filed a motion for summary judgment in August 1995. The motion, and Guz\u2019s opposition thereto, attached numerous supporting documents, including declarations and deposition excerpts. On the basis of these submissions, the following facts appear to be essentially undisputed:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">In 1971, Bechtel hired Guz as an administrative assistant at a salary of $750 per month. Throughout his Bechtel career, Guz worked in \u201cmanagement information,\u201d performing, at various times, duties on both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201cawarded\u201d and \u201coverhead\u201d sides of this specialty. He received steady raises and promotions. His performance reviews were generally favorable, though his March 1992 evaluation indicated he needed to follow through on ideas and should become \u201cfully computer literate in order to improve his long-term job success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">BNI, a division of Bechtel Corporation, is an engineering, construction, and environmental remediation company that focuses on federal government programs, principally for the Departments of Energy and Defense. Prior to 1993, BNI had its own in-house management information unit, the BNI Management Information Group (BNI-MI). BNI-MI itself represented a 1986 consolidation of two Bechtel management information units, which resulted in the work of these groups being done by fewer people. Between 1986 and 1991, BNI-MI\u2019s size was further reduced from 13 to six persons, and its costs were reduced from $748,000 in 1986 to $400,000 in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Guz had worked for BNI-MI since 1986. In 1992, at age 49, he was employed as a financial reports supervisor, responsible for supervising BNI-MI\u2019s overhead section, which included himself and 44-year-old Dee Minoia. At salary grade 27, Guz earned $5,940 per month. BNI-MI\u2019s six-member staff also included its manager, Ronald Goldstein (age 50), Goldstein\u2019s secretary Pam Fung (age 45), Robert Wraith (age 41), and Christine Siu (age 34). Guz\u2019s immediate superior was his longtime friend and colleague Goldstein. Goldstein, in turn, reported to Edward Dewey, BNI\u2019s manager of government services.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">During this time, Bechtel maintained Personnel Policy 1101, dated June 1991, on the subject of termination of employment (Policy 1101). Policy 1101 stated that \u201cBechtel employees have no employment agreements guaranteeing continuous service and may resign at their option or be terminated at the option of Bechtel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Policy 1101 also described several \u201cCategories of Termination,\u201d including \u201cLayoff\u2019 and \u201cUnsatisfactory Performance.\u201d With respect to Unsatisfactory Performance, the policy stated that \u201c[ejmployees who fail to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner may be terminated, provided the employees have been advised of the specific shortcomings and given an opportunity to improve their performance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A layoff was defined as \u201ca Bechtel-initiated termination!] of employees caused by a reduction in workload, reorganizations, changes in job requirements, or other circumstances . . . .\u201d Under the Layoff policy, employees subject to termination for this reason \u201cmay be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>placed on \u2018holding status\u2019 if there is a possible Bechtel assignment within the following 3-month period.\u201d Guz understood that Policy 1101 applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In January 1992, Robert Johnstone became president of BNI. While previously running another Bechtel entity, Johnstone had received management information services from the San Francisco Regional Office Management Information Group (SFRO-MI) headed by James Tevis. BNI-MI and SFRO-MI performed similar functions, and John Shaeffer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a veteran Bechtel employee who was several months older than Guz, had overhead reporting duties for SFRO-MI that were similar to Guz\u2019s job within BNI-MI.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Johnstone soon became unhappy with the size, cost, and performance of BNI-MI. In April 1992, he advised Dewey, Goldstein, and Guz that BNI-MI\u2019s work could be done by three people. A May 1992 memo from Dewey to Goldstein warned that Dewey and Johnstone had agreed BNI-MI\u2019s 1992 overhead budget of $365,000 was a \u201cmaximum <em>not </em>to be exceeded\u201d and was \u201csubject to further analysis and review, since the real guideline was far below this level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Between April and October 1992, Guz and Goldstein discussed how to reduce BNI-MI\u2019s work force. In September 1992, Dee Minoia was told to look for another job. In October 1992, on Dewey\u2019s recommendation, Gold-stein advised Guz to seek another Bechtel position, citing BNI-MI\u2019s reduced budget as the \u201cbiggest factor.\u201d By that time, as Guz knew, BNI-MI\u2019s overhead costs for 1992 had already run well over its strict budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In preparation for his departure, Guz compiled a list of his job tasks, together with his suggestions about who should perform his work once the BNI-MI staff was reduced. Guz recommended that most of his duties go to Shaeffer in SFRO-MI, and that the small remaining portion of his work, involving the government\u2019s Defense Contract Audit Agency, be transferred to a unit headed by Ann Dersheimer, BNI\u2019s 46-year-old controller, which regularly performed government audit and contract work. In mid-November, Goldstein managed to persuade Dewey, at least temporarily, that Guz was necessary to BNI-MI\u2019s work. With Dewey\u2019s consent, Goldstein asked Guz to stay, and Guz accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Meanwhile, however, Dewey and Johnstone were discussing the possibility of involving SFRO-MI more actively in BNI\u2019s management information needs. In late November 1992, Goldstein received from Dewey, and discussed with Guz, a memo setting BNI-MI\u2019s target overhead budget for 1993 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>at $250,000. The memo again suggested staff reductions as a means of bringing the unit\u2019s overhead within the budget limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">About the same time, Johnstone asked Tevis to submit a proposal to provide BNI\u2019s management information services through SFRO-MI. In early December, Tevis submitted a proposed budget of $200,000, which Johnstone accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On December 9, 1992, Goldstein informed Guz that BNI-MI was being disbanded, that its work would be done by SFRO-MI, and that Guz was being laid off. Goldstein told Guz the reason he had been selected for layoff was to reduce costs. On December 11, 1992, Guz received a confirmatory letter from Dewey, which referred to \u201cthe downturn in our workload\u201d and placed Guz on holding status. In a December 17, 1992, memo to BNI managers, Johnstone announced the transfer of BNI-MI to SFRO-MI effective February 1, 1993. During the transition period, as he had earlier recommended, Guz transferred his overhead reporting work to Shaeffer and his government audit work to Dersheimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">As part of the transition plan, Tevis consulted with Goldstein \u201cabout the positions [Tevis] would need that [he] could cover in [his] group and that [he] couldn\u2019t cover.\u201d According to Tevis\u2019s uncontradicted deposition testimony, Goldstein recommended Wraith and Siu as the best additions to SFRO-MI\u2019s staff. The reasons, according to Tevis, were that Siu had necessary skills in Bechtel\u2019s ORS computer operating system and occupied a salary grade commensurate with the duties Tevis wished her to assume, and that Wraith \u201cknew the project side\u201d of management information. Guz\u2019s name came up in the discussion, but Tevis and Goldstein \u201cboth decided\u201d Shaeffer and another current SFRO-MI employee, Chris Gee, were sufficient to assume Guz\u2019s overhead work.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Wraith and Siu, the two youngest members of BNI-MI, were transferred to SFRO-MI, while all the remaining BNI-MI employees, including Guz, were laid off. Guz was placed on holding status pending possible reassignment to another Bechtel position.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">During early 1993, while Guz was on holding status, three other positions became available in SFRO-MI, partly because of that unit\u2019s expanded responsibilities for BNI. An existing SFRO-MI employee, 42-year-old John Wallace, was selected for a new SFRO-MI position as supervisor of SFROMI\u2019s work for BNI. <em>Wallace\u2019s </em>former SFRO-MI subordinate, 52-year-old Jan Vreim, was placed in Wallace\u2019s old job. The third position, vacated by the transfer of another SFRO-MI member, was filled by 38-year-old Barbara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Stenho, who also already worked for Bechtel but was a newcomer to SFRO-MI.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Tevis explained that Wallace was selected for his position because it required his computer skills, and because his supervisory and project experience suited him for the responsibility of working directly with BNI president Johnstone, who was project oriented. Vreim was also chosen for her ORS computer ability, her history of working with high-level managers, and her project experience. The SFRO-MI position taken by Stenho required a close working relationship with another Bechtel entity, Bechtel Civil, where Stenho had previously been employed. Stenho was placed in her new job at the specific request of Bechtel Civil\u2019s manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Though Guz insists he let it be known he wanted to stay at Bechtel, even at a reduced salary, he appears to concede he did not specifically apply for any of the SFRO-MI positions. Tevis never saw Guz\u2019s resume before filling them, and he admitted he never considered Guz for these jobs. Tevis variously indicated he did not realize Guz was available, thought Guz \u201conly did overhead,\u201d understood from Goldstein that Guz lacked computer skills, and did not know Guz had supervisory experience. Tevis also noted Guz did not have the Bechtel Civil relationship necessary for the Stenho position. After Tevis was asked, at his deposition, to examine Guz\u2019s resume, Tevis acknowledged it indicated Guz might have qualified for the positions taken by Wraith and Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Guz\u2019s original three-month holding status was renewed for an additional three months, but he obtained no other position within Bechtel. He was terminated on June 11, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Guz sought to furnish evidence that the cost reduction and workload downturn reasons given him for the elimination of BNI-MI, and his own consequent layoff, were arbitrary, false, and pretextual. To rebut the implication that a general business slowdown required BNI to lay off workers, Guz submitted an excerpt from Bechtel Corporation\u2019s 1992 Annual Report. There, Bechtel Corporation\u2019s president stated that the \u201cBechtel team had an exceptional year,\u201d and that the company as a whole had achieved healthy gains in both revenue from current projects and new work booked. In his own declaration, Goldstein stated that BNI-MI\u2019s 1992 and projected 1993 workload was high, that BNI-MI\u2019s work volume was not directly related to the overall job hours of BNI, and that because much of BNI-MI\u2019s overhead cost was recoverable under BNI\u2019s government contracts, the net savings from elimination of BNI-MI were only a small fraction of its budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Guz also submitted additional Bechtel documents discussing specific company personnel policies and practices, including those policies pertaining to laid-off employees. These documents included Bechtel\u2019s 1989 Reduction-in-Force Guidelines (RIF Guidelines) and Bechtel\u2019s Personnel Policy 302 (Policy 302).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Policy 302 described a system of employee ranking (sometimes hereafter called force ranking), which was to be \u201cused alone or in conjunction with other management tools in making personnel decisions in such areas as . . . [sjtaffing.\u201d Rankings were to be based on the fair, objective, and consistent evaluation of employees\u2019 comparative job-relevant skills and performance. However, Policy 302 also provided that \u201c[ujnique situations may occur in which employee ranking may be inapplicable based on the nature of the personnel decision or the limited size of the ranking group.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The RIF Guidelines specified that when choosing among employees to be retained and released during a reduction in force, the formal ranking system set forth in Policy 302 was to be employed. For this purpose, the RIF Guidelines said, employees should \u201c[ijdeally\u201d be ranked, by similarity of function or level of work activity, in groups of from 20 to 100. The parties disputed whether Bechtel actually used this force ranking system when eliminating entire units of fewer than 20 employees. Bechtel\u2019s manager of human resources declared that force ranking was inappropriate for small units, such as BNI-MI, whose employees had dissimilar duties, grades, and skills. However, both Guz and Goldstein declared their recollection that force ranking was an established Bechtel policy and was used in 1986 when two management information units, containing 13 employees, were consolidated into a six-member unit, BNI-MI.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The RIF Guidelines also explained the term \u201cholding status\u201d and its benefits. According to the RIF Guidelines, this status could be granted upon layoff, for a renewable three-month period, while the employee awaited possible reassignment. The employee would not receive salary, but Bechtel would maintain his medical, dental, voluntary personal accident, and term life insurance. Bechtel should also provide the employee with \u201c[tjransfer and [pjlacement [ajssistance.\u201d The \u201creleasing organization\u201d should determine if the employee was qualified for other vacant positions within the same unit, \u2022 and \u201copen requisitions\u201d (i.e., solicitation of outside applicants for available positions) should generally be cancelled during a reduction in force. \u201cEfforts should <em>[also] </em>be made to contact discipline counterparts in <em>other </em>Bechtel entities/services\u201d in hopes of placing the employee, and the employee should be considered for future positions. (Italics added.) In his deposition, BNI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>president Johnstone agreed that Bechtel\u2019s practice was to place an employee on holding status prior to termination, to attempt to reassign the employee during this period, and to \u201ccontinue to look for positions even after the employee has been laid off.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In their declarations, Goldstein and Guz insisted Guz was qualified for each of the several vacant positions in SFRO-MI, as well as for several other positions that became available within Bechtel. Addressing Tevis\u2019s specific qualms about Guz, Guz and Goldstein declared that Guz had supervisorial experience, and had worked on both the awarded and overhead sides of management information. Guz further stated that he had taken training for the ORS computer system, \u201chad more than adequate computer skills for [his] position,\u201d and was never told his computer skills were deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The trial court granted summary judgment. The court reasoned that \u201c[Guz] was an at-will employee and has not introduced any evidence that he was ever told at any time that he had permanent employment or that he would be retained as long as he was doing a good job. . . . [f] Plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. . . . Plaintiff is also unable to rebut [Bechtel\u2019s] legitimate business reason for his termination and/or his failure to obtain another position within Bechtel. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Over a vigorous dissent by Presiding Justice Anderson, the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Four, reversed. The majority, Justices Poch\u00e9 and Reardon, reasoned as follows: Under <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, Guz\u2019s longevity, promotions, raises, and favorable performance reviews, together with Bechtel\u2019s written progressive discipline policy and Bechtel officials\u2019 statements of company practices, raised a triable issue that Guz had an implied-in-fact contract to be dismissed only for good cause. There was evidence that Bechtel breached this term by eliminating BNI-MI, on the false ground that workload was declining, as a pretext to weed out poor performers without applying the company\u2019s progressive discipline procedures. As to Guz\u2019s age discrimination claim, Bechtel was required to advance a credible nondiscriminatory reason for Guz\u2019s termination, after which the burden shifted to Guz to produce evidence that the proffered reason was discriminatory or pretextual. As already noted, however, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>a downturn in workload was the real reason for Bechtel\u2019s action was in legitimate dispute. Hence, summary judgment on the age discrimination claim was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The dissent argued that the trial court properly dismissed all Guz\u2019s causes of action. It reasoned as follows: As to the contract claim, Policy 1101 expressly provided that Bechtel employment was at will. The progressive discipline policy did not apply to general reductions in force, and nothing in Bechtel\u2019s personnel policies otherwise limited its right to eliminate positions. Guz\u2019s mere successful longevity could not prove a contractual right to be terminated only for good cause. Moreover, there was no evidence the elimination of BNI-MI was pretextual, or that Bechtel violated the implied covenant of fair dealing by engaging in intentional, bad faith conduct to deprive Guz of the benefits of his employment. As to age discrimination, Bechtel gave legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for eliminating BNI-MI, and Guz presented no evidence these reasons were false, let alone excuses for intentional discrimination against Guz on the basis of his <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Discussion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">I. <em>Summary judgment rules.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">On appeal after a motion for summary judgment has been granted, we review the record de novo, considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained. <em>(Artiglio v.

For instance, as we have observed, \u201cthe employment relationship is fundamentally contractual.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, 47 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Cal.3d 654, 696.) Thus, though Labor Code section 2922 prevails where the employer and employee have reached no other understanding, it does not overcome their \u201cfundamental . . . freedom of contract\u201d to depart from at-will employment. (47 Cal.3d at p. 677.) The statute does not prevent the parties from <em>agreeing </em>to any limitation, otherwise lawful, on the employer\u2019s termination rights. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 677, 680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">One example of a contractual departure from at-will status is an agreement that the employee will be terminated only for \u201cgood cause\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 677) in the sense of \u201c \u2018 \u201ca fair and honest cause or reason, regulated by good faith . . .\u201d \u2019 [citation], as opposed to one that is \u2018trivial, capricious, unrelated to business needs or goals, or pretextual . . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Scott v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 454, 467 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 427, 904 P.2d 834] <em>(Scott); </em>see also <em>Cotran v. Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 93, 104-105 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 900, 948 P.2d 412]; <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>See\u2019s Candies, Inc. </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 311, 330 [171 Cal.Rptr. 917] <em>(Pugh).) </em>But the parties are free to define their relationship, including the terms on which it can be ended, as they wish. The parties may reach <em>any </em>contrary understanding, otherwise lawful, \u201cconcerning either the term of employment or the <em>grounds or manner </em>of termination.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 680, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Thus, the employer and employee may enter \u201c \u2018an agreement . . . that ... the employment relationship will continue indefinitely, pending the occurrence of <em>some event such as </em>the employer\u2019s dissatisfaction with the employee\u2019s services or the existence of some \u201ccause\u201d for termination.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 680, quoting <em>Pugh, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 311, 324-325, italics added.) Among the many available options, the parties may agree that the employer\u2019s termination rights will vary with the particular circumstances. The parties may define for themselves what cause or causes will permit an employee\u2019s termination and may specify the procedures under which termination shall occur. The agreement may restrict the employer\u2019s termination rights to a greater degree in some situations, while leaving the employer freer to act as it sees fit in others.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The contractual understanding need not be express, but may be <em>implied in fact, </em>arising from the parties\u2019 <em>conduct </em>evidencing their actual mutual intent to create such enforceable limitations. <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 680.) In <em>Foley, </em>we identified several factors, apart from express terms, that may bear upon \u201cthe existence <em>and content </em>of an . . . [implied-in-fact] agreement\u201d placing limits on the employer\u2019s right to discharge an employee. <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) These factors might include \u201c \u2018the personnel policies or practices of the employer, the employee\u2019s longevity of service, actions or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>communications by the employer reflecting assurances of continued employment, and the practices of the industry in which the employee is engaged.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Pugh, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 311, 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><em>Foley </em>asserted that \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d must be examined to determine whether the parties\u2019 conduct, considered in the context of surrounding circumstances, gave rise to an implied-in-fact contract limiting the employer\u2019s termination rights. <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 681.) We did not suggest, however, that every vague combination of <em>Foley </em>factors, shaken together in a bag, necessarily allows a finding that the employee had a right to be discharged only for good cause, as determined in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On the contrary, \u201ccourts seek to enforce the <em>actual </em>understanding\u201d of the parties to an employment agreement. <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 677, italics added.) Whether that understanding arises from express mutual words of agreement, or from the parties\u2019 conduct evidencing a similar meeting of minds, the exact terms to which the parties have assented deserve equally precise scrutiny. As <em>Foley </em>indicated, it is the \u201cnature of [an implied-in-fact] contract\u201d that must be determined from the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Every case thus turns on its own facts. Where there is no express agreement, the issue is whether other evidence of the parties\u2019 conduct has a \u201ctendency in reason\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210) to demonstrate the existence of an actual mutual understanding on <em>particular </em>terms and conditions of employment. If such evidence logically permits conflicting inferences, a question of fact is presented. <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 677.) But where the undisputed facts negate the existence or the breach of the contract claimed, summary judgment is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Guz alleges he had an agreement with Bechtel that he would be employed so long as he was performing satisfactorily and would be discharged only for good cause. Guz claims no express understanding to this effect. However, he asserts that such an agreement can be inferred by combining evidence of several <em>Foley </em>factors, including (1) his long service; (2) assurances of continued employment in the form of raises, promotions, and good performance reviews; (3) Bechtel\u2019s written personnel policies, which suggested that termination for poor performance would be preceded by progressive discipline, that layoffs during a work force reduction would be based on objective criteria, including formal ranking, and that persons laid off would receive placement and reassignment assistance; and (4) testimony by a Bechtel executive that company practice was to terminate employees for a good reason and to reassign, if possible, a laid-off employee who was performing satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Guz further urges there is evidence his termination was without good cause in two respects. First, he insists, the evidence suggests Bechtel had no good cause <em>to eliminate BNl-MI, </em>because the cost reduction and workload downturn reasons Bechtel gave for that decision (1) were not justified by the facts, and (2) were a pretext to terminate him and other individual BNI-MI employees for <em>poor performance </em>without following the company\u2019s progressive discipline rules. Second, Guz asserts, even if there was good cause to eliminate his work unit, his termination nonetheless lacked good cause because Bechtel failed to accord him fair layoff rights set forth in its written personnel rules, including (1) use of objective force ranking to determine which unit members deserved retention, and (2) fair consideration for other available positions while he was in holding status..</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Court of Appeal agreed with Guz that there was triable evidence of an implied-in-fact contract to terminate him only for good cause. The court further agreed the evidence warranted a trial on Guz\u2019s <em>first </em>theory of breach, i.e., that Bechtel\u2019s stated economic reason for eliminating his work unit lacked support and was a pretext for firing unsatisfactory workers without resort to progressive discipline procedures. On this basis alone, the Court of Appeal reversed the summary judgment against Guz\u2019s contract cause of action. The Court of Appeal did not decide whether the evidence justified a trial on Guz\u2019s <em>second </em>theory of breach, i.e., the denial of rights specified by the company\u2019s fair layoff rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As we shall explain, we find triable evidence that Bechtel\u2019s <em>written personnel documents </em>set forth implied contractual limits on the circumstances under which Guz, and other Bechtel workers, would be terminated. On the other hand, we see <em>no </em>triable evidence of an implied agreement between Guz and Bechtel on <em>additional, different, or broader </em>terms of employment security. As Bechtel suggests, the personnel documents themselves did not restrict Bechtel\u2019s freedom to reorganize, reduce, and consolidate its work force for whatever reasons it wished. Thus, contrary to the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding, Bechtel had the absolute right to eliminate Guz\u2019s work unit and to transfer the unit\u2019s responsibilities to another company entity, even if the decision was influenced by dissatisfaction with the eliminated unit\u2019s performance, and even if the personnel documents entitled an individual employee to progressive discipline procedures before being fired for poor performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The basis on which the Court of Appeal overturned this portion of the trial court\u2019s summary judgment was therefore erroneous, and the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in this regard must be reversed. Having so concluded, we need not address the issue the Court of Appeal never reached, i.e., whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Guz has a triable claim that, in the course of the reorganization, Bechtel denied him fair layoff protections, such as objective ranking and placement assistance, as guaranteed by the company\u2019s written personnel provisions. We leave that question to the Court of Appeal on remand. The following paragraphs describe in detail our reasoning on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">At the outset, Bechtel insists that the existence of implied contractual limitations on its termination rights is negated because Bechtel <em>expressly disclaimed </em>all such agreements. Bechtel suggests the at-will presumption of Labor Code 2922 was conclusively reinforced by language Bechtel inserted in Policy 1101, which specified that the company\u2019s employees \u201chave no . . . agreements guaranteeing continuous service and may be terminated at [Bechtel\u2019s] option.\u201d As Bechtel points out, Guz concedes he understood Policy 1101 applied to him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">This express disclaimer, reinforced by the statutory presumption of at-will employment, satisfied Bechtel\u2019s initial burden, if any, to show that Guz\u2019s claim of a contract limiting Bechtel\u2019s termination rights had no merit. But neither the disclaimer nor the statutory presumption necessarily foreclosed Guz from proving the existence and breach of such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Cases in California and elsewhere have held that at-will provisions in personnel handbooks, manuals, or memoranda do not bar, or necessarily overcome, other evidence of the employer\u2019s contrary intent (see, e.g., <em>Thomka </em>v. <em>Financial Corp. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 877, 884-885 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 382]; <em>Walker v. Blue Cross of California </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 985, 993 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 184] (Walker); <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1227-1228 [261 Cal.Rptr. 185] <em>{Wilkerson)), </em>particularly where other provisions in the employer\u2019s personnel documents themselves suggest limits on the employer\u2019s termination rights (see, e.g., <em>Wood v. Loyola Marymount University </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 661, 665-669 [267 Cal.Rptr. 230]; <em>Zaccardi v. Zale Corp. </em>(10th Cir. 1988) 856 F.2d 1473, 1476-1477; <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. The Pritchard Corp. </em>(D.Kan. 1997) 972 F.Supp. 1352, 1369-1370; <em>Farnum </em>v. <em>Brattleboro Retreat, Inc. </em>(1995) 164 Vt. 488 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>[671 A.2d 1249, 1254-1255]; <em>Swanson v. Liquid Air Corp. </em>(1992) 118 Wash.2d 512 [826 P.2d 664, 668-677]; <em>Jones v. Central Peninsula General Hosp. </em>(Alaska 1989) 779 P.2d 783, 788).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The reasoning, express or implied, is that parol evidence is admissible to explain, supplement, or even contradict the terms of an unintegrated agreement, and that handbook disclaimers should not permit an employer, at its whim, to repudiate promises it has otherwise made in its own self-interest, and on which it intended an employee to rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We agree that disclaimer language in an employee handbook or policy manual does not necessarily mean an employee is employed at will. But even if a handbook disclaimer is not controlling <em>(Wilkerson, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1227) in every case, neither can such a provision be ignored in determining whether the parties\u2019 conduct was intended, and reasonably understood, to create binding limits on an employer\u2019s statutory right to terminate the relationship at will. Like any direct expression of employer intent, communicated to employees and intended to apply to them, such language must be taken into account, along with all other pertinent evidence, in ascertaining the terms on which a worker was employed. (Ibid,)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We examine accordingly the evidence cited by Guz in support of his implied contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>At the outset, it is undisputed that Guz received no individual promises or representations that Bechtel would retain him except for good cause, or upon other specified circumstances. (See <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 680.) Nor does Guz seriously claim that the practice in Bechtel\u2019s industry was to provide secure employment. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Indeed, the undisputed evidence suggested that because Bechtel, like other members of its industry, operated by competitive bidding from project to project, its work force fluctuated widely and, in terms of raw numbers, was in general decline.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">However, Guz insists his own undisputed long and successful service at Bechtel constitutes strong evidence of an implied contract for permanent employment except upon good cause. Guz argues that by retaining him for over 20 years, and by providing him with steady raises, promotions, commendations, and good performance reviews during his tenure, Bechtel engaged in \u201cactions . . . reflecting assurances of continued employment.\u201d <em>{Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 680.) Bechtel responds that an individual employee\u2019s mere long and praiseworthy service has little or no tendency to show an implied agreement between the parties that the employee is no longer terminable at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">A number of <em>post-Foley </em>California decisions have suggested that long duration of service, regular promotions, favorable performance reviews, praise from supervisors, and salary increases do not, without more, imply an employer\u2019s contractual intent to relinquish its at-will rights. <em>{Horn v. Cushman &amp; Wakefield Western, Inc. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 798, 817-819 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 459] <em>{Horn); Kovatch v. California Casualty Management Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1276 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 217]; <em>Davis v. Consolidated Freightways </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 354, 368 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 438]; <em>Tollefson, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 843, 856; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1554, 1559 [259 Cal.Rptr. 56]; see also <em>Hoy </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1994) 861 F.Supp. 881, 886.) These decisions reason that such events are but natural consequences of a well-functioning employment relationship, and thus have no special tendency to prove that the employer\u2019s at-will implied agreement, reasonably understood as such by the employee, has become one that limits the employer\u2019s future termination rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We agree that an employee\u2019s <em>mere </em>passage of time in the employer\u2019s service, even where marked with tangible indicia that the employer approves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the employee\u2019s work, cannot <em>alone </em>form an implied-in-fact contract that the employee is no longer at will. Absent other evidence of the employer\u2019s intent, longevity, raises and promotions are their own rewards for the employee\u2019s continuing valued service; they do not, <em>in and of themselves, </em>additionally constitute a contractual guarantee of future employment security. A rule granting such contract rights on the basis of successful longevity alone would discourage the retention and promotion of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">On the other hand, long and successful service is not necessarily irrelevant to the existence of such a contract. Over the period of an employee\u2019s tenure, the employer can certainly communicate, by its written and unwritten policies and practices, or by informal assurances, that seniority and longevity <em>do </em>create rights against termination at will. The issue is whether the employer\u2019s words or conduct, on which an employee reasonably relied, gave rise to that <em>specific </em>understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Read in context, <em>Foley, supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d 654, did not hold otherwise. In the first place, <em>Foley\u2019s </em>reference to lengthy, successful service as evidence of an implied contract not to terminate at will was simply quoted, with little independent analysis, from <em>Pugh, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 311, 328. <em>Pugh, </em>in turn, had adopted wholesale the reasoning of <em>Cleary v. American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 443 [168 Cal.Rptr. 722] <em>(Cleary) </em>that \u201c \u2018[termination of employment without legal cause [after long service] offends the <em>implied-in-law </em>covenant of <em>good faith and fair dealing </em>contained in all contracts, including employment contracts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pugh, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at p. 328, quoting <em>Cleary, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at p. 455, italics added.) In other words, these cases suggested, because the arbitrary termination of a veteran employee is neither fair nor in good faith, such conduct violates the implied covenant contained in every employment contract, regardless of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">But <em>Foley </em>itself discredited this line of reasoning. There we \u201creiterated that the employment relationship is fundamentally contractual\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 696), and we made clear that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot supply limitations on termination rights to which the parties have not actually agreed. <em>(Foley, supra, </em>at p. 698, fn. 39; see also discussion, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Insofar as <em>Foley </em>applied the long service factor to its own facts, it did so consistently with the principles of implied-in-fact contracts. In <em>Foley, </em>the employer claimed the employee\u2019s six years and nine months of service was <em>too short </em>a period to evidence an implied agreement not to discharge at will. We answered that \u201c[l]ength of employment [was] a relevant consideration\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>and the plaintiffs length of service was \u201csufficient time for <em>conduct to occur </em>on which a trier of fact could find the existence of an implied contract.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 681, italics added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Prominent among the conduct alleged by the <em>Foley </em>plaintiff was \u201crepeated <em>oral assurances of job </em>security.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 681, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We therefore decline to interpret <em>Foley </em>as holding that long, successful service, standing alone, can demonstrate an implied-in-fact contract right not to be terminated at will.  In the case before us, there is no indication that employee longevity is a significant factor in determining the existence or content of an implied contract limiting the employer\u2019s termination rights. Guz claims no particular \u201c \u2018actions or communications by [Bechtel]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 680), and no industry customs, practices, or policies <em>(ibid.), </em>which suggest that by virtue of his successful longevity in Bechtel\u2019s employ, he had earned a contractual right against future termination at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">If anything, Bechtel had communicated otherwise. The company\u2019s Policy 1101 stated that Bechtel employees had no contracts guaranteeing their continuous employment and could be terminated at Bechtel\u2019s option. Nothing in this language suggested any exception for senior workers, or for those who had received regular raises and promotions. While occasional references to seniority appear in other sections of Bechtel\u2019s personnel documents, the narrow context of these references undermines an inference that Bechtel additionally intended, or employees had reason to expect, special immunities from termination based on their extended or successful service.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Accordingly, the undoubted length and merit of Guz\u2019s Bechtel career does not bolster his claim that his at-will status had been altered by an implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>contract. We must look elsewhere for evidence raising a triable issue that Bechtel entered and breached an implied contract limiting its right to terminate Guz\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Guz asserts that Bechtel\u2019s personnel documents, read as a whole, strongly support his claim of an implied agreement for employment security. As Guz suggests, an employer\u2019s written personnel policies may be an important source of implied-contract evidence.  We have made clear that \u201cthe trier of fact can infer an agreement to limit the grounds for termination based on the employee\u2019s reasonable reliance on the company\u2019s personnel manual or policies.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 681-682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u201cThe principle that implied employment contract terms may arise from the employer\u2019s official . . . policies and practices is one that long predates <em>Foley </em>. . . . \u2018Of late years the attitude of the courts (as well as of employers in general) is to consider regulations of this type which offer additional advantages to employees as being in effect offers of a unilateral contract which offer is accepted if the employee continues in the employment, and not as being mere offers of gifts.\u2019 <em>([Chinn v. China Nat. Aviation Corp. </em>(1955) 98,] 99-100 [291 P.2d 91]; see also <em>Newberger </em>v. <em>Rifkind </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 1070, 1076 [104 Cal.Rptr. 663, 57 A.L.R.3d 1232] [implied unilateral contract for stock option agreement]; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Sparling </em>(1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 711, 721-722 [197 P.2d 807] [enforceable promise to pay pension benefits inferred from personnel policies].) In <em>Hepp </em>v. <em>LockheedCalifonia Co. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 714 [150 Cal.Rptr. 408], this reasoning was extended to policies regarding nonmonetary employment benefits.  There the court held that it was a question of fact whether an employer\u2019s [written] policy of preferential hiring for its laid-off employees was to be considered an implied contractual promise on which its employees could reasonably rely. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 719.)\u201d <em>(Scott, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 454, 464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">When an employer promulgates formal personnel policies and procedures in handbooks, manuals, and memoranda disseminated to employees, a strong inference may arise that the employer intended workers to rely on these policies as terms and conditions of their employment, and that employees did reasonably so rely. (See, e.g., <em>Scott, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 454, 465.) Both parties derive benefits from such an arrangement. From the employees\u2019 perspective, formal policies promote fairness and consistency, guarding against the arbitrary, capricious, and incongruous treatment of similar cases. By the same token, such policies may also help the employer by enhancing worker morale, loyalty, and productivity, providing competitive advantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>in the labor market, and minimizing employee litigation. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 469-470; see also <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">For these reasons, logic suggests that the employer may intend, and employees may understand, such generally promulgated policies as a systematic approach to personnel relations, providing a clear and uniform alternative to haphazard practices, understandings, and arrangements within the company. Therefore, where the employer has chosen to maintain such written policies, the terms they describe must be a central focus of the contractual analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Finally, Guz asserts there is evidence that, industry custom and written company personnel policies aside, Bechtel had an <em>unwritten </em>\u201cpolic[y] or practice[]\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 680) to release its employees only for cause. As the sole evidence of this policy, Guz points to the deposition testimony of Johnstone, BNI\u2019s president, who stated his understanding that Bechtel terminated workers only with \u201cgood reason\u201d or for \u201clack of [available] work.\u201d But there is no evidence that Bechtel employees were aware of such an unwritten policy, and it flies in the face of Bechtel\u2019s general disclaimer. This brief and vague statement, by a single Bechtel official, that Bechtel sought to avoid arbitrary firings is insufficient as a matter of law to permit a finding that the company, by an unwritten practice or policy on which employees reasonably relied, had contracted away its right to discharge Guz at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In sum, if there is any significant evidence that Guz had an implied contract against termination at will, that evidence flows exclusively from Bechtel\u2019s <em>written </em>personnel documents. It follows that there is no triable issue of an implied contract on terms <em>broader than the specific provisions of those documents. </em>In reviewing the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Bechtel may have breached contractual obligations to Guz by eliminating his work unit, we must therefore focus on the pertinent written provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">As noted above, Bechtel\u2019s written personnel provisions covering termination from employment fell into two categories. The parties do not dispute that certain of these provisions, expressly denominated \u201cPolicies\u201d (including Policies 1101 and 302), were disseminated to employees and were intended by Bechtel to inform workers of rules applicable to their employment. There seems little doubt, and we conclude, a triable issue exists that thfc specific provisions of these Policies did become an implicit part of the employment contracts of the Bechtel employees they covered, including Guz.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Guz also points to another Bechtel document, the RIF Guidelines, that addressed procedures for implementing reductions in the work force. Evidence suggesting the contractual status of this document is somewhat closer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>On the one hand, the \u201cGuidelines\u201d label and evidence indicating this document was distributed primarily to supervisors for their use, weigh against an inference that Bechtel intended a widely disseminated policy on which employees might directly rely. (See, e.g., <em>Knights v. Hewlett Packard </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 775, 780 [281 Cal.Rptr. 295].) Moreover, there was some evidence that even some Bechtel managers were unaware of the force ranking system set forth in Policy 302 and the RIF Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">On the other hand, the formality, tone, length, and detail of the RIF Guidelines suggest they were not intended as merely precatory. The RIF Guidelines comprised a minimum of six single-spaced pages, and were distributed under a cover letter suggesting that they represented \u201ccorporate policy.\u201d In some instances, the RIF Guidelines defined or supplemented terms and provisions directly set forth in Policies 302 and 1101, such as the holding status described in Policy 1101 and the formal personnel ranking system described in Policy 302. There was also some evidence that Bechtel employees, including Guz, were aware of RIF Guideline procedures such as force ranking, had observed that the company followed these procedures in the past, and believed them to be Bechtel\u2019s policy. Goldstein, Guz\u2019s supervisor at BNI-MI, declared that as a supervisor, he received and was \u201cinstructed to follow\u201d the RIF Guidelines. On balance, we are persuaded a triable issue exists that the RIF Guidelines, like the formally denominated Policies, formed part of an implied contract between Bechtel and its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">As Bechtel stresses, Policy 1101 itself purported to disclaim any employment security rights. However, Bechtel had inserted other language, not only in Policy 1101 itself, but in other written personnel documents, which described detailed rules and procedures for the termination of employees under particular circumstances. Moreover, the specific language of Bechtel\u2019s disclaimer, stating that employees had no contracts <em>\u201cguaranteeing . . . </em>continuous service\u201d (italics added) and were terminable at Bechtel\u2019s \u201coption,\u201d did not foreclose an understanding between Bechtel and all its workers that Bechtel would make its termination decisions within the limits of its written personnel rules. Given these ambiguities, a fact finder could rationally determine that despite its general disclaimer, Bechtel had bound itself to the specific provisions of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In holding that Bechtel may have <em>breached </em>the terms of an implied contract with Guz by <em>eliminating his work unit, </em>the Court of Appeal relied on two premises. Focusing on one reason Guz was given for this decision\u2014a \u201cdownturn in . . . workload\u201d\u2014the Court of Appeal concluded that even if this reason were taken at face value, the evidence permitted a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that it was arbitrary and unreasonable, and thus without good cause, because it lacked support in the facts. Second, the Court of Appeal found triable evidence that this stated reason was pretextual, in that it masked Bechtel\u2019s true purpose to dismiss BNI-MI\u2019s workers on the basis of the unit\u2019s poor performance, but without affording each member the benefit of the progressive discipline rules set forth in the company\u2019s personnel documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">On the facts before us, we conclude that both these premises were in error. Bechtel\u2019s written personnel documents\u2014which, as we have seen, are the sole source of any contractual limits on Bechtel\u2019s rights to terminate Guz\u2014 imposed no restrictions upon the company\u2019s prerogatives to eliminate jobs or work units, for any or no reason, even if this would lead to the release of existing employees such as Guz.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Policy 1101 itself did address a category of termination labeled \u201cLayoff.\u201d However, this section simply <em>defined </em>that term as a \u201cBechtel-initiated termination[] of employees caused by a reduction in workload, <em>reorganizations, changes in job requirements, </em>or other circumstances such as failure to meet [a] client\u2019s site access requirements.\u201d (Italics added.) Policy 1101 further provided that persons scheduled for layoff were entitled to advance notice to facilitate reassignment efforts and job search assistance, and that \u201c[a] surplus employee[] [might] be placed on \u2018holding status\u2019 if there [was] a possible Bechtel reassignment within the following 3-month period.\u201d By proceeding in this fashion, Policy 1101 confirmed that Bechtel was free to \u201creorganize]\u201d itself, or to \u201cchange[] . . . job requirements,\u201d and to \u201cinitiate[]\u201d employee \u201cterminations . . . caused by\u201d this process, so long as Bechtel provided the requisite advance notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The RIF Guidelines set forth more detailed procedures for selecting <em>individual </em>layoff candidates, and for helping such persons obtain jobs elsewhere within the company. But the RIF Guidelines, like the Policies, neither stated nor implied any limits on Bechtel\u2019s freedom to <em>implement the reorganization itself.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Guz, like the Court of Appeal, focuses on a separate section of Policy 1101, titled \u201cUnsatisfactory Performance.\u201d This section, the so-called progressive discipline provision, stated that \u201c[e]mployees who <em>fail to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner </em>may be terminated, <em>provided </em>the employees have been advised of the specific shortcomings and given an opportunity to improve their performance.\u201d (Italics added.) Like the Court of Appeal, Guz cites BNI president Johnstone\u2019s disclosure that he was unhappy with BNI-MI\u2019s work product as evidence that the elimination of BNI-MI was a pretext for firing its individual members without resort to the progressive discipline policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>However, as Bechtel suggests, Policy 1101 cannot reasonably be construed to conflate the separate Unsatisfactory Performance and Layoff provisions in this manner. Whatever rights Policy 1101 gave an employee threatened with replacement on account of his or her <em>individual </em>poor performance, we see nothing in Bechtel\u2019s personnel documents which, despite Bechtel\u2019s general disclaimer, limited Bechtel\u2019s prerogative to <em>eliminate </em>an <em>entire work unit, </em>and thus its individual jobs, even if the decision was influenced by a belief that the unit\u2019s work would be better performed elsewhere within the company.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Accordingly, we conclude the Court of Appeal erred in finding, on the grounds it stated, that Guz\u2019s implied contract claim was triable. Insofar as the Court of Appeal used these incorrect grounds to overturn the trial court\u2019s contrary determination, and thus to reinstate Guz\u2019s contractual cause of action, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Court of Appeal did not address Guz\u2019s second theory, i.e., that Bechtel also breached its implied contract by failing, during and after the reorganization, to provide him personally with the fair layoff protections, including force ranking and reassignment help, which are set forth in its Policies and RIF Guidelines. This theory raises difficult questions, including what the proper remedy, if any, should be if Guz ultimately shows that Bechtel breached a contractual obligation to follow certain procedural policies in the termination process. However, we commonly decline to decide issues not addressed by the Court of Appeal. (See, e.g., <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Board of Architectural Examiners </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 795 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641].) We will follow that practice here. On remand, the Court of Appeal should confront this issue and should determine whether Guz has raised a triable issue on this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">III. <em>Implied covenant claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Bechtel next urges that the trial court properly dismissed Guz\u2019s separate claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because, on the facts and arguments presented, this theory of recovery is either inapplicable or superfluous. We agree.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The sole asserted basis for Guz\u2019s implied covenant claim is that Bechtel violated its established personnel policies when it terminated him without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>prior opportunity to improve his \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d performance, used no force ranking or other objective criteria when selecting him for layoff, and omitted to consider him for other positions for which he was qualified. Guz urges that <em>even if his contract was for employment at will, </em>the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing precluded Bechtel from \u201cunfairly\u201d denying him the contract\u2019s benefits by failing to follow its own termination policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Thus, Guz argues, in effect, that the implied covenant can impose substantive terms and conditions beyond those to which the contract parties actually agreed. However, as indicated above, such a theory directly contradicts our conclusions in <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654. The covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied by law in every contract, exists merely to prevent one contracting party from unfairly frustrating the other party\u2019s right to receive the <em>benefits of the agreement actually made. </em>(E.g., <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 36 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) The covenant thus cannot \u201c \u2018be endowed with an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Love v. Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1153 [271 Cal.Rptr. 246].) It cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Labor Code section 2922 establishes the presumption that an employer may terminate its employees at will, for any or no reason. A fortiori, the employer may act peremptorily, arbitrarily, or inconsistently, without providing specific protections such as prior warning, fair procedures, objective evaluation, or preferential reassignment. Because the employment relationship is \u201cfundamentally contractual\u201d <em>{Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 696), limitations on these employer prerogatives are a matter of the parties\u2019 specific agreement, express or implied in fact. The mere existence of an employment relationship affords no expectation, protectible by law, that employment will continue, or will end only on certain conditions, unless the parties have actually adopted such terms. Thus if the employer\u2019s termination decisions, however arbitrary, do not breach such a substantive contract provision, they are not precluded by the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This logic led us to emphasize in <em>Foley </em>that \u201cbreach of the implied covenant cannot logically be based on a claim that [the] discharge [of an at-will employee] was made without good cause.\u201d <em>{Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 698, fn. 39.) As we noted, \u201c[b]ecause the implied covenant protects only the parties\u2019 right to receive the benefit of their agreement, and, in an at-will relationship there is no agreement to terminate only for good cause, the implied covenant standing alone cannot be read to impose such a duty. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The same reasoning applies to any case where an employee argues that even if his employment was at will, his arbitrary dismissal frustrated his contract benefits and thus violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Precisely because employment at will <em>allows </em>the employer freedom to terminate the relationship as it chooses, the employer does not frustrate the employee\u2019s contractual rights merely by doing so. In such a case, \u201cthe employee cannot complain about a deprivation of the benefits of continued employment, for the agreement never provided for \u00e1 continuation of its benefits in the first instance.\u201d <em>{Hejmadi </em>v. <em>AMFAC, Inc. </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 525, 547 [249 Cal.Rptr. 5].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Guz cites several decisions suggesting that the implied covenant precludes an employer from terminating even an at-will employee unfairly, such as by refusing to follow its own established policies and practices. <em>{Rulon-Miller </em>v. <em>International Business Machines Corp. </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 241, 247 [208 Cal.Rptr. 524] <em>{Rulon-Miller) </em>[employer\u2019s duty of fair dealing requires that \u201clike cases be treated alike\u201d; thus, employer\u2019s termination rules and regulations, if any, must be followed]; see <em>Gray, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d 813, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>820-821 [long service plus violation of employer policies may establish breach of covenant of \u201cfair treatment\u201d]; <em>Khanna, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d 250, 262 [implied covenant may be violated by termination of at-will employee where employer engaged in bad faith actions, extraneous to the contract, to frustrate benefits of employment]; <em>Pugh, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 311, 327-329 [termination after long service, in violation of employer policies, may breach implied covenant to refrain from arbitrary treatment]; <em>Cleary, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d 443, 455-456 [same]; see also <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Levelor Lorentzen, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 899 F.2d 772, <em>111 </em>[covenant requires \u201ccooperation in carrying out the contract and honesty in creating or settling disputes\u201d; breach of covenant may thus be shown where employee establishes lengthy satisfactory service and violation of employer\u2019s termination policies].) But insofar as these authorities suggest that the implied covenant may impose limits on an employer\u2019s termination rights beyond those either expressed or implied in fact in the employment contract itself, they contravene the persuasive reasoning of <em>Foley, </em>and are therefore disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Similarly at odds with <em>Foley </em>are suggestions that independent recovery for breach of the implied covenant may be available if the employer terminated the employee in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \u201cwithout probable cause,\u201d i.e., without determining \u201chonestly and in good faith that good cause for discharge existed.\u201d <em>(Walker, supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th 985, 997; see also, e.g., <em>Wilkerson, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1231; <em>Burton v. Security Pacific Nat. Bank </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 972, 979 [243 Cal.Rptr. 277]; <em>Rulon-Miller, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 241, 253.) Where the employment contract itself allows the employer to terminate at will, its motive and lack of care in doing so are, in most cases at least, irrelevant. (But see fn. 18, post.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">A number of Court of Appeal decisions since Foley have recognized that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing imposes no independent limits on an employer\u2019s prerogative to dismiss employees. (E.g., Camp, <em>supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th 620, 631 [implied covenant did not preclude unfair termination where there was no express or implied-in-fact contract limiting employer\u2019s termination rights]; <em>Flait v. North American Watch Corp. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 480-481 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 522] [employment contract contained express at-will term; because employee thus could not show her termination broke any \u201ccontractual covenant or promise,\u201d implied covenant claim must fail]; <em>Slivinsky v. Watkins-Johnson Co. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 799, 806 [270 Cal.Rptr. 585] [where contract contained express at-will clause, implied covenant claim must fail because employee could not show her termination without good cause frustrated \u201cthe [parties\u2019] intentions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>reasonable expectations . . . within the contract\u201d].) We affirm that this is the law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Of course, as we have indicated above, the employer\u2019s personnel policies and practices may become <em>implied-in-fact terms </em>of the contract between employer and employee. If that has occurred, the employer\u2019s failure to follow such policies when terminating an employee is a breach of the contract itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">A breach of the contract may also constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. But insofar as the employer\u2019s acts are directly actionable as a breach of an implied-in-fact contract term, a claim that merely realleges that breach as a violation of the covenant is superfluous. This is because, as we explained at length in <em>Foley, </em>the remedy for breach of an employment agreement, including the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied by law therein, is <em>solely contractual. </em>In the employment context, an implied covenant theory affords no separate <em>measure of recovery, </em>such as tort damages. <em>{Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654, 682-700.) Allegations that the breach was wrongful, in bad faith, arbitrary, and unfair are unavailing; there is no tort of \u201cbad faith breach\u201d of an employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We adhere to these principles here. To the extent Guz\u2019s implied covenant cause of action seeks to impose limits on Bechtel\u2019s termination rights <em>beyond </em>those to which the parties actually agreed, the claim is invalid. To the extent the implied covenant claim seeks simply to invoke terms to which the parties <em>did </em>agree, it is superfluous. Guz\u2019s remedy, if any, for Bechtel\u2019s alleged violation of its personnel policies depends on proof that they were contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>terms to which the parties actually agreed. The trial court thus properly dismissed the implied covenant cause of action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">IV. <em>Age discrimination claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Bechtel urges that the trial court correctly granted summary adjudication against Guz\u2019s claim that he was terminated because of his age, in violation of the FEHA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Bechtel contends that, in order to survive summary judgment, Guz was obliged to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination, but could not do so because it is undisputed that the bulk of his duties were assumed by an <em>older </em>employee. Alternatively, Bechtel insists it proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Guz\u2019s termination, i.e., a reduction in force resulting in the elimination of his job, which Guz failed to rebut with evidence that this justification was a pretext for age-related animus against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We agree with Bechtel that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law against Guz\u2019s age discrimination claim. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Bechtel offered extensive evidence of its reasons, unrelated to age, for eliminating BNI-MI, and for the ensuing individual personnel decisions that led to Guz\u2019s final release. In substantial measure, Guz\u2019s written response to Bechtel\u2019s motion conceded the truth, if not the wisdom, of Bechtel\u2019s explanation. To survive summary judgment, Guz was thus obliged to point to evidence raising a triable issue\u2014i.e., permitting an inference\u2014that, notwithstanding Bechtel\u2019s showing, its ostensible reasons were a mask for prohibited age bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">To sustain that burden, Guz first argues there are several triable bases for concluding that Bechtel\u2019s stated reasons are false. None of Guz\u2019s theories are persuasive. As sole independent support for an inference that Bechtel discriminated, Guz cites comparative-age evidence which suggests, in his view, that Bechtel\u2019s decisions favored younger over older workers. But Guz\u2019s claim of statistical age bias is weak in numerous respects. In the face of Bechtel\u2019s strong and unrebutted showing that it took its actions for nondiscriminatory reasons, the evidence of age favoritism on which Guz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>relies manifestly lacks sufficient probative force to allow a finding of intentional age discrimination. In the pages that follow, we explain our reasoning in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">A. <em>General principles (McDonnell Douglas test).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Because of the similarity between state and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying our own statutes. (See, e.g., <em>Mixon v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1306, 1316 [237 Cal.Rptr. 884] <em>{Mixon).) </em>In particular, California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination, including age discrimination, based on a theory of disparate treatment. <em>{Texas Dept, of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 248 [101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207] <em>{Burdine); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 792 [93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668] <em>(McDonnell Douglas); Martin </em>v. <em>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1730 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 181] <em>{Martin); Ewing v. Gill Industries, Inc. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 601, 610-611, 614 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 640] <em>(Ewing); County of Alameda v.

Thus, by successive steps of increasingly narrow focus, the test allows discrimination to be inferred from facts that create a reasonable likelihood of bias and are not satisfactorily explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">At trial, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test places on the plaintiff the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. This step is designed to eliminate at the outset the most patently meritless claims, as where the plaintiff is not a member of the protected class or was clearly unqualified, or where the job he sought was withdrawn and never filled. <em>(Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253-254 [101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093-1094]; <em>Caldwell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Paramount Unified School Dist. </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 189, 202 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 448] <em>(Caldwell).) </em>While the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie burden is \u201cnot onerous\u201d <em>(Burdine, supra, </em>at p. 253 [101 S.Ct. at pp. 1093-1094]), he must at least show \u201c \u2018actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were \u201cbased on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion . . . .\u201d [Citation].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibarbia v.

Generally, the plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.

Thus, in a trial, \u201c[i]f the trier of fact believes the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and if the employer is silent in the face of the presumption, the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff because no issue of fact remains in the case.\u201d <em>(Burdine, supra, </em>at p. 254 [101 S.Ct. at p. 1094], fn. omitted; see also <em>Hicks, supra, </em>at p. 506 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2746-2747].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Accordingly, at this trial stage, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by producing admissible evidence, sufficient to \u201craise[] a genuine issue of fact\u201d and to \u201cjustify a judgment for the [employer],\u201d that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>(Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at pp. 254-255 [101 S.Ct. at p. 1094]; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Claremont University Center </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 639, 663-664 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 151] <em>(Clark); </em>see <em>Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. at pp. 506-507, 509 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2746-2747, 2748] [\u201cevidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason\u201d (italics omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">If the employer sustains this burden, the presumption of discrimination disappears. <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. 502, 510-511 [113 S.Ct. 2742, 2748-2749] ; <em>Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255 [101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094-1095]; <em>Mixon, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d 1306, 1319.)

Code of Civil Procedure section 437c provides that on summary judgment, the <em>moving party </em>must establish entitlement to \u201cjudgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).) A moving defendant may do so by \u201cshow[ing]\u201d that the plaintiff\u2019s action \u201chas no merit\u201d <em>(id., </em>subds. (a), (c)(2)), i.e., that \u201cone or more elements . , . cannot be established\u201d or \u201cthere is a complete defense\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>Only after the defendant has met that burden must the plaintiff respond with admissible evidence raising a triable issue. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Several California decisions have suggested that because a plaintiff opposing summary judgment need not demonstrate triable issues until the moving defendant has made an initial no-merit \u201cshowing],\u201d the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burdens are \u201creversed\u201d on a defense motion for summary judgment against a claim of discrimination in employment. <em>(Sada v. Robert F. Kennedy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Medical Center </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 138, 150-151 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 112]; <em>Addy v. Bliss &amp; Glennon </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 205, 216 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 642]; <em>Martin, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1730-1731; <em>University of Southern California v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036 [272 Cal.Rptr. 264] <em>(University of Southern </em>California)). Other California cases, however, have indicated that the plaintiff can survive an employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment only by presenting, at the outset, triable evidence satisfying the prima facie elements of <em>McDonnell Douglas. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Horn, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 798, 805-807; <em>Hersant v. Department of Social Services </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 997, 1002-1006 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 483] <em>(Hersant); Caldwell, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 189, 203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Bechtel urges we adopt the latter view and impose an initial prima facie burden on a plaintiff opposing an employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Here, Bechtel insists, Guz could not demonstrate a prima facie case, because the transfer of Guz\u2019s specific BNI-MI duties to an older worker, Shaeffer, negated an inference of anti-age animus as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In response, Guz argues he should have no prima facie burden to avoid summary judgment. However, Guz asserts, if he did have such a burden, he satisfied it by pointing to evidence that, when implementing its work force reduction, Bechtel treated younger employees more favorably than older.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We need not resolve the \u201cprima facie burden\u201d issue, for an alternative analysis disposes of Guz\u2019s cause of action. In its summary judgment motion, Bechtel did not stand mute, relying solely on the premise that Guz failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of age discrimination. As an additional basis for its motion, Bechtel proceeded directly to the second step of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>formula. Bechtel set forth competent, admissible evidence <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-143 [120 S.Ct. 2097, 2106]; <em>Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. 502, 507 [113 S.Ct. 2742, 2747]; <em>Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254-255 [101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094-1095]) of its reasons, unrelated to age bias, why it eliminated Guz\u2019s work unit, BNI-MI, and thereafter chose persons other than Guz for vacant positions in the unit to which BNI-MI\u2019s functions were transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Bechtel\u2019s explanation of nondiscriminatory reasons was creditable on its face. Indeed, as we explain below, Guz has largely conceded the truth, if not the wisdom, of Bechtel\u2019s proffered reasons. Guz thus had the burden to <em>rebut </em>this facially dispositive showing by pointing to evidence which nonetheless raises a rational inference that intentional discrimination occurred. (See discussion, <em>post.) </em>For reasons we hereafter set forth, Guz has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">As an initial matter, Bechtel argues that the exercise of its prerogative to eliminate Guz\u2019s work unit and position constitutes, as a matter of law, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his termination.  However, downsizing alone is not necessarily a sufficient explanation, under the FEHA, for the consequent dismissal of an age-protected worker. An employer\u2019s freedom to consolidate or reduce its work force, and to eliminate positions in the process, does not mean it may \u201cuse the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of its [older] workers.\u201d <em>(Matthews v. Commonwealth Edison Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 128 F.3d 1194, 1195; see also, e.g., <em>Cronin v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1995) 46 F.3d 196, 204 <em>(Cronin); Uffelman v. Lone Star Steel Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1989) 863 F.2d 404, 407-408.) Invocation of a right to downsize does not resolve whether the employer had a discriminatory motive for cutting back its work force, or engaged in intentional discrimination when deciding which individual workers to retain and release. Where these are issues, the employer\u2019s explanation must address them. (See, e.g., <em>Throgmorton v. U.S. Forgecraft Corp. </em>(8th Cir. 1992) 965 F.2d 643, 646-647.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">On the other hand, if nondiscriminatory, Bechtel\u2019s true reasons need not necessarily have been wise or correct. (See, e.g., <em>Horn, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 798, 807; <em>Hersant, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th 997, 1009.) While the objective soundness of an employer\u2019s proffered reasons supports their credibility (see discussion, <em>post), </em>the ultimate issue is simply whether the employer acted with <em>a motive to discriminate illegally. </em>Thus, \u201clegitimate\u201d reasons <em>(Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at p. 254 [101 S.Ct. at p. 1094]) in this context are reasons that are <em>facially unrelated to prohibited bias, </em>and which, if true, would thus preclude a finding <em>of discrimination. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Kariotis </em>v. <em>Navistar Intern. Transp. Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 131 F.3d 672, 676 [suggesting that proffered reasons, if \u201cnondiscriminatory on their face\u201d and \u201chonestly believed\u201d by employer, will suffice even if \u201cfoolish or trivial or baseless\u201d]; <em>McCoy v. WGN Continental Broadcasting Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1992) 957 F.2d 368, 373 [ultimate issue is whether employer \u201chonestly believed in the reasons it offers\u201d]; see also <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Perskie </em>(3d Cir. 1994) 32 F.3d 759, 765 [issue is discriminatory animus, not whether employer\u2019s decision was \u201cwrong or mistaken,\u201d or whether employer is \u201cwise, shrewd, prudent, or competent\u201d].)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">With these principles in mind, we examine Bechtel\u2019s showing of its reasons for the decisions leading to Guz\u2019s dismissal. A substantial portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>this evidence was the deposition testimony of Bechtel officials, given under questioning by Guz\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">As noted above, BNI president Johnstone explained at length why he decided to eliminate BNI-MI. Johnstone testified as follows: After assuming BNI\u2019s presidency, he grew frustrated with BNI-MI\u2019s size, work product, and budget overruns. On the other hand, he had high regard for a similar Bechtel entity, SFRO-MI, with which he had worked in the past. Because SFRO-MI, unlike BNI-MI, provided management information services to many different Bechtel entities, he believed BNI could achieve economies of scale by relying on SFRO-MI, rather than BNI\u2019s own in-house unit, for such services. After receiving a budget proposal from SFRO-MI that fell well below BNI-MI\u2019s current budget, he decided SFRO-MI could perform BNI-MI\u2019s work better and more cheaply.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">James Tevis, SFRO-MI\u2019s manager, testified at length why, when reorganizing SFRO-MI to assume BNI-MI\u2019s work, he gave most of the duties Guz had performed to a current SFRO-MI staff member, John Shaeffer. Tevis also explained why he hired Robert Wraith and Christine Siu to perform work they had been doing at BNI-MI, why he promoted SFRO-MI members John Wallace and Jan Vreim to vacant positions within that unit, and why Barbara Stenho was chosen for another vacant SFRO-MI position.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Thus, Tevis recounted that during the transition, he consulted with his BNI-MI counterpart, Goldstein, about which, if any, BNI-MI employees might assist SFRO-MI in assuming BNI-MI\u2019s functions. Guz was discussed in this context. However, Tevis, who was keenly aware of the need for cost savings, felt that his own current employees, Shaeffer and Chris Gee, could assume Guz\u2019s overhead duties, and Goldstein agreed. Tevis did contemplate two new positions at SFRO-MI (in place of the six eliminated at BNI-MI). One of these positions would involve \u201cknowledge of the project side\u201d of Bechtel\u2019s business. The other, which Tevis wished to fill at a relatively junior salary grade, would be computer-intensive, and would require facility in Bechtel\u2019s new ORS computer operating system. On these bases, the 50-year-old Goldstein, Guz\u2019s longtime supervisor and close friend, <em>recommended </em>Wraith and Siu, <em>and not Guz, </em>as the best choices for reassignment to SFRO-MI.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Tevis further indicated why Wallace, Vreim, and Stenho were chosen for positions that later became open at SFRO-MI while Guz was on holding status. First, it became clear, Wallace and Vreim were SFRO-MI veterans, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Tevis had direct experience with their backgrounds, skills, performance levels, and work habits. Moreover, as Tevis explained, the job to which Wallace was promoted required substantial supervisory and computer skills <em>and </em>a project background that would allow effective communication with BNI president Johnstone. Vreim, Wallace\u2019s former subordinate, was promoted to Wallace\u2019s old position. She was selected for her ORS computer skills, project experience, and supervisory background.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Stenho had not previously worked for SFRO-MI, but, according to Tevis, hers was a special case in another way. Her principal SFRO-MI duty would be to provide management information services to a particular Bechtel entity, Bechtel Civil. Stenho was selected because she had previously worked for Bechtel Civil. That department, unhappy with the services it had been receiving from SFRO-MI, specifically requested that the incumbent SFRO-MI employee, Robert Luchini, be transferred, and that Stenho be assigned to replace him.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Finally, Tevis explained why he had not considered Guz for these positions. Tevis thought Guz \u201conly did overhead,\u201d did not realize Guz had supervisory experience, and, in one case \u201cdid not even know . . . Guz was available.\u201d In particular, Tevis mentioned Guz\u2019s poor computer skills, as reported to him by Goldstein.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Bechtel\u2019s showing of reasons was made by competent and admissible evidence (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (d)). Moreover, the reasons advanced were legally sufficient to establish that Guz\u2019s FEHA cause of action had no merit (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd (g)(2)), because they were manifestly unrelated to intentional age bias against Guz. If Bechtel\u2019s showing of proffered reasons is true, Guz\u2019s allegations of <em>intentional age discrimination </em>thus fail, and Bechtel is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c); <em>Martin, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1732.) Thus, even if Guz had no initial burden to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination\u2014a question we do not decide\u2014Guz <em>did </em>have a burden, in the face of Bechtel\u2019s showing of nondiscriminatory reasons, to show there was nonetheless a triable issue that decisions leading to Guz\u2019s termination were actually made on the prohibited basis of his age. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2); cf. <em>Calvillo-Silva, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 714, 735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Moreover, an inference of intentional discrimination cannot be drawn solely from evidence, if any, that the company lied about its reasons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The pertinent statutes do not prohibit lying, they prohibit discrimination. <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. 502,521 [113 S.Ct. 2742, 2754-2755].) Proof that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons are unworthy of credence may \u201cconsiderably assist\u201d a circumstantial case of discrimination, because it suggests the employer had cause to hide its true reasons. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 517 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2752-2753].) Still, there must be evidence supporting a rational inference that <em>intentional discrimination, on grounds prohibited by the statute, was the true cause </em>of the employer\u2019s actions. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 510-520 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2748-2754].) Accordingly, the great weight of federal and California authority holds that an employer is entitled to summary judgment if, considering the employer\u2019s innocent explanation for its actions, the evidence as a whole is insufficient to permit a rational inference that the employer\u2019s actual motive was discriminatory.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. 133 [120 S.Ct. 2097] confirms this principle. <em>Reeves </em>rejected several federal court of appeals decisions holding that <em>even after </em>the plaintiff has presented <em>prima facie evidence </em>sufficient to establish an inference of prohibited discrimination in the absence of explanation, and has also presented evidence that the employer\u2019s innocent explanation is false, the employer is nonetheless <em>necessarily </em>entitled to <em>judgment as a matter of law </em>unless the plaintiff thereafter presents <em>further </em>evidence that the true reason was discriminatory. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 146-149 [120 S.Ct. at pp. 2108-2109].) Contrary to these decisions, <em>Reeves </em>confirmed that, in a particular case, a plaintiff\u2019s showing of pretext, <em>combined </em>with sufficient prima facie evidence of an act motivated by discrimination, <em>may </em>permit a finding of discriminatory intent, and may thus preclude judgment as a matter of law for the employer. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 148-149 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2109].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">But <em>Reeves </em>made clear that even where the plaintiff has presented a legally sufficient prima facie case of discrimination, and has also adduced some evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered innocent reasons are false, the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>finder is not <em>necessarily </em>entitled to find in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. Thus, the court admonished, its holding should not be interpreted to mean \u201cthat such a showing will <em>always </em>be adequate to sustain a . . . finding of liability. <em>Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant\u2019s explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory. For instance, </em>an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred. [Citations.] .... [ft Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors. These include the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer\u2019s case . . . .\u201d <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. 133, 148-149 [120 S.Ct. 2097, 2109], second italics added.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Though <em>Reeves </em>discusses the federal age discrimination scheme, we find its reasoning sound for purposes of our similar law. We therefore conclude that Guz\u2019s age discrimination claim under the FEHA cannot survive Bechtel\u2019s motion for summary judgment unless the evidence in the summary judgment record places Bechtel\u2019s creditable and sufficient showing of innocent motive in material dispute by raising a triable issue, i.e., a permissible inference, that, in fact, Bechtel acted for discriminatory purposes. (See, e.g., <em>Martin, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1735.) As <em>Reeves </em>indicated, summary judgment for the employer may thus be appropriate where, given the strength of the employer\u2019s showing of innocent reasons, any countervailing circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive, even if it may technically constitute a prima facie case, is too weak to raise a rational inference that discrimination occurred. Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Guz argues at length that the evidence raises a triable issue of the falsity of Bechtel\u2019s proffered reasons. The authorities suggest that, in an appropriate case, an inference of dissembling may arise where the employer has given shifting, contradictory, implausible, uninformed, or factually baseless justifications for its actions. (See, e.g., <em>Ewing, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th 601, 615; <em>Tinker v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1997) 127 F.3d 519, 523; <em>Testerman v.

Indeed, Guz has made substantial <em>concessions to the truth </em>of Bechtel\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision to eliminate BNI-MI and for choosing others to fill positions at SFRO-MI. In its separate statement of undisputed facts (Undisputed Fact Statement) accompanying the motion for summary judgment (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b)), Bechtel asserted, on the basis of BNI president Johnstone\u2019s deposition testimony, that BNI-MI was eliminated because Johnstone was concerned about BNI-MI\u2019s performance, had prior satisfactory experience with SFRO-MI, and believed BNI would save money by eliminating its own management information unit and obtaining such services from SFRO-MI, which already served many Bechtel entities. In his required written response to the Undisputed Fact Statement, Guz admitted Johnstone considered BNI-MI\u2019s group performance. Guz otherwise \u201c[disputed\u201d Bechtel\u2019s explanation only to stress that Johnstone considered such specific cost issues as BNI-MI\u2019s overhead budget and the salaries of its employees.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Similarly, the Undisputed Fact Statement, relying on Tevis\u2019s deposition testimony, explained Bechtel\u2019s decisions to fill SFRO-MI positions with Wraith, Siu, Wallace, Vreim, and Stenho. The Undisputed Fact Statement asserted that Wraith was selected to do \u201cproject and proposals work based on his familiarity with project work and PFSR experience.\u201d Guz\u2019s response claimed this was \u201c[disputed,\u201d but his required citation of supporting evidence (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b))\u2014a passage from Tevis\u2019s deposition\u2014did not materially contradict Bechtel\u2019s claim. The Undisputed Fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Statement said Siu was selected \u201cto perform [ORS] input based on her familiarity with the ORS and her grade level.\u201d Guz responded that this was \u201c[u]ndisputed,\u201d except that by considering Siu\u2019s grade level, Tevis also necessarily considered her salary. Finally, the Undisputed Fact Statement set forth the particular qualifications that led Tevis to choose Wallace, Vreim, and Stenho for the positions they filled. Again, in his response, Guz raised no material dispute to the reasons given by Bechtel. Guz also admitted he had recommended SFRO-MI member Shaeffer as the logical choice to assume Guz\u2019s duties if Guz were laid off. Thus, much of Bechtel\u2019s explanation for the reasons, unrelated to Guz\u2019s age, that led to Guz\u2019s termination stands uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Guz nonetheless stresses several bases for finding that Bechtel\u2019s reasons were pretextual. With respect to the decision to eliminate BNI-MI, Guz emphasizes that over time Bechtel has phrased in different ways its reasons for taking this action. Thus, Guz notes, Goldstein told him the decision to transfer BNI-MI\u2019s functions to SFRO-MI was to reduce costs, but in Guz\u2019s official layoff notice, Goldstein\u2019s superior, Dewey, blamed BNI-MI\u2019s demise on a \u201cdownturn in our workload.\u201d Such \u201cshifting,\u201d and \u201cinconsistent\u201d statements, Guz urges, are evidence of dissembling. Guz further points to evidence that Bechtel\u2019s purported reasons for eliminating BNI-MI were unsound, and therefore likely untrue, in that Bechtel\u2019s business was strong, and that the elimination of BNI-MI would not save costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">However, as noted above, Guz has essentially conceded that the reasons cited by Bechtel in support of its motion for summary judgment\u2014cost efficiency and concerns about BNI-MI\u2019s performance as a <em>unit\u2014were the true reasons </em>why Bechtel decided to eliminate BNI-MI. Hence, even if a Bechtel official once used the phrase \u201cdownturn in . . . workload,\u201d and even if the cost efficiencies of eliminating BNI-MI are debatable on their merits, such facts are of little or no relevance in determining that Bechtel\u2019s cited reasons were a mask for prohibited age discrimination.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Guz also suggests a triable issue that Bechtel has given pretextual reasons why he was selected for layoff. Here Guz cites Bechtel\u2019s \u201cunexplained\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>failure to follow its RIF Guidelines, in that Bechtel laid him off without conducting a formal force ranting, did not help him find a new Bechtel job while he was on holding status, and did not fairly consider him for the vacant SFRO-MI positions. On the latter points, Guz stresses evidence from Tevis\u2019s deposition that Tevis never saw Guz\u2019s resume and was unaware of Guz\u2019s full qualifications and availability. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 331.) Moreover, Guz points out, Tevis admitted, after seeing Guz\u2019s resume for the first time, that he might have considered Guz qualified for certain of the SFRO-MI jobs. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Guz suggests that in any event, Tevis\u2019s excuses for failing to consider him are inherently implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">However, neither any failure by Bechtel to conduct the reorganization with full formality, nor Tevis\u2019s lack of complete information about Guz\u2019s background and availability, strongly suggests that the reasons Bechtel gave for releasing Guz are false. As we have already seen, in his response to Bechtel\u2019s summary judgment motion, Guz made major concessions to both the plausibility and the truthfulness of Bechtel\u2019s proffered reasons. Essentially uncontradicted are Bechtel\u2019s showings (1) that Guz himself proposed Shaeffer as the logical choice to assume Guz\u2019s overhead duties, (2) that Tevis had non-age-related business reasons for hiring Wraith, Siu, Wallace, Vreim, and Stenho, and (3) that those persons were well qualified for their positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Moreover, Guz has raised no serious dispute to Tevis\u2019s testimony that Goldstein recommended Wraith and Siu over Guz and advised Tevis that in the area of computer stills, an important qualification for most of the SFRO-MI jobs, Guz was relatively deficient. Guz has submitted a declaration by Goldstein, who states therein that Guz was qualified for the vacant SFRO-MI positions. However, Goldstein does not contradict Tevis\u2019s claims about their discussions concerning Guz. Indeed, in his most recent written evaluation of Guz, issued in March 1992, Goldstein had stated that for long-term success in the company, Guz needed to become more \u201ccomputer literate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Nor is there any evidence or inference of Bechtel\u2019s bad faith effort to prevent or impede Guz\u2019s fair consideration for suitable Bechtel positions. For all that appears, any such lapse arose, as much as anything, from Guz\u2019s own inaction. As noted above <em>(ante, </em>at p. 331), Guz asserts no personal efforts to find a Bechtel reassignment. In particular,- it. appears Guz did not proffer his resume to Tevis, though he knew Tevis\u2019s unit was assuming BNI-MI\u2019s functions, and he could easily have taken that step.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Thus, despite Bechtel\u2019s policy to provide placement assistance to laid-off employees, Tevis\u2019s testimony that he lacked full information about Guz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>skills or availability and did not fully consider Guz is neither implausible nor ominous, but understandable. For Bechtel\u2019s part, it is undisputed that the company renewed Guz\u2019s initial three-month holding status for a second three months, in order to afford Guz additional time, while receiving company benefits, to find a suitable reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">In sum, we see no grounds in this record for an inference that Bechtel has materially dissembled in explaining the reasons, unrelated to chronological age, for the personnel decisions leading to Guz\u2019s dismissal. Under such circumstances, any independent circumstantial evidence of discrimination is insufficient to raise a rational inference that Bechtel acted on grounds of prohibited bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">At the outset, Bechtel insists that an inference of intentional age discrimination is negated solely by the fact that Shaeffer, an <em>older </em>employee, assumed most of the duties Guz was performing before he was laid off. Guz responds by citing facts he claims amount to a prima facie showing that age bias infected the various personnel decisions leading to his release. Stripped to its essentials, Guz\u2019s case relies on the facts that despite his own qualifications and satisfactory performance, (1) he, then age 49, and three of the other five BNI-MI employees (respectively ages 50, 45, and 44) were terminated by Bechtel after that unit\u2019s elimination, while the only two persons retained, Wraith, age 41, and Siu, age 34, were the youngest of the group, and (2) two of the three persons later hired by SFRO-MI while Guz was on holding status\u2014Wallace, age 43, and Stenho, age 38\u2014were significantly younger than he.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Where an age-protected worker is directly replaced by a person not significantly younger, there may be no basis to suspect a motive of prohibited bias. (E.g., <em>Maxfleld v. Sinclair Intern. </em>(3d Cir. 1985) 766 F.2d 788, 793; cf. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp. </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 308 [116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433] (O\u2019Connor) [logical inference of age discrimination may arise where replacement is significantly younger, even if not below statutorily protected age].) But where jobs are eliminated and duties reallocated during a general work force reduction, the issue of discriminatory motive becomes more complicated. In the context of a work force reduction, it has been said that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove his direct \u201c \u2018replacement by a younger employee is \u201cnot necessarily fatal\u201d \u2019\u201d to a claim of discrimination; instead, he need only show, prima facie, that persons significantly younger, but otherwise similarly situated, were \u201c \u2018treated more favorably.\u2019\u201d <em>(Nidds, supra, </em>113 F.3d 912, 917, quoting <em>Washington v. Garrett </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 10 F.3d 1421, 1434; but see, e.g., <em>Barnes v. GenCorp Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1990) 896 F.2d 1457, 1465; <em>Simpson v. Midland-Ross Corp. </em>(6th Cir. 1987) 823 F.2d 937, 942-944 <em>{Simpson).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>A number of federal decisions have applied the more-favorable-treatment principle to conclude, on facts somewhat analogous to those before us, that a prima facie inference of discrimination can arise from evidence that during a work force reduction, a satisfactory age-protected worker was laid off, while younger employees were retained in similar jobs, or were reassigned to positions for which the plaintiff also qualified. (E.g., <em>Jameson v. Arrow Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1996) 75 F.3d 1528, 1533 [older layoff candidate applied for new assignment fitting his qualifications, but was rejected for younger person]; <em>Cronin, supra, </em>46 F.3d 196, 204 [during work force reduction, employer located positions for younger, but not older, employees]; <em>Branson </em>v. <em>Price River Coal Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1988) 853 F.2d 768, <em>111 </em>[employer fired older employees but retained younger employees in similar positions]; <em>Coburn v. Pan American World Airways, Inc. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1983) 711 F.2d 339, 342 [229 App.D.C. 61] [evidence that during work force reduction, plaintiff was \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in favor of younger person]; see also <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>Mohawk Rubber Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1989) 872 F.2d 1104, 1111 [evidence that while age-protected worker was laid off, younger workers were retained in the same position].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">However, in other cases where alleged numerical favoritism of younger workers arose within an extremely small employee pool, courts have rejected any consequent inference of intentional bias on grounds, among others, that the sample was too minuscule to demonstrate a statistically reliable discriminatory pattern. (See, e.g., <em>Fallis v. Kerr-McGee Corp. </em>(10th Cir. 1991) 944 F.2d 743, 745-746 [showing that a greater percentage of over-40 than under-40 workers were laid off is nonprobative because the relevant sample, 51 employees, was too small for statistical reliability]; <em>Sengupta v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 804 F.2d 1072, 1076 [showing that, among 28 employees, four of five laid off were Black did not establish prima facie case; statistical sample too small]; see also <em>Simpson, supra, </em>823 F.2d 937, 943 [even if \u201cage-weighted departure\u201d evidence, based on statistics, established prima facie case, it was insufficient to withstand employer\u2019s strong showing of performance-based reasons, where sample was based on only 17 persons]; cf. <em>Mayor v. Educational Equality League </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 605, 611 [94 S.Ct. 1323, 1329, 39 L.Ed.2d 630] [where citizen committee appointed by mayor had only 13 positions, statistical showing of race discrimination in appointments was not reliable where a change of only one person \u201cmeant an 8% change in racial composition\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Here, for several reasons, we conclude the comparative-age evidence cited by Guz, even if barely adequate to demonstrate a prima facie case, is insufficient for trial in the face of Bechtel\u2019s strong contrary showing that its reasons were unrelated to age-related bias. In the first place, the statistical inferences to be drawn from Guz\u2019s raw age comparisons are not nearly as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>strong as he implies. As suggested above, the premise that Bechtel purposely favored two workers on the basis of youth when deciding which BNI-MI employees to retain is weakened, for statistical purposes, by the small size of that unit, which included only six persons. A similar analysis applies to the three other positions for which Guz claims, or implies, he should have been considered at SFRO-MI.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Any arguable discriminatory inference is further diluted by other age-based evidence from which a contrary conclusion might be drawn. Thus, while it is not <em>dispositive </em>that, consistent with Guz\u2019s earlier recommendation, his own duties went to an <em>older </em>worker, Shaeffer, that fact significantly <em>undermines </em>any suspicion that chronological age influenced Guz\u2019s dismissal. Similar doubt arises from the fact that at age 52, Vreim, one of the three workers later selected for an open position in SFRO-MI, was also older than Guz.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Moreover, an issue arises whether the younger persons with whom Guz seeks comparison were younger <em>enough </em>to raise a logical suspicion of intentional age bias. Courts have differed about the exact gap in age that is significant for purposes of a discriminatory inference. (See, e.g., <em>Koster v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>(1st Cir. 1999) 181 F.3d 24, 31 [applying Massachusetts law: prima facie case is established where duties of 49- and 48-year-olds were partially assumed by 25-year-old]; <em>Schiltz v. Burlington Northern R.R. </em>(8th Cir. 1997) 115 F.3d 1407, 1413 [five-year age gap between plaintiff applicant and persons selected is not significant]; <em>Barber </em>v. <em>CSX Distribution Services </em>(3d Cir. 1995) 68 F.3d 694, 699 [eight-year difference between plaintiff and successful applicant is significant]; <em>Healy </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(3d Cir. 1988) 860 F.2d 1209, 1214 [replacement of 56-year-old senior manager by person nine years younger is significant]; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 656 F.2d 528, 533 [replacement of 54-year-old bookstore manager by person five years younger is significant].) One federal circuit follows the rule that any gap less than 10 years is presumptively <em>insignificant, </em>but the plaintiff can overcome the presumption with other evidence that the employer considered his age significant. <em>(Hartley </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Bell, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 124 F.3d 887, 892-893; see also <em>Richter, supra, </em>142 F.3d 1024, 1029.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Here, Wraith, one of the two reassigned BNI-MI employees, and Wallace, who took one of the later open positions at SFRO-MI, were, like Guz, in their mid-career 40\u2019s. Wraith, at 41, was eight years younger than the 49-year-old Guz, and Wallace, at 43, was only six years younger. There is no independent indication whatever that Bechtel considered the age differences among these three workers significant. Of the four younger persons Guz alleges were treated more favorably than he, only two were over 10 years younger. Guz does not dispute that one of these two, the 38-year-old Stenho, was uniquely qualified for her SFRO-MI job; she was hired, at the specific request of Bechtel Civil, to provide service to that office, where she had previously worked. (See discussion, <em>ante.) </em>Under these circumstances, Guz\u2019s arithmetic does not, in our view, strongly support a logical inference \u201c \u2018that [Bechtel\u2019s] employment decisions] [were] based on a[n] [illegal] discriminatory criterion.\u2019\u201d <em>(O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>517 U.S. 308, 312 [116 S.Ct. 1307, 1310], quoting <em>Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. 324, 358 [97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866], first three brackets added, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Any inference that Guz\u2019s raw age comparisons indicate age-based discrimination is further blurred by the weak evidence that the workers retained or hired over him were similar or comparable except for their dates of birth. Guz does not appear to dispute that the six individual members of the eliminated unit, BNI-MI, performed distinct duties at disparate ranks and levels of responsibility. The available SFRO-MI positions were also distinct, and it appears essentially undisputed that those jobs were filled by persons who fit their individual requirements as well as, or better than, Guz. As previously noted, most of these positions required considerable computer facility, while Guz\u2019s skills in this area were mediocre at best. The qualifications for Stenho\u2019s position essentially excluded any other candidate for that job. These variances undermine any rational conclusion from the raw age data that age was a significant factor in Bechtel\u2019s decisions to choose others instead of Guz.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In sum, even without considering Bechtel\u2019s explanation, Guz\u2019s evidence raised, at best, only a weak suspicion that discrimination was a likely basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>for his release. Against that evidence, Bechtel has presented a plausible, and largely uncontradicted, explanation that it eliminated BNI-MI, and chose others over Guz, for reasons unrelated to age. Indeed, Guz has raised little argument against Bechtel\u2019s further claim that, even if he was minimally qualified for the positions he lost, those persons who were actually chosen better fit Bechtel\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Under these circumstances we conclude, as a matter of law, that Guz has failed to point to evidence raising a triable issue that Bechtel\u2019s proffered reasons for its actions were a pretext for prohibited age discrimination. Bechtel is therefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed. The cause is remanded to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">George, C.

The American Association of Retired Persons has filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Guz.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Bechtel and one of its amici curiae have questioned whether such traditional standards apply to this case. Bechtel suggests that, to survive summary judgment, <em>Guz </em>had the burden to present evidence of an implied employment security agreement sufficient to overcome the statutory presumption of at-will employment (see discussion, <em>post), </em>and also to establish, under the generally accepted three-step procedure for testing such claims (see discussion, <em>post), </em>a prima facie case of intentional age discrimination. The California Chamber of Commerce argues more broadly that 1992 and 1993 amendments to the California summary judgment statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c) adopted then <em>extant federal </em>standards, under which a moving defendant could obtain summary judgment solely by showing, after opportunity for discovery, that the <em>opposing plaintiff </em>had <em>failed to present </em>triable evidence crucial to his case (see <em>Celotex Corp. </em>v. <em>Catrett </em>(1986) <em>477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-326 [106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265]). We need not belabor these matters. As we explain below, Bechtel <em>did </em>adduce, in support of its motion for summary judgment, <em>affirmative evidence </em>which, unless materially contradicted or rebutted, would establish that each of Guz\u2019s causes of action lacked merit. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) By any interpretation of the summary judgment statute, the burden thereupon shifted to Guz to show the existence of one or more triable issues of material fact {ibid.; see <em>Calvillo-Silva, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 714, 735), and, as to each cause of action, Guz did submit or point to evidence which, in his view, indicated such triable issues. Thus, as to each count of Guz\u2019s complaint, the issue on appellate review is simply whether, and to what extent, the evidence submitted for and against the motion for summary judgment discloses issues warranting a trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">As this court has explained, the statutory and common law rule presuming that employment contracts without a stated duration are at will is required by \u201c[sjpecial policy considerations.\u201d <em>(Consolidated Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Theatrical Stage Employees Union </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 713, 727, fn. 12 [73 Cal.Rptr. 213, 447 P.2d 325].) \u201c \u2018[T]he courts have not deemed it to be their function, in the absence of contractual, statutory or public policy considerations, to compel a person to accept or retain another in his employ, nor to compel any person against his will to remain in the employ of another.

The date on which Policy 1101 was promulgated is uncertain. However, we do not understand Guz to claim that he had an employment security agreement that <em>predated </em>and <em>arose independently of </em>Policy 1101 and therefore could not be <em>rescinded or cancelled </em>by virtue of Policy 1101 \u2019s belated disclaimer. On the contrary, Guz admits Policy 1101 (necessarily including its disclaimer) applied to him, and he premises his contractual claim on an amalgam of factors, <em>significantly including certain language in Policy 1101 itself. </em>(See discussion herein.) Hence, we may, and do, assume that the disclaimer included in Policy 1101 is a material factor in ascertaining the terms and conditions on which Guz individually was employed by Bechtel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b386-5\">On the other hand, most cases applying California law, both pre- and <em>post-Foley, </em>have held that an at-will provision in an <em>express written agreement, </em>signed by the employee, <em>cannot </em>be overcome by proof of an implied contrary understanding.

Salary in lieu of the requisite advance notice was available in certain circumstances. The RIF Guidelines, which described the specific procedures to be employed during a work force reduction, echoed this disparity in notice rights.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Court of Appeal <em>reinstated </em>the implied covenant claim for trial on the sole ground that Bechtel had waived any objection by malting arguments on appeal that were different from those it had raised in the trial court. Guz asserts that we should leave the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment undisturbed, still without addressing Bechtel\u2019s objections, because the arguments Bechtel now makes are not the same as those it raised in the Court of Appeal. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29(b)(1).) Under the present unusual circumstances, we deem it appropriate to address Bechtel\u2019s implied covenant arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"Afr\">In the trial court, Bechtel urged that (1) the implied covenant imposes no independent limits on an employer\u2019s termination rights, and (2) in any event, there is no evidence Bechtel acted in bad faith. In the Court of Appeal, appellant Guz asserted that Bechtel breached the implied covenant by violating its personnel policies even if Guz was an at-will employee. Bechtel responded only that it did not act in bad faith. The Court of Appeal, mistakenly asserting that Bechtel had not raised the bad faith argument below, concluded that Bechtel\u2019s \u201cchange of theory\u201d on appeal waived its challenge to the implied covenant claim. The Court of Appeal reinstated all causes of action, including that alleging a breach of the implied covenant. In its rehearing petition, Bechtel did not call the Court of Appeal\u2019s waiver error to its attention. (See Cal.

Bechtel\u2019s brief on the merits in this <em>court </em>contends that the trial court properly dismissed the implied covenant cause of action.

However, there appear several reasons not to do so. First, the \u201cindependent limits\u201d issue <em>was </em>before the Court of Appeal by virtue of appellant Guz\u2019s brief, and the Court of Appeal\u2019s waiver analysis is highly suspect. Second, even though Bechtel did not fully litigate the implied.covenant issue in the Court of Appeal, the matter is now fully briefed, squarely presented, and of substantial significance. Finally, and significantly, there seems little merit in allowing the <em>reinstatement </em>of a spurious cause of action\u2014the result imposed by the Court of Appeal\u2014on grounds that the defendant has waived, in the appellate courts, an issue on which it properly succeeded in the trial court. We therefore address the implied covenant issue on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We are not persuaded otherwise by a brief dictum in <em>Scott, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 454. There, the jury found the employer had breached an implied-in-fact contract not to <em>demote </em>without good cause; the issue before us in <em>Scott </em>was whether such a contract was enforceable. We answered that question in the affirmative, and we found ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s breach-of-contract verdict. In a footnote, we observed that the jury had also reached a plaintiff\u2019s verdict on the separate cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, but we declined to address that claim. Wfe remarked; \u201cSince breach of the implied-in-law covenant of good faith claim is basically a contract claim <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d [654,] 700), the former claim only becomes an issue <em>when there is insufficient evidence to find an implied-in-fact contract not to terminate or demote. </em>In this case, we are not called on to decide what independent significance a good faith covenant claim may have, since the jury found that there was an implied-in-fact contract not to demote.\u201d <em>(Scott, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 462, fn. 2, italics added.) Thus, <em>Scott </em>expressly declined to resolve what \u201cindependent significance\u201d an implied covenant claim may have. Moreover, to the extent <em>Scott </em>hinted that the implied covenant may have independent significance in cases where there is insufficient evidence of an implied-in-fact contract, the suggestion contravenes the persuasive reasoning of <em>Foley.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">We do not suggest the covenant of good faith and fair dealing has no function whatever in the interpretation and enforcement of employment contracts. As indicated above, the covenant prevents a party from acting in bad faith to frustrate the contract\u2019s <em>actual </em>benefits.

Here, as will appear, Guz\u2019s circumstantial evidence of intentional discrimination, even if fully credited and technically sufficient to establish a prima facie case, raises, at most, a weak inference of prohibited bias. Moreover, the concurring and dissenting opinion does not dispute that Guz\u2019s responses to discovery <em>largely conceded the truth </em>of Bechtel\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanations for its actions. (See discussion, <em>post.) </em>Under such circumstances, <em>Reeves </em>supports our conclusion that the evidence, viewed as a whole, does not give rise to a rational inference of discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Aside from his responses to the Undisputed Fact Statement, Guz has separately acknowledged the truth of Bechtel\u2019s claim that unit performance was a major factor in Johnstone\u2019s decision to eliminate BNI-MI. Guz has cited Johnstone\u2019s testimony to that effect in aid of his claim that Bechtel breached its implied contractual obligations by failing to apply its written progressive discipline rules before terminating the BNI-MI group for performance reasons.

(Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 379.) However, as indicated above, SFRO-MI gained only <em>three </em>new positions attributable to work formerly done by the six members of BNI-MI. Former BNI-MI members Wraith and Siu were added to SFRO-MI\u2019s staff to do BNI-related work, and SFRO-MI member Wallace was appointed to a new position supervising SFRO-MI\u2019s new relationship with BNI. But Jan Vreim, Wallace\u2019s former SFRO-MI subordinate, was simply promoted to Wallace\u2019s old position, and Barbara Stenho was appointed to an existing SFRO-MI job, formerly held by Robert Luchini, that had nothing to do with BNI.

Similarly, if SFRO-MI\u2019s manager, Tevis, had made <em>only one </em>different personnel decision when filling the three later open positions, so that two of the three, rather than only one of the three, were filled by persons older than Guz, Guz would have no statistical claim that Bechtel\u2019s failure to consider him for those jobs was the result of age discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In his deposition, James Tevis indicated that the SFRO-MI position for which Christine Sin was hired was a junior one, commensurate with her salary grade, three steps lower than Guz\u2019s. Tevis conceded he considered Siu\u2019s salary level in selecting her for the job. Before 1999, both state and federal decisions had rejected the premise that prohibited age discrimination may be shown solely by evidence that the employer\u2019s actions were taken for economic reasons often <em>related </em>to worker age, such as comparative salaries. <em>(Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Biggins </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 604 [113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338] [firing of long-term employee to prevent imminent vesting of pension rights did not violate federal age discrimination law]; <em>Marks v.

In 1999, however, the Legislature amended the FEHA to overrule <em>Marks. </em>(Gov. Code, \u00a7 12941.1, added by Stats. 1999, ch. 222, \u00a7 2.) The new statute declares that <em>Marks </em>\u201cdoes not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>affect existing law\u201d governing state age discrimination claims, and states the Legislature\u2019s \u201cintent that the use of salary as the basis for differentiating between employees when terminating employment may be found to constitute age discrimination if use of that criterion adversely impacts older workers <em>as a group.\u201d </em>(Gov. Code, \u00a7 12941.1, italics added.) Guz has occasionally insinuated that Bechtel\u2019s decisions, particularly the elimination of BNI-MI and the retention of Siu, were discriminatory efforts to reduce salaries by releasing higher-paid older workers. However, Guz has never made a developed claim to that effect, and he has never cited section 12941.1. In any event, while Bechtel concedes that Johnstone sought to save costs by eliminating BNI-MI, any evidence that the motive was to eliminate senior salaries is no greater or different than the evidence that the decision disfavored older workers <em>directly. </em>Nor did Tevis\u2019s decision to select one junior employee, Siu, for a junior position have a disparate impact on older workers <em>as a group.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b416-8\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azu\">I concur in the majority opinion. I write separately to clarify what may appear to be an inconsistency between parts II and IV of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In part II, the majority hold that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Bechtel National, Inc.\u2019s (BNI) business reorganization was merely a pretext to terminate John Guz. There is therefore no triable issue that BNI breached its implied contractual obligation by failing to follow the \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d policy promised in its policy manual to its employees before they are discharged for poor performance. The majority do not decide, however, whether there is a triable issue regarding BNI\u2019s breach of its own layoff policies, and leave this question to the Court of Appeal on remand. If the Court of Appeal concludes there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>such a triable issue, and if Guz is able to prove at trial that these policies were breached, and that if he had been fairly considered for a position as dictated in the policies, he would more likely than not have retained his job, then Guz will have proved a contractual wrongful termination and be eligible for the usual damages associated with such a termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In part IV, the majority conclude that there is insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that BNI\u2019s termination of Guz was based on age discrimination. In so doing, the majority view this case as fitting into the class of cases discussed in <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 133, 148-149 [120 S.Ct. 2097, 2109, 147 L.Ed.2d 105], in which \u201calthough the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant\u2019s explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.\u201d The <em>Reeves </em>court elaborated, by way of example, that \u201can employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\u201d (530 U.S. at p. 148 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2109].) Although the question is close, I agree with the majority that, in light of Guz\u2019s concessions as to the nondiscriminatory nature of many of BNI\u2019s actions, and in light of the weakness of Guz\u2019s prima facie case, this case fits into the relatively narrow class of cases referred to in <em>Reeves.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Nonetheless, although BNI apparently had a nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Guz, that is not to conclude that it necessarily complied with its own contractual layoff policies. Nor does it negate the possibility that had it so complied, Guz would have retained his employment. These possibilities remain to be determined on remand and, if appropriate, at trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b417-7\">CHIN, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AOz\">I agree with the majority. I write separately to state another reason the trial court correctly granted summary judgment against plaintiff John Guz on the age discrimination claim: Even after \u201cextensive discovery\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 327), Guz has produced no credible evidence that defendants Bechtel National, Inc., and Bechtel Corporation (collectively Bechtel) discharged him because of his age. Bechtel, the moving party on summary judgment, has met its burden of showing that Guz cannot state a prima facie age discrimination case. Accordingly, Bechtel had no duty even to rebut Guz\u2019s age discrimination claim, although I agree that it also did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>I.

It is not onerous, but the plaintiff must show that the employer\u2019s actions, if unexplained, support an inference that they were more likely than not based on a prohibited discriminatory criterion.

(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 356-357.) California\u2019s traditional rule was that to prevail on summary judgment, a \u201cdefendant must conclusively negate a necessary element of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and demonstrate that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of a trial.\u201d <em>(Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46].) In 1992 and 1993, however, the Legislature amended Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, the statute concerning summary judgment. (See generally <em>Union Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 581-584 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 653].) Today, as relevant, Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (o)(2), provides that a defendant has met its burden on summary judgment \u201cof showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. The plaintiff. . . may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>This court has not yet considered the effect of these amendments in a discrimination case. The Courts of Appeal have, however, considered this question in detail, and not always consistently. (See, e.g., the exhaustive discussion in <em>Scheiding v. Dinwiddle Construction Co. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 69-83 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 360] <em>(Scheiding).) </em>Some courts have held that to prevail on summary judgment, the defendant need merely point to the plaintiff\u2019s lack of evidence establishing a prima facie case. <em>(Hersant v. Department of Social Services </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 997, 1002 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 483] [\u201cThe burden-shifting system requires the employee first establish a prima facie case of age discrimination\u201d]; <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Cushman &amp; Wakefield Western, Inc. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 798, 806 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 459]; <em>Caldwell v. Paramount Unified School Dist., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 203 [\u201cThus, the burdens of proof for purposes of a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment are precisely the same as those mandated by <em>McDonnell Douglas\u201d).) </em>Others have required the defendant to prove the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s inability to prove its own case . . . .\u201d <em>(Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 952, 959 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 821], italics omitted.) Others have suggested that because the moving party must negate the plaintiff\u2019s right to prevail on a particular issue, the burden is reversed on summary judgment. <em>(Sada v. Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 138, 150 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 112]; <em>Addy v. Bliss &amp; Glennon </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 205, 216 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 642].)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">I believe the Court of Appeal cases can generally be reconciled. The recent decisions recognize that Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision <em>(o)(2), </em>significantly changed California summary judgment law. To prevail on summary judgment, the defendant no longer must conclusively negate the plaintiff\u2019s case. Given the difficulty of proving a negative, such a test is often impossibly high. However, the statute also places an initial burden on the defendant in order to prevail on summary judgment. As explained in <em>Scheiding, </em>the differences in the cases can largely be described as differing degrees of caution rather than outright disagreement. <em>(Scheiding, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 82-83.) That case quoted with approval <em>(ibid.) </em>most of the following discussion in <em>Hagen v. Hickenbottom </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 168 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 197]: \u201cWe cannot agree with those who may be understood to suggest that a moving defendant may shift the burden simply by suggesting the possibility that the plaintiff cannot prove its case. It is clear to us, from the requirement . . . that a defendant have \u2018shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, former subd. (n)(2) [now subd. (g)(2)]; . . .), that a defendant must make an affirmative <em>showing </em>in support of his or her motion. Such a showing connotes something significantly more than simply \u2018pointing out to the . . . court\u2019 that \u2018there is an absence of evidence\u2019: before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the burden of producing even a prima facie case should be shifted to the plaintiff in advance of trial, a defendant who cannot negate an element of the plaintiff\u2019s case should be required to produce direct or circumstantial evidence that the plaintiff not only does not have but cannot reasonably expect to obtain a prima facie case. But where such a showing can be made we consider it both fair to the defendant and consistent with efficient administration of justice that the plaintiff be called upon, on risk of summary judgment, to make a prima facie case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">I think this discussion aptly summarizes the law. To prevail on summary judgment in a discrimination case, the defendant must show that the plaintiff both has not established and cannot reasonably expect to establish a prima facie case. A defendant can meet the former burden merely by showing the absence of evidence of discrimination. But that is not enough. The defendant must also show, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the plaintiff cannot reasonably expect to obtain a prima facie case. This latter showing, however, is not impossibly difficult. If a plaintiff has had the full opportunity to obtain discovery and to present all available evidence in support of a discrimination claim, and still has failed to establish a prima facie case, the trial court may reasonably infer that the plaintiff cannot do so. If the plaintiff cannot present a prima facie case, a nonsuit at trial would be inevitable. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 581c; <em>Caldwell v. Paramount Unified School Dist, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at pp. 203-204.) In that case, the trial court should grant summary judgment and avoid a useless trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">II. The Legal Standard Applied to This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Bechtel has shown that Guz had a full opportunity to discover and present all available evidence, and that he nonetheless has not stated a prima facie case of age discrimination. This showing meets Bechtel\u2019s burden of establishing that Guz cannot state a prima facie case, thus entitling it to summary judgment on this cause of action. Despite extensive discovery, Guz can point to no comments by anyone during his entire lengthy history with Bechtel suggesting age played a role in employment decisions in general, or in his case in particular, no meaningful statistical evidence, no evidence even of a possible financial or other motive for Bechtel to get rid of its older workers. He cites no evidence suggesting that age was a significant factor in Bechtel\u2019s layoff decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">It is true that Guz was a member of the protected class, but that fact alone proves nothing. In a reduction in force, many qualified, productive workers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>both within and outside a protected class, lose their positions. Older workers may be laid off just like younger ones. The laws against age discrimination do not \u201c \u2018required that younger employees be fired so that employees in the protected age group can be hired.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Earley v. Champion Intern. Corp. </em>(11th Cir. 1990) 907 F.2d 1077, 1083; see also <em>Vaughan v. MetraHealth Companies, Inc. </em>(4th Cir. 1998) 145 F.3d 197, 204 [age discrimination laws are not \u201csomething akin to a strict seniority protection system\u201d]; <em>Jameson v. Arrow Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1996) 75 F.3d 1528, 1532-1533.) Accordingly, \u201cthe decision to discharge a qualified, older employee is not inherently suspicious. ... In a [reduction in force], qualified employees are going to be discharged.\u201d <em>(Brocklehurst </em>v. <em>PPG Industries, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1997) 123 F.3d 890, 896.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Like the concurring and dissenting opinion, Guz relies largely on two circumstances to support the age discrimination claim. The first is that, of three positions that employees other than Guz filled while Guz was on holding status, younger employees filled two, and an older employee filled only one. This fact is meaningless. Even aside from the minuscule size of the sampling (see <em>post), </em>Guz does not tell us the average age of persons eligible or considered for these positions. If a majority of those persons were younger than Guz, a majority of those given the positions would likely also be younger. Guz \u201cdid not even attempt to place his figures in a relevant context so as to make them meaningful. . . . HO . . . [H]e neglects vital information regarding the pool of applicants and whether, for example, qualified older employees were available or applied for those jobs. . . . [Ejmployee statistics unaccompanied by evidence regarding qualified potential applicants from the relevant labor market . . . lack[] probative value.\u201d <em>(Simpson </em>v. <em>Midland-Ross Corp. </em>(6th Cir. 1987) 823 F.2d 937, 943.) Guz\u2019s related arguments regarding his qualifications relative to those retained does not aid him. \u201cAs courts are not free to second-guess an employer\u2019s business judgment, this assertion [that plaintiff was equally or more qualified than the people retained] is insufficient to permit a finding of pretext.\u201d <em>(Branson </em>v. <em>Price River Coal Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1988) 853 F.2d 768, 772.) \u201cThus, plaintiff\u2019s general dispute concerning his job performance, in the absence of any other evidence of age discrimination, does not provide a sufficient basis for a jury to infer that [the employer] terminated plaintiff on the basis of his age.\u201d <em>(Fallis </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp. </em>(10th Cir. 1991) 944 F.2d 743, 747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The second circumstance Guz cites comes closest to presenting evidence that might suggest age discrimination: Of the six persons in his unit, Bechtel retained the youngest two. This fact also fails to arouse suspicion for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">First, a group of six is simply too small to be statistically significant. \u201cFor [the plaintiff] to show a prima facie case of disparate treatment based solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>on statistics he must show a 1 \u201cstark\u201d pattern\u2019 of discrimination unexplainable on grounds other than age.\u201d <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 794 F.2d 534, 539; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 902 F.2d 1417, 1423.) In <em>Mayor v. Educational Equality League </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 605 [94 S.Ct. 1323, 39 L.Ed.2d 630], the United States Supreme Court found of \u201cno significance\u201d statistics based on a group of 13, \u201c[i]n large part. . . because the number of positions . . . was too small to provide a reliable sample.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 611 [94 S.Ct. at p. 1329]; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 612 [94 S.Ct. at p. 1329].) A change of only one person \u201cmeant an 8% change in racial composition.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 611 [94 S.Ct. at p. 1329].) Here, the numbers are even smaller. A <em>single </em>change\u2014retaining the 50 year old and laying off the 34 year old\u2014would not have affected Bechtel\u2019s actions towards Guz in the slightest but would have made the statistics show action <em>favoring </em>older persons. Many cases have found no statistical significance with groups larger than six. (E.g., <em>Vaughan v. MetraHealth Companies, Inc., supra, </em>145 F.3d at p. 203 [\u201ca sample of seven employees ... is too small for reliable analysis\u201d]; <em>Brocklehurst v. PPG Industries, Inc., supra, </em>123 F.3d at p. 897 [group of 14 is too small]; <em>Fallis v. Kerr-McGee Corp., supra, </em>944 F.2d at p. 746 [group of nine \u201cis too small to provide reliable statistical results\u201d]; <em>Simpson v. Midland-Ross Corp., supra, </em>823 F.2d at p. 943 &amp; fn. 7, and cases cited [reliance on a sample of 17 is \u201csuspect\u201d]; <em>Sengupta </em>v. <em>Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 804 F.2d 1072, 1076 [group of 28 is too small].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Second, Bechtel did not systematically replace older persons with substantially younger ones. Of the six in Guz\u2019s group, all but one were in their 40\u2019s (or 50); one was 34. The replacement of a worker with another \u201csubstantially younger than the plaintiff\u2019 <em>{O\u2019Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 313 [116 S.Ct. at p. 1310]) might look suspicious, but not these actions. <em>Hartley v. Wisconsin Bell, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 124 F.3d 887 considered the \u201cquestion: how much older than a replacement does a plaintiff have to be in order to pass <em>O\u2019Connor\u2019s </em>test?\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 892.) \u201cWhile we suspect that the answer depends to some extent on the circumstances in a case, we consider a ten-year difference in ages (between the plaintiff and her replacement) to be presumptively \u2018substantial\u2019 under <em>O\u2019Connor. </em>In cases where the disparity is less, the plaintiff may still present a triable claim if she directs the court to evidence that her employer considered her age to be significant. In that instance, the issue of age disparity would be less relevant. ...[![]... Ten years is a reasonable threshold establishing a \u2018significant\u2019 and \u2018substantial\u2019 gap, which is what <em>O\u2019Connor </em>demands. Yet the line we draw is not so bright as to exclude cases where the gap is smaller but evidence nevertheless reveals the employer\u2019s decision to be motivated by the plaintiff\u2019s age.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 893.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>This assessment seems reasonable. In a given case, the plaintiff might be able to show that an age difference of less than 10 years was significant to the employer. For example, if some important contractual right vested at the age of 50, then replacing a 49 year old with someone younger, even if less than 10 years younger, might be replacing a person with someone substantially younger. But no such evidence exists here. Absent any evidence that Bechtel considered the age differences of persons in their 40\u2019s to be significant, I would find them insignificant. Without more, choosing among various persons in their 40\u2019s gives no cause to suspect age discrimination. Specifically, replacing a 49 year old with a 41 year old is not, by itself, replacing a person with someone <em>substantially </em>younger. Only one person in the group in this case\u2014the 34 year old\u2014was substantially younger than Guz.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Third, the members of the group of six had different qualifications and performed different duties. \u201c[A] plaintiff\u2019s statistical evidence must focus on eliminating nondiscriminatory explanations for the disparate treatment by showing disparate treatment between <em>comparable </em>individuals.\u201d <em>(Fallis </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp., supra, </em>944 F.2d at p. 746.) \u201c[T]here must be evidence that [those over 40] had positions and performance ratings that were comparable to [those under 40] who were retained.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 747.) Here, the group was quite disparate. One, for example, was a secretary, who had duties not remotely similar to Guz\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Fourth, any slight weight we may give to plaintiffs statistics is negated by the fact that Guz\u2019s <em>own duties </em>were largely assumed by someone <em>older </em>than he. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 366.) This fact, even if not itself dispositive, eliminates any suspicious inference that may be drawn from Bechtel\u2019s retaining the two youngest of Guz\u2019s group. \u201c[T]he fact that [the employer] replaced [plaintiff] with [an] even older [employee] contradicts [plaintiff\u2019s] claims of discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>(Brocklehurst v. PPG Industries, Inc., supra, </em>123 F.3d at p. 897.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Guz also argues that Bechtel did not follow its own fair layoff procedures, and that this circumstance supports his discrimination claim. The argument is factually dubious but even if correct would fail to suggest age discrimination. A mere failure to follow formal internal policies does not support a discrimination claim. In <em>Vaughan, </em>the employer had an \u201celaborate Downsizing Policy . . . memorialized in a 144-page Downsizing Manual.\u201d <em>(Vaughan </em>v. <em>MetraHealth Companies, Inc., supra, </em>145 F.3d at p. 200.) \u201c. . . Cooper, who made the decision to discharge [the plaintiff], admitted he was not familiar with the Downsizing Manual, [and] had never read it. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the \u201cdistrict court noted . . . various differences between the Downsizing Manual and Cooper\u2019s actual decision-making process.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 201.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>But this showing was not sufficient to support the discrimination claim. \u201cThe plaintiff must have developed some evidence on which a juror could reasonably base a finding that discrimination motivated the challenged employment action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 202.) The employer\u2019s failure \u201cto follow its own Manual . . . does not even hint that the real motive was age discrimination. \u2018The mere fact that an employer failed to follow its own internal <em>procedures </em>does not necessarily suggest that the employer was motivated by illegal discriminatory intent.\u2019 <em>Randle v. City of Aurora, </em>69 F.3d 441, 454 (10th Cir. 1995). Federal courts cannot ensure that business decisions are always informed or even methodical.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 203; see also <em>Rose v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., supra, 902 </em>F.2d at p. 1422; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1993) 990 F.2d 812, 819.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Guz\u2019s inability to present any credible evidence to establish his age discrimination claim supports the superior court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Bechtel\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Much of the concurring and dissenting opinion is irrelevant to the majority\u2019s holding. The majority does not suggest that age discrimination is lawful; it clearly is not. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12941, subd. (a); see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 353, fn. 19.) The majority merely holds that the <em>evidence in this case </em>does not suggest Bechtel engaged in age discrimination. For example, the discussion of <em>Marks v. Loral Corp. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 30 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, <em>post, </em>at p. 382) is utterly irrelevant.

Guz was one of six employees in BNI\u2019s management information unit (BNI-MI); he was a financial reports manager, making $71,280 a year. That year, during a phase of corporate reorganization, Bechtel eliminated BNI-MI and transferred its functions to Bechtel\u2019s San Francisco Regional Office Management Information Group (SFRO-MI). Reassigned to SFRO-MI as part of this transfer were BNI-MI\u2019s two youngest members, both of whom held lower grade positions and earned lower salaries than Guz. Shortly thereafter, SFRO-MI created three new positions, two of which it filled with workers younger than Guz. The younger workers were between seven and 15 years younger than Guz.

Code, \u00a7 12920), making for a more stressful and ultimately less productive work environment.\u201d <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 895 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157].) Thus, the FEHA\u2019s express policy condemning discrimination against older workers benefits the public at large. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Here, plaintiff\u2019s case is based on a theory of \u201cdisparate treatment,\u201d meaning that because of his age (49 years at the time of discharge), Bechtel treated him less favorably than it did younger workers. (See <em>Martin v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1730 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 181]; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 902 F.2d 1417, 1421.) \u201cThe ultimate question in every employment discrimination case involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>(Reeves v. Sanderson </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 133, 153 [120 S.Ct. 2097, 2111, 147 L.Ed. 105] <em>(Reeves).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In disparate treatment cases, California courts apply the test that the United States Supreme Court articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 792, 802-803 [93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-1825, 36 L.Ed.2d 668] <em>(McDonnell Douglas) </em>to assess such cases when brought under federal law. <em>(Martin v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 1730.) This test governs the allocation of the burden of production and the order for the presentation of proof at the trial of a discrimination case. <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at pp. 142-143 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2106]; <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 502, 506 [113 S.Ct. 2742, 2746-2747, 125 L.Ed.2d 407] <em>(Hicks).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test, a plaintiff employee claiming discrimination has the initial burden to establish \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, a \u2018prima facie\u2019 case of . . . discrimination.\u201d <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 506 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2747]; <em>Texas Dept, of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 248, 252-253 [101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093-1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207] <em>(Burdine).) </em>When, as here, the alleged age discrimination resulting in the employee\u2019s discharge occurs during an employer\u2019s restructuring of its work force, the employee can make a prima facie case based on evidence that the employee (1) was age 40 or older; (2) satisfied the employer\u2019s legitimate expectations of job performance; and (3) the employer treated younger workers more favorably (for instance, by offering them replacement positions denied to the discharged employee). (See <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Budd Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1995) 66 F.3d 886, 889-890; <em>Greene v. Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>(10th Cir. 1996) 98 F.3d 554, 560; see also <em>Jameson </em>v. <em>Arrow Co. </em>(11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Cir. 1996) 75 F.3d 1528, 1533.) With respect to the third factor (more favorable treatment of younger workers), a number of federal appellate courts have pointed out that a discharged employee\u2019s failure to prove replacement by a younger worker does not necessarily defeat a claim of age discrimination if the termination is the result of a general reduction in work force. <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo &amp; Co., supra, </em>902 F.2d at p. 1421; <em>Armbruster v. Unisys Corp. </em>(3d Cir. 1994) 32 F.3d 768, 777; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Package Machinery Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1988) 865 F.2d 1331, 1335, fn. 2. [replacement by a younger person not an element of prima facie age discrimination case].)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Once the discharged employee has established a prima facie case of discrimination, there is a <em>presumption </em>of unlawful discrimination by the employer. <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. 502, 506 [113 S.Ct. 2742, 2746-2747]; <em>Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at p. 254 [101 S.Ct. at p. 1094].) As the high court has explained: \u201cA prima facie case under <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>raises an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors. [Citation.] And we are willing to presume this largely because we know from our experience that more often than not people do not act in a totally arbitrary manner, without any underlying reasons, especially in a business setting. Thus, when all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer\u2019s actions, it is more likely -than not the employer, whom we generally assume acts with some reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration such as race [or age].\u201d <em>(Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 567, 577 [98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949-2950, 57 L.Ed.2d 957], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">If the trier of fact finds the discharged employee\u2019s prima facie case persuasive, and the employer remains silent in the face of the just-described presumption of unlawful discrimination, the trial court \u201cmust enter judgment for the plaintiff because no issue of fact remains in the case.\u201d <em>(Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at p. 254 [101 S.Ct. at p. 1094].) The employer is, of course, free to rebut the presumption by presenting evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination. <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 507 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2747].)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">An employer\u2019s desire to reduce expenses by eliminating some employee positions is not itself a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge of older workers. Chief Judge Richard Posner of the federal Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit explained this in a case alleging disability discrimination during corporate downsizing. \u201cEven if the employer has a compelling reason wholly unrelated to the disabilities of any of its employees to reduce the size of its work force, this does not entitle it to use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of its disabled workers. [Citations.] This point is most easily seen by thinking of a [reduction in work force] as a kind of hiring: the employer has decided to reduce its work force from, say, 100 to 80 employees; this means it has 80 slots to fill and in filling them must choose among 100 \u2018applicants.\u2019 The law forbids the employer to disqualify the disabled applicants on the basis of their disability.\u201d <em>(.Matthews v. Commonwealth Edison Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 128 F.3d 1194, 1195.) This reasoning applies with equal force to a case alleging age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Nor is it sufficient for the employer to show that the discharged older workers earned higher salaries than the younger workers who were retained. Although a Court of Appeal reached a contrary conclusion in <em>Marks v. Loral Corp. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 30 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 1], and this court denied review (Justice Mosk and I voting to grant), the Legislature has since expressly abrogated that decision by declaring \u201cthat the use of salary as the basis for differentiating between employees when terminating employment may be found to constitute age discrimination if use of that criterion adversely impacts older workers as a group, and . . . that the disparate impact theory of proof may be used in claims of age discrimination.\u201d (\u00a7 12941.1, enacted by Stats. 1999, ch. 222, \u00a7 2.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">When, under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-allocation rules, the employer responding to a discharged employee\u2019s prima facie case of age discrimination offers legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the discharge, what countervailing evidence must the employee present to sustain a judgment after trial? This was the question before the United States Supreme Court in Reeves, <em>supra, </em>530 U.S. 133 [120 S.Ct. 2097]. There, the 57-year-old plaintiff had worked for a plumbing manufacturer for 40 years when he was fired. The employees who later filled the plaintiff\u2019s former position were all in their 30\u2019s. At trial, the employer disputed that age was the motivating factor for the discharge, asserting that it terminated the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>because he had not kept accurate records of employee attendance. The jury awarded damages to the plaintiff, but the federal Court of Appeals reversed for insufficiency of evidence. The United States Supreme Court disagreed. Describing the issue as \u201cthe kind and amount of evidence necessary to sustain a jury\u2019s verdict that an employer unlawfully discriminated on the basis of age\u201d <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 137 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2103]), the high court held that the circuit court had \u201cmisconceived the evidentiary burden borne by plaintiffs who attempt to prove intentional discrimination through indirect evidence\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 146 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2108]). That burden could be satisfied by evidence of the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\u2019s asserted justification is false.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 148 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2109].) From such evidence, a trier of fact could reasonably conclude \u201cthat the employer unlawfully discriminated.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Consideration of the evidence here in light of the legal framework discussed, <em>ante, </em>leads to these conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Guz\u2019s evidence presented in opposition to Bechtel\u2019s summary judgment motion was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test: (1) He was over 40 years of age when terminated; (2) his job performance exceeded Bechtel\u2019s legitimate expectations (he was promoted six times, and was given 17 merit raises, and he received a Silver Performance Plus Award for saving the company $1.7 million; his 1991-1992 performance review described him as a \u201cstrong performer in his group\u201d; and in his 22 years at Bechtel, he was never told his skills were deficient); and (3) Bechtel treated younger workers more favorably than older workers by transferring, from the disbanded BNI-MI unit (where Guz was employed) to SFRO-MI and selecting for two of the three new SFRO-MI positions, workers between seven and 15 years younger than Guz; and by retaining the two youngest of the six workers at BNI-MI, while terminating the two oldest. This evidence, if presented at trial and accepted by the fact finder would have given rise to a presumption of age discrimination that, if unrebutted by Bechtel, would require entry of judgment for plaintiff. <em>{Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 507 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2747].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Bechtel did, however, present rebutting evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment. According to Bechtel, a \u201cdownturn in workload\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>a desire to save costs prompted its elimination of the BNI-MI unit, where Guz had worked. And it chose the younger workers for the SFRO-MI positions because they were the most qualified for those positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Notwithstanding Bechtel\u2019s rebuttal evidence, Guz could still prevail at trial under the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Reeves </em>by presenting evidence of a prima facie case of age discrimination plus sufficient additional evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could reject \u201cthe employer\u2019s asserted justification [as] false.\u201d <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 148 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2109].) As Justice Ginsburg\u2019s concurrence in <em>Reeves </em>explained, \u201ctwo categories\u201d of evidence are needed' to support a jury\u2019s verdict in a disparate treatment case based on circumstantial evidence of unlawful discrimination: \u201c[F]irst, evidence establishing a \u2018prima facie case,\u2019 . . . ; and second, evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation for its actions was false.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 154 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2112] (cone. opn. of Ginsburg, J.).) Here, in opposing Bechtel\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Guz presented evidence in both categories. As discussed earlier, he offered evidence comprising a prima facie case of age discrimination. In addition to the evidence of the prima facie case, he presented this evidence: (1) He was qualified for the SFRO-MI positions filled by other workers; (2) Bechtel never considered him for any of the new positions at SFRO-MI; (3) Bechtel did not comply with its own downsizing policy of ranking employees based on skills and functions; and (4) Bechtel\u2019s stated reasons for eliminating BNI-MI\u2014cost reduction and downturn in workload\u2014were demonstrably false, as noted on page 379, <em>ante. </em>From this additional evidence, a trier of fact could reasonably reject as false Bechtel\u2019s asserted business justifications for Guz\u2019s discharge. As Justice Ginsburg\u2019s concurrence in <em>Reeves </em>noted, \u201cevidence suggesting that a defendant accused of illegal discrimination has chosen to give a false explanation for its actions gives rise to a rational inference that the defendant could be masking its actual, illegal motivation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, under the high court\u2019s standard in <em>Reeves, </em>Guz\u2019s evidence here would be sufficient for an appellate court to sustain \u201ca jury\u2019s verdict that an employer unlawfully discriminated on the basis of age.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 137 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2103].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Here, however, we are concerned not with the sufficiency of evidence to sustain a jury verdict of age discrimination, but only with whether Guz\u2019s evidence raises \u201ca triable issue of material fact\u201d to be resolved at trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) Because, as I have explained, Guz\u2019s evidence was sufficient under <em>Reeves </em>not only for a jury to reject Bechtel\u2019s proffered reasons for the discharge but also for an appellate court to uphold an age discrimination verdict, that evidence squarely presented \u201c[t]he ultimate question\u201d in any disparate treatment case, namely, \u201cwhether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>p. 153 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2111].) That issue was in this case a material issue of fact in dispute. Therefore, the trial court erred when, in granting summary judgment for Bechtel, it precluded Guz from having the merits of this material issue of fact resolved at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The majority does not at all acknowledge that Guz\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, it looks to a statement by the high court in <em>Reeves </em>that an employer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when \u201c \u2018no rational fact finder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 362, italics omitted.) According to the majority, that is the case here. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In <em>Reeves, </em>the high court explained that notwithstanding evidence comprising a prima facie case of discrimination and sufficient additional evidence for a jury to reject an employer\u2019s proffered explanation, the employer would be entitled to a judgment as a matter of law if, for instance, \u201cthe record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted <em>independent </em>evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\u201d <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 148 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2109], italics added.) But here the record does not conclusively reveal Bechtel\u2019s true reason for Guz\u2019s discharge, and there is insufficient independent evidence that the reason was other than his age. Therefore, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, this case falls outside the <em>Reeves </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In a recent decision, I explained the reason for FEHA\u2019s prohibition against age discrimination in employment: \u201cAging is a highly complex and variable process. Chronological age alone is not a reliable measure of any individual\u2019s vitality or ability, and many individuals remain robust and productive well past the normal retirement age. Nevertheless, some employers have discriminated against highly qualified older workers solely because of their age, either by not hiring them or by replacing them with younger persons.\u201d <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 909.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Seeking ever greater efficiency to meet the demands of open market competition, many corporations engage in frequent internal reorganization. As some departments or working groups are reduced or eliminated and others are expanded or created, many employees\u2019 jobs are placed at risk in a corporate equivalent of the old game of musical chairs. Because the corporate employer controls the seating assignments, corporate officers who wish to eliminate older workers may use the complexities of the restructuring process to conceal their illegal discriminatory intent. Here, Guz has alleged that he was the victim of exactly this sort of age discrimination by his employer, Bechtel, contrary to the public policy and the law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Guz\u2019s lawsuit against Bechtel is now at the summary judgment stage, where the question to be decided is whether the evidence submitted by Guz and Bechtel shows there is an issue of material fact in dispute that needs to be resolved by a full trial in open court. Unlike the majority, I conclude that the evidence does show a triable issue of fact, and that plaintiff deserves a trial on the merits to determine whether he lost his job for legitimate business reasons or because of illegal age discrimination. Because the majority denies plaintiff the opportunity to prove his case at trial, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Further undesignated statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">I do not agree with Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion that <em>Marks v. Loral Corp., supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th 30, is \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d to the issues here. (Cone. opn. of Chin, J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 372, fn. 1.) The younger workers that Bechtel chose to retain earned lower salaries than Guz, and the Legislature\u2019s recent clarification of the law on this point serves to explain why Bechtel has not and could not lawfully rely on the resulting salary savings to justify its decision, as other employers in the past have done.</p>\n<p id=\"A5z\">Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion also complains that this opinion\u2019s discussion of the illegality of age discrimination \u201cis irrelevant to the majority\u2019s holding\u201d because \u201c[t]he majority does not suggest that age discrimination is lawful.\u201d (Cone. opn. of Chin, J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 372, fn. 1.) Surely the illegality of age discrimination cannot be entirely irrelevant in an age discrimination case. The nature and purpose of the prohibition against age discrimination in employment should be kept in mind when assessing the sufficiency of the evidence and the allocation of the proof burdens on a summary judgment motion in an age discrimination case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Because I conclude that plaintiff\u2019s evidence here was sufficient for a prima facie case of age discrimination, I express no view on whether a plaintiff suing under the FEHA can successfully avoid summary judgment without such evidence. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 357 [also declining to decide this issue].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion asserts that \u201cGuz cannot state a prima facie case.\u201d (Cone. opn. of Chin, J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 374.) It finds some significance in Guz\u2019s failure to point to \u201ccomments by anyone\u201d at Bechtel suggesting that his age played a role in Bechtel\u2019s employment decisions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>But such evidence of discriminatory intent is unnecessary either to allege or to prove age discrimination based on <em>disparate </em>treatment, plaintiff\u2019s theory in this case. Rather, as the high court in <em>Reeves </em>has said, an employee claiming disparate treatment can rely entirely on circumstantial evidence, which may be probative of intentional discrimination and \u201cquite persuasive.\u201d <em>(Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at pp. 146-147 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2108].)
