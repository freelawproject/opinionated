J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEV\">Relying upon its opinion in <em>People v. Mai </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 117 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 141], the Court of Appeal held that a robbery can be committed even if the victim did not possess the property that was taken by force or fear. We disapprove the decision in <em>Mai </em>and reverse, in part, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Around 5:30 p.m. on February 10, 1995, a number of employees were celebrating a coworker\u2019s birthday in the lunchroom of G&amp;G Assemblers, a computer assembly business located in Huntington Beach. Also present was Jose Jiminez, the husband of one of the employees. During the celebration, defendants Thuan Van Nguyen, Thanh Van Le, Anphong Due Nguyen, and Sokha Kong entered the lunchroom brandishing weapons, ordered the victims to lie facedown on the floor, and bound the victims\u2019 arms and legs with plastic strips and ties.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Three of the employees testified that defendants took their money and identification. One defendant announced an intention to take identification from each of the victims so defendants would know where the victims lived, which might dissuade the victims from reporting defendants to the authorities. A fourth employee testified, but was not asked and did not state whether defendants took her money or identification. The remaining five victims, including the visitor Jiminez, did not testify. Defendants took approximately $400,000 worth of computer modules and memory chips from the business and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Several months later, defendants returned to G&amp;G Assemblers, apparently intending to repeat the crime. Employees recognized defendants and summoned the police. Later that day, police officers arrested defendants at a nearby park.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">At trial, the court granted the prosecutor\u2019s request for the following special jury instruction, apparently based upon language in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mai, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number><em>supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 117, 129: \u201cTo be a victim of robbery, however, a person need not own, possess, be in control of, or even have the right to possess or control the property sought by the perpetrator. A victim may be an employee or visitor who becomes subject to the application of force or fear utilized to obtain the property of another person, owner of a business or employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Defendants were convicted of nine counts of second degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit an additional robbery (\u00a7 182). The jury found true the allegations that all defendants except Kong personally used a firearm during the robberies (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1)), that Kong, a principal, was armed with a firearm during the robberies (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), and that all defendants were armed with firearms during the conspiracy to commit the additional robbery (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)). Thuan Nguyen, Le, and Anphong Nguyen each were sentenced on the first count of robbery to a term of five years in prison, plus an enhancement of four years for personally using a firearm, plus consecutive terms of one year for each of the remaining eight counts of robbery, and the one count of conspiracy, plus enhancements of 16 months on each of the remaining eight counts of robbery, for a total term of 28 years and eight months in state prison. Kong was sentenced on the first count of robbery to a term of five years in prison, plus an enhancement of one year for being armed with a firearm, plus consecutive terms of one year each on five of the remaining counts of robbery, for a total term of 11 years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Defendants appealed, arguing, among other contentions, that there was insufficient evidence to establish that any property was taken from the visitor Jiminez, and, therefore, that each defendant\u2019s conviction based upon the robbery of Jiminez must be reversed. The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that to be the victim of a robbery, a person need not have been in possession of the property taken and that, in any event, there was sufficient evidence establishing that defendants took whatever money or identification Jiminez had in his possession. We granted review. For the reasons that follow, we reverse, in part, the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Section 211 provides: \u201cRobbery is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d Despite this statutory language requiring that the property be taken from \u201cthe possession of another\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the Court of Appeal concluded that defendant could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>convicted of robbing Jiminez based upon the taking of property from the business, whether or not Jiminez had a possessory interest over the merchandise taken from the business. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal relied upon its earlier decision in <em>People v. Mai, </em>supra, 22 Cal.App.4th 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In <em>Mai, </em>the defendant and his accomplice entered \u00e1 gold business and held at gunpoint the owner of the business, his mother, his brother, and his brother\u2019s nephew. The robbery attempt was foiled when the owner and his brother overpowered their assailants, wounding the defendant and killing his accomplice. The defendant was convicted of the murder of his accomplice and four counts of attempted robbery. He challenged the conviction of attempted robbery of the nephew on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that the nephew was in joint possession of the gold that the defendant tried to steal from the business. The Court of Appeal rejected this contention with a broad holding: \u201cAssuming the nephew was no more than a visitor to the business premises and neither owned nor possessed the gold, once force and fear were applied to him in an attempt to deprive <em>someone, or anyone, </em>of property, [the nephew] became the victim of an attempted robbery. [Citation.] A robbery consists of the application of force or fear to obtain the property of another. The victim need not own, possess, or even have the right to possess the property sought by the perpetrator.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mai, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 117, 129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Less than a year later, the Court of Appeal in <em>Sykes v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 479 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 571], took a different approach. Sykes broke into a music store and stole a saxophone. A security guard employed by a business across the street saw the defendant leaving the music store and ordered him to stop. The defendant initially approached the guard, but then turned and fled. The guard pursued and apprehended the defendant following a struggle, during which the defendant bit or scraped the guard\u2019s hand. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant could not be prosecuted for robbery, because the saxophone had not been taken from the possession of the security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The decision in <em>People v. Galoia </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 595 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 117] followed the decision in <em>Sykes, </em>and held that a Good Samaritan who attempted to thwart a robbery was not a victim of that robbery. Galoia took several items from a convenience store in which Mark Steadman was collecting money from the video games he maintained in the store. Steadman pursued Galoia until Galoia threatened him and Galoia\u2019s companion struck him. Relying upon the decision in <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th 479, the Court of Appeal held that \u201cSteadman did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>sufficient interest in the property to be a robbery victim.\u201d <em>(People v. Galoia, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 598.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We granted review to resolve this conflict in authority. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mai, supra, </em>22- Cal.App.4th 117, that the property taken during a robbery need not be taken from the possession of the victim, should be disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We consistently have held that, in order to constitute robbery, property must be taken from the possession of the victim by means of force or fear. \u201cTo constitute robbery the property must be removed from the possession and immediate presence of the victim against his will, and such removal must be by force or fear.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 553, 589 [180 Cal.Rptr. 266, 639 P.2d 908], revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom. California </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 992 [103 S.Ct. 3446, 77 L.Ed.2d 1171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552], we held that a security guard had constructive possession of property taken from the jewelry store in which he was employed and, thus, properly could have been alleged as a victim of the robbery: \u201c \u2018Robbery is an offense against the person; thus a store employee may be the victim of a robbery even though he is not its owner and not at the moment in immediate control of the stolen property.\u2019 [Citation.] Robbery convictions have been upheld against contentions that janitors and night watchmen did not have a sufficient possessory interest in their employer\u2019s personal property to qualify as victims. [Citations.] Even a visitor in a store who was forced to remove and surrender money from the store\u2019s cash box was held to be a victim of the robbery. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 880; <em>People v. Jones </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1054 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 46] [store truck driver had \u201csufficient representative capacity with respect to the owner of the property to be the victim of robbery\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Estes </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 23, 27 [194 Cal.Rptr. 909] [security guard]; <em>People v. Masters </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 509, 519-520 [185 Cal.Rptr. 134] [restaurant employee was a victim of robbery, even though another employee was closer to the cash register from which the property was taken]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arline </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 200, 202 [91 Cal.Rptr. 520], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 834 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99] [employee of gas station was a victim of robbery even though a coemployee had the key to the cash box from which the property was taken]; <em>People v. Poindexter </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 566, 568-569 [63 Cal.Rptr. 332] [barmaid]; <em>People v. Downs </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 758, 765 [251 P.2d 369] [janitors]; <em>People v. Dean </em>(1924) 66 Cal.App. 602, 606-607 [226 P. 943] janitors and watchmen].)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">In <em>People v. Gordon </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 519, 529 [186 Cal.Rptr. 373], the defendant and an accomplice entered the residence of Joseph and Mary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Lopes, threatened them with a firearm, and took from their adult son\u2019s bedroom a large amount of cash and marijuana. The Court of Appeal affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction of robbery, stating that \u201cthe parents possessed these personal items of their adult son for purposes of the robbery statute.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In <em>People v. Moore </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 668 [84 Cal.Rptr. 771], the mother of an employee entered the business and found a robbery in progress. At the defendant\u2019s direction, she removed money from a cash register and a money bag and gave it to the defendant. The Court of Appeal rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the mother was not a victim of the robbery because she \u201cwas not an employee but merely a visitor,\u201d holding that once the mother \u201cexercised dominion over the money, whatever her motivation in so doing, she became, insofar as defendant was concerned, the person in possession thereof, and she was properly designated in the information as the immediate victim of his robbery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 670-671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Although the theory of constructive possession has been used to expand the concept of possession to include employees and others as robbery victims, the case of <em>People v. Mai, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 117, is the only published decision in California that has dispensed entirely with the requirement that a robbery victim be in possession of the property taken by the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It has been settled law for nearly a century that an essential element of the crime of robbery is that property be taken from the possession of the victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ho Sing </em>(1907) 6 Cal.App. 752, 753 [93 P. 204].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Attorney General argues that arbitrary results will ensue from a rule limiting the victims of a robbery to persons from whose possession property has been taken. The visitor to the business in the present case was subjected to the same level of force as were the employees of the business, yet each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the employees is a victim of robbery while the visitor is not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is a legitimate concern. Section 222.1 of the Model Penal Code avoids this problem by defining robbery to include the use of force or fear against <em>any </em>person during the commission of a theft: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he: [\u00b6] (a) inflicts serious bodily injury upon another; or [\u00b6] (b) threatens another with or purposely puts him in fear of immediate serious bodily injury; or [\u00b6] (c) commits or threatens immediately to commit any felony of the first or second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">But regardless of the wisdom of following the approach adopted by the Model Penal Code, it is clear that this approach has not been adopted in California. The language of section 222.1 of the Model Penal Code is quite different from the language of Penal Code section 211. As noted above, section 211 defines robbery as \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d The Model Penal Code makes no mention of the taking of property in the possession of another, as does Penal Code section 211. Rather, a defendant commits robbery within the definition of the Model Penal Code if, in the course of committing a theft, the defendant inflicts, threatens to inflict, or puts <em>any </em>person in fear of immediate serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The comment to section 222.1 of the Model Penal Code does not discuss why language such as that in Penal Code section 211 requiring that property be taken from the possession of another was not included in the model code provision, but it does discuss why related language in Penal Code section 211, requiring that property be taken \u201cfrom his person or immediate presence,\u201d was omitted. Characterizing the language used in section 211 as the \u201ctraditional basis for classifying theft as robbery,\u201d the comment explains that the Model Penal Code purposely deleted this requirement so that in \u201ca few situations\u201d the definition of robbery would apply to \u201cthe theft of property other than from the person or in the presence of the victim.\u201d (Model Pen. Code &amp; Commentaries, com. 3 to \u00a7 222.1, p. 112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Several states have adopted the Model Penal Code approach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One such state is New Jersey. The Supreme Court of New Jersey termed the new law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201c \u2018a clean break with the past.\u2019 \u201d <em>(State v. Mirault </em>(1983) 92 N.J. 492 [457 A.2d 455, 457].) The court recognized the significance of this change: \u201cBoth the New Jersey Code and the [Model Penal Code] broaden common law robbery in several ways: they include injury or threat to one other than the custodian of the property; they include escape from commission or attempt; and they eliminate the element of asportation. Our new statute thus \u2018manifests a legislative intent to adopt a more expansive concept of robbery.\u2019 \u201d (457 A.2d at pp. 457-458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Unlike the State of New Jersey, California has not adopted the Model Penal Code definition of robbery. Section 211 reflects, instead, the traditional approach that limits victims of robbery to those persons in either actual or constructive possession of the property taken. We take no position on which of these differing approaches is preferable. Our Legislature has adopted the traditional approach, as reflected in the language of section 211. It is up to the Legislature to implement any change that may be desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In the present case, Jiminez was a visitor to the business and was not in actual or constructive possession of the property taken from the business. None of the convictions for the robbery of Jiminez, therefore, can be based upon evidence that property was taken from the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">In addition to holding that each defendant\u2019s conviction for the robbery of Jiminez could be based upon the taking of property from the business, the Court of Appeal also concluded that there was sufficient evidence that property was taken from Jiminez\u2019s person: \u201cThe circumstantial evidence to support this inference was the robbers\u2019 stated intent to take all identification, one of the robbers\u2019 demand to another robber to be sure and take all identification, and the testimony of three of the victims\u2014the only ones ever asked\u2014that the robbers accomplished that intention on them.\u201d There is a flaw in this reasoning. There is no evidence that Jiminez had any identification or other personal property in his possession. The Attorney General does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>not argue to the contrary. Even if it can be inferred from the evidence presented that defendants tried to rob Jiminez, it cannot be determined whether they succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">As discussed above, the jury was instructed that Jiminez could be a victim of robbery based upon the taking of property owned by the business, even if he did not \u201cown, possess, be in control of, or even have the right to possess or control the property sought by the perpetrator.\u201d The Attorney General concedes that if this instruction was erroneous, and we have concluded that it was, defendants\u2019 convictions for robbing Jiminez cannot stand, because the jury may have based its verdict upon the evidence that defendants took property owned by the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The Attorney General argues, however, that we can reduce each defendant\u2019s conviction for robbing Jiminez to a conviction for attempting to rob that individual, because \u201c[t]he only difference created by the allegedly erroneous instruction is that the jury may not have evaluated the evidence concerning one element.\u201d We do not agree. Reducing defendants\u2019 convictions to attempted robbery would not alter the circumstance that the jury may have based its verdict on this count upon the taking of property from the business, rather than the taking, or attempted taking, of property from the person of Jiminez. We may not uphold each defendant\u2019s conviction for robbing Jiminez, or reduce each such conviction to one for attempted robbery, unless this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 665, 677, fn. 6 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 647, 2 P.3d 1189].) An instructional error is harmless if it .is \u201c \u2018clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the present case, the jury may have based its verdict on this count solely upon the evidence that property was taken from the business, without considering whether any defendant attempted to take property from the person of Jiminez. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that it is \u201c \u2018clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty\u2019 \u201d had the erroneous instruction not been given. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed to the extent it affirms each defendant\u2019s conviction for robbing Jiminez, and is otherwise affirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>The case is remanded to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Mosk, J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">On January 17, 2001, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Only one published decision has cited with approval the holding in <em>Mai </em>that a robbery victim need not possess the property taken during the robbery. In <em>People v. Bekele </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1457 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 797], disapproved on another ground in <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 13-14 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618], Robert Jump and his coworker, Paco Fernandez, saw the defendant burglarizing Jump\u2019s truck. Jump said, \u201c \u2018Let\u2019s stop\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018There is somebody in my truck.\u2019 \u201d (Bekele, at p. 1460.) Jump and Fernandez approached the truck and told the defendant to stop. The defendant ran and Fernandez gave chase while Jump radioed for help. As Fernandez followed, the defendant produced a firearm and pointed it at Fernandez, saying, \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant was convicted, among other charges, of the robbery of Fernandez. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, holding that \u201cFernandez had constructive possession of Jump\u2019s property through Jump\u2019s implied grant of authority to help stop the theft.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1462.) Although, as noted above, this decision cites <em>Mai </em>with approval, it nevertheless appears to apply the settled rule that a robbery victim must possess the property taken during the robbery. We need not, and do not, decide whether the court in <em>Bekele </em>was correct in concluding that Jump\u2019s comments were sufficient to confer upon his coworker constructive possession of the truck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Of course, the visitor may be the victim of other offenses, such as assault with a deadly weapon.
