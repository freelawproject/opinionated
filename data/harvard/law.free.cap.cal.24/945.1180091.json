National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265] (hereafter sometimes <em>Foster-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number><em>Gardner), </em>we addressed the question, which was of first impression in the State of California, whether the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured in a \u201csuit seeking damages\u201d was limited to a civil action prosecuted in a court. We answered in the affirmative. We went on to conclude that the duty did not extend to a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">In this cause, we address the question, also of first impression in this state, whether the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify the insured for \u201call sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages\u201d is limited to money ordered by,.a court. We shall answer in the affirmative. We shall go on to conclude that the duty does not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">This cause arises from a petition for writ of mandate filed in the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District, and subsequently assigned to Division Three thereof. The petitioners are Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, and Certain London Market Insurance Companies, hereafter collectively the London Insurers; the respondent is the Superior Court of Los Angeles County; and the real parties in interest are entities including Powerine Oil Company, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">The petition for writ of mandate, as the Court of Appeal would later state, was submitted against this background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-9\">\u201cPowerine was engaged in the oil refining business for approximately 60 years. Through its predecessor, Rothschild Oil [Company], it commenced oil refining operations in Santa Fe Springs, California, in the mid-1930\u2019s. Over the years it expanded those operations and by the late 1970\u2019s Powerine\u2019s business occupied over 100 acres and employed over 500 people. In addition, Powerine also engaged in oil and petroleum-related exploration, production, terminaling and transportation operations throughout the western states. However, in approximately 1985, a soft petroleum market resulted in a significant financial reversal, eventually forcing Powerine into bankruptcy. Ultimately, it divested itself of all of its operations except for its refinery in Santa Fe Springs. Even so, that refinery [was] only . . . periodically operated between 1986-1995. Since the latter date, it has not been operated at all, and only a skeleton crew of employees has remained, primarily for environmental compliance and equipment maintenance purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Read in conjunction with all of its supporting papers, the petition for writ of mandate contains allegations, subsequently admitted or at least not denied, to the following effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Highlands Insurance Company filed a complaint and thereby initiated a civil action in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County for declaratory relief against Powerine, among others. In pertinent part, it alleged, in substance, that it had issued Powerine various comprehensive general liability insurance policies; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had instituted a proceeding against Powerine pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.) for the cleanup of a contaminated site in Monterey Park, the so-called Operating Industries, Inc., Superfund Site, and for the abatement of the contamination\u2019s effects; Powerine demanded that Highlands defend and indemnify it in the pending proceeding; Highlands undertook to defend Powerine under a reservation of rights, and continued to do so. Highlands prayed for a declaration that it did not owe Powerine any duty to defend or any duty to indemnify in the pending proceeding. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Powerine filed \u00e1 cross-complaint and thereby initiated a cross-action essentially for damages and declaratory relief against the London Insurers, among others. In the; operative cross-complaint, which is the second amended one, Powerine alleged, in pertinent part and in substance, that the London Insurers had issued it various insurance policies, including policy No. LAB 2579, a comprehensive general liability insurance policy for a term from May 1, 1958, to May 1, 1961; the EPA had instituted a proceeding against Powerine pursuant to CERCLA for the cleanup of the contaminated Operating Industries, Inc., Superfund Site in Monterey Park, and for the abatement of the contamination\u2019s effects, and had required it, and would continue to require it, to expend funds therefor; the EPA had also instituted a proceeding against Powerine pursuant to CERCLA for the cleanup of a contaminated site in Santa Fe Springs, the so-called Waste Disposal, Inc., Superfund Site, and for the abatement of the contamination\u2019s effects, and had required it, and would continue to require it, to expend funds therefor; similarly, the California Regional Water Quality Control Boards for the Los Angeles and San Diego Regions (Regional Water Boards) had each initiated at least one proceeding of its own against Powerine by means of a cleanup and abatement order pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Porter-Cologne Act) (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13000 et seq.) relative to contaminated soil and groundwater at and around one or more sites in the region in question, and had required it, and would continue to require it, to expend funds therefor; in addition, several persons or entities had prosecuted to conclusion several civil actions in court against Powerine based on allegations of contamination; the London Insurers owed Powerine a duty to defend in the past actions, but denied that they did so; the London Insurers also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>owed Powerine a duty to indemnify in the past actions and the pending proceedings, but denied that they did so as well. Powerine prayed for, inter alia, a declaration that the London Insurers owed it a duty to indemnify in the pending EPA/CERCLA and Regional Water Boards/Porter-Cologne Act proceedings, and also prayed for damages for harm arising from their breach of the duty to defend in the past civil actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The London Insurers filed an answer to Powerine\u2019s operative cross-complaint. In addition to various admissions and denials, they asserted several affirmative defenses. One of the affirmative defenses was, in general, that they did not owe Powerine any duty to defend. More specifically, it was to the effect that they did not owe it any duty to defend in any proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute, as opposed to a civil action prosecuted in a court, because the duty was limited to the latter and hence could not extend to the former. Another of the affirmative defenses was, in general, that they did not owe it any duty to indemnify. More specifically, it was to the effect that they did not owe it any duty to indemnify for any expenses required by such an agency pursuant to such a statute, as opposed to money ordered by a court, because the duty was limited to the latter and hence could not extend to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The London Insurers then filed a motion for summary adjudication of certain issues in Powerine\u2019s cross-action. There was a single issue at the threshold: Were the pending EPA/CERCLA and Regional Water Boards/ Porter-Cologne Act proceedings the only matters at issue in the cross-action, to the exclusion of any other proceedings conducted before administrative agencies pursuant to environmental statutes, and also to the exclusion of any civil actions prosecuted in court? As to this issue, they claimed that the identified pending proceedings alone were at issue. There were, in effect, two issues of substance: First, did the London Insurers owe Powerine any duty to defend in any of the identified pending proceedings? Second, did they owe it any duty to indemnify for any expenses required therein? As to the first substantive issue, they claimed that there was no triable issue as to any material fact, and that they were entitled as a matter of law to an adjudication that they did not owe any duty to defend. As to the second substantive issue, they similarly claimed that there was no triable issue as to any material fact, and that they were entitled as a matter of law to an adjudication that they did not owe any duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Powerine filed opposition to the London Insurers\u2019 motion for summary adjudication. It conceded more than they claimed, to the effect that only the pending Regional Water B oards/Porter-Cologne Act proceedings were at issue in the cross-action, to the exclusion even of. the EPA/CERCLA proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">After a hearing, the superior court issued an order granting in part, and denying in part, the London Insurers\u2019 motion for summary adjudication. It ruled that only the pending Regional Water Boards/Porter-Cologne Act proceedings were at issue in the cross-action. It did so in reliance on Powerine\u2019s concession of the point in its opposition. It ruled that there was no triable issue as to any material fact, and that the London Insurers were entitled as a matter of law to an adjudication that they did not owe Powerine any duty to defend in any of the identified pending proceedings. It did so in reliance on what, at the hearing, it had termed, and Powerine had not disputed, was Powerine\u2019s concession of the point in its opposition. But it also ruled that, apart from any triable issue as to any material fact, the London Insurers were not entitled as a matter of law to an adjudication that they did not owe Powerine any duty to indemnify for any expenses required therein. It did so because it concluded that the duty to indemnify was not limited to money ordered by a court, but could extend to expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">It was against the superior court and its order denying their motion for summary adjudication of the issue of their duty to indemnify Powerine that the London Insurers submitted their petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Directly after filing, the Court of Appeal ordered the parties to show cause why the relief requested in the London Insurers\u2019 petition for writ of mandate should, or should not, be granted. Powerine filed a reply to the petition, in opposition to relief. The London Insurers filed a response to the reply, in support thereof. The superior court did not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">In its judgment, the Court of Appeal discharged the order to show cause and ordered issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order denying the London Insurers\u2019 motion for summary adjudication of the issue of their duty to indemnify Powerine and to make a new order granting what they sought. In an opinion authored by Justice Croskey and joined by Presiding Justice Klein, the Court of Appeal determined, albeit more impliedly than expressly, that the superior court\u2019s order denying the London Insurers\u2019 motion for summary adjudication of the issue of their duty to indemnify Powerine was subject to independent review. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>went on to determine, more expressly than impliedly, that the order was erroneous, concluding that the duty to indemnify was limited to money ordered by a court, and did not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute, including any expenses required by the Regional Water Boards pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act. It was of the view that, \u201cwhen the Supreme Court decided <em>Foster-Gardner </em>it, in reality, also decided this case.\u201d In a dissenting opinion, Justice Aldrich, without identifying the standard of review, would have found no error, concluding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Powerine filed a petition for review. We granted its application. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The issue on review is whether the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify the insured for \u201call sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages,\u201d as imposed by the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy, is limited to money ordered by a court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">By way of background, the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy was developed in 1940. (E.g., <em>Wisconsin Label v. North-brook Property &amp; Cas. </em>(2000) 233 Wis.2d 314, 329, fn. 3 [607 N.W.2d 276, 283]; Note, <em>Liability Coverage for \u201cDamages Because of Property Damage\u201d Under the Comprehensive General Liability Policy </em>(1984) 68 Minn. L.Rev. 795, 798.) Over the years that have followed, it has periodically been revised, appearing in various versions. (E.g., <em>Wisconsin Label </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Cas. Ins., supra, </em>233 Wis.2d at p. 329, fn. 3 [607 N.W.2d at p. 283]; Note, <em>Liability Coverage for \u201cDamages Because of Property Damage\u201d Under the Comprehensive General Liability Policy, supra, </em>68 Minn. L.Rev. at pp. 798-799; see <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>California </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 764, 772 [113 S.Ct. 2891, 2896-2897, 125 L.Ed.2d 612].) It had its name changed to the standard <em>commercial </em>general liability insurance policy in 1986. <em>(American Star Ins. Co. v. Insurance Co. of the West </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1320, 1323, fn. 1 [284 Cal.Rptr. 45].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Since before the development of the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy, courts have, of course, entertained civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Throughout the same period, various administrative agencies have conducted various proceedings under various statutes, which generally provide for, or at least allow, subsequent civil actions prosecuted in a court at which the proceedings themselves may be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">In relatively recent years, administrative agencies like the EPA, which has been granted \u201cextraordinary powers,\u201d have begun to conduct proceedings, which are of a \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d type, pursuant to environmental statutes like CERCLA. <em>(Ray Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1992) 974 F.2d 754, 764.) Similar administrative agencies, including the Department of Toxic Substances Control of the California Environmental Protec-, tion Agency, have begun to conduct similar proceedings pursuant to similar environmental statutes, including the Hazardous Waste Control Act (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25100 et seq.) and also the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 25300 et seq.), which is the \u201cCalifornia version of CERCLA\u201d <em>(Nixon-Egli Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>John A. Alexander Co. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1996) 949 F.Supp. 1435, 1438; see <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 861). Likewise, the Regional Water Boards have begun to conduct proceedings of their own pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Each of the cited environmental statutes makes the course and outcome of any proceeding before the administrative agency in question affect the course and outcome of any subsequent civil action prosecuted in a court, and does so to the agency\u2019s benefit and its subject\u2019s detriment, in order to give the subject an incentive toward compromise and a deterrent against litigation. (See generally 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9604, 9606, 9607, 9609, 9613 (CERCLA); Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25350-25359.7, 25360-25367 (Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act); <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25180-25195 (Hazardous Waste Control Act); Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13300-13365 (Porter-Cologne Act).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">In order to resolve the issue on review, to which we now turn, we must determine the meaning of the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy with regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">\u201cAn insurance policy is a contract between an insurer and an insured . . . , the insurer making promises, and the insured paying premiums, the one in consideration for the other, against the risk of loss ....</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>\u201cTo yield their meaning, the provisions of a policy must be considered in their full context. . . . Where it is clear, the language must be read accordingly. . . . Where it is not, it must be read in conformity with what the insurer believed the insured understood thereby at the time of formation . . . and, if it remains problematic, in the sense that satisfies the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations . . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">\u201cThe provisions of a standard policy\u201d\u2014including one for comprehensive general liability insurance\u2014\u201cmust be so considered. Of course, when they are examined solely on a form, i.e., apart from any actual agreement between a given insurer and a given insured, the rules stated above apply <em>mutatis mutandis. </em>That is to say, where it is clear, the language must be read accordingly, and where it is not, in the sense that satisfies the hypothetical insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>(Buss </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 45 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Among the provisions of the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy\u2014which is surely comprehensive but hardly unlimited <em>(Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 272, 279-280 [142 Cal.Rptr. 681])\u2014are the two with which we are here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">In the one provision, which is of direct and primary significance, the standard policy imposes on the insurer a duty to indemnify the insured, generally stating that the insurer \u201cwill pay all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages\u201d for harm proved within coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">In the other provision, which is of indirect and secondary\u2014but hardly less\u2014significance, the standard policy imposes on the insurer a duty to defend the insured, generally stating that the insurer has a \u201cduty to defend\u201d the insured \u201cin any suit seeking damages\u201d for harm alleged within coverage. In the same provision, it grants the insurer a <em>right </em>to defend the insured, including a right to control the defense, generally stating that the insurer has a \u201cright to defend\u201d the insured \u201cin any suit seeking damages\u201d for harm alleged within coverage. Also in the same provision, it grants the insurer, evidently as part of the right to defend (see <em>Diamond Heights Homeowners Assn. v. National American Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 563, 578 [277 Cal.Rptr. 906]), a right to settle any at least potentially covered dispute involving the insured, generally stating that the insurer has a \u201cright to settle any claim or suit\u201d against the insured \u201cas it may deem expedient\u201d\u2014a \u201csuit\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>being a dispute in the form of a civil action prosecuted in a court <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 878-882), a \u201cclaim\u201d being a dispute in some other form <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify the insured and the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured lie at the core of the standard policy. (See, e.g., <em>Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co. </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 38, 56-59 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 118, 948 P.2d 909]; <em>Buss </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 45-47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The duty to indemnify and the duty to defend are \u201ccorrelative.\u201d <em>(Ryan </em>v. <em>Royal Ins.

That is to say, the duty to defend has as its purpose \u201cto avoid or at least minimize liability . . . <em>before </em>liability is established\u201d <em>(Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 58, italics added), and the duty to indemnify has as <em>its </em>purpose \u201cto resolve liability . . . <em>after </em>liability is established\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 56, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Although correlative, the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend are not \u201ccoterminous.\u201d <em>(Ryan v.

They differ in their triggering: Whereas the duty to indemnify can arise only after damages are fixed in their amount (see <em>Aerojet-General Corp. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 56; <em>Buss </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 46), the duty to defend may arise as soon as damages are sought in some amount (see <em>Aerojet-General Corp. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 58; <em>Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 46). They also differ in their substance: Whereas the duty to defend \u201centails the rendering of a service, viz., the mounting and funding of a defense\u201d <em>(Aerojet-General Corp. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 58; accord, <em>Buss </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 46), the duty to indemnify \u201centails the payment of money\u201d <em>(Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co., supra, 17 </em>Cal.4th at p. 56; accord, <em>Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 46). They differ as well in their scope: Whereas the duty to indemnify may indeed be broad, the duty to defend must perforce be broader still. (See, e.g., <em>Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 59; <em>Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 46-47.) With this result: Where there is a duty to defend, there <em>may be </em>a duty to indemnify; but where there is no duty to defend, there <em>cannot be </em>a duty to indemnify. (See <em>Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 47, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">In <em>Foster-Gardner, </em>we held that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured in a \u201csuit seeking damages\u201d under the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy was limited to a civil action prosecuted in a court. <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 878-888.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">There, we took what we referred to as a \u201cliteral\u201d approach to the provision imposing on the insurer the duty to defend the insured in a \u201csuit seeking damages.\u201d <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 869.) In doing so, we considered the provision in its full context; we proceeded to find, in effect, that it was clear in its limitation to a civil action prosecuted in a court, and that, in such limitation, it did not run counter to the hypothetical insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 869-871, 878-888.) We declined to take either a \u201cfunctional\u201d or a \u201chybrid\u201d approach <em>(id. </em>at p. 869), each of which treats the provision as \u201cambiguous\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 872), the former deeming \u201csuit\u201d to reach anything that is equivalent to a suit, apparently without qualification <em>(id. </em>at p. 871 &amp; pp. 871-872, fn. 7), the latter deeming \u201csuit\u201d to reach anything that is equivalent to a suit, but \u201conly if it is sufficiently coercive and threatening\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 871-872 &amp; p. 872, fn. 8). We declined to take either approach because the duty to defend involved a \u201csuit,\u201d and not something equivalent to a suit or even something equivalent to a suit that was sufficiently coercive and threatening. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 872, 879.) We impliedly recognized that the provision could have imposed a duty to defend without any limitation to a \u201csuit,\u201d thereby \u201ccreating] \u2018a broad legal-services arrangement under which [the] insurer[] would step into any dispute\u2019 \u201d involving the insured. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881.) But we also impliedly recognized that the provision did not in fact impose such an unlimited duty. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 882.) We observed that the provision, under our reading, commended itself to society generally as laying down a \u201c \u2018bright-line rule that. . . reduces the need for future litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 887, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">In light of the foregoing, we went on to conclude that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured did not extend to a proceeding conducted before an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute\u2014specifically, there, a proceeding conducted before the Department of Toxic Substances Control pursuant to the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act. <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 878-888.) Our reason was that a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute does not constitute a \u201csuit,\u201d i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court, but rather implicates a \u201cclaim.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We did not ignore the fact that such a proceeding might ripen into such an action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 878-879, 881.) Neither did we ignore the fact that the course and outcome of such a proceeding might affect the course and outcome of such an action, to the agency\u2019s benefit and its subject\u2019s detriment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 881, 882-883, 887.) But we simply could not ignore the fact that such a proceeding does not itself amount to such an action\u2014a fact that the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act itself reflected by distinguishing the former from the latter. <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 878-879, 881, 884-885.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">In arriving at our conclusion, we declined to rewrite the provision imposing the duty to defend in order to remove its limitation to a civil action prosecuted in a court. (Foster-Gardner, <em>Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 886-888.) We would not do so for the insured itself, in order to shift to the insurer some or all of the potentially substantial costs that might be imposed on the insured in the course of a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 886-887.) Neither would we do so for considerations of public policy, in order, perhaps, to bring such a proceeding to a timely and appropriate outcome through such a shifting of costs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 888.) Our reason was that we do not rewrite any provision of any contract, including the standard policy underlying any individual policy, for any purpose. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Proceeding from <em>Foster-Gardner </em>to this case, we believe that the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify the insured for \u201call sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages\u201d under the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy is limited to money ordered by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Our belief about the duty to indemnify and its limitation to money ordered by a court is sufficiently supported when we look to what we may call Foster-Gardner\u2019s \u201csyllogism\u201d alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. The duty to defend is not broad enough to extend beyond a \u201csuit,\u201d i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court, but rather is limited thereto. A fortiori, the duty to indemnify is not broad enough to extend beyond \u201cdamages,\u201d i.e., money ordered by a court, but rather is limited thereto. \u201cIt is . . . well settled that because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,\u201d a determination that \u201cthere is no duty to defend automatically means that there is no duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>(State of N.Y. v.

(See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3281-3283; Black\u2019s Law Dict., <em>supra, </em>at p. 393, col. 2; 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 749-753; Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat.

For one might say that the insured is legally obligated to pay some such sum under abstract legal rules alone. Thus, one might say that a driver of an automobile is legally obligated to comply with all laws relating to use of the roads apart from any order by a court. One might also say that the driver is legally obligated to pay the toll required by such laws for passage over a designated bridge apart from any such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">But one would <em>not </em>speak of any \u201csum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay <em>as damages\u201d apart from any order by a court.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For one would not say that the insured is legally obligated to pay some such sum <em>as damages </em>under abstract rules alone. That is because, as a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay, \u201cdamages\u201d presuppose an institution for their ordering, traditionally a court, albeit no longer exclusively. (See, e.g., <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 355-386; McCormick, Handbook on the Law of Damages, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 1-3; see also <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Loether, supra, </em>415 U.S. at p. 196 [94 S.Ct. at p. 1009]; <em>Walnut Creek Manor v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 262.) \u201cDamages\u201d do not constitute a redundancy to a \u201csum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay,\u201d but a limitation thereof. Thus, again, one might say that a driver of an automobile is legally obligated to comply with all laws relating to use of the roads apart from any order by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>court. And, again, one might say that the driver is legally obligated to pay the toll required by such laws for passage over a designated bridge apart from any such order. But one would <em>not </em>say that the driver is legally obligated to pay any sum <em>as a fine </em>for failure to do so <em>apart from any such order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Consequently, the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify the insured for \u201call sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages\u201d is limited to money ordered by a court. It does not extend to all sums, or even any sum, that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay other than as damages. Surely not to all sums, or even any sum, that the insured may be said to become legally obligated to pay as a result of harm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">In concluding that the duty to indemnify is limited to money ordered by a court, we do not, to quote <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 840 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] (hereafter sometimes <em>AIU), </em>\u201cexalt form over substance.\u201d Rather, we do no more, and no less, than declare what we have determined to be the duty\u2019s substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">We observe that other courts are in accord with our conclusion that the duty to indemnify is limited to money ordered by a court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">We are not unaware, however, that yet other courts are contra.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither are we unaware that such other courts are more numerous. Their number, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>however, adds nothing to their weight. If we look at their decisions in accordance with the framework of <em>Foster-Gardner, </em>we find their weight insubstantial. They have taken what we there referred to as either a \u201cfunctional\u201d or a \u201chybrid\u201d approach, instead of a \u201cliteral\u201d one. Expressly or impliedly, they have treated the provision imposing the duty to indemnify as \u201cambiguous,\u201d those taking a \u201cfunctional\u201d approach deeming \u201cdamages\u201d to reach anything that is equivalent to damages, those taking a \u201chybrid\u201d approach deeming \u201cdamages\u201d to reach anything that is equivalent to damages if it is sufficiently significant. We put aside any question whether our taking of a \u201cliteral\u201d approach to the duty to defend in <em>Foster-Gardner </em>compels our taking of a like approach to the duty to indemnify in this case. Our words there, however, may be modified to apply here as well: The duty to indemnify involves \u201cdamages,\u201d clearly so, and not something equivalent to damages or even something equivalent to damages that is sufficiently significant. But, even if we do not look at the decisions of these courts in accordance with the framework of <em>Foster-Gardner, </em>we still find their weight insubstantial. For, whether their discussion fills many pages or amounts only to a few words, they have each failed to consider the provision imposing the duty to indemnify in its full context. Because of their failure, whatever discussion they set forth proves lacking in persuasive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">We recognize that the provision imposing the duty to indemnify could have done so <em>without </em>any limitation to money ordered by a court. In that event, it would have created a broad financial-subsidy arrangement under which the insurer would \u201cpay <em>any </em>sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">But we also recognize that the provision imposing the duty to indemnify does in fact do so <em>with </em>a limitation to money ordered by a court. We cannot, and will not, act as if it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">In its limitation to money ordered by a court, the provision imposing the duty to indemnify commends itself to society generally as laying down a bright-line rule. It has a tendency to promote fairness and efficiency in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>judicial sphere. By increasing certainty and decreasing uncertainty about the duty to indemnify, it serves to deter some litigation on the issue and to conclude what it does not deter expeditiously and soundly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">In light of the foregoing, we believe that the duty to indemnify does not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute\u2014specifically, here, proceedings conducted before the Regional Water Boards pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act. Our reason is that expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute, whether for the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination\u2019s effects or otherwise, do not constitute money ordered by a court. We do not ignore the fact that such expenses and such money are measured in precisely the same terms of dollars and cents. Neither do we ignore the fact that the furnishing of such expenses might altogether obviate the payment of such money. But we simply cannot ignore the fact that such expenses do not amount to such money\u2014a fact that the Porter-Cologne Act itself reflects by distinguishing the former from the latter. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7 13304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Not to the contrary is <em>AIU. </em>There, we held to the effect that the duty to indemnify may embrace <em>all </em>money ordered by a court, including \u201cmoney that the insured must give under law as compensation to third parties\u201d and also \u201cmoney that the insured must itself expend in equity in order to provide relief of the same sort.\u201d <em>(Aerojet-General Corp. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 56 [citing <em>AIU].) </em>We did <em>not </em>hold that the duty extends to any money <em>in addition to that ordered by a </em>court\u2014including any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. Indeed, we did not even consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Neither is <em>Vandenberg v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229] to the contrary. There, we held to the effect that the duty to indemnify may embrace <em>all </em>money ordered by a court, including money ordered by a court under the law of torts and, in' some \"cases, money ordered by a court under the law of contracts. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 838-841.) Again, we did <em>not </em>hold that the duty extends to any money <em>in addition to that ordered by a </em>court\u2014including any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. Indeed, we implied the opposite, albeit only in dictum, stating to the effect that the duty depends on a legal obligation to pay a sum as damages, which depends in turn on \u201cliability imposed in a definite sum by a final judgment. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 839.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Also not to the contrary is <em>Foster-Gardner </em>itself. There, we stated as follows: \u201c[B]ecause we conclude the insurers here did not contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>receive premiums to defend anything but a civil lawsuit, requiring them to defend [a proceeding conducted before the Department of Toxic Substances Control pursuant to the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act] would result in an unintended windfall for Foster-Gardner. Moreover, it is indeed arguable that an insured\u2019s early intervention in a dispute outside the civil action context may reduce any indemnity for which the insurer is ultimately held liable. That does not alter the scope of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend. Thus, even if Foster-Gardner is correct that its insurers will ultimately be obligated to indemnify costs incurred as a result of the [proceeding in question], this merely means that the insurers have an inherent incentive to participate in [the] proceeding[] where the costs are ascertained. Under the language of the policy, however, this is a judgment call left solely to the insurer (\u2018the company . . . may make such . . . settlement of any claim ... as it deems expedient\u2019). [Citations.] In any event, . . . \u2018this anomaly is more imagined than real since insurance companies routinely pay \u201cclaims\u201d that have not ripened into \u201csuits\u201d and which therefore have not triggered a defense obligation.\u2019 \u201d (Foster-Gardner, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 883, first and third ellipses in parenthetical in <em>Foster-Gardner.) </em>In so stating, we assumed that, as a general matter, a \u201cdispute outside the civil action context\u201d in the form of a \u201cclaim\u201d involving the insured in a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute may ripen into a \u201cdispute\u201d within that \u201ccontext\u201d in the form of a \u201csuit,\u201d in which the insurer may \u201cultimately [be] held liable\u201d for \u201cindemnity.\u201d We also assumed, more specifically, that Foster-Gardner\u2019s \u201cinsurers\u201d might \u201cultimately be obligated to indemnify costs incurred as a result of the\u201d proceeding in question if it passed from \u201cclaim\u201d to \u201csuit.\u201d But we did <em>not </em>hold that the duty to indemnify extends to any money <em>in addition to that ordered by a </em>court\u2014including any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">In arriving at our conclusion, we decline to rewrite the provision imposing the duty to indemnify in order to remove its limitation to money ordered by a court. We will not do so for the insured itself, in order to shift to the insurer some or all of the potentially substantial costs that might be imposed on the insured as the outcome of a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. Neither will we do so for considerations of public policy, in order, perhaps, to promote the outcome itself through such a shifting of costs\u2014for example, to advance the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination\u2019s effects by calling in the insurer\u2019s resources in supplement to those of an insured that is prosperous or in place of those of an insured that is not. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>reason is that we do not rewrite any provision of any contract, including the standard policy underlying any individual policy, for any purpose. (See <em>Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 75-76.) To do so with regard to the standard policy, with which we are here concerned, might have untoward effects generally on individual insurers and individual insureds and also on society itself. Through the standard policy, individual insurers made promises, and individual insureds paid premiums, against the risk of loss. To rewrite the provision imposing the duty to indemnify in order to remove its limitation to money ordered by a court might compel insurers to give more than they promised and might allow insureds to get more than they paid for, thereby denying their \u201cgeneral[] free[dom] to contract as they please[]\u201d of any effect in the matter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 75; accord, <em>Linnastruth v. Mut. Benefit etc. Assn. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 216, 218 [137 P.2d 833].) It is conceivable that to rewrite the provision thus might result in providing society itself with benefits that might outweigh any costs that it might impose on individual insurers and individual insureds. It is conceivable. But unknown. Knowledge \u201cdepend[s] in'large part on\u201d what we are ill suited for, that is, the \u201camassing and analyzing of complex and extensive empirical data.\u201d <em>(Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 76.) Without such knowledge, we could not proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Against our determinations, Powerine presents a number of arguments. None proves persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">As to Foster-Gardner\u2019s syllogism, Powerine argues that, even if the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, it does not follow that a determination that \u201cthere is no duty to defend <em>automatically </em>means that there is no duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>(State of N.Y. v. Blank, supra, </em>745 F.Supp. at p. 844, italics added.) To the extent that Powerine suggests that the absence of a duty to defend does not <em>necessarily </em>entail the absence of a duty to indemnify <em>under some possible comprehensive general liability insurance policy, </em>it is surely right. But it is just as surely wrong to the extent that it asserts that the absence of a duty to defend does not <em>actually </em>entail the absence of a duty to indemnify <em>under the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy. </em>For under the standard policy, if not under some individual one, this is the case: If the duty to defend does not arise because \u201cdamages\u201d are not sought in any amount in a \u201csuit,\u201d i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court, then the duty to indemnify cannot arise because \u201cdamages,\u201d i.e., money ordered by a court, cannot be fixed in their amount since they have not been sought in the first place. (Cf. <em>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, supra, </em>916 F.2d at p. 743 [holding that, if there is no \u201csuit,\u201d there cannot be any \u201cdamages\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>As to our holding that the duty to indemnify is limited to money ordered by a court, Powerine argues that we should read the provision imposing the duty to indemnify, in spite of its limitation to money ordered by a court, to extend to expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. It invokes section 1644 of the Civil Code: \u201cThe words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense, rather than according to their strict legal meaning; unless used by the parties in a technical sense, or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage, in which case the latter must be followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">By its terms, however, Civil Code section 1644 seems more applicable to an individual policy, which constitutes a contract reflecting the \u201cactual agreement between a given insurer and a given insured\u201d <em>(Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 45), than to the standard policy, which does not <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">But even if we apply Civil Code section 1644 to the standard policy, we read the provision imposing the duty to indemnify, in the \u201cordinary and popular sense\u201d of its \u201cwords\u201d rather than according to any \u201cstrict legal meaning\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>to be limited to money ordered by a court, and not to extend to expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. We do so because we consider the provision, as we must, in its full context. As stated, in both the legal and the broader culture, \u201cdamages\u201d exist traditionally inside of court. True it is, \u201cdamages\u201d have begun to appear in some administrative agencies, albeit only relatively lately and relatively infrequently. (See generally <em>Walnut Creek Manor </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 255-273; <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 355-386.) But, within the standard policy, \u201cdamages\u201d exist <em>solely </em>inside of court, especially in light of their linkage therein to a \u201csuit,\u201d i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court. The provision imposing the duty to defend expressly links \u201cdamages\u201d to a \u201csuit,\u201d because it is in a \u201csuit\u201d that \u201cdamages\u201d are sought in some amount through the court\u2019s order. The provision imposing the duty to indemnify impliedly links \u201cdamages\u201d to a \u201csuit,\u201d because it is in a \u201csuit\u201d that \u201cdamages\u201d are fixed in their amount through such order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">That the provision imposing the duty to indemnify happens to be limited to .money ordered by a court more impliedly than expressly is of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>consequence. An implied limitation is sufficient; an express limitation is not necessary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Neither is it of any consequence that the provision imposing the duty to indemnify with its more implied than express limitation might be less \u201cconspicuous, plain and clear\u201d <em>(Steven v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 862, 878 [27 Cal.Rptr. 172, 377 P.2d 284]; accord, <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Jacober </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 193, 202 [110 Cal.Rptr. 1, 514 P.2d 953]) than it would have been with a more express than implied limitation. It is an <em>exclusionary </em>provision, however, that is said to require \u201cconspicuousness,\u201d \u201cplainness,\u201d and \u201cclarity.\u201d <em>(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Jacober, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 202.) The provision imposing the duty to indemnify is simply not such: It does not <em>exclude </em>anything or anyone from the scope of the duty to indemnify, but merely <em>defines </em>the duty\u2019s scope in the first place. With that said, it is nevertheless adequately conspicuous, plain, and clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Powerine also argues that we should read the provision imposing the duty to indemnify, in spite of its limitation to money ordered by a court, to extend to expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute, in light of, inter alia, <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297], and <em>Lamb v. Belt Casualty Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.App.2d 624 [40 P.2d 311].</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">But neither <em>Isaacson </em>nor <em>Lamb </em>supports such a reading of the provision imposing the duty to indemnify. For neither supports a reading of the provision without any limitation to money ordered by a court. Rather, each stands, at most, for the proposition that, when an insurer breaches one of its duties, the insured may recover damages for harm arising therefrom, including an amount that it paid a third party in settlement. (See <em>Isaacson v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 791-792; <em>Lamb v. Belt Casualty Co., supra, </em>3 Cal.App.2d at pp. 630-632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">Powerine then argues to the effect that we should rewrite the provision imposing the duty to indemnify in order to remove its limitation to money ordered by a court. Its basis appears to be this: The limitation gives the insured a deterrent against compromise and an incentive toward litigation, and accordingly conflicts generally with the public policy in favor of settlement, which encourages compromise and discourages litigation, and specifically with the public policy underlying various environmental statutes, including those cited above, which gives the subject of a proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>before the administrative agency in question an incentive toward compromise and a deterrent against litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">But, as we have explained, not even for considerations of public policy would we rewrite the provision imposing the duty to indemnify in order to remove its limitation to money ordered by a court. In any event, such considerations seem hardly substantial. In spite of the limitation\u2014from all that appears both generally and specifically with regard to proceedings conducted before administrative agencies pursuant to environmental statutes\u2014compromise is regularly achieved, and litigation is regularly avoided. Recall that, in the same provision in which it imposes on the insurer a duty to defend the insured, the standard policy grants the insurer a right to settle any at least potentially covered dispute involving the insured. We may infer that, in a \u201clarge percentage\u201d of such disputes, insurers exercise their right, <em>(Comunale </em>v. <em>Traders &amp; General Ins. Co. </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 654, 659 [328 P.2d 198, 68 A.L.R.2d 883]; accord, e.g., <em>Commercial Union Assurance Companies v. Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 912, 917 [164 Cal.Rptr. 709, 610 P.2d 1038] (by the court).) That is because we know that, in a \u201clarge percentage\u201d of such disputes, they in fact achieve compromise and avoid litigation. <em>(Comunale </em>v. <em>Traders &amp; General Ins. Co., supra, </em>50 Cal.2d at p. 659; accord, e.g., <em>Commercial Union Assurance Companies v. Safeway Stores, Inc., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 917 (by the court).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">We arrive at our conclusion not unaware that other courts have held or stated, in terms or in effect, that the duty to indemnify is not limited to money ordered by a court, but may extend to expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the reasons that we have stated, we cannot, and will not, follow.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">We turn now to the decision of the Court of Appeal, which ordered issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order denying the London Insurers\u2019 motion for summary adjudication of the issue of their duty to indemnify Powerine under their comprehensive general liability and other insurance policies, and to make a new order granting what they sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">At the threshold, we believe that the Court of Appeal was right to subject to independent review the superior court\u2019s order denying summary adjudication of the issue of the London Insurers\u2019 duty to indemnify. A ruling denying summary adjudication is so scrutinized. (E.g., <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1450 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 54].) It resolves a pure question of law <em>(ibid.), </em>namely, whether there is any triable issue as to any material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to adjudication in his favor as a matter of law (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. (c) &amp; (f)). The same is true of a ruling granting summary adjudication. (E.g., <em>Maxconn Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1267, 1272 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 750]; <em>Casey v. Overhead Door Corp. </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 112, 118 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 603].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">On the merits, we believe that the Court of Appeal was also right to direct the superior court to vacate its order denying summary adjudication of the issue of the London Insurers\u2019 duty to indemnify and to make a new order granting summary adjudication thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary adjudication, like that of the London Insurers on the issue of their duty to indemnify Powerine, entails a determination whether there is any triable issue as to any material fact, and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled as a matter of law to an adjudication that it does not owe any such duty. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. (c) &amp; (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">The Court of Appeal concluded that policy No. LAB 2579, the comprehensive general liability insurance policy for the term from May 1, 1958, to May 1, 1961, imposes on the London Insurers a duty to indemnify Powerine that is limited to money ordered by a court, and does not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency, like the Regional Water Boards, pursuant to an environmental statute, like the Porter-Cologne Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Policy No. LAB 2579 imposes on the London Insurers a duty to indemnify Powerine with language like that of the standard policy, stating that the \u201cUnderwriters\u201d \u201c[d]o hereby agree with the Assured\u201d \u201c[t]o pay on behalf of the Assured all sums which the Assured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages\u201d for harm proved within coverage, \u201cirrespective of whether such damages are imposed by law or assumed under contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Policy No. LAB 2579 also imposes on the London Insurers a duty to defend Powerine with language like that of the standard policy, stating that the \u201cUnderwriters shall\u201d \u201c[d]efend in his name and behalf any suit against the Assured arising out of\u2019 harm \u201calleg[ed]\u201d within coverage \u201cand seeking damages on account thereof or seeking damages by reason of a contract under which the Assured assumed or is alleged to have assumed liability of others therefor . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">That the duty to indemnify under policy No. LAB 2579 is limited to money ordered by a court is supported by Foster-Gardner\u2019s syllogism. The syllogism here is <em>not </em>predicated on any assumption that the absence of a duty to defend <em>necessarily </em>entails the absence of a duty to indemnify <em>under some possible policy of comprehensive general liability insurance. </em>It is predicated, instead, on the fact that the absence of a duty to defend <em>actually </em>entails the absence of a duty to indemnify <em>under this individual policy of comprehensive general liability insurance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">That the duty to indemnify under policy No. LAB 2579 is limited to money ordered by a court is confirmed by the full context of the provision imposing the duty, with its language referring to \u201cdamages.\u201d The wider focus on the policy within the legal and broader culture reveals, as stated, that \u201cdamages\u201d exist traditionally inside of court. The narrower focus on the policy itself reveals this: The provision imposing the duty to defend expressly links \u201cdamages\u201d to a \u201csuit,\u201d because it is in a \u201csuit\u201d that \u201cdamages\u201d are sought in some amount through the court\u2019s order. The provision imposing the duty to indemnify impliedly links \u201cdamages\u201d to a \u201csuit,\u201d because it is in a \u201csuit\u201d that \u201cdamages\u201d are fixed in their amount through such order. That it declares itself applicable \u201cirrespective of whether such damages are imposed by law or assumed under contract\u201d is not to the contrary, merely recognizing as it does that the \u201cAssured\u201d may find itself responsible for the underlying harm through its own tortious conduct or through its agreement to \u201cindemnify\u201d or \u201chold\u201d another \u201charmless\u201d for the other\u2019s tortious conduct (see <em>Old Republic Ins.

One may assume that, at the time of the issuance of the policy in 1958, both the London Insurers and Powerine were acquainted with administrative agencies and environmental statutes\u2014although one could not contend that either could have foreseen the creation of administrative agencies like <em>these </em>agencies, which constitute a new kind of entity, or the enactment of environmental statutes like <em>this </em>statute, which constitutes a new kind of measure (see <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822, fn. 8). Even if the language of the provision imposing the duty to indemnify were, in fact, unclear in its limitation to money ordered by a court, there is simply no basis to conjecture that the London Insurers believed that Powerine understood the words to extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute, whether the agency or the statute was new or otherwise. Likewise, even if this language were, in fact, unclear in this regard, there is simply no basis to speculate that Powerine had objectively reasonable expectations\u2014or indeed any expectations whatsoever\u2014that the words extended so far.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">For the reasons stated above, we must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">George, C.

It is, rather, a factual reality that we must all confront. Hence, if there is indeed a \u201cyawning gap,\u201d it is not in <em>our </em>analysis.

I would hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">The issue presented here is logically related to two earlier decisions of this court that also dealt with the subject of insurance coverage under CGL policies in the context of enforcement proceedings under state and federal environmental protection laws. In <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] <em>(AIU), </em>this court held that when the government recovers or imposes environmental pollution remediation costs in a civil suit, those costs are, in the words of the standard CGL policy, sums that the insured is \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 837, 841.) I joined in that decision, which was unanimous. In <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265] <em>(Foster-Gardner), </em>a bare majority of this court held that an administrative agency notice identifying the recipient as a party potentially responsible for environmental pollution, and directing the recipient to assume responsibility for remediation of the pollution, does not trigger the duty of defense under a standard CGL policy issued to the recipient. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 881-882.) In a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Mosk and Werdegar, I disagreed with that holding. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 888 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">Had this court adopted the reasoning and conclusion of the dissent in <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 857, 888, there would be little room for argument about the proper resolution of the issue presented here. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>jurisdictions where coercive administrative proceedings under state or federal environmental laws have been held to trigger a carrier\u2019s defense obligation under a standard CGL policy, invariably the courts have held also that administrative cleanup orders trigger a CGL carrier\u2019s duty to indemnify. (See, e.g., <em>Coakley v. Maine Bonding and Cas. Co. </em>(1992) 136 N.H. 402 [618 A.2d 777]; <em>Spangler Const. v. Indus. Crankshaft </em>(1990) 326 N.C. 133 [388 S.E.2d 557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">But the converse is not equally true. One may accept the majority decision in <em>Foster-Gardner </em>as binding precedent and yet conclude that a CGL insurance carrier has a duty to indemnify its insured for the costs of complying with an administrative cleanup order. Indeed, the rules of insurance policy construction articulated in <em>Foster-Gardner </em>and in <em>AIU </em>strongly favor this conclusion. (See <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 868-869; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Because an insurance policy is a contract, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract was formed controls the meaning of its terms. <em>(Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 868; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822.) \u201cSuch intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. ([Civ. Code], \u00a7 1639.) The \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1644), controls judicial interpretation. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1638.) Thus, if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning. [Citations.] [\u00b6] If there is ambiguity, however, it is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor (i.e., the insurer) believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1649.)\u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>at p. 822; see also <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>at p. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Here, the policy language to be construed under these rules obligates the carrier to indemnify the insured for \u201call sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages.\u201d The majority does not dispute that an insured is \u201clegally obligated\u201d to comply with an administrative cleanup order to remediate environmental pollution. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 963.) But the majority insists that money paid in compliance with an administrative cleanup order is not \u201cdamages\u201d because \u201cdamages\u201d are only \u201cmoney ordered by a court.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 964.) In defense of this notion that only a court may award damages, the majority relies heavily on <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 857, in which this court concluded that the term \u201csuit\u201d in the CGL policy provision defining the duty to defend refers only to a judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>The principal flaw in this analysis is that the term \u201csuit\u201d nowhere appears in the CGL policy\u2019s indemnity provision. The majority dismisses this objection by postulating that \u201c[t]he provision imposing the duty to indemnify <em>impliedly links </em>\u2018damages\u2019 to a \u2018suit,\u2019 i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 962, italics added.) This implied link between the defense and indemnity provisions, insofar as it imposes a judicial proceeding limitation, is a legal fiction that the majority conjures from the void to fill the yawning gap in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">To justify its linkage of the term \u201csuit\u201d in the defense provision and the term \u201cdamages\u201d in the indemnity provision, the majority states that \u201cit is in a \u2018suit\u2019 that \u2018damages\u2019 are fixed in their amount through the court\u2019s order.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 962, fn. omitted.) But to say that a court may award \u201cdamages\u201d in a civil \u201csuit\u201d in no way excludes the possibility that an administrative agency may also award \u201cdamages\u201d by administrative order, just as the power of a court to issue a subpoena or hear testimony does not logically exclude administrative agencies from doing likewise. This court has frequently acknowledged that administrative agencies may award damages, provided they act with statutory authority and without violating the state Constitution\u2019s judicial powers clause. (See, e.g., <em>Walnut Creek Manor </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 245, 255-256 [284 Cal.Rptr. 718, 814 P.2d 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">In <em>AIU, </em>this court construed the term \u201cdamages\u201d as used in standard CGL indemnity provisions in a way that reveals the flaws in the majority\u2019s conclusion here that the term is inherently limited to judicial proceedings. There, this court summarized the basic concepts underlying various statutory and dictionary definitions of \u201cdamages\u201d: \u201cEach [definition] requires there to be \u2018compensation,\u2019 in \u2018money,\u2019 \u2018recovered\u2019 by a party for \u2018loss\u2019 or \u2018detriment\u2019 it has suffered through the acts of another.\u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 826, fns. omitted.) Notably absent from this summary is the notion that damages are recoverable only through a judicial rather than an administrative proceeding. In <em>AIU, </em>this court concluded that \u201cdamages\u201d included not only money recovered by an administrative agency as reimbursement for cleanup costs that the agency had paid, but also the costs of complying with remedial cleanup injunctions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 837, 841-842.) This court rejected a narrow construction of damages that \u201cwould make insurance coverage hinge on the \u2018mere fortuity\u2019 of the way in which government agencies seek to enforce cleanup requirements, would unreasonably constrain the agencies\u2019 choice of cleanup mechanisms, and would introduce substantial inefficiency into the cleanup process.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 840-841.) And this court stressed that \u201can insured would reasonably expect equal coverage of the costs of equivalent or alternative remedies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 841-842.) Administrative cleanup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>orders and court injunctions are equivalent or alternative remedies for imposing pollution remediation costs, and an insured would reasonably expect equal coverage for both. The majority\u2019s limitation of \u201cdamages\u201d to money ordered by a court makes coverage turn on the fortuity of the government agency\u2019s choice of enforcement mechanism; it is just the sort of rigid and formalistic definition this court rejected in <em>AIU. </em>Under the logic of <em>AIU, </em>therefore, the costs of complying with an administrative order are within the indemnity coverage of the standard CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Further support for the conclusion that the parties to the CGL insurance agreement intended \u201cdamages\u201d to include costs of complying with administrative cleanup orders is found in the circumstances of the issuance of the policies in this case, as Justice Aldrich explained in his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal. After noting that neither \u201csuit\u201d nor \u201cjudgment\u201d appears in the indemnity provision of the policy at issue, which provided primary coverage, Justice Aldrich reasoned that the omission was persuasive evidence that the insurers, in drafting this policy, did not intend to indemnify only those damages awarded in a civil action or by a final judgment. Had they intended such limitations, the insurers could easily have agreed to pay on behalf of the insured, for example, \u201call sums that the insured becomes legally obligated by final judgment to pay as damages.\u201d The insurers did not do so in the primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Although language of this sort does not appear in the indemnity provision of the primary policy, it does appear in another CGL policy written and issued on the same day by the same carrier to the same insured. In this other policy, which provided excess coverage, the carrier promised to pay \u201call sums which the insured shall by law become liable to pay and shall pay <em>or by final judgment be adjudged to pay </em>... as damages. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The italicized language in the excess policy shows that the insurer understood how to restrict the indemnity obligation to sums that the insured was required to pay as damages by final judgment (that is, sums ordered by a court in a civil action) when that was its intent. This limitation should not be read into a policy from which the insurer appears to have deliberately omitted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Moreover, as Justice Aldrich also pointed out, reliance on an \u201cimplied link\u201d between provisions using markedly different language is inconsistent with Foster-Gardner\u2019s reasoning in contrasting the terms \u201csuit\u201d and \u201cclaim.\u201d The CGL policy at issue there required the insurers to defend a \u201csuit,\u201d but gave them discretion to investigate and settle a \u201cclaim.\u201d <em>(Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 878.) This court reasoned that the use of these distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>terms \u201cindicates that the insurers\u2019 differing rights and obligations with respect to \u2018suits\u2019 and \u2018claims\u2019 were deliberately and intentionally articulated in the policies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 880.) We further reasoned that a policy\u2019s \u201ccareful separation\u201d of the obligations respecting \u201csuits\u201d from those concerning \u201cclaims\u201d revealed the drafters\u2019 intention to ascribe differing meanings to the two obligations. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This reasoning applies with equal force to the CGL policy\u2019s careful separation of the obligations respecting defense from those concerning indemnification. One must assume that use of different language to describe the nature and scope of these distinct obligations was deliberate and intentional. In particular, the use of the term \u201csuit\u201d in defining the defense obligation, and its omission from the definition of the indemnity obligation, reveals an intention that the indemnity obligation would be triggered not only by damages awarded in a civil action but also by the very same monetary obligation when imposed by a coercive administrative order. In other words, applying the <em>Foster-Gardner </em>rationale leads to a conclusion contrary to that reached by the majority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The majority\u2019s analysis is also inconsistent with this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Vandenberg v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229]. At issue there was \u201cwhether a [CGL] policy that provides coverage for sums the insured is \u2018legally obligated to pay as damages\u2019 may cover losses arising from a breach of contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 824.) Construing this language according to \u201cthe meaning a layperson would ascribe to [it],\u201d this court concluded that the policy provided indemnity coverage for the contract claim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 840.) This court explained that a contrary rule was unacceptable because it would \u201c[p]redicat[e] coverage upon [the] injured party\u2019s choice of remedy or the form of action sought\u201d and thereby \u201cpermit the injured . . . party to determine insurance coverage.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Applying <em>Vandenberg\u2019s </em>logic to the issue here, I would conclude that a layperson would understand the term \u201cdamages\u201d to include any sum the insured became legally obligated to pay to remedy harm, whether the legal obligation was established by court judgment or administrative order. The contrary rule, which the majority adopts here, is unacceptable because it permits an administrative agency to determine insurance coverage by its choice of remedy. If the agency proceeds to court to impose the cleanup costs, the indemnity obligation is triggered <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 841), but if the agency uses a coercive administrative order instead, the insured is left without coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">In support of its holding that an administrative cleanup order does not trigger a CGL carrier\u2019s duty to indemnify, the majority relies also on this syllogism: (1) A CGL carrier\u2019s duty to defend is broader than its duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>indemnify; (2) administrative agency proceedings do not trigger a CGL carrier\u2019s duty to defend; (3) therefore, an administrative order to pay remediation expenses does not trigger a CGL carrier\u2019s duty to indemnify. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 960-961.) The syllogism is logically unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">On several occasions, this court has remarked that an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend is broader than its obligation to indemnify, but we have explained that this means only that the insurer must defend a suit \u201cif the complaint shows a <em>potential </em>liability within the policy coverage\u201d <em>(Gribaldo, Jacobs, Jones &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Agrippina Versicherunges </em>A. <em>G. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 434, 456 [91 Cal.Rptr. 6, 476 P.2d 406], italics in original), even though the insured ultimately prevails in the suit or the damages actually awarded are not within the policy coverage. (See <em>Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co. </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 38, 59 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 118, 948 P.2d 909] [defense duty is broader because it \u201cextends beyond claims that are actually covered to those that are merely potentially so\u201d].) Thus this court has used the maxim that the defense obligation is broader than the indemnity obligation to explain why the defense obligation may exist even when the indemnity obligation does not. Before today, this court has never used the maxim to impose an artificial limit on the indemnity obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">In the landmark insurance case of <em>Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168], this court held that an insurer could have a duty to defend even when there was no duty to indemnify and in the course of explaining this holding we said that the duty to defend \u201cis independent of the indemnification coverage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 274.) Because the insurer\u2019s two primary obligations are defined by separate policy provisions that use different language, the scope of each should be assessed separately, without the sort of artificial linkage that the majority imposes. (See <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. and Sur. </em>(1994) 123 Wash.2d 891, 902 [874 P.2d 142, 148] [\u201cThe two duties, to defend and to indemnify, should be examined independently\u201d].) No general rule or maxim can take precedence over the basic principle that the mutual intention of the parties when they formed the insurance contract is controlling. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822.) The proper measure of the duty to indemnify is the language of the indemnity provision, construed according to the accepted rules for insurance policies. I have explained why application of those rules leads to the conclusion that the CGL insurer must indemnify its policyholder for the costs of complying with the administrative cleanup order. I would so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">It remains to be seen exactly what impact today\u2019s decision will have on the practical operation of insurance coverage for environmental pollution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>cleanup costs. A CGL policyholder who receives from an administrative agency a demand to clean up pollution that has caused property damage may still look to the carrier for financial assistance, but the policyholder must be careful in phrasing its claim against the carrier. Because the majority here and in <em>Foster-Gardner </em>categorizes an environmental agency cleanup demand or order as a \u201cclaim,\u201d the policyholder must invoke the carrier\u2019s obligation to settle claims rather than its obligation to indemnify for damages that the policyholder is legally obligated to pay. If the carrier agrees to \u201csettle\u201d the \u201cclaim\u201d by authorizing the policyholder to comply with the administrative order, then it appears that the carrier would be obligated to pay the cost of this \u201csettlement,\u201d subject to policy provisions regarding deductible amounts, coverage limits, and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">If the carrier declines to \u201csettle\u201d the \u201cclaim\u201d by providing the policyholder with the funds needed to comply with agency demands, the policyholder has two options. The policyholder may comply with the agency directive by using its own funds and then seek to recover these costs by bringing suit against the insurer, not for breach of the duty to indemnify, but for breach of the duty to accept a reasonable settlement. Although this option achieves a prompt cleanup of the environment, consistent with the goals of environmental protection legislation, it may not be financially or legally attractive to the policyholder. Not only would the policyholder have to fund the cleanup on its own, a task that may be beyond its financial resources, it would also have to assume a difficult burden of proof in litigation against the carrier for breach of the duty to accept a reasonable settlement. The policyholder normally would have to prove, among other things, that failure to accept the \u201csettlement\u201d by compliance with the cleanup demand exposed the policyholder to liability in excess of the policy limits (see <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 937, 940-941 [132 Cal.Rptr. 424, 553 P.2d 584]) or some other risk of particular harm (see <em>Bodenhamer v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1472, 1478-1479 [238 Cal.Rptr. 177] [even absent risk of an excess judgment, failure to settle may constitute bad faith if it exposes policyholder to adverse consequences, such as loss of business goodwill]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">If the carrier will not fund the policyholder\u2019s costs of compliance with the cleanup order, the policyholder\u2019s other option is to decline to comply with the order, thereby forcing the agency to resort to judicial proceedings that will trigger the carrier\u2019s duty to defend and, should the agency prevail, as it almost invariably does, the carrier\u2019s duty to indemnify. If the cost of complying with the agency\u2019s judgment against the policyholder exceeds the policy limits, the policyholder may sue the carrier for the excess on a theory that the carrier, by declining to accept a reasonable settlement, breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Thus, the majority\u2019s decision does not leave the policyholder faced with an agency cleanup order entirely without remedies against the CGL liability carrier, but because those remedies are not obvious to an unsophisticated policyholder, there is a risk that policyholders will forfeit valuable insurance coverage by failing to promptly invoke the carrier\u2019s settlement obligation. A policyholder astute enough to invoke the settlement obligation may still find itself enmeshed in a complex and tortuous series of legal proceedings before it obtains from the carrier the liability coverage for which it bargained. But the big losers in today\u2019s decision are public health and the environment, because a policyholder\u2019s only financially viable option, should the carrier decline to fund compliance with agency directives, may often be to ignore agency cleanup orders, thereby forcing the government to resort to litigation and delaying effective remediation of environmental pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">The petition of real party in interest Powerine Oil Company, Inc., for a rehearing was denied April 18, 2001.
