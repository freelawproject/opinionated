A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">In <em>Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc. </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 457 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 138 L.Ed.2d 585] (hereafter sometimes Glickman), a case of first impression, the United States Supreme Court, by a bare five-to-four majority, concluded that a marketing order issued by the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States did not implicate any right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment by compelling funding of generic advertising\u2014that is, advertising for a commodity as such, without reference to brand, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>In this cause, itself a case of first impression, we consider whether a marketing order issued by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture of the State of California implicates any right to freedom of speech under either the First Amendment or article I by compelling funding of generic advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">As we shall explain, we conclude that the marketing order in question does not implicate any right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment, but does indeed implicate such a right under article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The background to this action\u2014historical, statutory, and administrative\u2014is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In the course of the Great Depression, Congress enacted the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 or the AMAA. (See generally Act of June 3, 1937, ch. 296, 50 Stat. 246 et seq., as amended, codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The AMAA declared, as one of Congress\u2019s policies, the establishing and maintaining of orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in order to raise and support prices for their producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">To effectuate this policy, the AMAA authorized the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States to enter into \u201cmarketing agreements,\u201d which are contract-like arrangements with the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities concerning marketing matters, and provided that the making of any such agreement should not be held violative of any federal antitrust law.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">To the same end, the AMAA also authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to issue \u201cmarketing orders,\u201d which are regulations governing marketing matters for the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities. It provided for participation in the administration of such orders by the regulated producers and handlers themselves. It substantially restricted the terms of such orders generally to the limitation on total quantity marketed, the allotment of amounts for purchase, the allotment of amounts for marketing, the determination of the existence and extent of any surplus, the establishment of reserve pools, and, impliedly, the institution of grading and standards and the conduct of research. It also mandated that the regulated producers and handlers had to contribute funds to cover related expenses. It authorized the secretary to terminate as well as issue such orders. It generally provided that no such order could become effective unless approved or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>favored, as specified therein, by the regulated producers. Similarly, it generally provided that no such order could remain effective unless favored, as specified therein, by the regulated producers. It authorized the secretary to conduct referenda, expressly with regard to the coming into effect of such an order and impliedly with regard to its remaining in effect. In light of features of this sort, the mechanism of regulation that such an order sets up is, essentially, one of \u201cself-regulation\u201d by the regulated producers and handlers. (H.R.Rep. No. 99-271, 1st Sess., pt. 1, pp. 195-196 (1985), reprinted in 1985 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 1299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Since 1937, Congress has amended the AMAA on several occasions. As a general matter, the AMAA has retained the core of the provisions described above, but has expanded beyond their periphery. Notably, although it continues to restrict the terms of marketing orders for agricultural commodities that it authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to impose, it now permits more than it did originally. Specifically, it today allows, among other terms, the undertaking of research and development projects, encompassing, for plums and 25 other specified commodities,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cany form of marketing promotion including paid advertising,\u201d \u201cthe expense of\u2019 which is \u201cto be paid from funds collected pursuant to the marketing order\u201d in question. (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c(6)(I).) It first allowed a term of this sort, albeit not extending to advertising, in 1954. It first allowed one extending to advertising for a single specified commodity in 1962. It then did the same for 14 specified commodities, including plums, in 1965. It did likewise for the remaining 11 specified commodities, one or more at a time, in 1970, 1971, 1978, 1980, 1983, 1988, and 1999. From all that appears, and plainly with respect to plums (see H.R.Rep. No. 89-846, 1st Sess., pp. 2-4 (1965), reprinted in 1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 4143-4144), it has allowed terms extending to advertising in order to satisfy requests made by, among others, the regulated producers themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Marketing Order No. 917 (see generally 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 917 (2000)), entitled the California Tree Fruit Agreement, was issued by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the AMAA in various years in its various subparts, deriving ultimately from Marketing Order No. 36, issued in 1939. It presently applies to pears and peaches, and formerly applied to plums as well. It provides for the establishment of a \u201cControl Committee,\u201d whose members are drawn, largely if not exclusively, from the regulated producers and handlers themselves. It provides too for a \u201cCommodity Committee\u201d for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>of the fruits, which is effectively filled with or controlled by the regulated producers themselves. In addition, and among other things, it provides for the Control Committee\u2019s administration of its terms. It also provides for each Commodity Committee\u2019s undertaking of research and development projects, encompassing \u201cany form of marketing promotion including paid advertising,\u201d \u201cthe expenses of\u2019 which \u201cshall be paid from funds collected pursuant to\u201d assessments imposed on the regulated handlers by the secretary, on the committee\u2019s recommendation. (7 C.F.R. \u00a7 917.39 (2000) [presently, for pears and peaches]; 7 C.F.R. former \u00a7 917.39 (1991) [formerly, for plums as well]; see 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 917.37 (2000) [presently, for pears and peaches]; 7 C.F.R. former \u00a7 917.37 (1991) [formerly, for plums as well].) It has so provided for pears and peaches since 1976. It had done the same for plums since 1971. It sets out specific regulations regarding both fruit containers and packs.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Marketing Order No. 917 was terminated by the Secretary of Agriculture in 1991 as to plums because the results of a referendum conducted that year \u201cdemonstrated a lack of producer support. . . .\u201d (56 Fed.Reg. 23773 (May 24, 1991).)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Also in the course of the Great Depression, indeed within days after Congress enacted the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 or the AMAA, the Legislature enacted the California Marketing Act of 1937 or the CMA. (See generally Stats. 1937, ch. 404, \u00a7 1, p. 1329 et seq., as amended, codified at Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 58601 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Like the AMAA, the CMA declared, as one of the Legislature\u2019s policies, the establishing and maintaining of orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in order to raise and support prices for their producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Also like the AMAA, the CMA authorized the Director of Agriculture of the State of California\u2014who is now styled the Secretary of Food and Agriculture (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 50)\u2014to enter into \u201cmarketing agreements,\u201d i.e., contract-like arrangements with the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities concerning marketing matters, which would be binding, expressly, only on those signatory thereto, and would be exempt, impliedly, from all state antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Again like the AMAA, the CMA authorized the Director of Agriculture to issue \u201cmarketing orders,\u201d i.e., regulations governing marketing matters for the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities, which did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>following: provided for participation in the administration of such orders by the regulated producers and handlers themselves; substantially restricted the terms of such orders generally to, among others, the determination of the existence and extent of any surplus, the limitation on total quantity marketed, the allotment of amounts for purchase, the allotment of amounts for marketing, the regulation of periods for marketing, the establishment of reserve pools, the institution of grading and standards, and, impliedly, the conduct of research; and mandated that the regulated producers and handlers had to contribute funds to cover related expenses. It contained provisions relating to the termination of such orders, their coming into effect, and their remaining in effect, and, impliedly, the conduct of referenda. In light of features of this sort, the mechanism of regulation that such an order sets up is, essentially, self-regulation by the regulated producers and handlers themselves. (See <em>Voss </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 900, 907, 918-924 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">But, unlike the AMAA, the CMA authorized the Director of Agriculture to impose, among the terms of such a marketing order, the establishment of \u201cplans for advertising and sales promotion to create new or larger markets for agricultural commodities,\u201d specifically, plans that are \u201cdirected toward increasing the sale of such commodity without reference to a particular brand,\u201d etc. (Stats. 1937, ch. 404, \u00a7 1, pp. 1335-1336.) It mandated that the regulated producers and handlers subject to a marketing order with such a term had to contribute funds to cover related expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Since 1937, the Legislature has amended the CMA on several occasions. As a general matter, the CMA has retained the core of the provisions described above, but has expanded beyond their periphery. Such expansion, however, is not worthy of note here.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">In 1991, after the federal California Tree Fruit Agreement was terminated as to plums, there was no federal or state marketing agreement or order in place. The Secretary of Food and Agriculture then entered into a marketing agreement pursuant to the CMA with about 80 percent of the producers (apparently) and handlers of the fruit, evidently at their instigation, entitled the California Plum Marketing Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In 1992, the California Plum Marketing Agreement went into effect. It established a Plum Advisory Board, comprising producer-handlers and handlers, and authorized it to conduct research concerning plums and to engage in advertising, sales promotion, and market development. It was binding on its signatories only. It purportedly had several weaknesses, including an inability to require full participation, obtain adequate funding, and prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>free riders, and also an absence of provisions for quality standards and inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In 1993, a group of plum producers and handlers, which called itself the Stone Fruit Coalition, approached the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, and requested him to issue a marketing order pursuant to the CMA, specifically a marketing order that the group itself proposed. <em>(Voss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 904.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In 1994, the Secretary of Food and Agriculture issued a marketing order pursuant to the CMA, entitled the California Plum Marketing Program, which conformed to the one that the Stone Fruit Coalition proposed. (See <em>Voss v. Superior Court, supra, 46 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 904-906.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The California Plum Marketing Program provides for the establishment of a California Plum Marketing Board, which is virtually filled with, and totally controlled by, producers and/or producer-handlers of the fruit. In addition, and among other things, it provides for the board\u2019s administration of its terms. It also provides for the board\u2019s undertaking of activities extending to research; advertising, specifically generic advertising, along with sales promotion and market development; and the institution and implementation of quality standards and inspections. It provides as well for the board\u2019s assessment of funds from producers for expenses related to the foregoing activities, at a rate that may not exceed $0.20 per 28-pound box, including $0.02 for research, $0.11 for generic advertising along with sales promotion and market development, and $0.07 for quality standards and inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">On October 31, 1994, Gerawan Farming, Inc., filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Superior Court of Tulare County against, among others, the California Secretary of Food and Agriculture in his official capacity, originally Henry J. Voss, then Ann M. Veneman, now William J. Lyons, Jr. It challenged the California Plum Marketing Program, which was issued by the secretary pursuant to the CMA, under provisions including the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the free speech clause of subdivision (a) of section 2 of article I of the California Constitution. It alleged facts reflecting the historical, statutory, and administrative background, as set out above, relating to the AMAA and Marketing Order No. 917 and to the CMA and the California Plum Marketing Program. It also alleged facts, liberally construed, to the following effect: It produces and handles plums; plums constitute a lawful product; it has developed, and uses, a brand for marketing purposes; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising; its message is not false or misleading; nonetheless, the California Plum Marketing Program compels it to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will, and does so to some appreciable extent; the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising; the generic advertising, otherwise undescribed, \u201creflect[s] . . . viewpoints,\u201d political and ideological as well as commercial, \u201cto which it does not subscribe,\u201d and indeed with which it \u201cvehemently disagrees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Subsequently, in <em>Glickman, </em>a majority of the United States Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, concluded that Marketing Order No. 917,' which was issued by the United States Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the AMAA, did not implicate the right of parties including Gerawan to freedom of speech under the First Amendment by compelling funding of generic advertising. <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 467-477 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2137-2142].) They indicated that, had such a right been implicated, the appropriate standard for use in determining whether it had been violated would have been the test of <em>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 209 [97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261] (hereafter sometimes <em>Abood) </em>and its progeny, including <em>Keller </em>v. <em>State Bar of California </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 1 [110 S.Ct. 2228, 110 L.Ed.2d 1] (hereafter sometimes <em>Keller), </em>which had <em>not </em>been used by the court below\u2014 which \u201cinvolves] the compelled funding of speech\u201d generally <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 474, fn. 18 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2141])\u2014and not the test of <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 557 [100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341] (hereafter sometimes <em>Central Hudson), </em>which <em>had </em>been used by the court below\u2014 which \u201cinvolve[s] a restriction on commercial speech\u201d <em>(Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 474, fn. 18 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2141]). In the principal dissenting opinion, Justice Souter concluded that the marketing order in question did indeed implicate a First Amendment right to freedom of speech, was subject to examination under the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, and did not survive muster thereunder. <em>(Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 477-504 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2142-2156] (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).) In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas generally joined in Justice Souter\u2019s, but rejected the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, root and branch. <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 504-506 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2155-2156] (dis. opn. of Thomas, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Secretary of Food and Agriculture moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that Gerawan\u2019s complaint did not allege facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By order, the superior court granted the motion, but with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Gerawan proceeded to file an amended complaint. It challenged the California Plum Marketing Program under provisions including article I\u2019s free speech clause. It again alleged facts reflecting the historical, statutory, and administrative background, as set out above. Expanding somewhat the facts that it alleged previously, it also alleged facts, liberally construed, to the following effect: It produces and handles plums; plums constitute a lawful product; it has developed, and uses, a brand for marketing purposes; it engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising; its message is not false or misleading; nonetheless, the California Plum Marketing Program compels it to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will, and does so in excess of $80,000 per year; the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising; it \u201cdisagrees\u201d with, and indeed \u201cabhors,\u201d the generic advertising, otherwise undescribed, both on political and ideological grounds, as \u201csocialistic\u201d and \u201ccollectivist,\u201d and also on commercial grounds, as \u201cgrouping all . . . plums as though they are the same\u201d and as \u201cembarrassingly silly, idiotic and/or totally ineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Secretary of Food and Agriculture moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that Gerawan\u2019s amended complaint, like its original one, did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. By order, the superior court granted the motion, this time without leave to amend. It -stated that Gerawan \u201ccite[d] no authority for its argument that the California Constitution extends protections against compelled speech . . . greater than those provided in the United States Constitution which the United States Supreme Court [in Glickman] has held were not violated by\u201d Marketing Order No. 917, which it said was \u201cnot substantively distinguishable from\u201d the California Plum Marketing Program. It rendered judgment in the secretary\u2019s favor, and caused entry thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">After Gerawan filed a notice of appeal in the superior court, an appeal was docketed in the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Appellate District.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">By a judgment announced in a unanimous opinion certified for publication, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the superior court. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>apparently subjected to independent review the superior court\u2019s order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings submitted by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture. It proceeded to sustain the order. It acknowledged that it found \u201cpersuasive some of the reasoning in Justice Souter\u2019s dissent\u201d in <em>Glickman. </em>It nevertheless concluded that the California Plum Marketing Program does not implicate Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause, as construed by the <em>Glickman </em>majority. It determined that article I\u2019s free speech clause is not materially different from the First Amendment\u2019s. It attempted to render article I\u2019s free speech clause similar to the First Amendment\u2019s by construing article I\u2019s free speech clause as it believed other courts had construed the First Amendment\u2019s. It construed article I\u2019s free speech clause thus under a \u201cso-called \u2018principle of deference,\u2019 \u201d which it said operates when a state constitutional provision is \u201c \u2018similar\u2019 \u201d in its \u201c \u2018language\u2019 \u201d to a federal constitutional one.

That is because the right\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d is \u201cafforded\u201d not only to one who speaks but also to those who listen. <em>(Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va.

When the interests served by the speech at issue extend beyond those of the speaker to those of the listeners, the speaker, whoever or whatever it may be, may be deemed to possess the right in question.

That is to say, it does not run against the world, but only against governmental actors as opposed to private parties. (E.g., <em>Hurley v.

A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Article I\u2019s free speech clause took its present language and designation in 1980. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a), as amended June 3, 1980.) From there, it traces itself back to 1974, with the same language, but with a different designation as section 2. <em>(Id., </em>art. I, \u00a7 2, added Nov. 5, 1974.) Then to 1879, when the present California Constitution was framed, with a different designation as section 9, but with almost the same language: \u201cEvery citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right; and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>art. I, former \u00a7 9 (as adopted May 7,1879).) And <em>then </em>to 1849, when the original California Constitution was framed, with the same language and designation. (Cal. Const, of 1849, art. I, \u00a7 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Article I\u2019s free speech clause finds its prehistory outside of California in the New York Constitution <em>(Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 352, 366, fn. 9 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 993 P.2d 334]) and ultimately, perhaps, in Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries on the Laws of England <em>(Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 366, fn. 9; <em>Dailey v. Superior Court </em>(1896) 112 Cal. 94, 98 [44 P. 458]). But <em>not </em>in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. (E.g., <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 908 [153 Cal.Rptr. 854, 592 P.2d 341], affd. <em>sub nom. Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 74 [100 S.Ct. 2035, 64 L.Ed.2d 741]; see, e.g., Grodin, <em>Some Reflections on State Constitutions </em>(1988) 15 Hastings Const. L.Q. 391, 395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Although the designation of article I\u2019s free speech clause has changed appreciably over the years, from section 9 to section 2 to subdivision (a) of section 2, its language has not. (See <em>Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 365-366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">It is beyond peradventure that article I\u2019s free speech clause enjoys existence and force independent of the First Amendment\u2019s. In section 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>article I states, in these very terms, that \u201c[r]ights guaranteed by [the California] Constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d This statement extends to all such rights, including article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech. For the California Constitution is now, and has always been, a \u201cdocument of independent force and effect particularly in the area of individual liberties.\u201d <em>{People v. Hannon </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 588, 607, fn. 8 [138 Cal.Rptr. 885, 564 P.2d 1203] [speaking specifically of the present California Constitution]; accord, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Brisendine </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 528, 549-550 [119 Cal.Rptr. 315, 531 P.2d 1099].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Article I\u2019s free speech clause is at least as broad as the First Amendment\u2019s, and its right to freedom of speech is at least as great. (See, e.g., <em>Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 366-367; <em>Griset v. Fair Political Practices Com. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 851, 866, fn. 5 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 659, 884 P.2d 116]; <em>Blatty v. New York Times Co. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1033, 1041 [232 Cal.Rptr. 542, 728 P.2d 1177]; <em>Spiritual Psychic Science Church </em>v. <em>City of Azusa </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 501, 519 [217 Cal.Rptr. 225, 703 P.2d 1119]; <em>San Jose Mercury-News v. Municipal Court </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 498, 508 [179 Cal.Rptr. 772, 638 P.2d 655]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Glaze </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 841, 844, fn. 2 [166 Cal.Rptr. 859, 614 P.2d 291]; <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 908; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 652, 658 [119 Cal.Rptr. 468, 532 P.2d 116]; <em>Dailey v. Superior Court, supra, </em>112 Cal. at p. 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Hence, as to the points noted in our discussion of the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause and its right to freedom of speech, article I\u2019s free speech clause and <em>its </em>right to freedom of speech, <em>mutatis mutandis, </em>are at least in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Thus, under article I\u2019s free speech clause, as under the First Amendment\u2019s, \u201cspeech\u201d includes written expression as well as spoken. Indeed, under article I\u2019s free speech clause, it does so in terms. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Also, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech, like the First Amendment\u2019s, does not restrict itself depending upon the identity or legal character of the speaker. (See <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 359, 363, fn. 2, &amp; 368 [138 Cal.Rptr. 77, 562 P.2d 1326, 4 A.L.R.4th 273] <em>[semble]; People v. American Automobile Ins. Co. </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 317, 322, 328 [282 P.2d 559] <em>[semble].) </em>What matters is the speech itself. (See <em>Jacoby v. State Bar, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 363, fn. 2, &amp; 368.) That is because the right\u2019s protection is afforded not only to one who speaks but also to those who listen. <em>{Ibid.) </em>When the interests served by the speech at issue extend beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>those of the speaker to those of the listeners, the speaker, we think, whoever or whatever it may be, may be deemed to possess the right in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech, like the First Amendment\u2019s, is implicated in speaking itself. Because speech results from what a speaker chooses to say and what he chooses not to say, the right in question comprises both a right to speak freely and also a right to refrain from doing so at all, and is therefore put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from saying what he otherwise would say and also by compelling him to say what he otherwise would not say.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Similarly, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech, like the First Amendment\u2019s, may also be implicated in the use of money. Because speech results, through money\u2019s enabling, from what speech a speaker chooses to fund and what speech he chooses not to fund, the right in question comprises both a right to fund speech meaningfully and also a right to refrain from doing so altogether, and is therefore put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from funding speech that he otherwise would fund and also by compelling him to fund speech that he otherwise would not fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">As a general rule, however, article I\u2019s free speech clause and its right to freedom of speech are not only as broad and as great as the First Amendment\u2019s, they are even \u201cbroader\u201d and \u201cgreater.\u201d <em>(Dailey v. Superior Court, supra, </em>112 Cal. at p. 98; accord, <em>Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 366-367; see, e.g., <em>Griset </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 866, fn. 5; <em>Blatty v.

Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">It is, of course, true that this general rule does not preclude the possibility of exception. (See <em>Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">But, at least in the following particulars, it is indeed the general rule, and not any exception, that applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">First, article I\u2019s free speech clause, unlike the First Amendment\u2019s, specifies a \u201cright\u201d to freedom of speech explicitly and not merely by implication. (Friesen, <em>Should California\u2019s Constitutional Guarantees of Individual Rights Apply Against Private Actors? </em>(1989) 17 Hastings Const. L.Q. 111, 118, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>119-122; Note, <em>Rediscovering the California Declaration of Rights </em>(1974) 26 Hastings L.J. 481, 494; see Crosby, <em>New Frontiers: Individual Rights Under the California Constitution </em>(1989) 17 Hastings Const. L.Q. 81, 81-82.) Article I and the First Amendment are not dissimilar in providing, in the First Amendment\u2019s words, that \u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\u201d (U.S. Const., 1st Amend.), and, in article I\u2019s, that \u201c[a] law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a)). But, otherwise, article I and the First Amendment are altogether different, because only article I, and not the First Amendment, affirmatively declares as a \u201cright\u201d that \u201c[e]very person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a)), (Crosby, <em>New Frontiers: Individual Rights Under the California Constitution, supra, </em>17 Hastings Const. L.Q. at pp. 81-82; Friesen, <em>Should California\u2019s Constitutional Guarantees of Individual Rights Apply Against Private Actors?, supra, </em>17 Hastings Const. L.Q. at pp. 118, 119-122; see Fritz, <em>More Than \u201cShreds and Patches\u201d: California\u2019s First Bill of Rights </em>(1989) 17 Hastings Const. L.Q. 13, 22, 23, 31; Note, <em>Rediscovering the California Declaration of Rights, supra, </em>26 Hastings L.J. at pp. 493-495, 510.) Hence, article I itself grants a right to freedom of speech, and does not merely safeguard some such right against encroachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Second, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech, unlike the First Amendment\u2019s, is unbounded in range. It runs against the world, including private parties as well as governmental actors. (See <em>Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 908-911; Fritz, <em>More Than \u201cShreds and Patches\u201d: California\u2019s First Bill of Rights, supra, </em>17 Hastings Const. L.Q. at p. 31 [semble]; Friesen, <em>Should California\u2019s Constitutional Guarantees of Individual Rights Apply Against Private Actors?, supra, </em>17 Hastings Const. L.Q. at pp. 118, 119-122 [semble]; but see <em>Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center </em>v. <em>Blythe </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1641, 1665 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 189] [stating in dictum that \u201c[f]ree speech provisions of the state and federal Constitutions protect citizens from restrictions imposed by governmental action,\u201d and that \u201c[fjree speech concerns may be raised as a shield against injunctive relief only because the effectuation of such relief entails government action\u201d].) An argument has been made that \u201cit is the essential <em>nature </em>of constitutions that they are meant to restrain only\u201d governmental actors and not private parties too. (Friesen, <em>Should California\u2019s Constitutional Guarantees of Individual Rights Apply Against Private Actors?, supra, </em>17 Hastings Const. L.Q. at p. 116, italics in original [referring to, but not embracing, such an argument]; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 122, fn. 41, 123, fn. 44, &amp; 126, fn. 54 [similar].) But this argument overlooks the <em>peculiar character </em>of constitutions dating to the 19th century, which are not so narrow. (See Fritz, <em>The American Constitutional Tradition Revisited: Preliminary Observations on State Constitution-Making </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>in the Nineteenth-Century West </em>(1994) 25 Rutgers L.J. 945, 964-971.) Among such constitutions, ours must be numbered. (See Cal. Const, of 1849, art. XI, \u00a7 14 [expressly granting wives a right to separate property over against their husbands]; Cal. Const., art. XX, former \u00a7 8 (as adopted May 7, 1879) [impliedly granting husbands and wives a right to separate property the one against the other].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Third, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech, unlike the First Amendment\u2019s, is \u201cunlimited\u201d in scope. <em>(Dailey v. Superior Court, supra, </em>112 Cal. at p. 97; <em>see Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 121, 143 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 980 P.2d 846] (lead opn. of George, C. J.) <em>[semble: </em>distinguishing <em>Dailey </em>on another point].) Whereas the First Amendment does not embrace all subjects, article I does indeed do so, <em>in ipsissimis verbis: </em>\u201cEvery person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments <em>on all subjects </em>. . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a), italics added.) These words are \u201cqualified only by\u201d those that follow <em>(Pines v. Tomson </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 370, 393 [206 Cal.Rptr. 866] (per Arabian, J.)), which make anyone who \u201cabuse[s] . . . this right\u201d \u201cresponsible\u201d for his misconduct (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Within its \u201cunlimited\u201d scope <em>(Dailey v. Superior Court, supra, </em>112 Cal. at p. 97), which expressly embraces \u201call subjects\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a)), article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech protects political speech and ideological speech. (See <em>Wilson v. Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 658 [dealing with speech that was political in character]; <em>People </em>v. <em>American Automobile Ins. Co., supra, </em>132 Cal.App.2d at pp. 318-328 [dealing with speech that was, at least in aspect, ideological in character].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">It is not otherwise with respect to article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech and commercial speech. Which is to say, as we shall explain, the right in question protects such speech\u2014surely so in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services, the kind with which we are here concerned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">That article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech, at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>products and services, is implied through the specific language of the free speech clause in its precise setting. Again: \u201cEvery person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments <em>on all </em>subjects,\u201d with the sole qualification that anyone who \u201cabuse[s] . . . this right\u201d is \u201cresponsible\u201d for his misconduct. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a), italics added.) Plainly, this \u201cwording . . . does not exclude\u201d commercial speech from its \u201cprotection.\u201d (Friesen, State Constitutional Law: Litigating Individual Rights, Claims and Defenses, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5-2(b)(4), p. 274.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">That article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech, at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services, is expressed in the broad context of the free speech clause in the world at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Let us focus initially on the circumstances surrounding article I\u2019s free speech clause at its drafting for the original California Constitution of 1849.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Protection for commercial speech, at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services, must have practically been assumed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">One fact is relevant by its absence: The United States Supreme Court had not yet introduced its commercial speech/noncommercial speech dichotomy in First Amendment jurisprudence, and would not do so for almost a century.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">More to the point, from the very moment of independence through 1849, American legislatures had kept commercial speech free from regulation by statute, except as to products and services that were unlawful in the jurisdiction in question, such as lotteries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, horse racing in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and unlicensed innkeeping in Rhode Island. (Troy, <em>Advertising: Not \u201cLow Value\u201d Speech, supra, </em>16 Yale J. on Reg. at pp. 103-105.) And in the same period, American courts had similarly kept commercial speech free from regulation by common law, except as to messages that were false or misleading in their particulars, and then only to the extent that they were not immunized by the doctrine of caveat emptor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 104; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 106-107.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Facts of this sort should cause no surprise. Since colonial times, commercial speech, operating through advertising, had played a major role in the life of the press, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>primarily as a source of revenue but also as a kind of editorial content, inasmuch as it was \u201cthought to have independent value in educating and informing the reading public.\u201d (Troy, <em>Advertising: Not \u201cLow </em>Value\u201d <em>Speech, supra, </em>16 Yale J. on Reg. at p. 100; see <em>44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 495 [116 S.Ct. at p. 1504] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.).) And, of course, since colonial times, the press had itself played a major role in the life of the polity. (Troy, <em>Advertising: Not \u201cLow Value \u201d Speech, supra, </em>16 Yale J. on Reg. at pp. 97-101; see Franklin, Apology for Printers (June 10, 1731), reprinted in 1 Papers of Benjamin Franklin (Labaree et al. edits. 1959) pp. 194-199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In California itself in 1849, the prevailing political, legal, and social culture was that of Jacksonian democracy. (See Fritz, <em>More Than \u201cShreds and Patches\u201d: California\u2019s First Bill of Rights, supra, </em>17 Hastings Const. L.Q. at pp. 24-26, 33; Scheiber, <em>Race, Radicalism, and Reform: Historical Perspective on the 1879 California Constitution </em>(1989) 17 Hastings Const. L.Q. 35, 37.) Jacksonian democracy was animated by \u201cideals of equality and open opportunity.\u201d (Scheiber, <em>Race, Radicalism, and Reform: Historical Perspective on the 1879 California Constitution, supra, </em>17 Hastings Const. L.Q. at p. 37, fn. 8.) Those ideals worked themselves out in a \u201cliberal, market-oriented, economic individualism.\u201d (Johnson, Founding the Far West (1992) p. 57.) What such individualism presupposed, and produced, was wide and unrestrained speech about economic matters generally, including, obviously, commercial affairs. Remember the year\u20141849. \u201c[Ajfter the discovery of gold in 1848,\u201d \u201cCalifornia attracted\u201d a \u201crush of humanity.\u201d (Fritz, <em>Rethinking the American Constitutional Tradition: National Dimensions in the Formation of State Constitutions </em>(1995) 26 Rutgers L.J. 969, 975.) These men\u2014for they were largely men\u2014were \u201cessentially individualistic, greedy, and acquisitive gold-seekers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It was such who framed the original California Constitution, including article I\u2019s free speech clause. (Fritz, <em>Rethinking the American Constitutional Tradition: National Dimensions in the Formation of State Constitutions, supra, </em>26 Rutgers L.J. at p. 975.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">When we turn our eye to article I\u2019s free speech clause at its drafting for the present California Constitution of 1879, we find no reason to reject protection for commercial speech, at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services. The language in 1879 was identical to that in 1849. The United States Supreme Court had not yet introduced its commercial speech/noncommercial speech dichotomy in First Amendment jurisprudence, and would not do so for more than 60 years. In addition, the political, legal, and social culture of Jacksonian democracy had not passed, with its equality and open opportunity, economic individualism, and wide and unrestrained commercial speech. American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>legislatures continued to keep commercial speech free from regulation by statute, except as to products and services that were unlawful in the jurisdiction in question. (Troy, <em>Advertising: Not \u201cLow Value\u201d Speech, supra, </em>16 Yale J. on Reg. at pp. 111-113.) This was evidently true of the California Legislature, which kept commercial speech unregulated except for products and services that it made unlawful, such as lotteries (see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7319-322, 324-326 (1872) [criminalizing lotteries]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 323 (1872) [criminalizing the advertising thereof]), abortions (see <em>id., </em>former \u00a7\u00a7 274-275 (1872) [criminalizing abortions]; <em>id., </em>former \u00a7 311, subd. 4 (1872) [criminalizing the advertising thereof]), and obscene or indecent books and other items (see <em>id., </em>former \u00a7 311, subd. 3 (1872) [criminalizing obscene or indecent books and other items]; <em>id., </em>former \u00a7 311, subd. 4 (1872) [criminalizing the advertising thereof]). American courts continued to keep commercial speech free from regulation by common law, except as to messages that were false or misleading in their particulars, and then only to the extent that they were not immunized by the doctrine of caveat emptor. (See Troy, <em>Advertising: Not \u201cLow Value\u201d Speech, supra, </em>16 Yale J. on Reg. at pp. 104, 106, 111-113.) This was apparently true of California courts, for there is no indication in reported decisions to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Proceeding from 1879 to 1974, when article I\u2019s free speech clause was first amended, we again find no reason to reject protection for commercial speech, at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services. Although the numerical designation was different, the language was virtually identical. By 1974, the United States Supreme Court had introduced its commercial speech/noncommercial speech dichotomy in First Amendment jurisprudence, and indeed had held that the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech did not protect commercial speech at all. But there is no basis on which to conclude that the 1974 amendment of article I\u2019s free speech clause incorporated what had transpired in the intervening years, including the United States Supreme Court\u2019s First Amendment commercial speech/noncommercial speech dichotomy with its then nonprotection for commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Advancing finally from 1974 to 1980, when article I\u2019s free speech clause was last amended, we yet again find no reason to reject protection for commercial speech, at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services. Although the numerical designation was different, the language was absolutely identical. By 1980, the United States Supreme Court, while retaining its commercial speech/noncommercial speech dichotomy in First Amendment jurisprudence, had made a volte-face to hold that the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech did, in fact, protect commercial speech, albeit only somewhat. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>basis on which to conclude that the 1980 amendment of article I\u2019s free speech clause incorporated what had transpired in the intervening years, including the United States Supreme Court\u2019s First Amendment commercial speech/noncommercial speech dichotomy with its then, and current, \u201csomewhat\u201d protection for commercial speech.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The first question that we address is, Does the California Plum Marketing Program, issued by the California Secretary of Food and Agriculture pursuant to the CMA, implicate Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by compelling funding of generic advertising?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The answer that we give is, No.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">At the threshold, we note what hardly needs noting. Although a corporation, Gerawan may at least be deemed to possess a First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>right to freedom of speech, whether or not it does so strictly speaking. That is because the interests served by its commercial speech about its plums extend beyond itself. Such interests include those of its audience of \u201cconsumer[s],\u201d who may or may not choose to buy its fruit. (Vd. <em>Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 763 [96 S.Ct. at p. 1826]; see <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co. </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 476, 481-482 [115 S.Ct. 1585, 1589-1590, 131 L.Ed.2d 532].) Such interests also include those of \u201csociety\u201d in general (Vd. <em>Pharmacy Bd. </em>v. Vd. <em>Consumer Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 764 [96 S.Ct. at p. 1827]; see <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 481 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1589]). The information so communicated is \u201cindispensable to the proper allocation of resources in a free enterprise system\u201d like ours (Vd. <em>Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 765 [96 S.Ct. at p. 1827]; accord, <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 481 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1589]), because it literally <em>\u201cinforms </em>the numerous private decisions that drive the system\u201d <em>(Rubin v.

Consumer Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 765 [96 S.Ct. at p. 1827]).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">As stated, the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech, albeit only somewhat in comparison with noncommercial speech, including that which is political or ideological in character. It is implicated in speaking itself. It may also be implicated in the use of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say, even about a lawful product or service, in order to render his message truthful and not misleading. (See, e.g., Vd. <em>Pharmacy Bd. </em>v. Vd. <em>Consumer Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at pp. 771-772 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 1830-1831].) Consumer protection is the justification\u2014apparently, the sole one. (See, e.g., <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 492-493 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1594-1595] (cone. opn. of Stevens, J.); <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at pp. 771-772 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 1830-1831].) When the commercial speaker\u2019s message is already truthful and nonmisleading, however, compulsion of speech is not supported by the consumer protection rationale, but must be supported, if at all, by some rationale applicable to all speech, noncommercial as well as commercial. (See, e.g., <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 492-493 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1594-1595] (cone. opn. of Stevens, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Similarly, the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>form of advertising that he would otherwise not, even about a lawful product or service, in order to render his message truthful and not misleading. (See, e.g., <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at pp. 771-772 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 1830-1831].) Again, consumer protection is the\u2014 apparently sole\u2014justification. (See, e.g., <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Coors Brewing Co., supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 492-493 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1594-1595] (cone. opn. of Stevens, L); <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. </em>v. <em>Va. Consumer. Council, supra, </em>425 U.S. at pp. 771-772 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 1830-1831.) When the commercial speaker\u2019s message is already truthful and nonmisleading, however, compulsion of funding is not supported by the consumer protection rationale, but must be supported, if at all, by some rationale applicable to all speech, noncommercial as well as commercial. (Cf. <em>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 492-493 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1594-1595] (cone. opn. of Stevens, J.) [dealing with compulsion of speech].)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">It would therefore appear that, without more, the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech would <em>not </em>allow compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say, when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It would similarly appear that, without more, the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech would <em>not </em>allow compelling one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not, when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Appearances, however, deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In <em>Glickman, </em>a majority sustained Marketing Order No. 917, issued by the United States Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the AMAA, against a challenge by Gerawan, among others, that it violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech by compelling funding of generic advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">At the outset, the <em>Glickman </em>majority \u201cstress [ed] the importance of the . . . context\u201d established by the AMAA. <em>(Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].) They also emphasized that Marketing Order No. 917 was a \u201cdetailed\u201d \u201cregulatory scheme\u201d that had \u201cdisplaced many aspects of independent business activity that characterize other portions of the economy in which competition is fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>protected by the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It \u201ccompelled\u201d Gerawan and the rest \u201cto fund the generic advertising at issue . . . as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently\u201d was \u201calready constrained.\u201d (Gli<em>ckman v.

Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 462 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2135].) Such generic advertising was evidently intended not to prevent or correct any otherwise false or misleading message in the interest of consumer protection, but solely to develop markets and promote sales in the interest of producer welfare. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 462, 475 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2135, 2141].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The <em>Glickman </em>majority went on to conclude that Marketing Order No. 917 did not even implicate, still less violate, the First Amendment right of Gerawan and the rest to freedom of speech by compelling funding of generic advertising. (See <em>Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 468, 473-474, fn. 16, &amp; 476 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2140, fn. 16, &amp; 2141-2142].) They considered the marketing order in question as merely a \u201cspecies of economic regulation,\u201d no more and no less, without any effect on the right at issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 477 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2142].)

They did not measure the marketing order against the right, but rather purported to \u201cdistinguish\u201d the former out of the latter\u2019s scope. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Specifically, the <em>Glickman </em>majority said that Marketing Order No. 917 did not \u201cimpose[]\u201d any \u201crestraint\u201d on any person\u2019s freedom of speech <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138]): The fact that the order imposed \u201cassessments for generic advertising,\u201d which might \u201cindirectly lead to a reduction in\u201d one\u2019s \u201cindividual advertising budget[,] does not itself amount to a restriction on speech.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 470 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2139].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The <em>Glickman </em>majority then said that Marketing Order No. 917 did not \u201ccompel any person to engage in any . . . speech\u201d <em>(Glickman v.

He then found any such lack of disagreement immaterial: What mattered was <em>what speech </em>a speaker chooses to fund or not to fund, not <em>why </em>he chooses to do so or not. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 488-489 [117 S.Ct. atp p. 2147-2148] (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">As for the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s crucial assertion that Marketing Order No. 917 did not \u201ccompel\u201d any person to fund any \u201cpolitical or ideological\u201d speech <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 469-470 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138]), Justice Souter observed that the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech does not bar compelling a speaker to fund speech that he otherwise would not fund <em>only when such speech would be political or ideological in </em>character\u2014only when, in other words, it would \u201cengender\u201d in him a \u201ccrisis of conscience\u201d <em>(Glickman v.

Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 488 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2147] (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).) The fact that, under such decisions, a person who has lawfully been compelled to associate with others may be compelled to fund even political or ideological speech <em>without suffering a violation of the right in question </em>does <em>not </em>mean that he can be so compelled <em>without experiencing any implication of the right at all.

Unlike Justice Souter, he rejected the <em>Central Hudson </em>test in and of itself as too \u201clenient.\u201d <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 504 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2155] (dis. opn. of Thomas, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In sum, the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis results from, and results in, the proposition that the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech does not protect commercial speech against compelled funding. To quote Justice Souter, who was not challenged on the point, the <em>Glickman </em>majority simply found <em>\u201cno </em>First Amendment right to be free of coerced subsidization of commercial speech\u201d whatsoever. <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. <em>All </em>[117 S.Ct. at p. 2142] (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The soundness of the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis is open to serious question.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In its own terms, the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis lacks persuasiveness. Its legal component is driven not so much by principled reasoning as by ad hoc distinguishing. Its factual component is hardly better. For example, the majority\u2019s express \u201cpresum[ption]\u201d that Gerawan and the rest \u201cagree[d] with the central message of the speech that [was] generated by the generic [advertising]\u201d <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 470 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138]), to the effect that \u201c \u2018California Summer Fruits\u2019 are wholesome, delicious, and attractive to discerning shoppers\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 462 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2135]), and their implied conclusion that such a \u201ccentral message\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 470 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138]) is unexceptionable, appear to betray a certain lack of sophistication. To be sure, history has witnessed benefits accruing to producers of agricultural commodities from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>generic advertising. But it has also witnessed burdens imposed on them as a result. By way of illustration, when some producers, like Gerawan, develop and use brands in marketing their goods, and others do not, the former may find themselves disadvantaged by generic advertising in their competition against the latter. Generic advertising may portray goods as \u201cindistinctive\u201d in spite of brand, and may thereby \u201cminimize[] consumer desire to distinguish\u201d <em>inter se. </em>(Comment, <em>The Effect of Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc. on Nongeneric Commodities: A Narrow Focus on a Broad Rule </em>(1999) 9 San Joaquin Agr. L.Rev. 95, 113.) Even when no producers develop or use brands in marketing their goods, some may find themselves disadvantaged by generic advertising in their competition against others. Generic advertising can be manipulated to serve the interests of some producers rather than others, as by allowing some to develop a kind of brand by means of funds assessed from all and then use it for their own exclusive benefit. Thus, in any given case, a producer who objects to generic advertising may not be attempting to ride free on the funds of others\u2014a familiar charge\u2014but may merely be making an effort to prevent others from hijacking his own funds as they drive to their own destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">In addition, with virtual unanimity, commentators have subjected the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis to extensive criticism.

Justice Souter surely had the better of the argument. One can only hope that <em>Glickman </em>will someday prove to be an errant aberration, [and be] overruled .... The Court in <em>Glickman </em>appeared unable to get past conceptualizing the case before it as essentially one of agricultural and economic policy, and for that reason failed to apply conscientiously the First Amendment principles that ought to have resulted in\u201d Marketing Order No. 917 \u201cbeing struck down.\u201d (2 Smolla &amp; Nimmer, Freedom of Speech, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 20:45, pp. 20-114 to 20-115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">For his part, Charles Fried, who was formerly Solicitor General of the United States and is presently an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, has stated that \u201cthe Court in <em>Glickman . . </em>. did not see what Justice Souter pointed out in dissent, that the convergent analogies of\u2019 prior cases \u201calmost compelled a decision against the aspect of\u2019 Marketing Order No. 917 that \u201cthe court upheld.\u201d (Fried, <em>Perfect Freedom, Perfect Justice, supra, </em>78 B.U. L.Rev. at p. 743, fn. 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In the view of Professor Nicole C\u00e1sarez, \u201cGlickman constitutes a serious departure from traditional commercial speech and compelled speech analysis. The majority\u2019s contextual approach resulted in a house-of-cards opinion based on a faulty premise: that compelled commercial speech does not raise a First Amendment issue .... This premise overlooks three settled First Amendment principles: first, that compelled speech is just as constitutionally suspect as restricted speech; second, that paying for speech is constitutionally equivalent to speaking; and third, that commercial speech falls within the scope of the First Amendment.\u201d (C\u00e1sarez, <em>Don\u2019t Tell Me What to Say: Compelled Commercial Speech and the First Amendment, supra, </em>63 Mo. L.Rev. at p. 960.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">All that we have said above, however, must be qualified by this: Although the soundness of the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis is open to serious question, its authority is not. We shall therefore apply it here as we must.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In its amended complaint, Gerawan alleges facts, liberally construed, to the effect that it produces and handles plums; plums constitute a lawful product; it has developed, and uses, a brand for marketing purposes; it engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising; its message is not false or misleading; it is nevertheless compelled by the California Plum Marketing Program to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will; and the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Under the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis, Gerawan\u2019s factual allegations are not sufficient even to implicate its First Amendment right to freedom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>speech against the California Plum Marketing Program for compelling funding of generic advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Gerawan does not allege facts that would establish that the California Plum Marketing Program \u201cimposes\u201d any \u201crestraint\u201d on its freedom of speech. <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].) That the compulsion of funding of generic advertising for plums as a commodity may, as it alleges, reduce the amount of money available for its own advertising of its own branded plums is not enough. The <em>Glickman </em>majority stated plainly that any such \u201creduction . . . does not. . . amount to a restriction on speech.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 470 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2139].) Gerawan no longer resists.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Neither does Gerawan allege facts that would establish that the California Plum Marketing Program \u201ccompel[s]\u201d it \u201cto engage in any . . . speech.\u201d <em>('Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].) Under the facts alleged, the California Plum Marketing Program does not \u201crequire\u201d Gerawan \u201cto speak\u201d itself. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 471 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2139].) Gerawan does not assert that it does. Under the same facts, the California Plum Marketing Program does not \u201crequire\u201d Gerawan \u201cto be publicly identified or associated with\u201d the California Plum Marketing Board\u2019s \u201cmessage.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, Gerawan does indeed assert that it does. It assumes that \u201c[m]ost consumers assume\u201d that the board speaks on its behalf. Assumption upon assumption, however, does not amount to the allegation of a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Lastly, Gerawan does not allege facts that would establish that the California Plum Marketing Program \u201ccompel[s]\u201d it to fund any \u201cpolitical or ideological\u201d speech. <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 469-470 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].) It alleges that it \u201cdisagrees\u201d with, and indeed \u201cabhors,\u201d the generic advertising, otherwise undescribed, on both political and ideological grounds, as \u201csocialistic\u201d and \u201ccollectivist,\u201d and also on commercial grounds, as \u201cgrouping all. . . plums as though they are the same\u201d and as \u201cembarrassingly silly, idiotic and/or totally ineffective.\u201d It objects to the generic advertising, but does not even allege facts as to its specific content. Any aspects that \u201cgroupQ all . . . plums as though they are the same,\u201d or that are \u201cembarrassingly silly, idiotic and/or totally ineffective,\u201d are commercial in character. Any aspects, however, that are \u201csocialistic\u201d and \u201ccollectivist\u201d are indeed political or ideological. But they are not enough. The <em>Glickman </em>majority stated plainly that any objection against generic advertising as \u201c \u2018 \u201cpromoting] . . . socialistic\u201d \u2019 \u201d\u2014or collectivist\u2014\u201c \u2018 \u201cprograms\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, 521 U.S. </em>at p. 467, fn. 10 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2137]) has to be dismissed as \u201ctrivial\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 471 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2139]).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Against our conclusion, Gerawan argues that the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis is, in fact, inapplicable. To no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Gerawan initially attempts to distinguish the CMA, under which the California Plum Marketing Program was issued, from the AMAA, under which Marketing Order No. 917 was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Although plainly not identical, the CMA and the AMAA, so far as the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis is concerned, are not materially different. Since 1937, the AMAA\u2019s underlying policies have included the establishing and maintaining of orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in order to raise and support prices for their producers. The same is true of the CMA\u2019s underlying policies. Since 1937, the AMAA has authorized marketing orders as regulations governing marketing matters for the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities. The same is true of the CMA. The AMAA\u2019s authorization of provisions in marketing orders for advertising, whether generic or otherwise, has been relatively late and spotty. The same is <em>not </em>true, however, of the CMA, whose authorization of provisions in marketing orders for generic advertising has been broad and <em>ab initio. </em>This fact marks a difference\u2014but not one that is material or, apparently, even favorable to Gerawan\u2019s position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Gerawan then attempts to distinguish the California Plum Marketing Program itself from Marketing Order No. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Gerawan quotes the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s statement: Marketing Order No. 917 was a \u201cdetailed\u201d \u201cregulatory scheme\u201d that had \u201cdisplaced many aspects of independent business activity that characterize other portions of the economy in which competition is fully protected by the antitrust laws,\u201d and accordingly \u201ccompelled\u201d Gerawan and the rest \u201cto fund the generic advertising at issue . . . as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently\u201d was \u201calready constrained.\u201d <em>(Glickman </em>v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].) Gerawan then maintains that the California Plum Marketing Program is not such a \u201cdetailed\u201d \u201cregulatory scheme.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Although plainly not identical, the California Plum Marketing Program and Marketing Order No. 917, so far as the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis is concerned, are not materially different. Marketing Order No. 917, among other things, provided for the undertaking, by the Plum Commodity Committee, of research and development projects, including advertising, and set out specific regulations regarding both fruit containers and packs and also fruit grades and sizes. The California Plum Marketing Program provides for the undertaking, by the California Plum Marketing Board, of research; advertising, specifically generic advertising, along with sales promotion and market development; and the institution and implementation of quality standards and inspections. It appears that a federal marketing order under the AMAA <em>might have </em>regulated more broadly and deeply than a state marketing order under the CMA. But Marketing Order No. 917 <em>did not in fact </em>regulate so much more broadly and deeply than the California Plum Marketing Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">At bottom, Gerawan would have us characterize Marketing Order No. 917 as a regulation of economic activity with an incidental effect on speech and the California Plum Marketing Program as a regulation of speech with an incidental effect on economic activity. We cannot do so. Contrary to Gerawan\u2019s assertion, the fact that the California Plum Marketing Program earmarks 55 percent of the funds assessed from producers for generic advertising along with sales promotion and market development, with only 35 percent for quality standards and inspections and only 10 percent for research, does not cause it to \u201cstand[] alone ... as a regulation of speech.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The second question that we address is, Does the California Plum Marketing Program, issued by the California Secretary of Food and Agriculture pursuant to the CMA, implicate Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under the free speech clause of article I of the California Constitution by compelling funding of generic advertising?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The answer that we give is, Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">At the threshold, we note under article I\u2019s free speech clause what we noted under the First Amendment\u2019s. Although a corporation, Gerawan may at least be deemed to possess an article I right to freedom of speech, whether or not it does so strictly speaking. <em>(People </em>v. <em>American Automobile Ins. Co., supra, </em>132 Cal.App.2d at pp. 322, 328 <em>[semble].) </em>The interests served by its commercial speech about its plums, as we have explained, extend beyond itself to those of its audience of consumers and further to those of society in general. (See <em>Jacoby v. State Bar, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 363, fn. 2, &amp; 375-376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">As stated, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech, at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services. It is implicated in speaking itself. It may also be implicated in the use of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">We shall assume that, with the justification of consumer protection, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say, even about a lawful product or service, in order to render his message truthful and not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">We shall also assume that, with the justification of consumer protection, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not, even about a lawful product or service, in order to render his message truthful and not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Even with such an assumption, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech, without more, would <em>not </em>allow compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say, when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Similarly, even with such an assumption, article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech, without more, would <em>not </em>allow compelling one who engages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not, when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In its amended complaint, by way of restatement, Gerawan alleges facts, liberally construed, to the effect that it produces and handles plums; plums constitute a lawful product; it has developed, and uses, a brand for marketing purposes; it engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising; its message is not false or misleading; it is nevertheless compelled by the California Plum Marketing Program to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will; and the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Under the law as set forth above, Gerawan\u2019s factual allegations are sufficient at least to implicate its article I right to freedom of speech against the California Plum Marketing Program for compelling funding.,of generic advertising. Gerawan\u2019s commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising concerns a lawful product, and is not itself false or misleading. Yet, the California Plum Marketing Program compels it to fund, against its will, commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity\u2014generic advertising that is intended not to prevent or correct any otherwise false or misleading message in the interest of consumer protection, but solely to develop markets and promote sales in the interest of producer welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Against our conclusion, the Secretary of Food and Agriculture argues, in reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Teresinski </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 822 [180 Cal.Rptr. 617, 640 P.2d 753] (hereafter sometimes Teresinski), that there are \u201cno reasons . . . to justify rejecting\u201d the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s construction of the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause as our construction of article I\u2019s. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">In <em>Teresinski, </em>the presence of all four of the following facts counseled against rejection of a decision of the United States Supreme Court there considered: <em>First, </em>\u201cnothing in the language or history of the California\u201d constitutional provision in question \u201csuggested] that the issue before us should be resolved differently than under\u201d the analogous federal constitutional \u201cprovision.\u201d <em>(People v. Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 836.) <em>Second, </em>the decision in question \u201cdid not overrule past precedent or limit previously established rights under\u201d the United States Constitution. <em>(People v. Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 836.) <em>Third, </em>the decision \u201cwas unanimous, and ha[d] not inspired extensive criticism.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 836-837.) <em>Fourth, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>decision, \u201cif followed by the courts of this state, would not overturn established California doctrine affording greater rights\u201d in the particular area. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Here, by contrast, the absence of at least two of these four facts counsels in favor of rejection of the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">As for the fourth fact, counting from last to first, we acknowledge that the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis, \u201cif followed by the courts of this state, would not overturn established California doctrine affording greater rights\u201d in the area of commercial speech under article I\u2019s free speech clause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 837.) Such a result, however, is attributable solely to the fact that the precise issue here is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">As for the third fact, however, we must observe that the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis was far from \u201cunanimous\u201d <em>(People v. Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 836): It garnered the support of only five of the court\u2019s nine members, and provoked two of them to write dissenting opinions. We must also observe that the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis has in fact \u201cinspired extensive criticism\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at pp. 836-837): The various treatises, articles, comments, notes, and case notes cited above stand as proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">As for the second fact, we concede that, strictly speaking, the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis \u201cdid not overrule past precedent or limit previously established rights under\u201d the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause. <em>(People v. Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 836.) Such a result, however, is attributable solely to the fact that the precise issue there was one of first impression. All the same, the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis did indeed do violence to the law that it took into its hands. Professor Smolla: \u201cThe Court in <em>Glickman . . . </em>failed to apply conscientiously the First Amendment principles that ought to have resulted in\u201d Marketing Order No. 917 \u201cbeing struck down.\u201d (2 Smolla &amp; Nimmer, Freedom of Speech, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 20:45, pp. 20-114 to 20-115.) Former Solicitor General and now Justice Fried: \u201c[T]he Court in <em>Glickman . . </em>. did not see what Justice Souter pointed out in dissent, that the convergent analogies of\u2019 prior cases \u201calmost compelled a decision against the aspect of\u2019 Marketing Order No. 917 that \u201cthe court upheld.\u201d (Fried, <em>Perfect Freedom, Perfect Justice, supra, </em>78 B.U. L.Rev. at p. 743, fn. 84.) Professor C\u00e1sarez: \u201c[0]veriook[ing] . . . settled First Amendment principles,\u201d \u201cGlickman constitutes a serious departure from traditional commercial speech and compelled speech analysis.\u201d (C\u00e1sarez, <em>Don\u2019t Tell Me What to Say: Compelled Commercial Speech and the First Amendment, supra, </em>63 Mo. L.Rev. at p. 960.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>As for the first fact, we cannot agree that \u201cnothing in the language or history of\u2019 article I\u2019s free speech clause \u201csuggests that the issue before us should be resolved differently than under\u201d the First Amendment\u2019s as construed by the <em>Glickman </em>majority. <em>(People v. Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 836.) Indeed, as we have shown, practically <em>everything </em>in such language and history mandates a different resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Focusing on language more than history, the Secretary of Food and Agriculture claims that, for present purposes, article I\u2019s free speech clause is not materially different from the First Amendment\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The secretary\u2019s point has been anticipated by our analysis above, which sets out the specific language of article I\u2019s free speech clause in its precise setting and also its broad context in the world at large, and must yield to its force.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The secretary nevertheless attempts to make article I\u2019s free speech clause similar to the First Amendment\u2019s, thus: The first sentence of article I\u2019s free speech clause\u2014\u201cEvery person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a))\u2014is \u201cnot implicated in this case\u201d because it assertedly grants <em>only </em>a right to freedom of speech, most narrowly defined, and then <em>only </em>against prior restraint. The second sentence of article I\u2019s free speech clause\u2014\u201cA law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a))\u2014is indeed implicated, and it is equivalent to the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The secretary\u2019s attempt to make article I\u2019s free speech clause similar to the First Amendment\u2019s collapses onto itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">On its face, the secretary\u2019s attempt is essentially an application of brute force. It simply removes what is unique to article I\u2019s free speech clause vis-\u00e1-vis the First Amendment\u2019s, and keeps what is common. It is different in degree, but not in kind, from making over section 5 of article I of the California Constitution, which states that a \u201cstanding army may not be maintained in peacetime,\u201d into clause 12 of section 8 of article I of the United States Constitution, which implies that such an army may indeed be maintained, through the simple expedient of deleting the adverbial particle \u201cnot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Furthermore, in its substance, the secretary\u2019s attempt proves unpersuasive. It appears to be rooted in the assertion, referred to above, that article I\u2019s free speech clause grants <em>only </em>a right to freedom of speech, most narrowly defined, and then <em>only </em>against prior restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>We must, however, reject any suggestion by the secretary that article I\u2019s free speech clause <em>cannot </em>be implicated in the use of money, but is implicated <em>solely </em>in speaking itself. As stated, even if money is not itself speech, it nevertheless enables speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We must also reject any suggestion by the secretary that article I\u2019s free speech clause does <em>not </em>grant a right to refrain from speaking at all as well as a right to speak freely. Again, speech results from what a speaker chooses not to say in addition to what he chooses to say. The secretary appears to argue, syllogistically, as follows: A right that cannot be \u201cabuse[dj\u201d does not exist (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (a)); the right to refrain from speaking cannot be abused; therefore, the right to refrain from speaking does not exist. The conclusion does not follow because the minor premise, at least, is unsound. So far as commercial speech is concerned, and on the assumption that article I\u2019s right to freedom of speech does not protect commercial speech in the form of false or misleading messages about even lawful products or services,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the right not to speak can surely be abused, and is in fact abused, whenever the speaker fails to speak and thereby renders his message false or misleading. (Cf. <em>Griset </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 866, fn. 5 [implying, in dictum, that failure on the part of a political candidate to identity himself in a mass mailing may amount to abuse of the right not to speak].)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We must similarly reject any suggestion by the secretary that article I\u2019s free speech clause does <em>not </em>grant a right to refrain from funding speech altogether as well as a right to fund speech meaningfully. Again, speech results, through money\u2019s enabling, from what speech a speaker chooses not to fund in addition to what speech he chooses to fund. The secretary apparently makes the same syllogistic argument as described above, with the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In addition, we must reject any suggestion by the secretary that article I\u2019s free speech clause grants a right to freedom of speech <em>only </em>against prior restraint. True, it does indeed grant a right against prior restraint.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But without any limitation thereto. Certainly, that article I\u2019s free speech clause grants a right to freedom of speech against <em>prior </em>restraint does not preclude a right against what we may call \u201csubsequent punishment.\u201d Indeed, it effectively grants a right against subsequent punishment by effectively conferring immunity, save only for \u201cabuse\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>(a)). Moreover, a right against prior restraint could prove empty without a right against subsequent punishment, inasmuch as subsequent punishment might cause the speaker to impose a \u201cprior restraint,\u201d as it were, on himself, totally apart from even the threat of imposition of any prior restraint, properly so called, by another. Likewise, that article I\u2019s free speech clause grants a right to freedom of speech against prior <em>restraint </em>does not preclude a right against what we may call \u201cprior compulsion.\u201d One does not speak freely when one is restrained from speaking. But neither does one speak freely when one is compelled to speak. Perhaps restraint has figured historically as a more familiar evil. But compulsion does not present itself analytically as a less pernicious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">For all of these reasons, we must, and do, reject the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s construction of the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause as our construction of article I\u2019s. As stated, the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis results from, and results in, the proposition that the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of speech does not protect commercial speech against compelled funding. Any such proposition is simply untenable with respect to article I\u2019s. The <em>Glickman </em>majority found \u201cno . . . right\u201d whatsoever under the First Amendment \u201cto be free of coerced subsidization of commercial speech.\u201d <em>(Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. <em>All </em>[117 S.Ct. at p. 2142] (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).) We cannot so find under article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">With that said, we must in fairness own to the force of a sentiment that appears to inform the <em>Glickman </em>majority\u2019s analysis. <em>De minimis non curat lex </em>is a maxim of ancient origin, \u201cold\u201d even in the infancy of the nation. <em>(Ware v. Hylton </em>(1796) 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199, 268 [1 L.Ed.568, 597-598] (opn. of Iredell, J.).) It seems applicable to the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause. (See <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Railway Clerks </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 435, 456 [104 S.Ct. 1883, 1896-1897, 80 L.Ed.2d 428]; <em>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 559 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 1979-1980] (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Scalia, J.) [characterizing <em>Ellis </em>as recognizing a <em>\u201cde minimis </em>exception\u201d]; see generally <em>Konigsberg v. State Bar, supra, </em>366 U.S. at pp. 50-51 [81 S.Ct. at pp. 1006-1007].) In our view, it seems applicable as well to article I\u2019s. Under its operation, we might conclude that, in a given case, compelling funding of commercial speech, including generic advertising, does not implicate any right to freedom of speech under article I if the funding compelled and/or the commercial speech resulting therefrom are de minimis. In this case, the facts alleged are to the effect that the California Plum Marketing Program is devoted largely to commercial speech in the form of generic advertising and to compelling funding therefor, earmarking 55 percent of such funding to the underlying activity; it compels Gerawan itself to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising in excess of $80,000 per year; and it then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>engages in such speech in such form in excess of such amount from Gerawan\u2019s money alone. Under facts like those alleged here\u2014we know not what facts may one day be proved\u2014we cannot conclude that compelling funding of commercial speech, including generic advertising, does not implicate any right to freedom of speech under article I.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We turn now to the decision of the Court of Appeal, which affirmed the judgment of the superior court on its order granting, without leave to amend, the motion for judgment on the pleadings submitted by the California Secretary of Food and Agriculture on the ground that Gerawan\u2019s amended complaint did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">At the threshold, we believe that the Court of Appeal was right to subject the superior court\u2019s order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings, as it apparently did, to independent review. Such a ruling is so scrutinized. <em>(Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 146 [common law motion]; see <em>Schabarum </em>v. <em>California Legislature </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216-1217 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 745] [statutory motion].) It resolves a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law, viz., whether or not the factual allegations that the plaintiff makes are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. <em>(Smiley v. Citibank, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 145 [common law motion].) The resolution of a question of this sort calls for examination de novo. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 146 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">On the merits, however, we believe that the Court of Appeal was wrong to sustain the superior court\u2019s order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">A trial court\u2019s determination of a motion for judgment on the pleadings accepts as true the factual allegations that the plaintiff makes. <em>(Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 146 [common law motion]; see <em>Inter-Modal Rail Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 918, 924 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 60] [statutory motion].) In addition, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>gives them a liberal construction. (See <em>American Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 1110, 1118 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 251, 912 P.2d 1198] [without specification to common law or statutory motion]; <em>Inter-Modal Rail Employees Assn. v. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 924 [statutory motion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">An appellate court\u2019s consideration of the ensuing determination by the trial court involves the same acceptance and liberal construction of the factual allegations in question. <em>(American Airlines, Inc. v. County of San Mateo, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1118 [without specification to common law or statutory motion]; <em>Inter-Modal Rail Employees Assn. v. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 924 [statutory motion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The Court of Appeal sustained the superior court\u2019s order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings because it concluded that the California Plum Marketing Program does not implicate Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under either the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause or article I\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeal in its conclusion that the California Plum Marketing Program does not implicate Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause, as construed by the <em>Glickman </em>majority, by compelling funding of generic advertising. As we have explained, the California Plum Marketing Program, and the CMA pursuant to which it was issued, are not materially different for present purposes from Marketing Order No. 917, or from the AMAA pursuant to which <em>it </em>was issued. Marketing Order No. 917 was sustained by the <em>Glickman </em>majority. The California Plum Marketing Program must be sustained by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">But we do not agree with the Court of Appeal in its conclusion that the California Plum Marketing Program does not implicate Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under article I by compelling funding of generic advertising. As we have also explained, article I\u2019s free speech clause is indeed materially different for present purposes from the First Amendment\u2019s. The Court of Appeal attempted to render article I\u2019s free speech clause similar to the First Amendment\u2019s by construing article I\u2019s free speech clause as it believed other courts had construed the First Amendment\u2019s.  It construed article I\u2019s free speech clause thus under a \u201cso-called \u2018principle of deference,\u2019 \u201d which it said operates when a state constitutional provision is \u201c \u2018similar\u2019 \u201d in its \u201c \u2018language\u2019 \u201d to a federal constitutional provision. (Quoting <em>Raven v. Deukmejian, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 353.) The \u201cprinciple\u201d referred to, however, is only \u201cgeneral\u201d and not inexorable; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cdeference\u201d indicated merely counsels \u201cvoluntar[y]\u201d respectful consideration and does not \u201cmandate . . . blind obedience.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.)  In any event, the language of article I\u2019s free speech clause is simply <em>not </em>similar to the First Amendment\u2019s. Rather, as shown, it \u201cdiffers from\u201d it substantially. <em>(Los Angeles Alliance for Survival </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 365; accord, <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>112 Cal. at p. 97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">With our conclusion that the California Plum Marketing Program does indeed implicate Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under article I, we bring the task before us to an end. The Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was necessary to its judgment. The former cannot stand. The latter must therefore fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Our conclusion, however, brings no conclusion to this cause. That the California Plum Marketing Program implicates Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under article I does not mean that it violates such right. But it does indeed raise the question. That question, in turn, raises others, including what test is appropriate for use in determining a violation. And <em>that </em>question, in <em>its </em>turn, raises still others as well, including what protection, precisely, does article I afford commercial speech, at what level, of what kind, and, perhaps \u201cmost difficult,\u201d subject to what test <em>(Spiritual Psychic Science Church v. City of Azusa, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 513). To address such questions belongs, in the first instance, to the Court of Appeal on remand. It did not reach beyond the issue whether the California Plum Marketing Program implicates Gerawan\u2019s right to freedom of speech under article I when the cause was before it originally. It will have the opportunity, and the obligation, to do so when the cause returns following our judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that we must vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Kennard, J., Werdegar, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Namely, \u201calmonds, filberts (otherwise known as hazelnuts), California-grown peaches, cherries, papayas, carrots, citrus fruits, onions, Tokay grapes, pears, dates, . . . nectarines, celery, sweet com, limes, olives, pecans, eggs, avocadoes, apples, raisins, walnuts, tomatoes, . . .

At oral argument, counsel for certain of the amici curiae supporting the secretary\u2019s position attempted to raise the point.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfV\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The generic advertising component of the California Plum Marketing Program challenged in this case is for all relevant purposes identical to the component that has been a part of numerous similar marketing programs that have existed throughout the nation for more than 60 years, compelling all business enterprises in a particular industry to pay their fair share of the cost of generic, nonpolitical, and nonideological advertising of their agricultural products. As the majority recognizes, the challenged program also is for all relevant purposes identical to the generic advertising program that the United States Supreme Court, only three years ago, upheld in <em>Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc. </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 457 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 138 L.Ed.2d 585] (Glickman) against a challenge under the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. Although I agree with the majority that the protection afforded by article I, section 2, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution (hereafter article I, section 2(a) or the free speech provision) is independent of and in some contexts greater than that provided by the federal Constitution under the First Amendment, I believe the majority has failed to demonstrate that the state constitutional provision imposes greater restraint on the state\u2019s authority than its federal counterpart in the context presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">As I shall explain, other jurisdictions whose state constitutions contain free speech provisions similar to California\u2019s have interpreted their constitutional provisions as not restricting the respective state\u2019s, authority to regulate commercial speech any more than does the federal Constitution. In my view, there is no basis, either in the language or the history of California\u2019s constitutional provision, that would justify interpreting article I, section 2(a) so as to afford an agricultural producer a greater right under the state Constitution than under the federal Constitution to obtain \u201cfree rider\u201d status with respect to such generic advertising, i.e., to permit a producer to obtain the benefits from the generic advertising created under the marketing order without paying its fair share of the cost of such advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Moreover, even if I were to agree with the majority that we should reject the reasoning of <em>Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, and hold that the marketing program here at issue \u201cimplicates\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 476) the state constitutional right of free speech under article I, section 2(a), I would not remand this matter to the Court of Appeal to require that court first to determine, and then to apply, the correct standard of review for evaluating the validity of the marketing order\u2019s impingement upon plaintiff\u2019s state constitutional right to free speech. Instead, I would hold that any impingement is subject to review pursuant to the test set out in <em>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 209 [97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261] <em>{Abood) </em>and <em>Keller </em>v. <em>State Bar of California </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 1 [110 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>2228, 110 L.Ed.2d 1] <em>(Keller), </em>and further that, under that standard, the challenged plum marketing program does not violate article I, section 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In <em>Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, the United States Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by Justice Stevens and joined by Justices O\u2019Connor, Kennedy, Ginsburg and Breyer, held that the First Amendment is not implicated by a <em>federal </em>marketing order issued pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (Act of June 3, 1937, ch. 296, 50 Stat. 246 et seq. as amended, codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq.) that required an agricultural business to contribute to the costs of generic advertising of tree fruits. In reaching its decision, the court in <em>Glickman </em>emphasized the context of the compulsory advertising program, noting that the industry was thoroughly regulated and \u201ccollectivized\u201d in numerous respects. The court observed: \u201c[The tree fruits] are marketed pursuant to detailed marketing orders that have displaced many aspects of independent business activity that characterize other portions of the economy in which competition is fully protected by the antitrust laws. The business entities that are compelled to fund the generic advertising at issue in this litigation do so as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently is already constrained by the regulatory scheme. It is in this context that we consider whether we should review the assessments used to fund collective advertising, together with other collective activities, under the standard appropriate for review of economic regulation or under a heightened standard appropriate for the review of First Amendment issues.\" <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The court in <em>Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, proceeded to 'explain that \u201c[t]hree characteristics of the regulatory scheme at issue distinguish it from laws that we have found to abridge the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 469 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">First, the court observed that fruit producers and handlers are not prevented from promulgating their own advertisements, and hence communicating their own message, to any audience. <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, 469 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 2138].) The court rejected the argument that the \u201cassessments for generic advertising impinge on . . . First Amendment rights because they reduce the amount of money that producers have available to conduct their own advertising.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 470 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2138].) The court explained: \u201cThis is equally true, however, of assessments to cover employee benefits, inspection fees, or any other activity that is authorized by a marketing order. The First Amendment has never been construed to require heightened scrutiny of any financial burden that has the incidental effect of constraining the size of a firm\u2019s advertising budget. The fact that an economic regulation may indirectly lead to a reduction in a handler\u2019s individual advertising budget does not itself amount to a restriction on speech.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Second, the court in <em>Glickman </em>noted that no fruit producer or handler is compelled to engage in any actual or symbolic speech. <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, 469 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 2138].) The court rejected the contrary argument: \u201cOur compelled speech case law ... is clearly inapplicable to the regulatory scheme at issue here. The use of assessments to pay for advertising does not require respondents to repeat an objectionable message out of their own mouths, [citation], require them to use their own property to convey an antagonistic ideological message, [citations], force them to respond to a hostile message when they \u2018would prefer to remain silent,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>[citation], or require them to be publicly identified or associated with another\u2019s message, [citation]. Respondents are not required themselves to speak, but are merely required to make contributions for advertising. With trivial exceptions on which the court [below] did not rely, none of the generic advertising conveys any message with which respondents disagree. Furthermore, the advertising is attributed not to them, but to the California Tree Fruit Agreement or \u2018California Summer Fruits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 470-471 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2139], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Finally, the court in <em>Glickman </em>observed that the regulatory scheme differed from laws that have been found to implicate free speech rights, because in the case before it the generic commercial advertising did not force any producer or handler to endorse or finance political or ideological views with which he or she disagrees. <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, 469-470 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 2138-2139].) The court acknowledged, however, that \u201c[a]l-though this regulatory scheme may not compel speech as recognized by our case law, it does compel financial contributions that are used to fund advertising. . . . [J]ust as the First Amendment prohibits compelled speech, it prohibits\u2014at least without sufficient justification by the government\u2014 compelling an individual to \u2018render financial support for others\u2019 speech.\u2019 [Citation.] However, <em>Abood[, supra, </em>431 U.S. 209], and the cases that follow it, did not announce a broad First Amendment right not to be compelled to provide financial support for any organization that conducts expressive activities. Rather, <em>Abood </em>merely recognized a First Amendment interest in not being compelled to contribute to an organization whose expressive activities conflict with one\u2019s \u2018freedom of belief.\u2019 431 U.S., at 235.\u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 471 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2139].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The court in <em>Glickman </em>continued: \u201c[Requiring respondents to pay the assessments cannot be said to engender any crisis of conscience. None of the advertising in this record promotes any particular message other than encouraging consumers to buy California tree fruit. . . . [^] Moreover, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>than suggesting that mandatory funding of expressive activities always constitutes compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment, our cases provide affirmative support for the proposition that assessments to fund a lawful collective program may sometimes be used to pay for speech over the objection of some members of the group.\u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, 472-473 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2139-2140].) The high court stressed that \u201c <em>\u2018Abood </em>held that a union could not expend a dissenting individual\u2019s dues for ideological activities not \u201cgermane\u201d to the purpose for which compelled association was justified: collective bargaining.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 473 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2140].) The opinion in <em>Glickman </em>also noted that in <em>Keller, supra, </em>496 U.S. 1 (a case involving bar association activities), the court had found that \u201c \u2018the compelled association and integrated bar [were] justified by the State\u2019s interest in regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services\u2019 \u201d and had concluded that \u201c \u2018[t]he State Bar may therefore constitutionally fund activities germane to those goals out of the mandatory dues of all members. It may not, however, in such manner fund activities of an ideological nature which fall outside of those areas of activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 473 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2140], quoting <em>Keller, supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 13-14 [110 S.Ct. at pp. 223S-2236].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court in <em>Glickman </em>found the <em>Keller </em>test \u201cclearly satisfied\u201d in the case before it, \u201cbecause (1) the generic advertising of California [tree fruit] is unquestionably germane to the purposes of the marketing orders and, (2) in any event, the assessments are not used to fund ideological activities.\u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 473 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2140], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Summarizing its review of the three distinguishing characteristics discussed above, the court concluded in Glickman: \u201c[N]one of our First Amendment jurisprudence provides any support for the suggestion that the promotional regulations should be scrutinized under a different standard from that applicable to the other anticompetitive features of the marketing orders.\u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, 470 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 2138].) Based upon the highly regulated and collectivized context of the compulsory advertising program, and negative findings on the three factors mentioned above, the court in <em>Glickman </em>found the marketing program to be \u201ca species of economic regulation\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 477 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2142]) outside the reach of the First Amendment, and subject to mere rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Despite the majority\u2019s criticisms of <em>Glickman </em>(maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 499-505), it has failed to demonstrate that the high court was wrong in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>finding that, in this heavily regulated setting, the First Amendment is not implicated by the compelled funding of generic advertising through a marketing order, and that such an order in this setting is merely \u201ca species of economic regulation.\u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, <em>477 </em>[117 S.Ct. 2130, 2142].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Before and soon after adoption of the federal Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 at issue in <em>Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, numerous states enacted similar measures\u2014most of which are in effect today in codified and superseding or amended form\u2014providing, among other things, for assessments on many kinds of agricultural commodities, to fund generic advertising for those commodities. (E.g., 1935 Fla. Laws, chs. 16854-16858; 1937 Idaho Sess. Laws, ch. 252, \u00a7\u00a7 1-21; 1939 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 87, \u00a7\u00a7 1-16; 1939 Colo. Sess. Laws, ch. 66, \u00a7\u00a7 1-20; 1942 La. Acts, No. 294, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10; 1937 Me. Laws, ch. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 1-13; 1945 Neb. Laws, ch. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 1-12.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> California\u2019s version\u2014the California Marketing Act of 1937, added by Statutes 1937, chapter 404, section 1, page 1329 et seq., codified at Food and Agricultural Code, section 58601 et seq. (CMA or Act)\u2014is substantially similar to the other state and federal acts. The ensuing \u201cCalifornia Plum Marketing Program\u201d here under review is likewise substantially similar to other marketing programs that have existed for decades throughout the nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The California Act, like the federal legislation and that of many other states, creates a highly regulated environment that restricts the freedom of producers and handlers to act independently, for example by setting quality and ripeness standards for the marketing of products. In addition, and pertinent to our present inquiry, the California Act\u2014again like the federal legislation and that of many other states\u2014expressly permits issuance of marketing orders for advertising campaigns regarding agricultural commodities grown in California, funded by compelled contributions. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 58889, 58921.) Like producers and handlers under the federal program at issue in <em>Glickman, </em>and like those operating under other programs that have existed for decades throughout the nation, producers and handlers of California plums have been compelled, through a resulting state-issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>marketing order, to fund<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> generic advertising \u201cas a part of a broader collective enterprise.\u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, 469 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 2140].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">As the majority acknowledges, the state legislation and the marketing program here at issue are not materially different from the program approved in <em>Glickman. </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 507-508, 516.) The majority provides a partial description of this regulatory context (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 478-480), but I believe that it is helpful to emphasize the regulatory scheme in greater detail, and hence quote below extensively from the Court of Appeal majority\u2019s decision in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201cThe point of these [the state and federal marketing] programs is not simply to regulate the market; the point is to preserve the agricultural industry. The laws reflect a long-standing political judgment that \u2018agriculture\u2019\u2014unlike bicycle manufacturing or clothing production, for example\u2014cannot be allowed to disappear from the American economy because of untrammeled market forces . . . .[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201cIn this context, it is worth repeating at length the legislative findings that form the basis of the exercise of the police power of the state in the Act: \u2018It is hereby declared that the marketing of commodities in this state in excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>of reasonable and normal market demands therefor; disorderly marketing of such commodities; improper preparation for market and lack of uniform grading and classification of commodities; unfair methods of competition in marketing of commodities; and the inability of individual producers to maintain present markets or to develop new or larger markets for California-grown commodities, result in an unreasonable and unnecessary economic waste of the agricultural wealth of this state.\u2019 (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 58651.) The foregoing described the result of unrestrained competition in the marketing of perishable commodities; the Legislature then stated that \u2018[t]hese conditions vitally concern the health, peace, safety and general welfare of the people of this state.\u2019 (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 58652.)[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201c. . . [T]he California marketing order [here at issue] \u2018insure[s] maturity, grade and accurate size labeling,\u2019 in addition to providing mandatory funding of generic advertising. . . . [I]t is apparent from the foregoing legislative findings that maturity, grade and labeling standards directly displace the ability to compete using the traditional methods of different \u2018. . . preparation for market and . . . [individualized] grading and classification of agricultural commodities.\u2019 . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cIt is rational to control prices as a way to ensure both demand for the product and a supply of the product [citation]; it is rational to control supply to ensure a demand sufficient to return a fair price [citation]; and it is rational to stimulate demand so that the amount produced by suppliers brings a fair price. In each case, the fundamental assumption of unrestrained competition\u2014that supply and demand together set the price in a free market\u2014is replaced with an assumption that regulatory modification of the market\u2014of supply and/or demand\u2014is necessary in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\"><em>\u201cThis is the sense in which the </em>[Glickman] <em>majority characterized the generic advertising campaign as not violating free speech protections, but merely as one of a number of available tools imbedded in a comprehensive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>regulatory program </em>\u2018that impose[s] restraints on competition that arguably disadvantage particular producers for the benefit of the entire market.\u2019 <em>([Glickman, supra,] </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at p. 474 . . . , fn. omitted.) . . . [T]he point [of the <em>Glickman </em>majority] <em>is that the advertising tool merely seeks to accomplish the same goals as equally or more invasive tools, such as price, quantity, quality and labeling restrictions; no greater weight should be given to the fact that the advertising tool involves an activity that, in other contexts, is \u2018commercial speech\u2019 protected by the First Amendment.\u201d </em>(Fns. omitted, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\n<em>\\ \u2022*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">It is clear that the present case presents itself in essentially the same heavily regulated context that the majority in <em>Glickman </em>found to be highly pertinent to its inquiry under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The Secretary of Food and Agriculture of the State of California argues that although our state Constitution has independent force and we are not bound by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of corresponding provisions of the federal Constitution, nevertheless, pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Teresinski </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 822 [180 Cal.Rptr. 617, 640 P.2d,753] <em>(Teresinski), </em>we should give <em>Glickman </em>\u201crespectful consideration\u201d and follow it under our own charter \u201cunless persuasive reasons are presented for taking a different course.\u201d <em>(Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 836.) The majority implicitly concedes that pursuant to <em>Teresinski, </em>unless there are cogent reasons not to follow Glickman\u2019s conclusion, we should adopt the high court\u2019s approach in construing our own free speech clause, and hold that article I, section 2(a) is not implicated by the generic advertising component of the comprehensive state-mandated commercial marketing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The majority discusses the factors that we identified in <em>Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 822, 836-837, as relevant to whether we should construe a state constitutional provision consistently with federal construction of a corresponding provision of the federal charter, and concludes that, on balance, we should not follow the federal approach here. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 510-514.) I am not persuaded. I shall address the four factors in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\"><em>Does the language or history of article I, section 2(a) suggest that the issue before us should be resolved differently from the way it was resolved under the First Amendment in Glickman? (Teresinski, supra, </em>30. Cal.3d 822, 836.) The majority concludes that this factor weighs in favor of rejecting <em>Glickman </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>finding that the marketing program challenged here implicates article I, section 2(a) of our state charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">If we were to consider article I, section 2(a)\u2019s words in isolation, without regard to the provision\u2019s history, and without considering the highly regulated context of the program here at issue, I might agree with the majority that the program presently challenged \u201cimplicates\u201d article I, section 2(a). But it is not appropriate to consider the text of the state constitutional provision in isolation\u2014we must consider it along with its history and context. In this regard, I emphasize the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The majority asserts that \u201c[a]s a general rule,\u201d article I, section 2(a)\u2019s \u201cright to freedom of speech\u201d is \u201cbroader\u201d and \u201cgreater\u201d than that provided under the First Amendment, and that only in exceptional circumstances does the state provision fail to afford greater or broader free speech rights. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 491-492.) Because the proper application of the state free speech clause necessarily must be determined on a case-by-case basis, I am not convinced that it is helpful to attempt to quantify the question in terms of a \u201cgeneral rule.\u201d Nevertheless, on the basis of past decisions, it is incorrect to suggest that in all but exceptional circumstances the state Constitution provides greater or broader <em>protection </em>for speech than does the First Amendment. Instead, at least in the numerous areas that have been litigated, California decisions applying the state free speech clause have more often than not concluded that the state provision affords <em>no greater protection </em>than that afforded by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">For example, recently in <em>Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 352 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 993 P.2d 334] <em>{Los Angeles Alliance), </em>although emphasizing that our free speech clause is written in terms broader than the First Amendment, we held that our provision offers no greater protection of \u201csolicitation speech,\u201d and that our state standard for determining the validity of anti-solicitation laws is the same as the federal test. (At pp. 365-379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Similarly, for the past half-century, we have interpreted article I, section 2(a), (or its substantively identical predecessors) in numerous other contexts, as affording comparable but no greater protection for speech than that provided under the First Amendment. (See, e.g., <em>Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 745-746 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406], and cases cited [applying First Amendment standards in defamation action under article I, section 2(a), and holding that the state provision does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>impose greater obstacles to recovery than what is required by the First Amendment]; <em>Leoni v.

But in light of the numerous cases cited above, upholding various regulations under both the First Amendment and our state\u2019s free speech provision, with no different analysis for the state law claim, this hardly supports the majority\u2019s assertion that as a <em>general </em>rule, and absent exceptional circumstances, article I, section 2(a), provides speech protection that is broader or greater than that afforded under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">California has had for more than 150 years the same core language in article I, section 2(a)\u2014the declaration that \u201c[e]very person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects.\u201d The majority asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>that this language affords greater protection to <em>commercial </em>speech than does the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We have not been cited to any California decision prior to 1942 (when the United States Supreme Court held there was no First Amendment protection for commercial speech in <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Chrestensen </em>(1942) 316 U.S. 52, 54-55 [62 S.Ct. 920, 921-922, 86 L.Ed. 1262]), that recognized under article I, section 2(a)\u2019s predecessors any greater protection for commercial speech than that afforded by the First Amendment. From the filing of <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Chrestensen </em>in 1942, until 1976, when the high court reversed itself and found that cbmmercial speech enjoys some constitutional protection, subject to police power regulation (Va. <em>Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 748, 770-773 [96 S.Ct. 1817, 1829-1831, 48 L.Ed.2d 346]), our courts followed federal high court cases in upholding various commercial speech regulations. (See, e.g., <em>In re Mares, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 798, 802-805.) Likewise, since 1976 no California decision has suggested that California\u2019s protection of commercial speech is different in any respect from that provided under the First Amendment. (See, e.g., <em>Leoni </em>v. <em>State Bar, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d 609, 614, fn. 2, &amp; 622-628; <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, supra, 26 </em>Cal.3d 848, 866-871; <em>Loska v. Superior Court, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d 569, 581-584; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Olson) </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 181, 195 [157 Cal.Rptr. 628].) This history suggests that it would be quite suspect now to read into article I, section 2(a), an expansive protection of commercial speech that the California courts have failed to discern.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Again, the cases demonstrate that although our free speech clause is written in terms broader than the First Amendment, California courts nevertheless have long interpreted it as providing no greater protection for <em>commercial </em>speech than is afforded by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Finally, at least 40 other states have constitutional provisions with language that is substantively akin to that contained in the free speech provision of article I, section 2(a). (See <em>Los Angeles Alliance, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 352, 366, fn. 10.) Nothing in the briefs filed in this case, or in the majority opinion, suggests that the history and treatment of the provisions in those states differs significantly from the history and treatment in ours. It appears that until the United States Supreme Court held in 1976 that commercial speech is entitled to some level of protection under the First Amendment, in the few instances in which a state constitutional free speech provision was advanced as a basis for challenging a law, the courts of these other jurisdictions simply followed high court decisions in upholding various state regulations of commercial speech. (E.g., <em>Planned Parenthood Committee v. Maricopa County </em>(1962) 92 Ariz. 231 [375 P.2d 719]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lambert </em>(1975) 68 Wis.2d 523 [229 N.W.2d 622].) Although sister state decisions since 1976 regularly contain general comments to the effect that the language of their provision is \u201cbroader\u201d than that of the First Amendment (see cases cited in <em>Los Angeles Alliance, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 352, 366), most jurisdictions\u2014like our own (see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 525-526)\u2014have in practice interpreted their provisions as providing protection coextensive with the First Amendment. (E.g., <em>State v. Wicklund, supra, </em>589 N.W.2d 793, 799 [observing that numerous other states with \u201cvirtually identical language have interpreted the free speech provisions of their constitutions as coextensive with that of the First Amendment\u201d]; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 799, fn. 5 [citing cases].) With the possible exception of cases from Oregon,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> no decision of which I am aware from these other states has held that the state protection of <em>commercial </em>speech is greater than that provided by the First Amendment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>decisions have concluded otherwise.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, like California, numerous other states long have had substantially similar agricultural marketing programs that have included compelled funding of generic advertising (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 523), and in many of those jurisdictions courts have entertained and rejected diverse constitutional challenges to such programs. (E.g., <em>C. V. Floyd Fruit Co. </em>v. <em>Florida Citrus Commission </em>(1937) 128 Fla. 565 [175 So. 248, 112 A.L.R. 562];<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>State v. Enking </em>(1938) 59 Idaho 321 [82 P.2d 649]; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Michigan State Apple Commission </em>(1941) 296 Mich. 248 [296 N.W. 245];<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Louisiana State Department of Agriculture v.

Brown </em>(1965) 157 Colo. 378 [402 P.2d 621, 628] [noting that 21 states had upheld similar marketing acts].) Although amicus curiae participation in the present case has been extensive, no case from <em>any </em>of these numerous jurisdictions<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> has been brought to our attention suggesting, much less holding, that a state constitution\u2019s free speech clause provides protection for commercial speech <em>in the context here at issue, </em>i.e., when a person or entity (i) properly is required to associate with other business enterprises in conjunction with a regulatory scheme, and (ii) is required, in conjunction with that regulatory scheme, to help fund generic, nonpolitical, and nonideological commercial advertising that is germane to the purpose of the compelled association.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>This considerable history, and the absence of a holding from any other state similar to the one proposed by today\u2019s majority, suggest it would be inappropriate to now read into article I, section 2(a), rights with respect to commercial speech that numerous other courts in numerous other analogous jurisdictions previously have failed to recognize. I believe that this first <em>Teresinski </em>factor militates in favor of following the approach set out in <em>Glickman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The final three <em>Teresinski </em>factors yield the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\"><em>Does the federal decision in question overrule precedent or limit previously established rights under the United States Constitution? (Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 822, 836.) As the majority recognizes, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 511-512.) This factor militates in favor of following the approach set out in <em>Glickman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\"><em>Was the decision unanimous, and has it inspired \u201cincisive academic criticism\u201d? (Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 822, 836-837, italics added.) <em>Glickman </em>was closely divided and, like many high court opinions, it has been criticized, although it may be doubted whether the academic literature reflects the kind of incisive criticism contemplated in Teresinski.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As the majority recognizes, the result reached by <em>Glickman </em>also has support in the academic community. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 504.) On the whole, this third factor does not provide a strong basis for declining to follow the reasoning of <em>Glickman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The last <em>Teresinski </em>factor presents the question: <em>if Glickman is followed by our courts, would it overturn established California doctrine affording greater </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>rights under article I, section 2(a)? (Teresinski, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 822, 837.) The majority again admits that the answer is \u201cno.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 511.) As explained above, and as the majority acknowledges <em>(id., </em>at p. 496, fn. 6), there is no California precedent to overturn, because before today\u2019s holding there simply was no decision establishing greater commercial rights under the state provision than are provided under the First Amendment. Further, although agricultural marketing programs, with their generic advertising components, have been in existence in California for many decades, no California decision has suggested that such programs pose constitutional problems under article I, section 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Accordingly, I conclude, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, that the four <em>Teresinski </em>factors militate in favor of adopting <em>Glickman</em>'s approach in construing article I, section 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">As just explained, I am not convinced that we should disavow <em>Glickman </em>in construing our free speech provision. If we were to follow <em>Glickman </em>here, we would conclude that article I, section 2(a) is not implicated by the challenged marketing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Nevertheless, the majority holds that article I, section 2(a) is implicated by the plum marketing program. Having so concluded, however, the majority leaves for the Court of Appeal the task of attempting to resolve, on remand, whether the program actually <em>violates </em>the state Constitution. This issue was fairly raised in the petition for review, it is well addressed in the briefs, and the majority fails adequately to explain why this court should not also determine the standard of review and then apply that standard in order to decide whether the state free speech provision is violated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Gerawan proposes application of the test originally set out in <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. v.

The court in <em>Keller, </em>following the test first set out in <em>Abood, </em>approved compelled funding for State Bar activities\u2014even those that implicated political or ideological matters\u2014so long as (i) the compelled association was justified in the first place by the need to \u201cregulat[e] the legal profession\u201d and \u201cimprov[e] the quality of legal services,\u201d and (ii) the compelled funding from mandatory dues was for activities that were \u201cgermane to those goals\u201d\u2014meaning that the challenged expenditures were \u201creasonably incurred\u201d for those purposes. <em>(Keller, supra, </em>496 U.S. 1, 13-14 [110 S.Ct. 2228, 2235-2236].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Consistent with the majority in <em>Glickman, </em>I agree that if free speech rights are implicated here, the appropriate standard of review would not be the one developed to assess <em>restrictions on commercial speech </em>(the <em>Central Hudson </em>test), but instead the test used to assess <em>compelled funding of speech </em>(the <em>Abood/Keller </em>test). (Accord, <em>Gallo Cattle Co. v. California Milk Advisory Bd. </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 185 F.3d 969, 976-977 <em>(Gallo); </em>Case Note, <em>Constitutional Law\u2014Forced Advertising: Free Speech or Not Even? Glickman v.

Yes. The interest in maintaining the stability of markets for California plums justifies legislation that allows producers and handlers to establish compelled associations designed to accomplish that goal, (ii) Is the generic advertising program <em>germane </em>to the purposes of the marketing order here at issue? Yes. One purpose of the marketing order is to create and support a market for California plums. The advertising program clearly is germane to that purpose; the costs of the advertising program are \u201creasonably incurred\u201d (Keller, <em>supra, </em>496 U.S. 1, 14 [110 S.Ct. 2228, 2236]) to promote that goal.

[Citation.] Marketing orders promulgated pursuant to the AMAA are a species of economic regulation that has displaced competition in a number of discrete markets; they are expressly exempted from the antitrust laws. [Citation.] Collective action, rather than the aggregate consequences of independent competitive choices, characterizes these regulated markets. In order \u2018to avoid unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices,\u2019 [citation], these orders may include mechanisms that provide a uniform price to all producers in a particular market, that limit the quality and the quantity of the commodity that may be marketed, [citation], that determine the grade and size of the commodity, [citation], and that make an orderly disposition of any surplus that might depress market prices [citation]. Pursuant to the policy of collective, rather than competitive, marketing, the orders also authorize joint research and development projects, inspection procedures that ensure uniform quality, and even certain standardized packaging requirements. [Citation.] The expenses of administering such orders, including specific projects undertaken to serve the economic interests of the cooperating producers, are \u2018paid from funds collected pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the marketing order.\u2019 [Citation.] fl[] Marketing orders must be approved by either two-thirds of the affected producers or by producers who market at least two-thirds of the volume of the commodity. [Citation.] The AMAA restricts the marketing orders \u2018to the smallest regional production areas . . . practicable.\u2019 [Citation.] The orders are implemented by committees composed of producers and handlers of the regulated commodity, appointed by the Secretary, who recommend rules to the Secretary governing marketing matters such as fruit size and maturity levels. [Citation.] The committees also determine the annual rate of assessments to cover the expenses of administration, inspection services, research, and advertising and promotion. [Citation.] [1[] Among the collective activities that Congress authorized for certain specific commodities is \u2018any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising.\u2019 [Citation.] The authorized promotional activities, like the marketing orders themselves, are intended to serve the producers\u2019 common interest in disposing of their output on favorable terms. The central message of the generic advertising at issue in this case is that \u2018California Summer Fruits\u2019 are wholesome, delicious, and attractive to discerning shoppers. [Citation.] All of the relevant advertising, insofar as it is authorized by the statute and the Secretary\u2019s regulations, is designed to serve the producers\u2019 and handlers\u2019 common interest in promoting the sale of a particular product.\u201d <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. 457, 461-462 [117 S.Ct. 2130, 2134-2135], fns. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">At this point, the court explained in <em>Glickman: </em>\u201cWe considered, in <em>Abood[, supra, </em>431 U.S. 209], whether it was constitutional for the State of Michigan to require government employees who objected to unions or union activities to contribute to an \u2018agency shop\u2019 arrangement requiring all employees to pay union dues as a condition of employment.

(Shimomura, <em>A New Look at the California Marketing Act of 1937 </em>(1972) 5 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 190, 198.) It grew out of the chaotic conditions which characterized California agriculture during the early part of the twentieth century. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 196-198.) Before the promulgation of the CMA, each of California\u2019s many fruit and vegetable growers attempted to be the first in the market with his or her commodity, in order to take advantage of the premium prices paid on early shipments. This led to the marketing of inadequately ripened produce, and the glutting of the market during the peak season with poor quality commodities. Deceptive packaging, improper sampling, and false grading were often resorted to in order to attempt to enhance the attractiveness of the produce.

The majority does not point to any direct evidence (in the constitutional debates, revision records, or amendment materials, or otherwise) to support its hypothesis (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 494-496), and it ignores the circumstance that the California drafters did not fashion a new free speech provision that fit the majority\u2019s description of the distinctive culture of mid-19th century California, but instead simply adopted the preexisting language of the corresponding New York Constitution. I also note that the Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>State v. Wicklund </em>(Minn. 1999) 589 N.W.2d 793, recently conducted a similar historical review of its substantively identical provision <em>(id., </em>at pp. 798-799) and found \u201cnothing from either the 1857 [D]ebates [and Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention for the Territory of Minnesota] or decisions of other states having similar or identical provisions to suggest that our state\u2019s free speech protection was intended to be applied more broadly than its federal counterpart.\u201d That court concluded, \u201c[T]here is nothing inherent in the language of [the state provision] which requires more expansive protection for free speech than does the First Amendment.\u201d (At p. 799.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Gerawan Farming, Inc. relies upon <em>Moser v.

Although I do not find any explicit holding in <em>Moser </em>that the Oregon free speech clause applies equally to commercial and noncommercial speech, Gerawan\u2019s interpretation <em>of Moser </em>is arguably supported by prior Oregon appellate court cases asserting that Oregon\u2019s free speech provision generally does afford protection for commercial speech greater than that provided by the First Amendment, and indeed that commercial speech is entitled to the same protection as noncommercial speech <em>(Ackerley Communications, Inc. v.

The first two of these materials do not offer incisive criticism. Volume 2 of Smolla and Nimmer, Freedom of Speech (1999), much like some of the cited student works, contains primarily a detailed description of the various <em>Glickman </em>opinions (at \u00a7 20:45, pp. 20-106 to 20-114), after which the authors announce, in conclusory fashion and with no independent analysis, that Justice Souter\u2019s dissent presented the better argument. (At pp. 20-114.) Fried, <em>Perfect Freedom, Perfect Justice </em>(1998) 78 B.U. L.Rev. 717, is even less substantive. There, at the conclusion of a wide-ranging published lecture on jurisprudential attempts to attain \u201cperfect freedom\u201d and \u201cperfect justice,\u201d the author does little more than mention, in a five-line footnote that contains no independent analysis, his disagreement with the majority in <em>Glickman </em>and agreement with Justice Souter\u2019s dissent. (At p. 743, fn. 84.) The third professional work relied upon by the majority, C\u00e1sarez, <em>Don\u2019t Tell Me What to Say: Compelled Commercial Speech and the First Amendment </em>(1998) 63 Mo. L.Rev. 929 (C\u00e1sarez), does indeed present a thoughtful critique of the \u201ccontextual\u201d approach of the majority in <em>Glickman </em>(at pp. 960-965), but these five pages of this one work hardly constitute the kind of incisive academic criticism contemplated by <em>Teresinski.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The principal dissenting opinion in <em>Glickman </em>would have applied this <em>Central Hudson </em>standard and found that the marketing order in that case failed that test. <em>(Glickman, supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 491-504 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2149-2156] (dis. opn. of Souter, J.); cf. <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Frame </em>(3d Cir. 1989) 885 F.2d 1119, 1133-1137 [upholding different federal marketing order under <em>Central Hudson </em>standard].)

The court in <em>Gallo </em>proceeded, pursuant to <em>Glickman, </em>to apply the <em>Abood/Keller </em>test, and to uphold the program. The court reasoned: \u201cCompelled association of the milk producers of California is justified by purposes set out in the California Marketing Act and the Marketing Order: to prevent economic waste in the marketing of commodities; to develop more efficient and equitable methods of marketing' commodities; and to maintain present markets for, as well as to develop new and larger markets for, commodities grown within the State. [Citation.] The Marketing Order itself specifically provides that the authorized promotional activities are intended to maintain the present market for, as well as create new or larger markets for, California milk and dairy products. [Citations.] The CMAB\u2019s [California Milk Advisory Board\u2019s] employment of a generic advertising campaign of California Milk and dairy products, including the generic advertisement of Real California Cheese\u00ae, is obviously \u2018germane\u2019 to these purposes.\u201d <em>(Gallo, supra, </em>185 F.3d at p. 976.) The court further explained in <em>Gallo: </em>\u201cBecause the Real California Cheese\u00ae advertising campaign is designed to increase the overall consumption of California raw milk by increasing the demand for cheese made from California milk, it is \u2018germane\u2019 to the Marketing Act\u2019s and Marketing Order\u2019s goals of maintaining the present market for, as well as creating new or larger markets for, California milk and dairy products. [Citations.] CMAB can therefore use Gallo\u2019s assessments, over Gallo\u2019s objection, to fund the generic advertisement of Real California Cheese\u00ae.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 977, registered marks in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
