The summons was served on the same day. On the 13th day of August, defendants served notice on plaintiff that they would, on the 18th of August, move the County Judge to dissolve the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-9\">The County Judge denied the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-10\">Defendants answered, denying the allegations of the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-11\">November 4th, 1863, plaintiff recovered judgment. Defendants appealed from the order refusing to dissolve the attachment, and from the judgment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-12\"><em>G. F. &amp; William II.

It is insisted by respondent that the question cannot be considered, for the reason that under the provisions of the Practice Act the order is not appealable; and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>cannot be reviewed on an appeal from the judgment, for the reason that the Court, on an appeal from a judgment, can only \u201c review an intermediate order involving the merits and necessarily affecting the judgment.\u201d (Practice Act, Sec. 344.) This objection seems to us to be well founded. Section 347 prescribes the cases and section 336 the time in which an appeal may be taken. This is not an appealable order within the meaning of those sections, and an appeal, therefore, cannot be taken from it directly as an order; and it is not an order \u201c involving the merits, and necessarily affecting the judgment,\u201d within the meaning of section 344. The attachment is merely a proceeding ancillary to the action, by which a party is <em>enabled to </em>acquire a lien for the security of his demand by a levy made before instead of after the entry of a judgment. This ancillary proceeding may be taken at the time of the commencement of the action, or at any time after-wards. Reither the action nor the judgment, under our law, in any manner depends upon the attachment, although the attachment depends upon the action. The judgment in the case is precisely the same, whether the attachment is dissolved or not. In those States where the attachment is used as a process for acquiring jurisdiction, the consequences of dissolving or refusing to dissolve an attachment might be different. But here, the judgment is not, in any respect, affected by the attachment. We could neither reverse nor modify the final judgment in any particular in consequence of any error in the attachment proceedings. The provision\u2014\u201c Upon an appeal from a judgment the Court may review any order involving the merits and necessarily affecting the judgment,\u201d implies that it shall not review intermediate orders not affecting the judgment. We think the question cannot be reviewed in this form of proceeding. It is a case for which the Practice Act has made no provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The case of <em>Taaffe </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>7 Cal. 518, appears to have been decided on the authority of <em>Qristvold </em>v. <em>Sharpe, 2 </em>Cal. 17. But the latter case arose under the Practice Act of 1851, which provided for an appeal \u201c from an order * * * which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>affects a substantial right in an action or special proceeding.\u201d Probably this provision would embrace an order of the kind under consideration. The attention of the Court, in the case of <em>Taaffe </em>v. Rosenthal, does not appear to have been called to the amendment of the Practice Act in this particular. Besides, the objection does not appear to have been raised or discussed in <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Sharpe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">No error appearing which affects the judgment, it must be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
