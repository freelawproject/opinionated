The plaintiff further claimed that the defendants refused to comply with these conditions, and that he rented other premises. On the part of the defendants it was claimed that the sum of $50 was paid as a part payment upon the rental price agreed upon for the premises referred to, and that plaintiff failed to pay the balance through no fault of the defendants. There was a direct conflict of testimony upon these questions, and the trial judge decided in favor of the plaintiff, and no sufficient reason appears why such judgment should be disturbed. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondent All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
