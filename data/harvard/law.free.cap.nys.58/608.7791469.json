On June 2, 1898, the said Joseph Herrmann made a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors to the defendant herein. Plaintiff claims that prior to said assignment, and by reason of the fraud of the said Joseph Herrmann, the contract of sale for the aforesaid chattels was duly rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">There is no proof of a valid rescission or abandonment of the contract of sale of the chattels by Silverman to Herrmann. The vendee, Herrmann, remained in possession of the chattels, and the vendor, Silverman, held and continued to hold the notes of the vendee given for the purchase thereof. Murray v. Harway, 56 N. Y. 337. By the assignment, the defendant assignee, as aforesaid, became lawfully possessed of the chattels, and, to make his possession a tortious one, a demand and refusal were necessary before suit could be brought against him to recover the chattels. There is no proof of a demand of the chattels on the assignee before bringing the action. Goodwin v. Wertheimer, 99 N. Y. 149, 1 N. E. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">Judgment appealed from affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
