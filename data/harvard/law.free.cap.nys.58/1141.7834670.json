The evidence shows that in crossing the defendant\u2019s tracks the plaintiff exercised due caution. The injuries complained of were severe. The verdict was a reasonable one. These injuries were caused by defendant\u2019s negligence in turning the corner at Fifty-Third street west and Ninth avenue. The evidence shows that defendant\u2019s car was going very fast,\u2014in fact, unreasonably fast,\u2014thus running down plaintiff and injuring her.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
