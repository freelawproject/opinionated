Higgins. The will was made in 1878, and Mr. Higgins died in 1882. The particular clause of the will under which the plaintiffs claim is the seventh. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">\u201cSeventh. I give and bequeath unto the children of my sister Ellen W. Perley each the sum of ten thousand dollars. In the event, however, either of said children shall die before me, leaving issue surviving me, then and in that event I give and bequeath the sum of ten thousand dollars which the one so dying would have taken if living unto his or her issue; If, however, either of said children shall die before me without leaving issue surviving me, then and in that' event I give and bequeath the sum of ten thousand dollars which the one so dying would have taken if living unto the survivors or survivor of them, said children of my said sister Ellen W. Perley, and to the issue of such of them as shall have previously died leaving issue; such issue to take the part or share which his, her, or their parent or parents would have taken if living.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Ellen W. Perley had four children. Two of them survived Mr. Higgins. One died in 1871, leaving .one child, who died before the making of the will; and one died in 1875, leaving two children, the present plaintiffs. The question is, do the issue of a child of Mrs. Perley who died before the execution of Mr. Higgins\u2019 will take under the seventh clause? It is to be observed that the clause in question is one of six of precisely the same tenor, in each of which Mr. Higgins makes similar provisions for the children of his brothers and sisters. The scheme of benefaction was an elaborate one, and -was evidently well considered, and carefully drafted by skillful hands. There is no reason, therefore, why we should hesitate to apply to these six clauses well-settled rules of interpretation. The intention of the testator was apparently in accordance with these rules, and we find nothing -whatever in the will indicative of any different intention. He premises with a gift of $10,000 to each of the children of his sister Ellen W. Perley. Standing alone, this, is a primary gift to such of the then living children of Mrs. Perley as should survive the testator. It is certainly not a gift to nonexistent persons, and consequently it does not bring within the class the children of Mrs. Perley who were dead at the time the will was made. What follows was plainly substitutionary. If nothing had been added to the primary gift, there would have been a lapse upon the death of any of the then living children prior to the death of the testator. The substitutionary clauses which follow were plainly inserted to prevent such a lapse. No clearer words of substitution could well be framed than those of the first substitutionary clause which follows the primary gift. The sentence opens with the words, \u201cIn the event, however.\u201d This clearly refers to a future, not a past, event. The use of the word \u201chowever,\u201d following the words \u201cin the event,\u201d lends additional force to this view. Then consider the reference which follows to the \u201csaid children.\u201d Who are the \u201csaid children?\u201d Are they not the children who are the objects of his primary gifts? These latter form the class, and the reference throughout the clause to the children of Mrs. Perley, or to either of said children, are references to this class. And, further, there is no trace of an intention to supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>ment the primary gift to the then living children of Mrs. Perley with an additional gift to the issue of her then dead children. This is emphasized by the form of the gift to the issue of a dead child: \u201cThen and in that event I give and bequeath the sum of ten thousand dollars which the one so dying would have taken if living unto his or her issue.\u201d This, in its natural import, refers to some member of the class who, being alive when the will was made, would have taken if living at the death of the testator. Then look at the second substitutionary clause. Here we find provision for the death of \u201ceither of said children without leaving issue surviving me.\u201d What then? Why, \u201cthen and in that event\u201d he gives the sum of $10,000\u2014again which the one so dying would have taken if living\u2014unto the survivor or survivors of the \u201csaid children of my said sister,\u201d and to the issue of such of them \u201cas shall have previously died leaving issue.\u201d \u2022 There is a double significance in this second substitutionary clause. It repeats and emphasizes the substitutionary phrases of the first substitutionary clause. If it referred to children of Mrs. Perley who were dead at the time of the making of the will, it was certainly an odd and roundabout way of adding to the primary gift to her then living children. Why speak of the possible event of a child dying without leaving issue, when that child had already died without leaving issue? It is suggested that Mr. Higgins may not have known which of Mrs. Perley\u2019s children were dead and which were alive when he made his will. That may be, and it may also be that he did know. We cannot speculate on that head. There is nothing in the language of his will to indicate that he was providing for lapses of memory or for insufficient information with regard to family history. But the most significant expression in the second substitutionary clause is found in connection with the gift to the issue of the survivors. The language is, \u201cto the issue of such of them as shall have previously died leaving issue.\u201d The plaintiffs lay great stress upon this phraseology. It seems to us, however, that, in the connection in which it is used, this form of language but furnishes an additional argument against the plaintiffs\u2019 contention. It certainly shows that the testator gave due weight to grammatical precision. He did not loosely attribute the same sense to the words \u201cshall die before me\u201d that he did to the words \u201cshall have previously died.\u201d When he meant \u201cshall have previously died,\u201d he said so. When he meant \u201cshall die before me,\u201d he said so. It will be observed that he used the expression \u201cshall die before me\u201d twice,\u2014once in the first substitutionary clause, and once in the second; that is, in the very clause in which he used the words \u201cshall have previously died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The authorities support this construction. They recognize that the test is whether the gift to the issue is primary or substitutionary. If it is primary, the issue of children who predeceased the will take. If substitutionary, they do not, for the simple and obvious reason that, to take by way of substitution, one must point to the original legatee in whose place he is to stand; and that he cannot do when there was no such original legatee at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>the making of the will,\u2014he who might have been such having died prior thereto. Thus, in Tytherleigh v. Harbin, 6 Sim. 329, the gift was \u201cunto or amongst all and every and such one or more of the child or children of B. T. who shall be living at the time of his decease, and the issue of such of them as shall be then dead leaving issue.\u201d This was held to be an original and substantive gift to the issue of the deceased children of B. T., quite the same as the original and substantive gift to his children living at his decease. The gift was to the \u201cchildren\u201d and the \u201cissue.\u201d There was nothing substitutionary in it, or in any part of it. The rule on this head is extremely well put by Mr. Jarman (2 Jarm. Wills [5th Am. Ed.] p. 775), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\">\u201cWhere, however, the children of the deceased person found their claim, not on a mere clause of substitution, but on a substantive, independent, original gift, comprehending them concurrently with another class of objects, the doctrine of the preceding cases does not apply, and the gift will extend to the children of persons who were dead when the will was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">This admirable expression, \u201ccomprehending them concurrently with another class of objects,\u201d illustrates and clarifies many cases on the same line as Tytherleigh v. Harbin, which otherwise might seem to conflict with the. well-known case of Christopherson v. Naylor, 1 Mer. 320, where the substitutionary rule was originally laid down. There the bequest was \u201cto each and every of the child and children of my brothers and sisters, A., B., O., &amp; D., who shall be living at the time of my decease.\u201d Here the bequest is, in substance and effect, \u201cto each and every of the child and children of my brothers and sisters, A., B., C., D., E., &amp; F., living at the time of- my decease.\u201d There he says that \u201cif any child or children of my said brothers and sisters, or any of them, shall happen to die in my lifetime, and leave issue at his or her decease, then and in such case * * * I give and bequeath the same to his, her, or their issue.\u201d The expression, \u201cshall happen to die in my lifetime, and leave issue,\u201d does not vary substantially from the expression here,\u2014\u201cshall die before me, leaving issue.\u201d The cases are practically identical. Sir W. Grant, M. B., there held that the language of the will imported nothing but a substitutionary gift to the issue of the nephews and nieces. \u201cThe nephews and nieces,\u201d he said, \u201care here the primary legatees. Nothing whatever is given to their issue, except in the way of substitution. In order to claim, therefore, under the will, these substituted legatees must point out the original legatees in whose place they demand to stand. But, of the nephews and nieces of the testator, none could have taken besides those who were living at the date of the will. The issue of those who were dead at that time can consequently show no objects of substitution, and to give them original legacies would be, in effect, to make a new will for the testator.\u201d This case has been repeatedly followed in England, and cited with approval in this state. An attempt was made in England by Vice Chancellor Malins to deviate from the rule there laid dowrn (see In re Potter\u2019s Trust, L. R. 8 Eq. 52, and In re Lucas\u2019 Will, 17 Ch. Div. 788), but it was quite unsuccessful. Christopherson v. Naylor was approved in Be Thompson\u2019s Trusts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number><em>2 </em>Wkly. Rep. 218; In re Hotchkiss\u2019 Trusts, L. E. 8 Eq. 643; In re Chapman\u2019s Will, 32 Beav. 382; In re Barker, 47 Law T. (N. S.) 38; In re Webster\u2019s Estate, 23 Ch. Div. 737; and In re Chinery, 39 Ch. Div. 614,\u2014and finally it was adopted by the court of appeal as the \u25a0settled law of England. Groves v. Musther, Law J. 59 Ch. 296; In re Wood, 63 Law J. Ch. 790. In Groves v. Musther, the testatrix directed her residuary estate to be equally divided between her nephews and nieces not before named, \u201cbut, should any of them be dead before me, I then direct that his or her share shall be equally divided between his or her children.\u201d It was held that the children of nephews and nieces dead at the date of the will were not entitled to take under the bequest. Cotton, L. J., alluded to the fact that Mr. Justice Kay, in the court below, had decided the case on the authority of Christopherson v. Naylor, and said that Justice Kay was right in so doing; adding that \u201cthis case is covered, not only by the decision in Christopherson v. Naylor, but also by the reasoning there given.\u201d Lord Lindley, in his opinion in the same case, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-5\">\u201cI have long been familiar with Christopherson v. Naylor. That decision T\u00edas often been criticised, and occasionally disapproved, and in particular by Vice Chancellor Malins in Adams v. Adams. L. R. 14 Eq. 246; but I cannot agree with him in his criticism. Personally, I approve that decision, and I have always understood it to be good law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">In Re Wood, the testator bequeathed his residue upon trust to invest and pay the income of the investments equally among all his children during their respective lives, and upon the death of .any such child, whether before or after the testator\u2019s death, to hold the corpus, whereof the income was or would have been payable to such child, upon trusts for the benefit of the child or children of such child. It was held (affirming Mr. Justice Kekewich) that a grandchild of the testator, whose parent died before the date of the will, was not entitled to a share in the residue. Lindley, L. J., \u2022said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-7\">\u201cAs to the authorities, with all due deference to the decisions of Vice Chan-cellor Malins in Ee Potter\u2019s Trust, and in Be Lucas\u2019 Will, I think that Christopherson v. Naylor, Groves v. Musther, and In re Chinery govern the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Lopes, L. J., said he was of the same opinion. Davey, L. J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-9\">\u201cAs to the residuary gift, I think the question is concluded by authority. Notwithstanding the opinion of Vice Chancellor Malins expressed in Ee Potter\u2019s and In re Lucas\u2019 Will, and frequently repeated, I think Christopherson v. Naylor was rightly decided, and must be followed. It has been frequently accepted by the court of appeals in subsequent cases, including Groves v. Musther.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">See, also, many cases cited in Jarm. Wills (5th Am. Ed.) pp. 771-774.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">In this state Christopherson v. Naylor was referred to approvingly in Re Crawford, 113 N. Y. 375, 21 N. E. 142, and Palmer v. Dunham, 125 N. Y. 68, 25 N. E. 1081. In the Crawford Case, Judge Andrews carefully analyzes the two' classes of gifts,\u2014primary and substitutionary,\u2014and points out the effect of each upon the question whether the issue of predeceased members of the class dying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>before the date of the will take. In the latter case, Judge O\u2019Brien, in citing Christopherson v. Naylor with approval, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-4\">\u201cThe gift of .a remainder was to a class, followed by a substitutionary gift of the share of any one in the class who should die, to the next of liin of this deceased person. No one can take under this substitutionary clause who cannot show that his parent might have been one of the original class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">His concluding remarks are peculiarly applicable to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-6\">\u201cBequests similar to the one now under consideration have been the subject of much controversy in regard to the right of the issue of predeceased children to take when the words used in the will were left open to construction. But, as was said in Re Crawford, 113 N. Y. 366, 21 N. E. 142, we are relieved in this case from the necessity of a critical examination of the cases on the general subject, for the reason that the language of the will is so plain as to remove any doubt about the meaning of the testatrix. She evidently intended that the fund invested should, upon the death of her niece, pass to the children of that niece who were living when the will was made, and the next of kin of any of them who subsequently died.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The intention here is as clear as was the intention there, and no doubt is left, after the closest scrutiny of the entire will, as to Mr. Higgins\u2019 meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">The appellants rely upon Teed v. Morton, 60 N. Y. 502. The provision there, however, brought the case within the rule laid down in Tytherleigh v. Harbin, supra. The gift was to the testator\u2019s \u201csurviving children, and the issue of such of them as may have died leaving issue.\u201d Thus, the issue of such as might have died leaving issue were \u201ccomprehended concurrently\u201d with the surviving children. The gift to the issue there was thus primary, independent, and substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Upon both principle and authority, therefore, our conclusion is that the issue of such of Mrs. Perley\u2019s children as had died prior to the making of Mr. Higgins\u2019 will took nothing under the seventh \u25a0clause of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">It follows that the judgment appealed from was right, and \u2022should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
