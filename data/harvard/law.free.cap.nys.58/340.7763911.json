The car stopped, as she said, just where she asked it to stop; but where, with reference to the two crosswalks on Twenty-Third street, or whether it was on the north side of Twenty-Third street, she could not remember. For the defendant, four witn\u00e9sses (the conductor, the gripman, a bicycle patrolman, and a passenger) testified that the accident happened north of Twenty-Third street, and that the plaintiff alighted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>from the car before it had come to a stop at all; giving incidents with circumstantiality.
