Under this agreement the defendant boarded the horse, occasionally washed the wagon and cleaned the harness, though these latter were not stipulated services. Being in arrears on December 1, 1898, the plaintiffs were notified by the defendant that they could not remove the horse, wagon, and harness from the stable until his charges were paid. Nine days after this notice, the plaintiffs made a written dem\u00e1nd for the return of the horse, wagon, and harness, which was refused. These facts, and the value of the articles having been shown, the justice rendered judgment that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the possession of the wagon and harness or their value, adjudged to be $142, and that the defendant had a lien upon the horse for the sum of $60 for the keep of the animal, and was entitled to retain said animal until such indebtedness was paid. From so much of the judgment as awarded the possession or the value of the wagon and harness to the plaintiff, comes the present appeal. The defendant failed to establish any lien, either by agreement or by statute, as an artisan for the betterment of personal property, or for storage of the goods, within sections 70, 73, art. 6, c. 418, Laws 1897. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
