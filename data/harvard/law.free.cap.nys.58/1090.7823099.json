One of the conditions indorsed on the policy and incorporated into the contract was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-14\">\u201cNo disability shall constitute a claim * * * where the claimant is Able to leave his bed or house (in case of disabling sickness), nor during any .period of convalescence, nor when the attendance of a physician is not required \u25a0every second- day at the bedside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">This action was brought to recover the agreed insurance for 22 weeks\u2019 alleged disability, within the meaning of this policy. We are \u25a0constrained to reverse the judgment which the plaintiff recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-16\">It appears from the testimony of his wife, who was the only witness called, that he was taken sick on the 6th day of September, 1898; that he was confined to his bed for about 10 weeks; that, during the remaining period of the alleged disability, he occasionally returned to bed, and at times went abroad \u201cfor air and recreation,\u201d \u2022and in December, 1898, made a visit of several months to his daughter in East Orange, N. J., \u201con account of his sickness and for his health.\u201d Further, her evidence discloses but one occasion upon which he was attended by a physician. On this state of facts it is clear that the plaintiff cannot succeed. While it would indeed be venturesome, under the nice and elaborate restrictions of -the whole policy, to assert under what circumstances an insured would not be met by some condition to bar recovery, it is certain that this plaintiff did not adduce testimony to meet the requirements of the quoted provision of the policy. He saw fit to enter into an agreement so phrased that his obligations were positive, and that of the defendant optional. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>Gainor v.
