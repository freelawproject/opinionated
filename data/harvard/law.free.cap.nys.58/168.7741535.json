The judgment demanded is that the defendants be enjoined and restrained from selling and disposing of the pens manufactured by the plaintiff for less than the established list prices, and from hereafter purchasing the same from any of the plaintiff\u2019s customers at less than the list prices; that the defendants return to the plaintiff the pens now in their custody and control; and that the plaintiff also have judgment for the damages sustained. The defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground (1) that there was a defect of parties defendant, and (2) that causes of action had been improperly united. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We think the demurrer was properly overruled. As to the first ground named,\u2014that there is a defect of parties defendant,\u2014the allegation of the complaint is \u201cthat the names and residences of such customers are at present unknown to the plaintiff, and plaintiff asks that they be joined as defendants herein, when discovered, in case they shall be within the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d If the allegation of the complaint in this respect be true,\u2014and in determining this question it must be assumed that it is,\u2014then the plaintiff could not make such persons defendants. The defendants, however, by their answer, can set out the names of the parties whom they claim should be made defendants, and then they can be brought in by an amended complaint. There is no other way in which the plaintiff can make them parties. The law does not require an impossibility, neither does it require a plaintiff to make an unknown person a defendant. Earle v. Scott, 50 How. Prac. 506. The demurrer was also properly overruled on the other ground,\u2014that causes of action had been improperly united. The plaintiff bases its right to maintain the action upon the fact that the defendants, knowing of the existence of the contracts which the plaintiff has with its customers, has induced them to violate the same for the purpose of injuring plaintiff\u2019s business. But one cause of action is alleged. If several customers have, by reason of the acts of the defendants, been induced to violate their contracts, or if, through their acts, one customer has been induced to make different sales in violation of his contract, the proof of these facts would simply tend to establish the one cause of action upon which the plaintiff predicates its right to recover, viz. knowingly inducing customers to violate their contracts, to plaintiff\u2019s damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">It is suggested by the appellants in the brief filed that the complaint does not state a cause of action. A sufficient answer to this suggestion is that the defendants did not demur upon that ground, and the question is therefore not before the court for determination, and we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>It follows that the judgment appealed from is right, and must be affirmed, with costs, with leave, however, to defendants within 20 days after entry and notice of the affirmance of the judgment to withdraw the demurrer, and interpose an answer to the complaint on payment of the costs in this court and the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
