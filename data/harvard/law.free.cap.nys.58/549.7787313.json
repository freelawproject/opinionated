J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT6\">By the policy of insurance upon which this action is brought, the defendant insured the plaintiff against loss by fire \u201cto the following described property, while located and contained as described herein, and not elsewhere, to wit: $450 on frame, shingle-roofed dwelling house, and additions thereto; $150 on household furniture * * [and other household articles] while contained therein; $100 on frame, shingle-roofed barn, No. 1, and attachments thereto. All situate near Rockhill, Sullivan county, N. Y., and occupied by the assured.\u201d After the issuing of the policy, one of the additions mentioned in it was detached from the house, and moved to a point on the plaintiff\u2019s land 30 feet distant from its original position, where it continued to be used for kitchen purposes until it and its contents were destroyed by fire. It will be observed that the policy covered a risk on \u201cproperty while located and contained as described herein, and not elsewhere.\u201d The only location of the property described in the policy is, \u201cAll situate near Rockhill, Sullivan county, N. Y., and occupied by the assured.\u201d The removal of the kitchen addition for a distance of 30 feet created no condition which in terms excluded the kitchen from the location described in the policy, and if it were not for a somewhat ambiguous clause in the agreed statement of facts signed by both attorneys, upon which the motion to dismiss was made, we should have no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion. That clause reads, \u201cIt is not intended by this motion to raise the question that by reason of the removal aforesaid the hazard was increased.\u201d That is, the defendant made a motion to dismiss, and in making it admitted that it did not claim that there was any increased hazard occasioned by the removal; and this statement \"is tantamount to an admission on the part of the defendant that the hazard was not increased. We are thus brought to the question whether the removal invalidated the policy, where the addition continued to be on the plaintiff\u2019s land, and within the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of the location described in the policy, though its precise location was changed a distance of 30 feet. It is not entirely clear that the word \u201clocated\u201d refers at all to the buildings, although it precedes and apparently relates to the several items which form the subject of the risk, because it is connected by the word \u201cand\u201d with \u201ccontained.\u201d \u201cContained\u201d could not apply to the buildings. It can relate only to personal property in the buildings. If \u201cor\u201d had been use.d instead of \u201cand,\u201d there would have been no difficulty, but we think the words \u201clocated and contained\u201d relate solely to the personal property. Thus construed, there is no ambiguity in the policy. The \u2022words \u201cdwelling and addditions\u201d would cover even a detached addition, and that whether detached before or after the issuance of the policy. If there is any ambiguity of doubt as to what risk was intended to be covered by the policy, it must be resolved in favor of the insured. In point of fact, if we may judge by results, it is evident that the risk not only was not increased, but was actually diminished, by the removal; for the fire was confined to the removed kitchen, and, with our common knowledge of the lack of facilities for extinguishing fires on farms, we may assume that a similar fire in the kitchen when it was annexed to the house would have resulted in the destruction of the entire building. There was then no increase of the risk accepted by the defendant, and, this being assumed, we must hold that there was no change of risk, and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
