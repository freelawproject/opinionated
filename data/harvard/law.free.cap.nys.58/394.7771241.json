As to whether or not such a construction was a safe and proper one, under all the facts and circumstances of this case, was a question of fact for the jury to determine. It was properly submitted to the jury, and determined against the defendant. We concur in-their finding. Such a construction, in our judgment, was positively dangerous in this instance. The evidence shows that the defendant\u2019s platform was long enough, so as to enable it to so build its doors that they would not have overlapped, no matter how used by defendant\u2019s patrons. It is certainly under a duty to its patrons to furnish them with reasonably safe means of ingress and egress to and from the platform in question. The fact that such platform was daily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>used by several thousands of persons should have caused them to avoid a defective and dangerous construction, such as this one was. We find no error, and judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
