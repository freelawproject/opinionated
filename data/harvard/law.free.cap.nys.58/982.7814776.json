The defense was a composition deed, executed by the plaintiffs with other creditors, whereby they agreed to accept 25 per cent, of their claims, payment to be made within two months from the date of the instrument, which was \u201cthe-day of August, 1898.\u201d The defendant pleaded tender of 25 per cent, of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and he paid such amount into court. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs for the amount tendered. The particular day in August not being specified, the two months allowed by the agreement did not commence to run until the end of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>month. But the defendant proved no tender until two or three days before Thanksgiving Day. This was not sufficient. The terms of a composition deed must be strictly complied with. Penniman v. Elliott, 27 Barb. 315; Smythe v. Graydon, 29 How. Prac. 11; Warburg v. Wilcox, 2 Hilt. 118. The defendant sought to relieve himself from his default by proof that he did not obtain the signature of his last creditor until January. It was unnecessary that he should obtain its execution by all his creditors to render the deed operative, as no such provision was contained in the instrument. Renard v. Tuller, 4 Bosw. 107; Hall v. Merrill, 5 Bosw. 266; Strickland v. Harger, 16 Hun, 465; Van Bokkelen v. Taylor, 62 N. Y. 105. Hence this delay did not relieve the debtor from his-obligation to pay, within the stipulated time, the creditors who-signed in August.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
