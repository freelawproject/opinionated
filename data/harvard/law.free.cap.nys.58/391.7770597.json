Lee on March 10, 1899. He admits that on and prior to February 2, 1899, he was the president of the defendant corporation, but alleges that on that day an election was held, at which he was not elected to any of the offices specified in subsection 3 of section 431 of the Code, but he fails to state whether any new officers were then elected, or give the names of the newly-elected officers, or that the newly-elected officers ever accepted office or qualified. In our judgment, Lee should have stated the facts which effected a change of officers, and whether the new officers qualified and accepted the offices. He will in law be the president of the corporation until his successor is elected, and has qualified. Wamsley v. H. L. Horton &amp; Co. (Sup.) 23 N. Y. Supp. 85; Palmer v.
