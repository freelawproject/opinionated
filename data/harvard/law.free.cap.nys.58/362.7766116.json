The plaintiffs brought replevin for goods which they had sold and delivered to -one Mandel just previous to Handel\u2019s failure. The goods were found in the possession of the defendant, who claimed to have bought them acting for another person, one Fetterer, who testified that he had purchased and paid value for the goods, in which statement he was corroborated by the testimony of the defendant\u2019s counsel and clerk. This evidence, tending to show property in a stranger and connecting the defendant himself therewith, being in nowise contradicted or discredited, requires the reversal of the judgment. Gerber v.
