The constitution of the association, which was subscribed by the plaintiff\u2019s husband, provided that the sum of $100 should, on the decease of any member of one year\u2019s standing, be paid to the relative who should assume or be responsible for the expenses of his funeral; but this payment was subject to the proviso that \u201cno funeral benefits shall be paid by this union in the case of a member who shall have been three (3) months in arrears, during the six months immediately preceding his death.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s hiisband was in arrears for a period of over three months, which he discharged less than four months before his decease. We think the interpretation of this proviso is clear. It intended that, in case of a member being in arrears for three months, even when he paid those arrears his family should not be entitled to the funeral benefit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>\u2022unless he continued his payments for six months thereafter. It was intended as a- penalty for defaulting in the payments to be made to the association, and is analogous to the provision that the families of those members only who have been such over a year should be entitled to the benefit. It is urged that the provision is unreasonable, and therefore void. In the case of Cartan v. Society, 3 Daly, 20, cited in support of this claim, the defendant was a corporation, and the provision assailed was a by-law. Here the defendant is a voluntary association, and the provision is contained in its constitution, subscribed by the members. That constitution is the contract between the parties, and if its provisions are not illegal, immoral, or contrary to public policy, it must be upheld, whether reasonable or not; for parties have the right to enter into unreasonable nr unwise contracts, so long as such contracts are not illegal, and are fairly made. This is the distinction between the case of a voluntary association and that of a corporation. Kehlenbeck v. Logeman, 10 Daly, 447; Ulmer v. Minister (Sup.) 37 N. Y.
