The pleadings were oral. The defendant offered no testimony upon the trial, and, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s c\u00e1se, made a motion to dismiss the complaint upon the ground, among others, that, the defendant having been shown to be a voluntary unincorporated association, the action should have been brought against the president or treasurer thereof, as required by section 1919 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The motion was denied. The fact being as stated, and it having been further shown that the association had a president and treasurer, the objection was well taken, as long as the action was not instituted against all the members of the association, under section 1923 of the Code. In no event was the ac-. tian well brought against the association as a corporation, nor was service of the summons upon the secretary sufficient. It is not necessary to discuss the other points raised on the appeal. The judgment should be reversed, with costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">Judgment reversed, with costs to appellant.
