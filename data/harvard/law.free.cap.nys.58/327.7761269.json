The only substantial question involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>in the appeal relates to' the admission of testimony at the trial as to plaintiff\u2019s earnings during the years 1895, 1896, and 1897. The c\u00e1se shows that there was evidence as to plaintiff\u2019s condition in life, and as to his business, which was that of a commercial traveler in the wholesale line, and that in consequence of the injuries inflicted upon him he had missed the first fall trip in his business in the year 1896 as a commercial traveler,, and that he suffered pain from the injuries received for about one year. Upon the whole, a proper foundation was laid for the introduction of evidence as to the earnings referred to, and such evidence was properly admitted under the decision of the eo\u00fart of appeals in Ehrgott v. City of New York, 96 N. Y. 264. True, the decision was made with reference to average earnings before the injury, but upon the same principle evidence is admissible as to average earnings for a reasonable subsequent period. Moreover, the evidence as to subsequent average earnings was neither sufficiently objected to nor did it prejudice the defendant, but was beneficial to it, for it showed that during the last six months of 1897 the plaintiff earned more than he had earned before the injury. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">MacLEAN, J., concurring.
