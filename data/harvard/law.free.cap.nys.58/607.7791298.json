The answer, as amended on the trial, amounts to a general denial. The proofs at the trial show that a check of $100 and the note in suit were given by the defendant to the plaintiff, who was the attorney of Dowling &amp; Worms, in payment or settlement of a claim of Dowling &amp; Worms for commissions, on a deal of three houses, against the defendant. The payment or settlement of that claim constituted a good consideration for said note. The attorney had the right and the power to make the settlement, and Dowling &amp; Worms, his clients, were bound by it; and the defendant, Austin, was protected thereby, and released from all liability on said claim on behalf of Dowling &amp; Worms. Dowling &amp; Worms had to look to their attorney, the plaintiff, for their money. There is no merit in any one of the defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
