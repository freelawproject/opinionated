The ground upon which it was vacated was that the papers upon which it was issued failed to show that the testimony of the witnesses was material to the party making the application. In Re Garvey, 33 App. Div. 135, 53 N. Y. Supp. 476, we held that a witness who was required to appear for examination under the foreign commission had no standing to question the sufficiency of the proof upon which the subpoena was allowed; that, so far as he was concerned, the statute was complied with when the commission was presented to a justice of the supreme court, with an affidavit which satisfied him that the witness\u2019 testimony was material to a party to the action in which the evidence was to be taken. We think that, applying this rule, the affidavit of Charles M. Hough justified the court in issuing the subpoena. That affidavit expressly states \u201cthat said witnesses are necessary and material witnesses.\u201d Then it states what is expected to be proved by them. It is apparent that the facts sought to be proved by the witnesses, as stated in this affidavit, would be material upon the question of the validity of a claim to the fund in controversy; and the parties having claims upon the fund in the hands of the plaintiff, where the action is brought to distribute the fund, are entitled to show that a demand upon which a party makes a claim against that fund is not a valid claim. As was said in Re Garvey, supra: \u201cIt certainly is not for the witness to criticise the proof of materiality, as defective or insufficient. That should be left to the parties to the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the subpoena denied, with $10 costs, to be paid by the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
