It was held by this court in Rieser v. Charles F. Parker &amp; Co., 57 N. Y. Supp. 745, that the provisions of the Greater New York Charter attempting to confer upon the municipal court of the city of New York jurisdiction of actions in which the defendant is a nonresident of the state are unconstitutional, and the case at bar is covered by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-24\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
