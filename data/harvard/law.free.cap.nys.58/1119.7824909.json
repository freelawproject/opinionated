Both the plaintiff and her husband testified that, at the time of the sale, they examined the contents of the restaurant, and made an inventory of the articles, and that the articles now claimed by the plaintiff were there. The defendant testified to exactly the contrary, saying that the articles claimed were not there, and were never there. His counsel asked, \u2018Did they [the plaintiff and her husband] examine the contents of the restaurant?\u201d and he answered, \u201cHo, sir;\u201d and thereafter, \u201cDid they take any inventory of the restaurant? A. Ho, sir.\u201d To these questions the plaintiff objected that they were entirely immaterial, for the reason that the bill of sale speaks for itself. The court sustained the objection, and struck out the answers, \u201cin view of the fact that the action is not for breach of warranty,\u201d with exception to the defendant. Heither the reason of. the objection stated by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, nor that given by the learned justice,\" for his ruling, was tenable. The evidence to be elicited by the question was in direct contradiction of a material incident testified to by the plaintiff and her husband, and would have been of importance for the consideration of the jury. For such error the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
