Chase, on the 24th day of July, 1898, at the town of Duanesburgh, in this Schenectady county, being the first day of the week, commonly called \u2018Sunday,\u2019 between the hours of 3 o\u2019clock p. m. and 8 o\u2019clock p. m., on the said 24th day of July, 1898, unlawfully and willfully, and with unlawful and willful intent, at the hotel or saloon known as the \u2018American Hotel,\u2019 in the village of Quaker Street, this county, of which hotel said George W. Chase was proprietor, did unlawfully and knowingly, and with unlawful and willful intent, and without authority or license therefor, have open and unlocked the door or entrance from the street, highway, yard, hallway, room, or adjoining rooms where liquors are sold, or kept for sale, during the hours wiien the sale of liquors was forbidden, and by admitting to such room or rooms persons not members of his family, for purposes forbidden by such statute in such case made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-12\">\u201cWm.

Subdivisions 1, 2, 3, and 4 of section 34 prescribe specific punishment upon conviction for various violations therein forbidden. Subdivision 2 provides that \u201cany corporation, association, copartnership, or person --- * * who shall violate the provisions of this act by trafficking in liquors contrary to the provisions of sections 11, 22, 23, 24, 30, or 31, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction therefor shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment,\u201d etc. We do not think that the act of keeping a door open or unlocked prohibited in subdivision G- of section 31 is trafficking in liquor, within the meaning of the act. \u201cTrafficking in liquor\u201d is defined in section 2 of the act, as amended in 1897, as embracing various kinds of sale and distribution of liquor, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cTrafficking in liquor, within the meaning- o\u00a3 this act, is: (1) A sale of less than five gallons of liquor; or, (2) a sale of five wine gallons or more of liquor, in which less than five gallons of any one kind and quality is included; or, &lt;3J a sale of five wine gallons or more of liquor, any portion of which is intended or permitted to he drunk on the premises where sold; or, (4) a sale of five wine gallons or more of liquor, when the liquor so sold is delivered or agreed to he delivered in a less quantity than five wine gallons at one time; or, (5) the distribution of liquor by, between or on behalf of members of a corporation, association, or co-partnership to a member thereof or to others in quantities less than five gallons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Section 11 prescribes the taxes imposed upon the business of trafficking in liquors, specifying it as \u201cupon the business of trafficking in liquors to be drunk upon the premises where sold\u201d (subdivision 1); \u201cin quantities less than five wine gallons, no part of which shall be drunk on the premises\u201d (subdivision 2); \u201cby a duly-licensed pharmacist\u201d (subdivision 3); \u201cupon any car, steamboat, or vessel\u201d (subdivision 4). Section 22 imposes \u201crestrictions upon the traffic in liquors in connection with other business.\u201d Section 23 enumerates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u201cpersons who shall not traffic in liquors.\u201d Section 24 enumerates places \u201cin which traffic in liquor shall not be permitted.\u201d Section 30 enumerates \u201cpersons to whom liquor shall not be sold or given.\u201d Section 31 prohibits the sale of liquor except under the license and terms and conditions specified in the act, and then makes it unlawful to sell, offer, or expose for sale, or give away, any liquor on Sunday, within specified hours, on specified days, within certain places, and within certain other places, and adulterated liquors, and to certain persons. Thus, the various methods of trafficking in liquor are catalogued,\u2014 those which are permissible, if licensed, as well as those which are absolutely forbidden, and those whose permissibility or prohibition depends upon time, place, circumstance, or persons. Then follows subdivision G-, upon which this indictment is based. This is not a specification of some kind of traffic in liquor, like the previous provisions and like some following it, but a regulation of the place or room or rooms where \u201cthe liquors are sold or kept for sale during the hours when the sale of liquors is forbidden.\u201d Manifestly, it was the intent of the legislature to punish, not only the prohibited traffic in liquors, but in addition, and as an aid to the suppression of such prohibited traffic, to prohibit certain acts which would, if permitted, lead to the violation of the prohibition of the traffic itself; somewhat in the nature of acts prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons,\u2014 the carrying is no offense per se, but, if not carried, the weapons will not so often become the means of offense. The keeping of the door of a saloon open or unlocked opens the door to the traffic, but is not the traffic itself. The opportunity for offense is prohibited, in order to make the prohibition of the offense itself more effective. It may or may not be intended as an offer to traffic, and therefore we cannot, in a criminal- case, in the absence of further statement, hold that it is a charge of an offer to traffic in liquors or to sell them. The punishment of the unlawful traffic is, as a general rule, specified,\u2014perhaps it'is in all cases, we are not now called upon to look for omitted cases, \u2014and prosecution by indictment is prescribed. The punishment of thfe particular collateral offense specified in subdivision Gr of section 31 is not particularly prescribed, and therefore it is one of the misdemeanors mentioned in subdivision 5 of section 34, and hence within the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of special sessions, as provided in subdivision 2 of section 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The judgment of the county court is affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
