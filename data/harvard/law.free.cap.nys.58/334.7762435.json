The order to show cause and the summons were returnable on the same day.. On that day the motion was heard and denied in an order granting \u201cleave to renew said motion, on proper papers, within four days.\u201d On the same day, the justice permitted the plaintiff to take an inquest, and from the judgment entered thereon comes the present appeal, which, however, rests neither upon error of law nor upon error of fact. Burkhard v. Smith, 19 Misc. Rep. 31, 42 N. Y. Supp. 638. As the motion to interplead is to be made before answer (section 820, Code Civ. Proc.), it may be that the leave to renew within four days was practically a deferment of the return day of the summons, and that the taking of the inquest was, at least, premature, and therefore a ground for opening the default; but the application therefor should be made to the justice, under section 1367, Consol. Act, which provides for an appeal to this tribunal. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
