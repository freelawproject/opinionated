It is admitted, I take it from an examination of this case, that the plaintiff was a broker, in the ordinary sense, and that the parties to whom these bonds were offered for sale, and who accepted the same, were able, competent, and willing to purchase. The only question here is, what was the plaintiff, in law, to do in this transaction, in order that he might be entitled to his commission? We think, the employment being admitted, that, upon the production of a person or party ready, willing, and. able to buy at the terms and arrangements as specified by the vendor, this is enough to entitle the broker to his commission, even if the sale is not consummated, provided this does not occur thereafter by reason of any act of the broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">While the case is not as clearly presented as might be, we think it is sufficient, the question being disposed of, to affirm this judgment. It is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
