By section 3, tit. 18, of the charter of the city of Brooklyn, it was provided that a contract should be valid and binding only when the comptroller should certify \u201cthat the means required to make the payments under such contract are provided and applicable thereto,\u201d and the Greater New York charter (section 149) contains substantially the same provision. In answer to the relator\u2019s application, the comptroller makes affidavit that he has not funds applicable to the contract sufficient to pay for the. work to be done thereunder. It would be unprofitable to state the details of the respondent\u2019s affidavit, tending to show that he is without funds, or those of the relator\u2019s petition, on which is based the claim that there either is or should be sufficient money on hand to pay for the work. The main contention of the relator is that, when the contract was executed, the comptroller of the city of Brooklyn had sufficient funds, and should, therefore, have certified the contract; that the comptroller of the city of New York is, in law, the successor of the comptroller of the late city of Brooklyn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>and therefore the duty undischarged by his predecessor remains obligatory on the present comptroller. We concede the relation between the comptroller of the late city of Brooklyn and the present comptroller of the city of New York. We also concede that the comptrollership is a continuous office. People v. Comptroller, 77 N. Y. 45. The respondent is not asked to certify that at any previous time there were funds applicable to the payment of the relator\u2019s contract (a certificate of that character would be valueless), but to certify to the fact as it exists when the certificate is made. A mandamus will not lie to compel a public officer to certify to an untruth. People v. Fowler, 55 N. Y. 252. The denials contained in the affidavit of the respondent are not illusory or evasive, and the facts tending to show the truth of such denials are positively stated. The allegation of the respondent\u2019s affidavit, whether by way of denial or of affirmation of new matter, must be taken as true, on an application for a writ of peremptory mandamus. If the relator wishes to take issue on the facts, he must apply for the alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements, with leave to the relator to take an alternative writ of mandamus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
