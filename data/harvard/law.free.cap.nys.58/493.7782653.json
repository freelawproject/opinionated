Section 2240 provides (subdivision 2) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cIf the person, to whom the precept is directed, resides in the city or town in which the property is situated, but is absent from his dwelling-house, service may be made by delivering a copy thereof at his dwelling-house, to a person of suitable age and discretion, who resides there; or, if no such person can, with reasonable diligence, be found there, upon whom to make service, then by delivering a copy of the precept, at the property sought- to be recovered, either to some person of suitable age and discretion residing there, or if no such person can be found there, to any person of suitable age and discretion employed there,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Section 2235 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the petition in matters of this character shall state the \u201cfacts which, according to the provisions of this title, authorize the application by the petitioner.\u201d The facts necessary to be stated in this case were that \u201ca demand for the rent has been made, or at least three days\u2019 notice in writing, requiring, in the alternative, the payment of the rent, or the possession of the premises, has been served, in behalf of the person entitled to the rent, upon the person owing it, as prescribed in this title for the service of a precept.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2231, subd. 2. These facts are all set out.in the petition, with the exception that it is not stated that the service, in the absence of the tenant, was made upon \u201ca person of suitable age and discretion, who resides there.\u201d The petition says that the service was made by delivering a copy of the notice to \u201ca person in charge of said premises, said tenant being absent therefrom at the time.\u201d A person might be in charge of the premis\u00e9s, and yet not be of suitable age and discretion, \"nor yet a resident of such premises, neither is there anything in the petition to show that the person who was served with this notice was of \u201csuitable age and discretion employed -there.\u201d This being a summary proceeding, it is necessary that the provisions of the statute should be strictly followed. It was necessary that the court should be informed by the petition that the notice had been served in the manner pointed out by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure; and, this fact not appearing, the court failed to gain jurisdiction, and the proceeding is fatally defective. People v. Keteltas, 12 Hun, 67. The order appealed from should be reversed, being void for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Order reversed, and proceedings dismissed, with costs.
