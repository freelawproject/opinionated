J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7y\">On October 21, 1896, defendants purchased from plaintiffs certain skins, valued at $4,263.94. These goods were delivered to defendants prior to October 28th. On the last-mentioned date, defendants wrote to plaintiffs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">\u201cOctober 28th, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-16\">\u201cMess. Wm. Amer &amp; Co.\u2014Gentlemen: We had to go over the entire lot of stock again to find the 10 dozen which were short, and we found that you were right, but, on examination of the entire lot of stock, we find a vast difference. The writer examined every bundle himself, and found 82 bundles which were not. So we returned you this day, via New Line, those bundles, as inclosed memorandum, which are not. Kindly credit same to our account, and oblige, 1 Folk &amp; Fritz.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">The memorandum inclosed itemized the goods returned, and fixed their value at $1,038.41. On October 29th plaintiff wrote defendants as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-18\">Messrs. Folk &amp; Fritz, 44 Warren Street, New York, N. Y.\u2014Gentlemen: Your letter received, with regard to stock sold. In the first place, it was a straight sale. You looked through all the goods, and bought them, with the remark, T will take the lot, and chance.\u2019 The stock sent was the same you looked at, and the lot you refused we still have on hand. Now, as this was a straight sale, we refuse to receive the goods. Your next-door neighbor wanted the goods, and claimed them, even threatening us with a lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-19\">\u201cYours, truly, Wm. Amer &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-20\">On November 13th the defendants again wrote plaintiffs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-21\">\u201cMess. Wm. Amer &amp; Co.: Inclosed find check for $3,880.38, in settlement of bill of October 21st, less merchandise returned and discount. Please acknowledge receipt, and oblige, Folk &amp; Fritz.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-22\">A check for $3,880.38, dated November 13th, payable to the order of plaintiffs, was inclosed. This check was immediately cashed by plaintiffs upon its receipt. These facts clearly establish that on November 14th, when plaintiffs cashed the check just referred to, they were aware of the fact that the. defendants contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>said check was regarded by them as fully paying the debt due for the goods delivered, and that they (defendants) would recognize no further indebtedness as due on said account. The defendants so certainly understood the situation. If it was not agreeable to them, it was their duty to return' the check, and refuse to accept the settlement so offered; but, having accepted the check, it follows, as a matter of law, that the claim in question is canceled and fully paid. The use of the check was ipso facto an acceptance of the condition. The trial justice was right in dismissing the complaint. There were no facts to submit to the jury. See Hills v. Sommer. 53 Hun, 392, 6 N. Y. Supp. 469; Fuller v. Kemp, 138 N. Y. 231, 33 N. E. 1034; and Nassoiy v. Tomlinson, 148 N. Y. 326, 42 N. E. 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The exceptions must be overruled, and judgment ordered for defendants, with costs and disbursements in the court below and in this court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
