Phillips, which claim subsequently became vested in the plaintiff alone. Phillips died in 1890, and the defendant\u2019s intestate was appointed administrator of his estate. In 1893, in settlement of the claim against her husband's estate, Mrs. Phillips gave the plaintiff a promissory note for $1,000, signed, \u201cAnnie M. Phillips, Admx.\u201d Payments were made on the claim from time to time, and renewal notes, generally at three months, were given for the balance due; all signed in the form stated. Mrs. Phillips died on March 17, 1896, at which time the plaintiff held her note, given on this account, for $383.91. For the amount of this note the plaintiff presented a claim against the estate of the deceased, which was referred under the statute. The note signed by Mrs. Phillips constituted her individual obligation, the addition \u201cAdmx.\u201d being simply descriptio person\u00ae, and not limiting her liability. Schmittler v. Simon, 101N. T. 554, 5 N. E. 452. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that, even assuming the note to be the individual obligation of the deceased, it did not bind her personally, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the only consideration for it was the claim against the estate of her husband; and in support of this proposition he relies on the case of Bank v. Topping, 9 Wend. 273. It was there said: \u201cAdministrators who have given a note for the debt of their intestate cannot be made personally responsible for the payment thereof, unless it be shown that they have assets, or that forbearance was the consideration of the note.\u201d But, a new trial having been had in. the case cited, it was a second time before the supreme court. 13 Wend. 557. It was then held that the execution of the note \u201cwas prima facie evidence of assets in the hands of the defendants sufficient to pay it, but it was competent for them to rebut that presumption by showing affirmatively that they had no assets.\u201d In the present case no proof has been given to show that the assets of the estate of the husband were insufficient to discharge the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and therefore, under the decision on the second hearing of the Topping Case, the defense has entirely failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
