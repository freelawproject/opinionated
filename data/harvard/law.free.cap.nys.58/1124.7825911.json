The plaintiff\u2019s case rests upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which, taken as true, only shows that he was employed by certain persons engaged in an enterprise which was afterwards incorporated, and that after the incorporation he continued at work, receiving at the first the same salary as before, and then less. There was no evidence of the adoption by the defendant corporation of the contract. The plaintiff himself said there was notMng said by the officers about his contract. \u201cThere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>was nothing said at all about my contract. That was too well understood.\u201d The evidence was insufficient to sustain the judgment in favor of the plaintiff, who was merely continued as employ\u00e9 in the business after the incorporation, under an implied promise to pay, without any agreement as to the time. Morrison v. Railroad Co., 52 Barb. 173; Tucker v. Iron Co., 53 Hun, 139, 6 N. Y. Supp. 134; Mason v. Secor, 76 Hun, 178, 27 N. Y. Supp. 570. In my opinion, the judgment should be reversed, and the complaint, verification, and testimony of the plaintiff submitted to the grand jury of the county. All concur;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
