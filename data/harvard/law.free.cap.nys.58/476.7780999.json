The action has since been tried) upon the theory indicated by this court (Naumer v. Gray, 28 App. Div. 529, 51 N. Y. Supp. 222), resulting in a judgment for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tiff of $100. The appellant urges that the motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint should have been granted upon the ground that the action for divorce was still pending. In view of the fact that the defendant, in answering, alleges under oath that \u201cthe action for separation referred to in plaintiff\u2019s complaint was terminated by the voluntary return of the said May G. Gray to the defendant, before trial of the action, and before any order of the court had granted counsel fees and alimony therein,\u201d it is not quite clear what right the defendant now has to urge this point. The complaint, upon the trial of the action, was amended to conform to the allegation of the defendant upon this point; and while it is true that there had been no formal discontinuance of the action, the voluntary return of the plaintiff in the action for separation to the defendant effectually put an end to the litigation, and the plaintiff in this action had no remedy through the ordinary channels. To have granted this motion would have closed the doors to this plaintiff, as the action for a separation had passed beyond the control of the court, at least for the purpose of compensating this plaintiff. We are of opinion that the plaintiff, having a cause of action, had a right to go to the jury upon the question of the value of his services. The fact that the trial' court before whom the motion for alimony and counsel fees was made reached the conclusion that the plaintiff' should have $75 is not controlling in this case, the order of the cpurt never having been entered, and the action having been terminated by the plaintiff in the separation action. The question was submitted to the jury by the learned justice presiding at the trial without exception on the part of the defendant, counsel for the latter having announced to the court that: \u201cI will not call any witnesses for the defense. On the case, and on the fact that Judge Osborne considered $75 sufficient, I am willing to go to the jury.\u201d It is too late now to urge that the measure of compensation was fixed by the order of Judge Osborne, that order not having been entered, and the plaintiff never having had any benefit from that order. It hardly seems necessary to consider this case further. The plaintiff was clearly entitled to some compen- \u25a0 sation, and, as there is nothing tO' indicate that the jury has failed in the discharge of its duty in the premises, the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
