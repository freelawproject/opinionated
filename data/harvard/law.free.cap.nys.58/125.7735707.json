In the first place, all the plaintiffs do not join in it. The action is brought by Van Vleck and the sheriff of the county. The money, if recovered, is to be paid to the sheriff, and he alon\u00e9 has any beneficial interest in it. An appeal taken by one plaintiff, in which the other does not join, does not present any substantial question to be considered. Besides that, it does not appear that any exception was taken to the decision of the referee. Where such is the case, the court has no power to review any question which might have been raised upon the trial. Thompson v. Schwartz (March, 1899), 57 N. Y. Supp. 416. But, even if there were power in the court to review exceptions taken upon the trial in the absence of an exception to the decision, no exceptions were taken upon the trial of this case, and therefore there was nothing to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">The judgment, therefore, must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
