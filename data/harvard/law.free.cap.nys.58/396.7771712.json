A plaintiff suing upon a negotiable note or bill purchased before maturity is presumed, in the first instance, to be a bona fide holder. But when the maker has shown that the note was obtained from him under duress, or that he was defrauded of it, the plaintiff will then be required to show under what circumstances, and for what value, he became the holder.\u201d Bank v. Green, 43 N. Y. 298. The burden of proof was improperly placed on defendant to show that the plaintiff was not a bona fide holder, and a holder without notice of the fraud. If the defendant had been permitted to show that the check had been procured from him by fraud upon the part of the payee, the presumption that the plaintiff was a bona fide holder would no longer obtain, and plaintiff could not recover without showing that he had received the check without knowledge of the fraud, and had paid value therefor. Grant v. Walsh, 145 N. Y. 503, 40 N. E. 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">For the error complained of, the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
