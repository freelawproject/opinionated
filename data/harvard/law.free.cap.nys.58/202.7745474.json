Where a summons is served with a notice, but no verified complaint served, the practice here is to apply to the special term for leave to enter judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ment. We think that it was not necessary in this instance to appoint a referee to determine the amount of damages. The clerk may do so. Nor do we think that costs should have been allowed. Therefore the order must be modified by striking therefrom the costs allowed; also the provision appointing a referee; and, as so modified, the order is affirmed, without costs or. disbursements to either party. Of course, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney will credit, on the issuance of the execution, the amount received herein by his client.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
