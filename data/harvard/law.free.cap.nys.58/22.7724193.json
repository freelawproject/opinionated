The jury having rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant on the return of the verdict moved, under section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to set aside the verdict as against the weight of the evidence. The motion, having been adjourned from time to time, was argued, and a decision rendered in favor of the defendant, granting the application. Prior to this decision, however, the justice entered judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">By chapter 748 of the Laws of 1896, the justice was empowered to entertain the motion, and set aside the verdict of the jury. By the terms of that act, the moving party is required, within five days after the rendition of the verdict, to give not less than five nor more than eight days\u2019 notice of his motion. The defendant\u2019s action was therefore irregular in bringing his motion on immediately upon the return of the verdict. This irregularity was waived by the failure of the plaintiff to take any objection to the defendant\u2019s practice, and by proceeding to argue the motion on the merits. Nor could the defendant be prejudiced by the justice entering judgment prior to the decision of the motion, as the defendant\u2019s application was one of right. On the merits, we are of the opinion that the decision of the justice was correct, or at least not so plainly erroneous as to justify our interference. As the verdict was set aside for the error of the jury in deciding the question of fact, and not for any error of law, the application should have been granted only upon terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Order modified so as to require, as a condition for setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial, that the defendant within five days pay the plaintiff the sum of $10 costs, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
