We are satisfied that the whole was fairly submitted, and that the jury properly found for the defendant. Unless it appears that the jury, in arriving at their determination, did so under prejudice, passion, or malice, their verdict will not be disturbed, and particularly so where the case points that it is one clearly for their determination. This case was one, and we find no error, and therefore affirm the judgment, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">SCHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
