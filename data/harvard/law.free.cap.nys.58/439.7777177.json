'</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">The instrument which is thus alleged to have been forged reads as follows, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-16\">\u201cAdvertising Contract</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akm1\">\u201cNo. 346. Rochester, 8\u20146\u20141897.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-18\">\u201cTo the Publishers: You are hereby authorized to insert our advertisement for the Financial &amp; Trade Guide for 1897-8 Edition, to occupy the space of i/4 page Adv. and 3 heading, for which we agree to pay the sum of ($15)* fifteen dollars. Name, Co-operative Foundry Co. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-19\">\u201cBy whom signed, McCarthy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-20\">\u201cAddress,-.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-21\">\u2014On publication of advertisement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-22\">\u201cNot subject to cancellation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-23\">\u201cThe publisher will not be bound by any agreement not stipulated hereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-24\">And, as it purports upon its face to be an obligation of the party whose name is attached thereto to pay the sum of $15, there can be no question but that it falls within the enumeration of instruments which may be the subject of forgery contained in section 513 of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>. It was held in the court below that the first and third counts of the indictment, standing by themselves, set forth all the essential elements of the crime charged, and we do not understand that proposition to be seriously controverted upon this appeal; but it is contended that the second count is insufficient in its averments, and that for that reason the entire indictment must fall. A careful examination of this count leads us to the conclusion that the learned county judge must either have misapprehended the language employed by the pleader to set forth the offense charged, or .else that he has failed to give to it the interpretation it is entitled to receive. If we correctly apprehend the import of the count, it does not charge the defendants with having altered or added to a genuine instrument in such a manner as to change its character; but it simply avers that the defendants, having in their possession, custody, and control a certain paper containing the genuine signature of the Co-operative Foundry Company, a more particular description of. which was unknown to the grand jury, \u201con the day and year last aforesaid, at the city and county aforesaid, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously did falsely make, forge, and counterfeit the above set forth instrument above the said genuine and authorized signature' of the said Cooperative Foundry Company,\u201d etc. Where a person in possession of a piece of paper. containing the genuine signature of another fraudulently writes a promissory note over that signature, it will doubtless be conceded that he is just as guilty of the crime of forgery as though he had unlawfully signed that person\u2019s name to the note. Pen. Code, \u00a7 511; People v. Graham, 6 Parker, Cr. R. 135; Mann v. People, 15 Hun, 155-162. And that is substantially what the second count of this indictment charges the defendants with having done; for it avers that they had a genuine signature in their possession, and then, in the very language of the statute, charges them with having forged so much of the instrument as appears above that signature. The office of an indictment is to apprise the defendant of the nature of the crime with the commission of which he stands charged, and if it avers the offense as the statute defines it, stating all the circumstances which constitute such offense, it fulfills its office, and answers every requirement. Phelps v. People, 72 N. Y. 334. As the second point of ihe indictment under consideration, in our opinion, does set forth the offense within the rule just stated, we think it should have been permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Judgment reversed, demurrer overruled, and the case remitted to the county court of Monroe county, with directions to proceed under section 547 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
