Kenney v. Association, 89 Hun, 190, 35 N. Y. Supp. 8. The circumstances, however, are such that it seems to me the county court might well have permitted that to have been done nunc pro tune, under section 3047 of the Code of Civil Brocedure. It has, however, declined to do so. It was a matter resting in its discretion, and there is a long line of authorities holding that we have not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>right to review that exercise of discretion. Tucker v. Pfau, 70 Hun, 59, 23 N. Y. Supp. 953; Wright v. Chase, 77 Hun, 90, 28 N. Y. Supp. 310; Myers v. Riley, 36 Hun, 20; Thomas v. Keeler, 52 Hun, 318, 5 N. Y. Supp. 359; Bantleon v. Meier, 81 Hun, 162, 30 N. Y. Supp. 706; People v. Young, 92 Hun, 373-377, 36 N. Y. Supp. 547; Paper Co. v. Szerlip, 9 App. Div. 206, 41 N. Y. Supp. 376; Judson v. O\u2019Connell (Sup.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 92; Sexton v. Bennett (Sup.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 437. The only case that I have been able to find where the discretion of the county court was overruled upon- appeal was the case of Gutbrecht v. Railroad Co., 28 Hun, 497. . There would seem to be no alternative, therefore, but to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
