The affidavit of the plaintiff shows that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $311.66 over and above all payments, counterclaims, and set-offs, and plaintiff begs leave to refer to his complaint, which is made a part of affidavit; and these, with the affidavit of Henry D. Schutte, all read together, spell out a complete cause of action. It is sufficient if the proof has a legal tendency to make out, in all its parts, a case for the issuing of an attachment. The complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and, although based upon information and belief, the material allegations are sworn to by one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s assignors in this action, in an affidavit attached to the papers upon which the attachment was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The order appealed irom should be affirmed, with costs.
