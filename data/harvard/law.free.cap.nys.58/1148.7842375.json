They believed that, if plaintiffs had been allowed to perform their contract with defendants, they would have lost money, instead of making a profit. They evidently wished to prevent defendants from recovering two bills of costs herein. Therefore they rendered a verdict for plaintiffs for nominal damages, supposing that such a verdict would so save plaintiffs. A verdict in favor of defendants would have been justified by the evidence. After a careful perusal of the verdict, we think that no injustice was done plaintiffs. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
