Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and the clerk of the court taxed, among other things, as costs, two trial fees; issues of fact, $60; fees on two trials, $4; entering two judgments, $2. Thereafter the defendant made several motions, and ultimately succeeded in obtaining an order for retaxation, which disallows one trial, one entry of judgment, and one clerk\u2019s fee, predicating the reduction upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>construction by the court of the terms of its order opening and vacating the judgment first entered. The terms imposed by the court for favor granted were within its discretion, and, unless abused or mistakenly exercised, beyond interference. Flannery v. James, 18 Wkly. Dig. 557. In granting the motion for retaxation, the court recorded its construction of its former order, saying, \u201cIt was intended by me that that amount should be payment of costs of the inquest and disbursements that the plaintiff had incurred, or was entitled to, up to the date of that decision.\u201d The terms to be imposed upon opening the default were within the discretion of the court at special term, and, if its order had provided that the plaintiff was not to have the costs and taxable disbursements of the first trial (for an inquest is a trial), the defendant would have been relieved from their payment, and they could not have been taxed by the clerk. The defendant\u2019s counsel having failed to obtain an order containing the terms which he claims it should have had, it cannot now be amended by an expression, two years later, of what the learned justice intended, for such unexpressed intention can form no part of the action of the court. The taxation by the clerk of the trial fee and disbursements of the first trial was correct, and should not have been stricken out. The order of the general term of the city court should be reversed, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Order reversed; with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
