It appeared by the petition that the tenant had defaulted \u201cfor three months\u2019 rent of the said premises before described, to wit, \u201cfrom the 1st day of January, 1899, to the 1st day of April, 1899.\u201d Upon the trial the petitioner proved that January, February, and March were the three months referred to. The petition having been verified on the 29th of March, when the April rent was not yet due, a motion was made to amend the petition by substituting the word \u201cMarch\u201d for the word \u201cApril.\u201d The tenant claims that the allowance of the amendment was reversible error. That is a mistaken view. Every fact necessary to confer jurisdiction is clearly set out in the petition. While the court is without power to amend in a particular essential to confer jurisdiction, yet that, having once attached, the liberal provisions of the Code should apply to all subsequent proceedings. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 723,-3347, subd. 6; Fox v. Held, 24 Misc. Rep. 184, 52 N. Y. Supp. 724. Especially is this true where, as in this instance, the amendment involves the rectification of a mere clerical error. The default in the payment of rent is correctly alleged to have covered a period of three months from a specified date, which clearly terminated on March 1st, but which, by misstatement, was made to read \u201cApril 1st.\u201d It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>be straining the principles of construction to declare incurable by amendment such an obvious and immaterial oversight. The other objections urged being frivolous, the order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Order affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
