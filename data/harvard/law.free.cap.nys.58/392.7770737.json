Such written agreement was duly filed; thus constructive notice of the facts therein recited was given defendant. Actual notice was also given him of said mistake. Thus it appears that, prior to the assignment to the defendant, he had full knowledge of the fact that his assignor had no right or title to the replevied goods, and that they were not covered by the mortgage. How, then, can he have an interest in them? The jury, in deciding against him, were compelled to do so by force of the evidence submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
