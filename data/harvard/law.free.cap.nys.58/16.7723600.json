The shipper attached a bill of lading and original invoice to a draft, which was accepted by plaintiffs. The consignees received the bill of lading and original invoice from plaintiffs, and issued to them a letter of lien, wherein they agreed to hold the merchandise or its proceeds as the property of plaintiffs until they were repaid the amount of the acceptance. The consignees thereafter refused to accept the goods because the quality was. inferior. Plaintiffs thereafter paid the draft, and took possession of the goods under them letter of lien, and caused the same to be sold after notice to the consignees; failing to realize as much as they had paid out on the draft. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiffs were under no obligation to examine the merchandise before accepting the draft, and hence they might recover the deficiency from the consignees. .</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b34-16\">3.

It was accepted by the drawees, and paid by them at maturity on the 24th of May. Accompanying the draft was a bill of lading and certified invoice for 1,000 bags of beans shipped from Fiume by the steamship City, and deliverable to the order of Strauss in the city of New York. The bill was'indorsed by Strauss in blank. The beans arrived in New York in due course, and were rejected by the defendants, to whom they had been sold by Strauss, on the ground of their alleged inferior quality. They were subsequently sold at public auction by the plaintiffs, after proper demand upon, and notice to, the defendants, and failed to realize the amount of the draft by the sum of $1,036.05. This action is brought to recover that deficiency. The contract for the purchase and sale of \u201c1,000 bags 1892 crop, white medium beans, free from colored, as per sample,\u201d was made between the defendants and Strauss (acting by the Western Agency, Limited) on the 27th of January, 1893. On the same day the defendants made the following application to the plaintiffs: \u201cPlease issue a letter of credit for account of ourselves, in favor of Anton Strauss, of Budapest, for any sums not exceeding about eight hundred twenty-five pounds Stlg. Drafts to be drawn at three months\u2019 date from date of bill of lading against shipment by steamer or steamers to New York, direct or otherwise, for invoice cost of 1,000 bags beans. Bills to be accompanied by full set, in due course, of blank indorsed bills of lading to order, and original invoice certified by the U. S. consulate.\u201d In pursuance of this request, the plaintiffs issued a letter of credit in favor of Strauss, and he availed himself thereof, upon shipment of the beans, by drawing the draft with blank indorsed bill of lading and certified invoice attached, to which reference has been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">I can find nothing in the case to support the claim that it was the understanding or intention that the plaintiffs, in granting the letter of credit, should stand merely as guarantors of bills drawn by Strauss on the defendants. The letter of credit is not in evidence. Presumably its terms conform to the defendants\u2019 letter of request which, as I understand it, was for a credit in favor of Strauss, under which he might draw upon the plaintiffs at three months from date of bill of lading for invoice cost of beans shipped by steamer to New York. The details stated in the letter of request\u2014that is, the due dates of the drafts, the documents to accompany the drafts, the goods to be shipped, the mode and the date of shipment, the date when the credit should expire\u2014were evidently to guide the plaintiffs in determining whether drafts drawn by Strauss should be accepted by them for the defendants\u2019 account. That the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance was authorized and in accordance with the defendants\u2019 understanding seems to be put beyond dispute by a paper executed by the defendants on the 15th of March. The beans had then arrived in New York, and the defendants executed and delivered what is called a \u201cletter of lien,\u201d in which they acknowledged the receipt from the plaintiffs of the invoice and bill of lading for the 1,000 bags of beans shipped by Strauss and consigned to the plaintiffs, \u201cas per their letter of credit B, No. 501,\u201d for \u00a3825, dated February 9, 1893, and which states as follows: \u201cAnd the said shipper having drawn upon Messrs. Benecke, Souchay &amp; Co. for \u00a3813. 7s. 8d. on the said invoice, we agree to hold the above-mentioned goods, or the proceeds thereof, as the property of Messrs. Benecke, Souchay &amp; Co., until we have covered the amount drawn for by proper remittances.\u201d This, it seems to me, was a plain approval by the defendants of the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of the draft drawn by Strauss, and a plain admission that both draft and acceptance were regular and in accordance with the terms of the defendants\u2019 letter of request. It is admitted that the acceptance was paid by the plaintiffs at its maturity. These facts constitute a good cause of action against the defendants. I cannot see that the fact that the beans sent forward by Strauss were inferior in quality to those contracted for at all affects the question of the defendants\u2019 liability for moneys paid by the plaintiffs in discharge of an obligation assumed by them at the defendants\u2019, request. The kind or quality of the beans to be shipped by Strauss was not defined in the defendants\u2019 letter asking for a credit, and no duty devolved upon the plaintiffs to ascertain, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>fore accepting, whether the goods shipped corresponded in quality with the goods ordered..</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">A second defense is that the plaintiffs negligently\u2019 and unduly delayed the sale of the beans after the defendants gave notice of their rejection, thereby causing the loss for which they now seek to recover. The facts are as follows: The beans arrived at New York about the 15th of March, and on that day the bill of lading and invoice were delivered to the defendants, who entered the beans in the custom house, and, after inspecting them, informed Weber \u201cthat we would not take the beans until we made him some proposition on them.\u201d On the 14th of April the defendants gave Weber written notice that \u201cwe positively refuse to receive these beans, and will not honor the draft when due,\u201d and inclosed an order on the delivery clerk of the steamer City directing the delivery of the beans to Weber. This order was returned by Weber to the defendants on the following day. Thereupon the defendants wrote the Western Agency that the beans \u201care at the disposal of Mr. Anton Strauss, the Western Agency, Limited, and Messrs. Benecke, Souchay &amp; Co., and we advise you to take care of them.\u201d The acceptance was paid by the plaintiffs on the 24th of May. On the 7th of June, Weber, for the plaintiffs, demanded of defendants the immediate delivery of the beans, in response to which the defendants returned the delivery order. On the 27th of June, \u201cafter proper demand and notice\u201d (as it is stipulated), the beans were sold at public auction, producing the net sum of $2,979.80. The undisputed testimony of the defendant Haebier is that there was a considerable decline in the value of beans in the New York market during May and June, 1893, but the extent of the decline does .not satisfactorily appear. Haebler\u2019s opinion is that in the month of April the beans in question were worth the amount of the Strauss draft.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">The plaintiffs insist, first, that they were not at liberty to sell the beans until after the payment of their acceptance, because until then they had no cause of action against the defendants. In this they are, I think, correct. No cause of action arose against the defendants by their notice on April 14th that they would not pay the draft. In Burtis v. Thompson, 42 N. Y. 250, it was held that an action for the breach of a promise to marry will lie at once upon a positive refusal to perform, although the time specified for the performance has not arrived. The court said: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s counsel insists that, if this is the law to be applied in the present case, it will follow that the maker of a note due at a future day will make himself liable to an action instantly by declaring to the holder that he will never pay it. This conclusion does not at all follow. In the case of such a note the holder is in no respect damnified until payment is withheld after it is due. Until this happens, no legal right of his has been violated by the maker.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-7\">The plaintiffs further insist that they were not bound to use any greater diligence than they did use in making sale of the beans. I think that they are right in this also. They were at liberty, without a sale, to enforce the liability of the defendants for the full amount of the acceptance. A creditor, unless he has agreed to do so, is never bound to realize upon collateral which he holds before proceeding against the debtor to recover the debt. De Cordova v. Barnum, 130 N. Y. 617, 29 N. E. 1099; People v. E. Remington &amp; Sons, 121 N. Y. 328, 24 N. E. 793. If he chooses to reduce the amount of the debt before suit by a sale of the collateral, it is for him to determine when the sale shall be made; reasonable notice being given to the debtor. The rule that governs as between a vendor and a vendee who refuses to accept goods bought by him is not applicable to such a case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-8\">Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for the amount claimed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b36-9\">\u25a0Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
