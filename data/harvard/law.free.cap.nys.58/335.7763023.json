The only ground upon which a reversal of the judgment is asked for is that it is against the clear weight of evidence. The plaintiff was the only witness sworn in her own behalf, and her testimony is wholly unsupported. She testifies that while a passenger upon one of the defendant\u2019s cars, and when near Twenty-Sixth street, she signaled the conductor to stop the car; that the car stopped; that she had arisen from her seat, and was about to take hold of the brass rail of the car, to aid her in alighting, when the car suddenly started; and that she thereupon' was thrown violently to the ground. This testimony was positively and unequivocally contradicted, not only by the conductor of the car, but also by two disinterested witnesses. The latter testified that they sat in the car, near the plaintiff; that the plaintiff gave the signal to stop the car; that while it was still in motion, and although told by the conductor to wait until the car stopped, she got off before it came to a stop, and by reason thereof w.as thrown to the ground. In view of this testimony, and the probabilities fairly deducible from all the facts and circumstances shown by the record, the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">MacLEAN, J., concurring. LEVENTRITT, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
