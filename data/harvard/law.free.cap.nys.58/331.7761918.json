Allen, which the defendant had agreed to erect. A written contract was entered into between the parties to this action, and therein reference was made to the plans and specifications according to which all the work, including the plastering, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>to be done. No reference was, however, made to the general contract between the defendant and Mrs. Allen. It was admitted that the balance had not been paid, the defendant maintaining his right- to withhold it. on account of plaintiff\u2019s defective work. Upon hearing the evidence on the issue thus raised, the court found\" against the defendant; and his just conclusion, involving merely the solution of a conflict of evidence, we cannot disturb. Conroy v. Allen, 23 Misc. Rep. 125, 50 N. Y. Supp. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The appellant, however, predicates error on the exclusion of the general contract between him and Mrs. Allen. But none of its conditions were imported into the plaintiff\u2019s plastering contract, which was an entirely independent agreement. Further, examination of the excluded contract shows that none of its provisions affect the rights of the parties. The judgment should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">FREEDMAN, P.

As subcontractor, the plaintiff agreed to plaster the house \u201caccording to plans and specifications,\u201d which required all mortar to be applied in the best manner, well-troweled, leaving the surface straight and true; to repair and make good all blemishes and damages to plastering by other workmen; and that the entire work, in all its parts, be done in a workmanlike and substantial manner, and to be approved by the architect. This he did not do, by his own admissions. According to the evidence, the contractor (the defendant) had to throw off, or did throw off, for the plaintiff\u2019s remiss- \u2022 ness, more than the amount claimed herein, upon the settlement with the owner, whose son testified that the wind came through behind the window casings because of the bad plastering, and that its unsightliness was to be covered by wall papering. It was not a compliance with his covenant to repair to offer to repair the blemishes and damages after the owner had moved into her house, in which the plaintiff-had left his work to be a discomfort and an eyesore. Nor should he, after so acquitting himself, be allowed compensation as for work done in all its parts in a workmanlike and substantial manner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
