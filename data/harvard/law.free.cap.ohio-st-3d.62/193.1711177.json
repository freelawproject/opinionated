For the reasons to follow, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The commission\u2019s order granting permanent total disability compensation did not discuss claimant\u2019s retirement nor did it explain what nonmedical factors persuaded the commission to find claimant permanently and totally disabled. While the latter deficiency generally warrants a return to the commission for an amended order, in certain situations it does not. <em>State, ex rel. Galion Mfg. Div., Dresser Industries, Inc., v. Haygood </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 38, 573 N.E.2d 60, carved a limited exception to the general rule set forth in <em>State, ex rel. Noll, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, in the case of a claimant whose award of permanent total disability compensation was supported by medical evidence of permanent total impairment. In <em>Haygood </em>we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201c * * * While permanent total disability benefits may never be denied solely on the basis of medical evidence without consideration of <em>Stephenson [State, ex rel. Stephenson, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, nonmedical disability] factors contained in the record, there are some situations where an <em>award </em>of such benefits may properly be based on medical factors alone. It would serve no practical purpose for the commission to consider nonmedical factors in extreme situations where medical factors alone preclude sustained remunerative employment, since nonmedical factors will not render the claimant any more or less physically able to work.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>60 Ohio St.3d at 40, 573 N.E.2d at 62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In the present case, the commission based its finding of permanent total disability, in part, on Dr. De La Iglesia\u2019s report. His comprehensive narrative concluded that claimant was medically incapable of sustained remunerative employment due to the allowed conditions. <em>Haygood </em>thus controls, making an amended order pursuant to <em>Noll </em>unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\"><em>Haygood, </em>however, does not negate the need to return this cause to the commission on other grounds. Claimant retired from Chrysler on December 31,1982 \u2014 two years before his initial application for permanent total disability compensation and nearly four and one-half years before his current one. We have not previously addressed the effect of retirement upon a claimant\u2019s eligibility for permanent total disability compensation, having limited earlier discussions to a retired claimant\u2019s eligibility for impaired earning capacity or temporary total disability compensation. Upon review, we find that the principles espoused with regard to the latter are equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u201cTemporary total disability\u201d is the inability to return to the former position of employment due to industrial injury. <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, syllabus. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>claimant who retires for reasons unrelated to his or her injury cannot receive temporary total disability compensation since it is the claimant\u2019s own action, not the industrial injury, that prevents a return to the former position of employment. <em>State, ex rel. Rockwell Internatl., v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 531 N.E.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cPermanent total disability,\u201d on the other hand, is the state of being unfit for sustained remunerative employment due to industrial injury. <em>State, ex rel. Jennings, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E.2d 420. \u201cSustained remunerative employment\u201d necessarily encompasses \u201cformer position of employment.\u201d It would therefore be inconsistent to state that retirement would not prevent an award of permanent total disability benefits but would preclude temporary total disability compensation, particularly when the criterion for temporary total disability is much less demanding than that of permanent total disability. Accordingly, the principles set forth in <em>Rockwell </em>control.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In the case before us, the absence of reference to claimant\u2019s retirement in the commission\u2019s award of permanent total disability compensation suggests that the commission did not address the voluntariness of his departure. We thus affirm the appellate court\u2019s decision directing the commission to vacate its order awarding permanent total disability compensation and to conduct further proceedings on claimant\u2019s entitlement to permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The commission\u2019s lump-sum payment order merits similar treatment. R.C. 4123.64(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cThe industrial commission, under special circumstances, and when the same is deemed advisable for the purpose of rendering the injured or disabled workman financial relief or for the purpose of furthering his rehabilitation, may commute payments of compensation or benefits to one or more lump sum payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Fees charged by a claimant\u2019s attorney for services rendered in securing workers\u2019 compensation benefits may also be commuted to lump-sum payment. R.C. 4123.06. The court below found that the commission abused its discretion by ordering Chrysler, without prior notice of a hearing, to advance attorney fees to claimant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Neither R.C. 4123.64(A) nor 4123.06 expressly mandates a hearing on lump-sum payment applications. However, Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-10(B)(2)(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">\u201cAn application from a claimant for such purpose is to be accompanied by a certificate, executed by the attorney, listing in detail the services rendered, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>fees received prior to the filing of the application for services in obtaining the award under which the advancement to pay the fee is requested * * *. A copy of the certificate is to be furnished to the claimant by the commission or a staff hearing officer <em>prior to the hearing on the application. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The emphasized language implies that a hearing is contemplated, despite the lack of an express directive. We thus find that the commission abused its discretion in making a lump-sum advancement of attorney fees without notice of a hearing to Chrysler.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b375-9\">H.
