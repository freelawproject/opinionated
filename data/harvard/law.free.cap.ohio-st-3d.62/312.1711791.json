For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and reinstate the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">In order to prevail on his Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment, Guirlinger had to demonstrate that he had a meritorious defense, that his motion was timely, and that he was entitled to relief on one of the five grounds stated in the rule. <em>GTE Automatic Electric, Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 150, 1 O.O.3d 86, 88, 351 N.E.2d 113, 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">The defense Guirlinger raised was available at common law, see <em>Goodman v. Goodman </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 223, 187 N.E. 777, and has been codified in the Uniform Commercial Code, UCC 3-606, R.C. 1303.72(A)(2), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">\u201c(A) The holder discharges any party to the instrument to the extent that without such party\u2019s consent the holder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201c(2) unjustifiably impairs any collateral for the instrument given by or on behalf of the party or any person against whom he has a right of recourse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As the appellate court correctly noted, the promissory notes are negotiable instruments under R.C. 1303.03(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the separate guarantee agreements at issue here are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">However, because the promissory note anticipates and defines some of the rights of the suretyship, the Revised Code provisions do apply to the guarantee agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Buckeye Federal cites several cases supporting the proposition that a creditor must be in possession of the collateral in order to be responsible for its unjustified impairment, including <em>BancOhio Natl. Bank v. Troyer </em>(Mar. 18, 1987), Tuscarawas App. No. 86AP060043, unreported, 1987 WL 9097; <em>Commercial Credit Equip. Corp. v. Hatton </em>(N.D.Tex.1977), 429 F.Supp. 997; <em>Moore v. Luxor (North America) Corp. </em>(1988), 294 Ark. 326, 742 S.W.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">We find that the most equitable and commonsense approach is to require the party in possession of the collateral to carry the responsibility to conserve it. Public policy will not be served by requiring a creditor out of possession to supervise and, probably, second-guess the debtor or the guarantor in its handling of the collateral in its rightful possession. We hold, therefore, that a creditor not in possession of collateral cannot be liable for its unjustified impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The trial court was correct in holding that Buckeye Federal had no duty to monitor the collateral that Cardinal was equipped to administer.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The issue of waiver was raised before the trial court. Because the trial court ruled that the defense of impairment of collateral was not available, it found it unnecessary to address the question of whether Guirlinger had waived the defense. The court of appeals declined to consider the issue, although it was presented. We find that the court of appeals could have determined the issue of waiver, and we may also do so. <em>Lehman v. Haynam </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 595, 59 0.0. 5, 133 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We find that Guirlinger did not allege sufficient facts in his motion to give rise to the claimed defense, and further find that the guarantee agreement speaks for itself on the issue of impairment of collateral. The record contains an ample basis for the trial court\u2019s overruling of the motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The guarantee agreements expressly state that Guirlinger waived his right to any defense based upon Buckeye Federal\u2019s delay in asserting its rights under the notes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>In <em>Fed. Land Bank of Louisville v. Taggart </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 8, 31 OBR 6, 508 N.E.2d 152, this court held at paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201cA decrease in the value of collateral resulting from the lender\u2019s extension of the time for making payment on a promissory note cannot, even if proven, be the basis for an impairment of collateral discharge when, by advance consent, the accommodation party agreed to allow such extensions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsbJ\">Although <em>Taggart </em>dealt with an accommodation maker, not, as here, a guarantor, <em>Taggart\u2019s </em>rationale is equally persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In <em>Taggart, </em>the promissory note stated expressly that the accommodation party waived \u201call legal diligence in enforcing collection\u201d and expressly reserved to the holder the right to extend the time of payment. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 31 OBR at 7, 508 N.E.2d at 154. By contrast, in the instant case, Guirlinger\u2019s defense is predicated upon the proposition that Buckeye Federal knew or should have known that the fair market value of the property was decreasing. Guirlinger, the chief executive officer of Cardinal, the corporation that administered the property, was in a far better position to know that at the time he was expressly requesting extension of time, the value of the property was diminishing. We hold that Guirlinger cannot claim foul in Buckeye Federal\u2019s actions when he himself had not merely acquiesced in but actively encouraged those actions. In <em>Taggart </em>the accommodation maker had consented in advance and was not even aware of a reamortization agreement, and yet was not allowed a discharge on the basis of impairment of collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Guirlinger asserts that Buckeye Federal slept on its rights in not calling the loan some two years before it did, even though the payments on the note were then current. R.C. 1303.72(A)(2) refers to unjustifiable impairment of the collateral. A holder is justified in not calling a note, even if he is able to do so, when the payments on that note are current. Further, Guirlinger was presumably aware of the steady deterioration of the property when he requested an extension of time, and so he must be estopped from asserting that Buckeye Federal\u2019s prior delay was unjustified in light of his express request for further delay. The uncontroverted facts in the record gave rise to the conclusion that, even if Guirlinger did not actually induce the delay that produced his alleged damages, he ratified it. Particularly given the relationship of the debtors, the managers of the property, and the guarantor here, we find that both law and equity require the conclusion that Guirlinger waived the defense of impairment of collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment on the court of appeals, and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-5\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Wright and Patton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b496-6\">Sweeney and Douglas, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b496-7\">John T.
