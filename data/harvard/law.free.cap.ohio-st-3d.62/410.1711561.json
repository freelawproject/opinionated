None of appellant\u2019s claimed errors shows a lack of jurisdiction by the trial court, which is required for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus when a petitioner is incarcerated pursuant to a judgment of a court of record. R.C. 2725.05. His claim that R.C. 2929.71 did not become effective until after the crime was committed is wrong. R.C. 2929.71 first went into effect on January 5, 1983. (139 Ohio Laws, Part I, 523, 569-570.) The indictment alleges that the attempted murder occurred on or about February 7, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Appellant\u2019s alleged errors concerning independent examiners and tampering with evidence are procedural matters. \u201cHabeas corpus does not reach procedural errors either in the original trial or attempted appeal therefrom.\u201d <em>Parker v.
