Am. Sub. H.B. No. 417 (135 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1690, 1700).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The statute did not define \u201cgood cause.\u201d The court of appeals felt that its decision in <em>State, ex rel. Fellers, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 247, 248, 9 OBR 421, 422, 459 N.E.2d 605, 606, furnished an acceptable definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3zc\">\u201c \u2018Good cause\u2019 is demonstrated when, at the time of making the first election, subsequently occurring circumstances were not foreseeable. If a person suffers what appears to be a minor injury, at the time of the election, but the injury subsequently causes major problems to the relator\u2019s health and earning power, such a change of circumstances constitutes \u2018good cause\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 4123.57, for a change of election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Relator says he showed good cause because, as a result of the injury, he developed a substantial disability which prevented him from working, and in order to obtain additional compensation a change of election was required. Goodyear, urging the contrary, contends that if relator is prevented from continuing work because of his injury, it is a natural consequence of the development of that injury and this \u201cnatural progression\u201d cannot be characterized as an unforeseen subsequently occurring circumstance which causes major problems as to the relator\u2019s health and earning power as set forth in <em>Fellers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">A review of the facts may resolve the dispute. Relator\u2019s injury of November 28, 1973, was allowed for neck and low back injuries. He received a five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>percent permanent partial disability award for that disability in 1977 (\u201ca minor injury\u201d). The allowance of the claim was expanded in 1982 to thirty-five percent permanent partial disability upon recognition of additional conditions of fibromyositis of low back and neck and lumbrosacral discogenic disease (\u201cmajor problems\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">We recently discussed, in <em>State, ex rel. Simpson, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 162, 580 N.E.2d 779, when to permit a change of election as contemplated by former R.C. 4123.57(A): \u201cupon approval of the industrial commission for good cause shown.\u201d Ultimately, the change should be approved only upon \u201cproof of actual impairment of earning capacity.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Johnson, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 384, 533 N.E.2d 775, syllabus. See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Bouchonville, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 50, 52, 521 N.E.2d 773, 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">As we stated at fn. 1 in <em>Simpson, supra, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 164, 580 N.E.2d at 781, a two-pronged test, incorporating elements of <em>Fellers, supra, </em>and <em>Johnson, supra, </em>will indicate whether \u201cgood cause\u201d warranting the change of election has been established. To establish good cause, a claimant must prove (1) unforeseen changed circumstances subsequent to the initial election, and (2) actual impaired earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The claimant has met the first criterion. However, the second has not been addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Accordingly, a limited writ will issue directing the commission to determine from a review of its records whether claimant has suffered an actual impaired earning capacity as a result of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-11\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b559-12\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b559-13\">Holmes and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b559-14\">Holmes, J., dissenting. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b559-15\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
