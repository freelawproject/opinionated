Fisher, on contestor Paul E. Pfeifer\u2019s petition contesting the results of the 1990 election for Ohio Attorney General. <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Attorney General of Ohio </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 103, 569 N.E.2d 447. As the prevailing party, contestee has now filed a motion for costs, seeking reimbursement for various expenses, including attorney fees, that he incurred in opposing contestor\u2019s petition. Contestor has opposed the motion for costs and has filed an application for return of the $10,000 bond he filed with his petition pursuant to R.C. 3515.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">Contestee seeks costs pursuant to R.C. 3515.09, Civ.R. 54(D), and R.C. 2323.51. However, we agree with contestor\u2019s argument that Civ.R. 54(D) and R.C. 2323.51 are not applicable to election contests. The procedures prescribed for election contests are specific and exclusive. <em>State, ex rel. Daoust, v. Smith </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 199, 200, 6 O.O.3d 457, 458, 371 N.E.2d 536, 537; <em>Foraker v. Perry Twp. Rural School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 243, 4 O.O. 264, 199 N.E. 74, paragraph two of the syllabus. Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>exclusivity of the election contest procedures in R.C. 3515.08 <em>et seq., </em>we cannot afford relief except as provided therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We decline to adopt contestee\u2019s contention that R.C. 3515.11 incorporates Civ.R. 54(D) and R.C. 2323.51 into election contest proceedings. R.C. 3515.11 states in part that \u201c[t]he proceedings at the trial of the contest of an election shall be similar to those in judicial proceedings, in so far as practicable * * Although this provision incorporates into election contest proceedings some rules and statutes governing civil actions, such incorporation is limited to those rules and statutes that would pertain \u201cat the trial of the contest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">Prior orders in this contest have recognized the applicability of Civ.R. 41(B)(2) and 26(B)(3), each of which can be said to apply \u201cat the trial of the contest.\u201d Civ.R. 41(B)(2) provides for dismissal of a case after the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief, clearly a procedure to be used \u201cat * * * trial.\u201d See <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Attorney General of Ohio </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 604, 567 N.E.2d 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Civ.R. 26(B)(3) governs the discoverability of an opposing party\u2019s work product. See <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Attorney General of Ohio </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 614, 567 N.E.2d 243. Although it is apparent that the main purpose of Civ.R. 26(B)(3) is to govern pretrial discovery, the rule also had relevance to this \u201ctrial of the contest.\u201d Since testimony in the trial of a contest in this court must be taken by deposition, see R.C. 3515.16, we may refer to those provisions of the Civil Rules pertinent to depositions, including Civ.R. 26(B)(3). See, also, Civ.R. 45(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Unlike Civ.R. 41(B)(2) and 26(B)(3), Civ.R. 54(D) and R.C. 2323.51 do not set forth procedures that could be applied \u201cat * * * trial\u201d in this contest. Civ.R. 54(D) provides for an award of costs \u201cto the prevailing party,\u201d which assumes that any necessary trial to determine the \u201cprevailing party\u201d has previously been conducted. R.C. 2323.51 provides for an award of attorney fees to a party harmed by \u201cfrivolous conduct\u201d in a civil action. Such an award, however, can be made only \u201cat any time prior to the commencement of the trial in a civil action or within twenty-one days after the entry of judgment in a civil action.\u201d R.C. 2323.51(B)(1). R.C. 2323.51 is not a procedure to be used at a trial. Since Civ.R. 54(D) and R.C. 2323.51 would not apply \u201cat the trial of the contest,\u201d R.C. 3515.11 does not incorporate their provisions into election contest proceedings. We lack statutory authority to apply Civ.R. 54(D) or R.C. 2323.51 to this election contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Contestee\u2019s remaining basis for his motion for costs and attorney fees is R.C. 3515.09. That statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">\u201cSaid [contest] petition shall be accompanied by a bond with surety to be approved by the clerk of the appropriate court in a sum sufficient, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>determined by him, to pay all the costs of the contest. The contestor and the person whose right to the nomination or election to such office is being contested, to be known as the contestee, shall be liable to the officers and witnesses for the costs made by them respectively; but if the results of the nomination or election are confirmed or the petition is dismissed or the prosecution fails, judgment shall be rendered against the contestor for the costs; and if the judgment is against the contestee or if the results of the nomination or election are set aside, the county shall pay the costs as other election expenses are paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Despite contestor\u2019s arguments regarding the interpretation of R.C. 3515.09, we conclude that contestor is liable to the contestee for \u201call the costs of the contest.\u201d The purpose of the statutory bond is to provide security for such costs. If the contestor were not liable for \u201call the costs of the contest,\u201d there would be no reason for the statute to require that he post a bond securing such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Furthermore, there is little doubt that the contestor may be held liable to the contestee. The statute specifically states that \u201cjudgment shall be rendered against the contestor for the costs.\u201d As the other party to the contest, the contestee is the natural beneficiary of such a judgment. Inasmuch as the statute makes the contestee initially liable for certain costs attributable to \u201cofficers and witnesses,\u201d a judgment against the contestor should at least shift those costs from the contestee to the contestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Contestee claims that a number of items are recoverable as part of \u201call the costs of the contest.\u201d Those items include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">(1) attorney fees in defending against the contest petition and in complying with this court\u2019s ballot security order;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">(2) attorney travel expenses to attend depositions and to comply with the ballot security order;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">(3) expenses to copy materials for submission to this court, contestor\u2019s counsel, and others;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">(4) expenses to deliver materials to this court, contestor\u2019s counsel, and others;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">(5) court reporter charges;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">(6) videotape technician charges for attending, recording, editing, and filing two videotaped depositions;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">(7) witnesses\u2019 fees and mileage;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">(8) computerized legal research expenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">(9) expert witness fees; and</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>(10) long distance telephone and facsimile transmission charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">An order of costs for items 5, 6, and 7 may be justified. As stated previously, R.C. 3515.09 requires that the contestor reimburse the contestee for \u201ccosts\u201d attributable to \u201cofficers and witnesses.\u201d R.C. 3515.12 in turn states that \u201cthe fees of officers and witnesses shall be the same as are provided in other cases, in so far as the nature of the proceedings admits.\u201d Read together, these provisions allow an award of costs for fees that are paid to officers and witnesses, such fees being \u201cthe same as are provided in other cases * * *.\u201d The court reporter and videotape technician charges are allowable because those persons were \u201cofficers\u201d for purposes of the deposition testimony submitted to this court for resolution of the contest. Since these officers\u2019 fees shall be the same as in other cases, we look to the statute governing deposition fees generally for guidance. R.C. 2319.27. Similarly, the fees and mileage of witnesses are allowable as costs. We find the standard for fees and mileage in civil cases to be most pertinent. R.C. 2335.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Beyond these categories of costs, however, we find no authority to award the litigation expenses listed in items 1 through 4 and 8 through 10 as part of \u201call the costs of the contest.\u201d Even with the word \u201call\u201d placed before \u201ccosts\u201d in R.C. 3515.09, the key word in the statute is \u201ccosts.\u201d <em>Benda v. Fana </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 259, 263, 39 O.O.2d 410, 413, 227 N.E.2d 197, 201 (\u201ccosts\u201d and \u201call costs\u201d synonymous). \u201cCosts are generally defined as the <em>statutory </em>fees to which officers, witnesses, jurors, and others are entitled for their services in an action and which the statutes authorize to be taxed and included in the judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Commrs. of Franklin Cty., v. Guilbert </em>(1907), 77 Ohio St. 333, 338, 83 N.E. 80, 81. In other words, a particular litigation expense will not qualify as part of \u201ccosts\u201d unless it is \u201cfixed and taxable according to statute.\u201d <em>Benda, supra, </em>10 Ohio St.2d at 263, 39 O.O.2d at 413, 227 N.E.2d at 201. \u201c \u2018[C]osts\u2019 are not synonymous with [litigation] expenses unless expressly made so by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, absent express statutory provision, attorney fees are not recoverable as part of \u201ccosts.\u201d <em>Muze v. Mayfield </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 173, 573 N.E.2d 1078. Contestee has not cited any pertinent statute that allows us to tax as costs the various litigation expenses he has incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Contestee\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 259, 18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101, is misplaced. In <em>Moore, </em>this court liberally construed R.C. 4123.519 as allowing a workers\u2019 compensation claimant to recover, as part of the \u201ccost of any legal proceedings,\u201d an expert witness\u2019s fee for testifying in a deposition. The court concluded that R.C. 4123.95 mandated such a liberal construction. However, we have no similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>statutory mandate in the election contest statutes to construe R.C. 3515.09 liberally. Indeed, a rule of strict construction applies to election contest procedures. <em>Jenkins v. Hughes </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 186, 190, 47 O.O.127, 129, 105 N.E.2d 58, 60; <em>McCall v. Eastern Local School Disk Bd. of Edn. </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 50, 52, 8 O.O.2d 11, 12, 157 N.E.2d 351, 353. But, see, <em>Hitt v. Tressler </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 174, 176, 4 OBR 453, 454, 447 N.E.2d 1299, 1302 (\u201chypertechnical\u201d reading of signature requirement in R.C. 3515.09 avoided). The <em>Moore </em>holding therefore has no application to this case or any case arising outside the workers\u2019 compensation context. See <em>Moore, supra, </em>18 Ohio St.3d at 262, 18 OBR at 316-317, 480 N.E.2d at 1103 (distinguishing <em>Benda v. Fana, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Finally, we note contestee\u2019s policy argument that he should be reimbursed for his litigation expenses because he has \u201c[i]n a very real sense\u201d defended \u201cthe public\u2019s [election] procedures while he defended] his own interests.\u201d Contestee argues that contestor asserted numerous contentions without any factual basis, without any reasonable prefiling investigation, and without any effort to demonstrate the relation to the specific election race and willingness to withdraw them when they proved totally groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We do not accept the premise that contestee, alone, was defending the interests of the public in this election contest. A contestor who raises arguable claims, as contestor did here, also serves the public interest by raising and litigating important questions concerning the public\u2019s vote. In view of the clear violation of the law by the ballot rotation in Mahoning County, the closeness of the election, the very short time for filing a contest of election petition under R.C. 3515.09, and the dearth of controlling law on the issues presented in contestor\u2019s complaint, we conclude that contestor\u2019s complaint and pursuit of the issues therein could in no way be deemed to be frivolous. The complaint, even after depositions were filed, presented justiciable issues that were properly before this court for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In any event, policy arguments cannot transform the phrase \u201call the costs of the contest\u201d into a broad license to grant contestee reimbursement for most or all his litigation expenses. \u201cCosts\u201d do not extend so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Finding only limited support for contestee\u2019s motion for costs, we hereby order that the contestee shall file within fifteen days of the date of this order such affidavits as are necessary to substantiate the amount of costs he incurred regarding items 5, 6, and 7. Contestor shall have ten days after such filing to dispute the amounts claimed by contestee by filing counter-affidavits. Until we assess the amount of costs owed, contestor\u2019s application for return of bond will be held in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Order accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Holmes, Wright and H.

I concur in the allowance of the contestee\u2019s costs as to items 5, 6, and 7. However, I must respectfully dissent from the disallowance of contestee\u2019s costs as to items 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">I totally agree with the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[djespite contestor's arguments regarding the interpretation of R.C. 3515.09, we conclude that contestor is liable to the contestee for 'all the costs of the contest.\u2019 \u201d The phrase \u201call the costs of the contest\u201d is not ambiguous. It clearly means all costs. None of these costs would have been incurred if the contest had not been filed. Accordingly, I would require the contestor to reimburse contestee for items 1 through 10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>judicial authority to prevent them from representing themselves, and <em>State, ex rel.

These showings are sufficient to withstand dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) (failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) and, in the absence of any response from appellee, they are a sufficient basis for granting appellants relief pursuant to our plenary authority in extraordinary actions. Accordingly, the court of appeals\u2019 judgment is reversed and the writ of prohibition is allowed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
