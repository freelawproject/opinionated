The court of appeals dismissed appellant\u2019s mandamus complaint before he filed his \u201capplication\u201d to add a claim of habeas corpus. Therefore, there were no multiple claims to be considered under Civ.R. 54(B) (proposition of law No. 1), and the court did not err by not considering his habeas corpus claim because the case was decided before he filed it (proposition of law No. 3). Moreover, appellant has not yet proved his case; therefore, the court of appeals did not err by not granting the relief he seeks (proposition of law No. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Proposition of law No. 2 is more problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">The court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of the case is clearly based on certain attachments to appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss filed below. These include an amended complaint for a writ of mandamus filed in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County in November 1988, which named appellee, among others, as a respondent and also raised the issues raised in this case; the appellate court\u2019s judgment entry of December 19, 1988 dismissing the complaint; and various other complaints filed in 1988 and 1989 in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, the Hamilton County Municipal Court, and the Ohio Court of Claims seeking injunctive relief and damages against appellee and others. All the attachments, with varying degrees of specificity, refer to the unlawful revocation of appellant\u2019s parole in 1978 after his maximum sentence had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>However, the court of appeals permitted appellee to file the untimely motion to dismiss without a motion asserting excusable neglect or proof of same, both of which are required by Civ.R. 6(B)(2) and (D). Moreover, it based its decision on matters outside the pleadings \u2014 the aforementioned attachment to the motion to dismiss. Therefore, it treated the case as if it were converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. In such a case, Civ.R. 12(B) requires that the court consider \u201conly such matters outside the pleadings as are specifically enumerated in Rule 56.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C) enumerates \u201cpleading[s], depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact.\u201d The complaints and judgment entries, submitted without affidavit, are none of these. Accordingly, the case is not a proper one for summary judgment. See <em>Biskupich v. Westbay Manor Nursing Home </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 220, 515 N.E.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Nor was the case subject to dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B). Civ.R. 8(C) designates <em>res judicata </em>an affirmative defense. Civ.R. 12(B) enumerates defenses that may be raised by motion and does not mention <em>res judicata. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the defense of <em>res judicata </em>may not be raised by motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B). See <em>Johnson v. Linder </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 412, 14 OBR 531, 471 N.E.2d 815. In that case, the Court of Appeals for Allen County held that the affirmative defense of <em>res judicata </em>could be raised by motion for summary judgment. We concur. However, as previously discussed, appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was not proper for conversion into a motion for summary judgment and was not so converted.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s motions for attorney fees and \u201capplication for petition for a writ of habeas corpus, ad prosequendum, and ad subjiciendum\u201d filed in this court are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b287-9\">Resnick, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\">. We do not imply that the court must grant appellant\u2019s motion for default judgment. See Civ.R. 55(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
