We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">During the assessment period, R.C. 5739.33 stated that if any corporation required to file sales tax returns and remit sales tax failed to do so \u201c * * * any of its officers, or employees having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Am.Sub.H.B.

However, the BTA affirmed the commissioner and found appellant liable, based upon <em>Spithogianis v. Limbach </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 55, 559 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In reviewing an appeal from a decision of the BTA we do not weigh the evidence.

The facts presented in the record indicate that the BTA decision was reasonable and lawful and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
