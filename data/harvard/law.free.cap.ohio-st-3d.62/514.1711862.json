R.C. 2901.04. Furthermore, words and phrases in Ohio statutes are to be construed \u201caccording to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d R.C. 1.42. It is with these principles in mind that we analyze R.C. 2919.22(A) and its applicability to the situation at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">R.C. 2919.22(A) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">\u201cNo person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">As stated in <em>State v. Sammons </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 460, 12 O.O.3d 384, 391 N.E.2d 713, the apparent intention of the drafters of this section \u201cwas to punish a breach of statutory duty, when the breach results in a substantial risk to the health or safety of a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 12 O.O.3d at 386, 391 N.E.2d at 715. For the following reasons, we conclude that R.C. 2919.22(A) does not create a statutory duty which is breached when a parent uses cocaine prior to the child\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">A review of the terms \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d within their common usage supports the conclusion that R.C. 2919.22(A) does not proscribe the conduct at issue. Under the common usage of the term \u201cparent,\u201d Gray did not become a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>parent until the birth of the child. Furthermore, the child did not become a \u201cchild\u201d within the contemplation of the statute until she was born. As stated in <em>State v. Anders </em>(June 19, 1989), Stark Cty. C.P. No. JU 68459, unreported, at 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201cThe plain interpretation of the word is mother or father of a child who has been born alive. The word parent comes from the Latin <em>parere, </em>meaning to give birth. In addition, a plain reading of the statute indicates that this parent-child relationship must be in existence at the time of the creation of the substantial risk of harm. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The statutory and regulatory scheme in Ohio strongly indicates that where the concerns of the unborn are at issue, the legislature and administrative bodies have referred to the unborn specifically.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In <em>Reyes v. Superior Court of San Bernadino Cty. </em>(1977), 75 Cal.App.3d 214, 141 Cal.Rptr. 912, the California Court of Appeals addressed the issue of whether a heroin-addicted mother could be prosecuted under the California child endangering law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for using heroin prior to the birth of her child. The court found that the word \u201cchild\u201d as used in the California child endangering statute \u201cwas not intended to refer to an unborn child and that petitioner\u2019s prenatal conduct does not constitute felonious child endangering within contemplation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 141 Cal.Rptr. at 913. In similar fashion, the Michigan Court of Appeals, in addressing a charge of delivery of cocaine based on the movement of cocaine through the umbilical cord after birth, held the relation of the statute to the facts was so tenuous that the court could not infer that the legislature intended it to apply absent unmistakable evidence of legislative intent. <em>People v. Hardy </em>(1991), 188 Mich.App. 305, 307-312, 469 N.W.2d 50, 52-53. Other states\u2019 courts have reached similar conclusions. See <em>Commonwealth v. Pellegrini </em>(Mass.Sup.Ct. Oct. 15, 1990), Plymouth No. 87970, unreported (mother charged with distributing cocaine to a person under eighteen); <em>State v. Gethers </em>(Fla.App.1991), 585 So.2d 1140 (mother charged with aggravated child abuse); and <em>State v. Inzar </em>(N.C.Sup. Ct. April 9, 1989), Robeson Cty. Nos. 90CRS6960 and 90CRS6961, unreported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>(mother charged with assault with a controlled substance and delivery of a controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The state relies primarily upon our previous holding in <em>State v. Dickinson </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 65, 57 O.O.2d 255, 275 N.E.2d 599, in contending that Gray can be properly prosecuted under R.C. 2919.22(A). In <em>Dickinson, </em>this court held that an essential element of R.C. 4511.181 (vehicular homicide) is that the person whose life was taken has been born alive, <em>id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, and that a viable fetus is not a person within the meaning of R.C. 4511.181, <em>id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The state contends by analogy that prenatal conduct can be punished under R.C. 2919.22(A) if the child endangered is subsequently born alive. We do not find the state\u2019s argument in this regard to be persuasive. As stated in <em>Anders, supra, </em>at 6-7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201c * * * [T]he <em>Dickinson </em>case must be distinguished on the following points. Firstly, 2919.22(A), unlike the homicide statutes, indicates that a certain relationship must be in existence between the defendant and the victim at the time the act of creating a substantial risk is done. The homicide statutes indicate that \u2018no person\u2019 shall commit the acts as described. Nowhere in 2919.22(A) does it indicate that mothers-to-be or pregnant women are in the specific group of people at whom the statute is directed. Secondly, 2919.22(A) does not contain proof of harm as an element of the crime. Obviously, a crucial element of the homicide statutes is proof that someone died. In 2919.22(A), the creation of the risk is the criminal conduct. Thirdly, California\u2019s ruling on a homicide statute, <em>Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County, </em>(1970) [2 Cal.3d 619, 87 Cal.Rptr. 481,] 470 P.2d 617 was identical to Ohio\u2019s ruling in <em>Dickinson, </em>at the time the California court in <em>Reyes </em>ruled on the inapplicability of the California child endangering statute to a situation where the accused was a heroin addict whose twins were born addicted to heroin. Fourthly, the unique relationship between a pregnant woman and the developing fetus requires a careful look at what activities will be deemed criminal, and at what point during the pregnancy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Based upon these obvious distinctions, we do not believe that the reasoning of <em>Dickinson </em>is applicable in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">\u201cThe Legislature is an appropriate forum to discuss public policy, as well as the complexity of prenatal drug use, its effect upon an infant, and its criminalization.\u201d <em>Hardy, supra, </em>188 Mich.App. at 310, 469 N.W.2d at 53. The Ohio Legislature currently has before it S.B. No. 82, which, if passed, would create the new crime of prenatal child neglect<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to handle situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>such as those at bar. \u201c \u2018A court should not place a tenuous construction on [a] statute to address a problem to which the legislative attention is readily directed and which it can readily resolve if in its judgment it is an appropriate subject of legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hardy, </em>quoting <em>People v. Gilbert </em>(1982), 414 Mich. 191, 212-213, 324 N.W.2d 834, 844. \u201c[I]f a legally cognizable duty on the part of pregnant women to their developing fetuses is to be recognized, the decision must come from the legislature only after thorough investigation, study and debate.\u201d <em>Stallman v. Youngquist </em>(1988), 125 Ill.2d 267, 280, 126 Ill.Dec. 60, 66, 531 N.E.2d 355, 361. The legislature is now undertaking the thorough investigation necessary to resolve this important and troubling social problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Therefore, we conclude that R.C. 2919.22 does not apply where a mother abuses drugs during her pregnancy. The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b696-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes and H.

I must respectfully dissent. Tammy Gray gave birth to Sierra Gray. According to documents filed pursuant to discovery, at the time of birth, appellee\u2019s blood tested positive for the presence of cocaine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>A like test result was found as to the infant child. Several days later Sierra Gray was hospitalized because of cocaine withdrawal symptoms. Thereafter, Tammy Gray was indicted pursuant to R.C. 2919.22(A) for child endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The effects of cocaine use by a pregnant woman on her unborn child are both devastating and well documented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I am satisfied that a woman who knowingly abuses cocaine while pregnant violates a duty of care to her unborn child and thus endangers that child when this action results in a substantial risk to the health and safety of that child following birth. Apparently the majority feels it is a \u201cstretch\u201d to treat an unborn but viable fetus as a \u201cchild.\u201d I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly referred to a viable fetus as an unborn child. See, <em>e.g., Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, Inc. </em>(1989), 492 U.S. 490, 506, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 3050, 106 L.Ed.2d 410, 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association, as <em>amicus, </em>argues and I agree that \u201c[n]o one, not even a pregnant woman, has an unlimited right to do with her body as she pleases.\u201d The court in <em>Roe v. Wade </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147, recognized a constitutional right to personal privacy that includes a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy, but that right is limited by important state interests. <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. at 152-154, 93 S.Ct. at 726-727, 35 L.Ed.2d at 176-178. \u201cOne such limiting interest is the \u2018 <em>\u201clife and the health of the viable unborn child.\u201d </em>\u2019 [Emphasis added.] <em>Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City Missouri, Inc. v. Ashcroft, </em>462 U.S. 476 [487, 103 S.Ct. 2517, 2523, 76 L.Ed.2d 733, 742-743] (1983) [quoting the Missouri statute].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\"><em>Amicus </em>continues, \u201cBut in the case at bar, the use of the test set out in <em>Roe v. Wade </em>and its prodigy [sic] to balance the privacy rights of a woman against the compelling interest the State possesses in the life and well-being of the unborn child is inappropriate. For here, we are not dealing with a fundamental right. There is no fundamental right to abuse cocaine. The act of using cocaine is not an act relating to a right connected with marriage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>procreation, contraception, family relations, or child bearing. * * * No special protection is afforded the cocaine abuser just because she is pregnant. She is not spared the consequences of her illegal cocaine use because she is pregnant. Here you are <em>not </em>being asked to balance a woman\u2019s significant interest in bodily integrity against the States\u2019 interest in the health and welfare of its\u2019 <em>\\sic </em>] children. No, you are being asked to balance a woman\u2019s desire to use illegal drugs, while she happens to be pregnant, with the health and welfare of her child. \u2018[A]s a matter of law, the right of a woman to an abortion is different and distinct from her obligations to the fetus.\u2019 <em>In Re: A.C. </em>(D.C.App.1987), 533 A.2d 611. In the case at bar, the State is imposing no moral or medical injury or impairment upon a pregnant woman[;] it asks only what it asks of everyone, that is that she not abuse cocaine. A pregnant woman is not, due to her maternity, immune from the consequences of her illegal acts. This case is not about a woman\u2019s choice to conceive or carry a child. This is about the right of a child to be born healthy, free of injuries inflicted by the illegal acts of another.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">I firmly believe that a child has the legal right to begin life without the burden of injuries inflicted upon her before she is born.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">While R.C. 2929.12 does not enumerate specific conduct which amounts to a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d to the child, we have consistently held that the statute is not overbroad. See <em>State v. Daniels </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 220, 15 O.O.3d 232, 400 N.E.2d 399, certiorari denied (1980), 449 U.S. 851, 101 S.Ct. 142, 66 L.Ed.2d 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">I must concur with the <em>amicus </em>that <em>any </em>person of ordinary intelligence has to know that <em>in \u00fatero </em>exposure to cocaine poses an unacceptable risk to the unborn child. Suggestions by the courts below that the duty of care found in the statute does not arise until after birth is both morally and legally unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>As I believe that the words of the statute should be given their ordinary meaning, I would reverse the court of appeals and remand the matter for trial on the merits of the indictment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b699-6\">Douglas, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b697-10\">.
