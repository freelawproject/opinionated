The court concluded that the board of trustees is not a governmental unit, and that the proper governmental unit here is the regional transit authority. Nor is the board of trustees the person responsible for the public records. GCRTA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>bylaws designate the Secretary-Treasurer of GCRTA as the person responsible for maintaining the public records sought by relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We agree with the court of appeals. Accordingly, its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-7\">Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Weight, H.
