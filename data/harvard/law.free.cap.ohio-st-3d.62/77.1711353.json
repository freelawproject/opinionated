We find a six-month suspension insufficient. As the panel noted, this is the second time Osborne has violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. In view of his past conduct, which involved conflicts of interest, a six-month suspension is too light a penalty for this repeat offender. See Gov.Bar R. V(8). Moreover, Osborne compounded his offense by claiming that he misunderstood the restraining order. His argument that the order\u2019s language somehow excluded the residence was indefensible; his claim that he so believed is incredible. Therefore, respondent, Harry K. Osborne, Jr., is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year.
