Some two months later he was given a parole revocation hearing, which, pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5120:1-1-19(A)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was limited to the issue of mitigation. At the hearing, the fact of the subject convictions was established. Relator offered only an ambiguous statement in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">Relator did not plead at the hearing, nor does he now plead, any especially difficult or complex issues in mitigation that would entitle him to counsel. See <em>State, ex rel. Stamper, v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>85, 578 N.E.2d 461, decided this day. Instead, he argues that a parole violator by reason of conviction of a subsequent felony is entitled to all procedural rights afforded to a technical violator. We rejected this argument in <em>Stamper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Accordingly, we grant respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment and deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
