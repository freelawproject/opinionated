Instead, her complaint makes clear that she seeks the writ because she is dissatisfied with the probate court\u2019s choice of a guardian for her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">\u201cThe writ of <em>procedendo </em>is merely an order from a court of superior jurisdiction to one of inferior jurisdiction to proceed to judgment. It does not in any case attempt to control the inferior court as to what that judgment should be.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Davey, v. Owen </em>(1937), 133 Ohio St. 96, 106, 10 O.O. 102, 106, 12 N.E.2d 144, 149. Since Harris has alleged no delay in judgment, she has stated no claim in procedendo. The judgment of the court of appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-16\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
