For the reasons which follow, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">The commission\u2019s exclusive focus on perceived deficiencies in claimant\u2019s medical evidence is misdirected. The commission mistakenly believes, as stated in its brief to this court, that temporary total disability compensation was denied because claimant did not \u201cprovide probative and substantial evidence in support of her claim.\u201d This is not, however, what the order said. The order stated that temporary total disability compensation was denied because claimant\u2019s disability had become permanent, which, per <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, precludes temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">No evidence supports the commission\u2019s reasoning. The district hearing officer, relying on Dr. Moser\u2019s report, found that claimant\u2019s condition became permanent as of her November 1983 auto accident. Dr. Moser, however, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>not examine claimant until November 3, 1987. Thus, his opinion as to the permanency of claimant\u2019s condition prior to that time is not probative. Accordingly, there is no evidence supporting the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the denial of compensation, however, is not automatically \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting an award. <em>State, ex rel. Lampkins, v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 16-17, 542 N.E.2d 1105, 1108. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the court of appeals which directed the commission to redetermine claimant\u2019s entitlement to temporary total disability compensation over the period in question. If the claimant\u2019s medical evidence is indeed insufficient to support a compensation award, the commission order should specifically so state, and explain why it found the medical evidence inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
