No. 1017, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3710, 3711. (Current R.C. 4123.32 gives similar rule-making power to the Administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Acting under this grant, the commission adopted Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201c(B) Succeeding employers \u2014 experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201c(3) Where a legal entity having an established coverage or having had experience in the most recent experience period wholly succeeds one or more legal entities having established coverage or having had experience in the most recent experience period and at least one of the entities involved has a merit rating experience, the experience of all the involved entities shall be combined to establish the rate of the successor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">\u201c(4) Where a legal entity succeeds in the operation of a portion of a business of one or more legal entities having an established coverage or having had experience in the most recent experience period, the successor\u2019s rate shall be based on the predecessor\u2019s experience within the most recent experience period, pertaining to the portion of the business acquired by the successor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Appellant proposes that (1) it is not Bleile\u2019s successor in interest, and (2) it does not meet the common-law criteria for successor liability assumption and, therefore, cannot assume Bleile\u2019s rate experience. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The current controversy centers on the definition of \u201csuccessor in interest.\u201d Appellees define the term by the statutory language that precedes it\u2014 successor in interest being the transferee of a \u201cbusiness in whole or in part.\u201d Appellant responds that R.C. 4123.32 does not define the term and, therefore, under R.C. 1.49, the court must adopt a common-law definition. This argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">We find no evidence in either R.C. 4123.32(D) or Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B) that \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d is intended to be the term of art that appellant claims. Both sections imply that a successor in interest, for work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ers\u2019 compensation purposes, is simply a transferee of a business in whole or in part. Presumably, the General Assembly would have expressly set forth a more specialized meaning if that was its intent. Contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, there is no need to look beyond these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Appellant also proposes that the successorship liability principles enunciated in <em>Flaugher v. Cone Automatic Machine Co. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 60, 30 OBR 165, 507 N.E.2d 331, control the assumption of Bleile\u2019s rate experience. <em>Flaugher </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cThe general rule in products liability is that a successor corporation\u2019s amenability to suit will depend on the nature of the transaction which gave rise to the change in ownership. * * * Where the transfer is accomplished by means of a statutory merger or consolidation, the liability of the former corporation will be assumed by the new entity. * * * Where there is merely a sale of a corporation\u2019s assets, the buyer corporation is not liable for the seller corporation\u2019s tortious conduct unless one of the following four exceptions applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201c(1) the buyer expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such liability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201c(2) the transaction amounts to a <em>de facto </em>consolidation or merger;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201c(3) the buyer corporation is merely a continuation of the seller corporation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201c(4) the transaction is entered into fraudulently for the purpose of escaping liability. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 62, 30 OBR at 167, 507 N.E.2d at 334.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">We reject appellant\u2019s assertion for several reasons. First, the General Assembly in R.C. 4123.32(D) has already stated the experience-assumption criteria that it wants applied. Second, <em>Flaugher </em>involved products liability and amenability to common-law suit. Third, the criterion of <em>Flaugher </em>that there is \u201cmerely a sale of a corporation\u2019s assets\u201d does not apply to appellant. Here, in addition to the purchase of the assets, appellant contractually agreed to retain all Bleile employees. Arrangements were also made for a successor profit-sharing plan and there was partial commonality of directors. Accordingly, we find <em>Flaugher </em>inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b262-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
