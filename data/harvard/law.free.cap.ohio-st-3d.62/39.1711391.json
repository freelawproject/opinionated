Is Rule XVI of the Ohio Supreme Court Rules of Procedure [providing for federal certification of state-law questions] constitutional under [A]rticle IV, [S]ection 5 of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Whether spendthrift trusts are valid and enforceable under Ohio law. Specifically, is the spendthrift clause contained in the Brewer Trust enforceable under Ohio law?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Scott contends that both questions should be answered \u201cno.\u201d Bank One contends that they should be answered \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">This case comes here pursuant to Section 1, Rule XVI of the Supreme Court Rules of Practice: \u201cThe Supreme Court may, at its discretion, answer questions of law certified to it by the Supreme Court of the United States, a Court of Appeals of the United States, or a United States District Court. * * * \u201d The first certified question in this case is whether Rule XVI itself is consistent with the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">In addressing this question, the parties focus on whether we have jurisdiction under Section 2, Article IV of the Constitution to answer certified questions. It is well settled, of course, that neither statute nor rule of court can expand our jurisdiction beyond the constitutional grant. <em>State, ex rel. Ellis, v. Bd. of Deputy State Supervisors </em>(1904), 70 Ohio St. 341, 348, 71 N.E. 717, 718; <em>Humphrys v. Putnam </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 456, 460, 17 O.O.2d 424, 426, 178 N.E.2d 506, 509; <em>State, ex rel. Cleveland Municipal Court, v. Cleveland City Council </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 120, 122, 63 O.O.2d 199, 200, 296 N.E.2d 544, 547; <em>State, ex rel. Coyne, v. Todia </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 232, 237, 543 N.E.2d 1271, 1276. If Rule XVI expanded our jurisdiction, we would have to declare it unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>However, jurisdictional analysis is irrelevant to Rule XVI\u2019s constitutionality, for a court does not exercise jurisdiction by answering a certified question. \u201cJurisdiction\u201d means \u201c[t]he power to hear and determine a cause * * *.\u201d <em>Sheldon\u2019s Lessee v. Newton </em>(1854), 3 Ohio St. 494, 499. By answering a state-law question certified by a federal court, we may affect the outcome of the federal litigation, but the federal court still hears and decides the cause. Therefore, answering a certified question is not an exercise of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Thus, we need no grant of jurisdiction in order to answer certified questions. Conversely, our jurisdiction under Section 2, Article IV cannot be the source of our power to answer such questions. If we have such power, we must seek it elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In our view, such a power exists by virtue of Ohio\u2019s very existence as a state in our federal system. We begin with a truism: the Ohio Constitution permits the state to exercise its own sovereignty as far as the United States Constitution and laws permit. Since federal law recognizes Ohio\u2019s sovereignty by making Ohio law applicable in federal courts, the state has the power to exercise and the responsibility to protect that sovereignty. Therefore, if answering certified questions serves to further the state\u2019s interests and preserve the state\u2019s sovereignty, the appropriate branch of state government \u2014 this court \u2014 may constitutionally answer them.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The state\u2019s sovereignty is unquestionably implicated when federal courts construe state law. If the federal court errs, it applies law other than Ohio law, in derogation of the state\u2019s right to prescribe a \u201crule of decision.\u201d \u201cBy allocating rights and duties incorrectly, the federal court both does an injustice to one or more parties, and frustrates the state\u2019s policy that would have allocated the rights and duties differently. The frustration of the state\u2019s policy may have a more lasting effect, because other potential litigants are likely to behave as if the federal decision were the law of the state. In that way, the federal court has, at least temporarily, <em>made </em>state law of which the state would have disapproved, had its courts had the first opportunity to pass on the question.\u201d McCree, Foreword, 1976 Annual Survey of Michigan Law (1977), 23 Wayne L.Rev. 255, 257, fn. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The danger is scarcely theoretical. Federal courts acknowledge that they frequently err in applying state law that is unclear or unsettled. See, <em>e.g., United Services Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney </em>(C.A.5, 1964), 328 F.2d 483, 486-487, fn. 5-9 (collecting cases where state courts rejected federal interpretations of state law); W.S. <em>Ranch Co. v. Kaiser Steel Corp. </em>(C.A.10, 1967), 388 F.2d 257, 264-265, fn. 11-16 (Brown, J., concurring and dissenting) (collecting cases), reversed (1968), 391 U.S. 593, 88 S.Ct. 1753, 20 L.Ed.2d 835. Indeed, some federal judges consider state-law interpretation so hazardous that they com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>pare it to \u201cprophecy.\u201d See <em>Nichols v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(C.A.10, 1974), 501 F.2d 392, 393; <em>Reid v. Volkswagen of America, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1975), 512 F.2d 1294 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; Brown, Certification \u2014 Federalism in Action (1977), 7 Cumberland L.Rev. 455. As United States Circuit Judge Alan Norris has remarked, certification frees federal courts from \u201chaving to <em>guess </em>how state courts will decide important questions of state law.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>Norris, The Bicentennial of Judicial Federalism (1990), 53 Ohio St.3d lvii, lviii.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Another federal judge has argued that it matters little if a federal court errs in applying state law, because if \u201cstate law is so unclear that a federal court, honestly trying to discover and apply it, falls into error * * * the relevant state policies are so lacking in development and firmness that their nonapplication in a diversity case is not of very great moment.\u201d Wright, The Federal Courts and the Nature and Quality of State Law (1967), 13 Wayne L.Rev. 317, 320. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We respectfully disagree. Points of state law that seem unclear to federal courts may be quite clear to \u201c[ijnformed local courts,\u201d which \u201cmay find meaning not discernible to the outsider.\u201d <em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. Thibodaux </em>(1959), 360 U.S. 25, 30, 79 S.Ct. 1070, 1073, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058, 1063. One cannot infer from a federal court\u2019s honest misunderstanding of state law that the policies served by that law lack development and firmness.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Moreover, we strongly believe in the importance of accurately applying Ohio law in federal courts. \u201cIn the tension between federal and state power lies the promise of liberty.\u201d <em>Gregory v. Ashcroft </em>(1991), 501 U.S.-,-, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 2400, 115 L.Ed.2d 410, 423: To the extent that a federal court applies different legal rules than the state court would have, the state\u2019s sovereignty is diminished; as Judge McCree put it, the federal court has made state law. From the state\u2019s viewpoint, losing part of its sovereignty is no small matter, especially since a federal court\u2019s error may perpetuate itself in state courts until the state\u2019s highest court corrects it. See <em>Nupnau v. Hink </em>(1964), 53 Ill.App.2d 81, 91, 203 N.E.2d 63, 68-69 (federal decision applying Illinois law entitled to deference in Illinois court), reversed (1965), 33 Ill.2d 285, 211 N.E.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Certification ensures that federal courts will properly apply state law. Note, Inter-jurisdictional Certification: Beyond Abstention toward Coopera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>tive Legal Federalism (1963), 111 U.Pa.L.Rev. 344, 362. It thus strengthens the \u201cfederalist structure of joint sovereigns,\u201d <em>Gregory, supra, </em>501 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 2399, 115 L.Ed.2d at 422, and redeems \u201cthe promise of liberty,\u201d <em>id,., </em>contained in the federal and Ohio Constitutions. We cannot doubt our power to protect Ohio\u2019s sovereignty from inadvertent encroachments by federal courts. We therefore hold that Rule XYI is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Since we may constitutionally answer certified questions, we now consider the second certified question. The federal court has asked us whether spendthrift trusts are enforceable under Ohio law, and specifically whether the spendthrift clause in the Brewer Trust is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">A \u201cspendthrift trust\u201d is a trust that imposes a restraint on the voluntary and involuntary transfer of the beneficiary\u2019s interest in the trust property. 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Trusts (1959) 311, Section 152(2). Most states enforce such trusts, at least to some degree. See IIA Scott, Law of Trusts (Fratcher Ed.1987) 93-95, Section 152.1, fn. 2 and 3, and 138-140, Section 153, fn. 13. However, in <em>Sherrow v. Brookover </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 310, 22 O.O.2d 373, 189 N.E.2d 90, paragraphs three and four of the syllabus, we held that, absent legislative authorization, a restraint on the involuntary transfer of the beneficiary\u2019s continuing and enforceable rights in the trust property is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In a technical sense, it is arguable that the trust provision at issue here is not a true spendthrift provision. It does not expressly restrain the alienability of McCombe\u2019s interest in the trust property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, it provides that Bank One shall distribute the trust property outright to McCombe unless he is, <em>inter alia, </em>insolvent (\u201cthe insolvency clause\u201d), has filed a petition in bankruptcy (\u201cthe bankruptcy clause\u201d), or would not personally enjoy the property (\u201cthe nonenjoyment clause\u201d). When any of these things occurs, the trust becomes a discretionary trust. Only when all the conditions cease to exist will McCombe again be entitled, under the terms of the trust, to outright distribution of the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">However, Brewer intended this provision to accomplish the same goal as a spendthrift trust. The federal district court found that Brewer \u201cwanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>leave her estate to John McCombe, but did not want to have her estate end up in the hands of John McCombe\u2019s creditors.\u201d While the trust provision at issue does not forbid the alienation of McCombe\u2019s interest in the trust property, it does in effect prevent such alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">If the trust is enforced according to its terms, attachment of McCombe\u2019s future interest would create what the federal bankruptcy court described as \u201can impasse or \u2018Catch 22\u2019 solution.\u201d <em>McCombe, supra, </em>93 B.R. at 601. As Bank One concedes, McCombe\u2019s future interest in distribution is alienable. R.C. 2131.04; <em>Martin v. Martin </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 101, 112, 8 O.O.3d 106, 112, 374 N.E.2d 1384, 1391, quoting <em>Moore v. Foresman </em>(1962), 172 Ohio St. 559, 565, 18 O.O.2d 123, 126, 179 N.E.2d 349, 353. But the nonenjoyment clause precludes Bank One from distributing trust property outright unless McCombe will personally enjoy it. Therefore, if McCombe\u2019s future interest is transferred to the bankruptcy trustee, it can never become a present interest. Instead, McCombe would continue to be the beneficiary of a discretionary trust, the property of which his creditors cannot reach. Restatement of Trusts 2d, <em>supra, </em>at 311, Section 155(1); see <em>Bureau of Support v. Kreitzer </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 147, 150, 45 O.O.2d 480, 482, 243 N.E.2d 83, 85. This will be the result even after the bankruptcy proceedings are concluded, because their conclusion removes only two of the disabling conditions (those embodied in the bankruptcy and insolvency clauses) that have prevented McCombe from receiving the trust property outright. Thus, the nonenjoyment clause makes McCombe\u2019s future interest in the trust property worthless to anyone but McCombe.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Under such circumstances, it is unlikely that creditors would trouble to attach the future interest. \u201cThe object of the creditor is to get the property for himself, not merely to deprive the beneficiary of it.\u201d Bartelme, Spendthrift Trusts (1894), 50 Albany L.J. 6, 10. Even if they did, McCombe would simply receive distributions at the discretion of a trustee selected by his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Enforcement of the Brewer Trust as written would neatly circumvent <em>Sherrow </em>and allow McCombe to enjoy the property free of his creditors\u2019 claims. A rule so easily avoided would be no rule at all. We therefore agree with the federal court\u2019s characterization of the Brewer Trust as a spendthrift trust. We must either apply <em>Sherrow </em>or overrule it. So we turn to the question raised by <em>amici: </em>Should <em>Sherrow </em>be overruled?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">First, we briefly examine whether we should reconsider precedent in the context of a certified question. \u201cThe certification procedure was not designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>so as to allow a party \u2018to seek to persuade the state court to change what appears to be present law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Venezia v. Miller Brewing Co. </em>(C.A.l, 1980), 626 F.2d 188, 192, fn. 5, quoting <em>Cantwell v. Univ. of Massachusetts </em>(C.A.1, 1977), 551 F.2d 879, 880. Thus, federal courts will not certify a question to which the answer is in no real doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">However, once a federal court does certify a question to us, we must \u201cdetermine the present law bearing on the issue certified.\u201d <em>Morningstar v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co. </em>(1979), 162 W.Va. 857, 862, 253 S.E.2d 666, 669. The purpose of certification is to apply the same rules of state law to litigants in federal court as would apply in state court. If <em>Sherrow </em>deserves to be overruled, it would be unjust to apply it here simply because this case arose in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">That said, we consider the merits of <em>Sherrow. </em>In evaluating Sherrow\u2019s viability, we recognize that \u201cthe principle of <em>stare decisis </em>is necessary to an orderly and predictable system of law * * <em>Shearer v. Shearer </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 94, 95, 18 OBR 129, 130, 480 N.E.2d 388, 390. However, we are also mindful \u201cthat our adherence to former decisions [must] not be arbitrary, but founded in their continuing reason and logic.\u201d <em>Hall v. Rosen </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 135, 138, 4 O.O.3d 336, 338, 363 N.E.2d 725, 727, overruled on other grounds, <em>Johnson v. Adams </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 48, 18 OBR 83, 479 N.E.2d 866. \u201cIt is * * * the proper province of this court to correct judicially created doctrines if they are no longer grounded in good morals and sound law.\u201d <em>Albritton v. Neighborhood Centers Assn, for Child Development </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 210, 214, 12 OBR 295, 299, 466 N.E.2d 867, 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\"><em>Amici </em>raise several arguments in favor of overruling <em>Sherrow </em>and allowing spendthrift trusts. Most persuasively, they argue that a property owner should have the right to dispose of her property as she chooses. That is why most courts, including Ohio courts before <em>Sherrow, </em>have enforced spendthrift trusts. See, <em>e.g., Nichols v. Eaton </em>(1875), 91 U.S. 716, 727, 23 L.Ed. 254, 257; <em>Skillman v. Symmes </em>(1896), 14 Ohio C.C. 547, 7 Ohio C.D. 39; <em>Frazier v. Wilkinson </em>(1899), 18 Ohio C.C. 363, 10 Ohio C.D. 106; <em>Matthews v. Curtis </em>(1926), 20 Ohio App. 209, 151 N.E. 778; <em>McWilliams v. McWilliams </em>(C.P.1956), 2 O.O.2d 77, 78, 140 N.E.2d 80, 82-83. See, also, <em>Payer v. Orgill </em>(C.P.1963), 91 Ohio Law Abs. 106, 109, 191 N.E.2d 373, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">On the other hand, an owner\u2019s rights over her property are not absolute. We endorsed that notion in <em>Sherrow; </em>we do not shrink from it today. As Dean Griswold rightly says: \u201cThe validity of spendthrift trusts is a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>policy, not of logic.\u201d Griswold, Spendthrift Trusts (2 Ed.1947) 634, Section 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">However, as a matter of policy, it is desirable for property owners to have, within reasonable bounds, the freedom to do as they choose with their own property. That freedom is not absolute, as we recognized in <em>Sherrow. </em>But it is a policy consideration to be balanced against other policy considerations. In a society that values freedom as greatly as ours, this consideration is far from trivial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The most important argument against spendthrift trusts is that they are unfair to the beneficiary\u2019s creditors because they allow the beneficiary to enjoy the trust property without paying his debts. \u201cCreditors have a right to collect their judgment not only from the property that the debtor had at the time when they extended credit to him but also from any property which he may have, even if acquired thereafter.\u201d <em>Sherrow, supra, </em>174 Ohio St. at 313, 22 O.O.2d at 375, 189 N.E.2d at 93. This argument fails both logically and as a matter of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">As a matter of logic, Sherrow\u2019s reasoning begs the question. Of course, we agree that McCombe\u2019s creditors may collect from any property he has, including whatever interest he has in the trust property. But McCombe <em>has </em>no greater interest in the trust property than the trust agreement gives him. And McCombe\u2019s interest in the trust property is contingent on his personal enjoyment of it. If his interest in the trust property passes to his creditors, he will not personally enjoy it; if he will not personally enjoy it, then he has no interest in it to transfer to his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">More important, Sherrow\u2019s reasoning fails as a matter of policy. Suppose that Brewer had said to McCombe: \u201cI will give you this property when you are out of debt, but not before.\u201d No one would suggest that McCombe\u2019s creditors, having somehow learned of Brewer\u2019s intent to give her property to McCombe, could take the property from Brewer. Brewer had no obligation to satisfy McCombe\u2019s debts with her own property. See <em>Beals v. Croughwell </em>(1941), 140 Neb. 320, 326-327, 299 N.W. 638, 641, 138 A.L.R. 1330, 1334. Or suppose that, after the bankruptcy proceedings were concluded, McCombe received a gift from Brewer. No one would suggest that the bankruptcy trustee could attach it. Yet, in these hypotheticals, McCombe\u2019s creditors are no worse off than they would be if the Brewer Trust is enforced. The results are identical: McCombe enjoys Brewer\u2019s property and the creditors get no share of it. These hypotheticals show that enforcing a spendthrift provision \u201ctakes nothing from the prior or subsequent creditors of the beneficiary to which they previously had the right to look for payment * * *.\u201d <em>Huestis v. Manley </em>(1939), 110 Vt. 413, 419, 8 A.2d 644, 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Some have suggested that spendthrift trusts, like other restraints on alienation, are economically inefficient. See, <em>e.g., </em>Note, Spendthrift and Other Protective Trusts in Ohio (1964), 33 U.Cin.L.Rev. 281, 284 (hereinafter \u201cOhio Spendthrift Trusts\u201d). However, the overwhelming majority of states recognize such trusts, and we know of no evidence that spendthrift trusts have harmed those states\u2019 economies. See Griswold, <em>supra, </em>at 635-637, Section 554; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 91, Section 152.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The <em>Sherrow </em>court also appealed to legislative supremacy to support its decision. The court noted that only the General Assembly may exempt property from creditors\u2019 claims. \u201cIt is elementary that, as to property or rights that are subject to execution, any claim by an individual owner thereof for exemption of part or all of such property or rights from claims of his creditors must be based upon constitutional or statutory provisions providing for such exemption.\u201d <em>Sherrow, supra, </em>174 Ohio St. at 315, 22 O.O.2d at 376, 189 N.E.2d at 93-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We certainly cannot dispute the general proposition that \u201can individual [property] owner\u201d may claim only such exemptions as the Revised Code allows him. See R.C. 2329.66(A). But we think the <em>Sherrow </em>court drew the wrong conclusion from that proposition. Again, Sherrow\u2019s essential fallacy was to beg the question of what the \u201cindividual [property] owner\u201d actually <em>owns </em>as the beneficiary of a spendthrift trust. The beneficiary owns no greater interest in the trust property than the settlor has given him. In the case of a spendthrift trust, the settlor has not given the beneficiary an alienable interest. Enforcing the trust does not, then, exempt the beneficiary\u2019s property from creditors\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The <em>Sherrow </em>court also cited, without elaboration, R.C. Chapter 2333. <em>Sherrow, supra, </em>at 315, 22 O.O.2d at 376, 189 N.E.2d at 93. R.C. 2333.01, the \u201ccreditor\u2019s bill\u201d statute, makes various equitable interests of a judgment debtor subject to the payment of the judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Some have argued that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>statute actually forbids the enforcement of a spendthrift trust. See Ohio Spendthrift Trusts, <em>supra, </em>33 U.Cin.L.Rev. at 293. Accord Griswold, <em>supra, </em>at 251, Section 213 (citing R.C. 2333.01\u2019s virtually identical predecessor statute, former G.C. 11760).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">But this argument suffers from the same infirmity noted above. It is true that a judgment debtor\u2019s equitable interests are liable to execution of the judgment. But the statute speaks only of those interests \u201cwhich * * * [the judgment debtor] <em>has * * </em>(Emphasis added.) And the beneficiary of a spendthrift trust has no interest that can be executed upon, because the trustor did not give him such an interest. The General Assembly undoubtedly could have outlawed spendthrift trusts, but it has not. Since the General Assembly has not spoken, we must, as the <em>Sherrow </em>court did, make our best effort to balance the competing policies favoring and disfavoring spendthrift trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We are no longer satisfied with the balance struck twenty-eight years ago. The policy reasons against spendthrift trusts, which seemed so strong then, now look weak. The <em>Sherrow </em>court too easily dismissed the countervailing policy that the law should allow the property owner, within reason, to dispose of her property as she chooses. We can no longer sustain the <em>Sherrow </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Accordingly, we overrule <em>Sherrow </em>and hold that spendthrift trusts will be enforced in Ohio. Our answer to the second certified question, therefore, is that the spendthrift clause contained in the Brewer Trust is enforceable under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\n<em>Decision accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ay\">H. Brown, J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\">. The <em>Reid </em>court\u2019s interpretation of Michigan law was later rejected by the Supreme Court of Michigan. See <em>Reid v. Volkswagen of America, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1978), 575 F.2d 1175 (on appeal from remand).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\">. It should be noted that Judge Wright is not arguing against certification. But, cf., McCree, <em>supra, </em>at 257, fn. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-13\">. According to Bank One, the Brewer Trust contains, in addition to the provision at issue in this case, a provision that \u201cno interest in the income or principal of the * * * Trust shall be alienated, encumbered, or otherwise disposed of by any beneficiary while in the possession and control of the Trustee * * This provision, while not at issue here, is a classic spendthrift provision, clearly inconsistent with <em>Sherrow, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. Indeed, an early commentator argued that the economy benefits when property owners are allowed to set up spendthrift trusts. \u201cIn America wealth is not as often acquired by inheritance as by the ingenuity, hard work, or personal ability of the owner, and usually the greatest incentive to its accumulation is the fact that its possession will afford comforts and opportunities to his children.\u201d Bartelme, <em>supra, </em>at 10. This contention is surely as plausible as the contention that spendthrift trusts damage the economy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">. R.C. 2333.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201cWhen a judgment debtor does not have sufficient personal or real property subject to levy on execution to satisfy the judgment, any equitable interest which he has in real estate as mortgagor, mortgagee, or otherwise, or any interest he has in a banking, turnpike, bridge, or other joint-stock company, or in a money contract, claim, or chose in action, due or to become due to him, or in a judgment or order, or money, goods, or effects which he has in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>possession of any person or body politic or corporate, shall be subject to the payment of the judgment by action.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
