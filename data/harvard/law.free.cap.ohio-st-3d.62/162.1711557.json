Any future partial disability awards were to be paid according to the method first selected. However, for \u201cgood cause shown\u201d a claimant may change election. Former R.C. 4123.-57(A). We must decide whether the commission abused its discretion when it found no good cause here. We find that it did not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">\u201cGood cause\u201d is not statutorily defined nor have we previously interpreted it. The parties direct our attention to <em>State, ex rel. Fellers, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 247, 248, 9 OBR 421, 422, 459 N.E.2d 605, 606, wherein the Court of Appeals for Franklin County stated that \u201cgood cause,\u201d as used in R.C. 4123.57(A), \u201cis demonstrated when, at the time of making the first election, subsequently occurring circumstances were not foreseeable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtG\">Fellers hurt her arm and shoulder at work. She sought partial disability compensation and was found to be ten percent partially disabled. Fellers elected to be compensated under R.C. 4123.57(B). She later applied for an increase in partial. disability compensation and it, too, was paid under paragraph (B). Fellers continued working throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">When Fellers\u2019 injury later prevented her from working, she attempted to change her election from R.C. 4123.57(B) to 4123.57(A). The commission found no good cause and denied her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The appellate court found an abuse of discretion and ordered the commission to vacate its order. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">\u201c \u2018Good cause\u2019 is demonstrated when, at the time of making the first election, subsequently occurring circumstances were not foreseeable. If a person suffers what appears to be a minor injury, at the time of election, but the injury subsequently causes major problems to the relator\u2019s health and earning power, such a change of circumstances constitutes \u2018good cause,\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 4123.57, for a change of election.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The commission did not abuse its discretion in finding foreseeability and, therefore, lack of good cause in the case at bar. <em>Fellers </em>is distinguishable in two important respects \u2014 both of which go to the question of foreseeability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>First, when the election was made, Fellers\u2019 injury was minor \u2014 appellant\u2019s was not. By the time appellant made his election, his claim had been additionally allowed for a disc condition \u2014 herniated nucleus pulposis L4-5 \u2014 and appellant had undergone back surgery. Second, unlike Fellers, appellant was already prevented by his injury from working when he elected to receive R.C. 4123.57(B) compensation. Thus, the circumstances that appellant claims justify an election change were not only foreseeable, but were present when the initial election was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AXKj\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\">. While <em>Fellers </em>enunciates an acceptable definition of \u201cforeseeability,\u201d foreseeability can no longer be viewed as the sole element of \u201cgood cause.\u201d When <em>Fellers </em>was decided, claimant\u2019s eligibility for impaired earning capacity benefits under former R.C. 4123.57(A) was thought by some to be automatic once a partial disability had been found. Under <em>State, ex rel. Johnson, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 384, 533 N.E.2d 775, however, this is no longer true. In <em>Johnson, </em>we held that a claimant must prove <em>actual </em>impaired earning capacity. As such, \u201cgood cause\u201d must now be viewed as dual pronged, demonstrated only by a showing of unforeseeable circumstances <em>and </em>actual impaired earning capacity. If either requirement is not met, \u201cgood cause\u201d has not been established.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
