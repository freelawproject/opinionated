For the reasons which follow, we conclude that the transactions are leases, and that Custom Leasing is the \u201cowner\u201d of the leased equipment for personal property tax return purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">R.C. 5711.05 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEach person shall return all the taxable property of which he is the owner * * * \u201d; \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in R.C. 5711.01(B) \u201cmeans any owner of taxable property * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">When the \u201clease/conditional sale\u201d issue was before us in <em>Equilease Corp. v. Donahue </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 81, 39 O.O.2d 88, 226 N.E.2d 721, we identified the applicable rules and the appropriate test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cThe rules * * * were set forth in <em>Alzfan v. Bowers, Tax Commr., </em>175 Ohio St. 349, 352 [25 O.O.2d 250, 252, 194 N.E.2d 852, 854], as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201c \u2018Where * * * a so-called lessee is obligated to accept and pay for personal property at some future time and has no option to return it, the transaction is held to be a conditional sale even though terms commonly used in leases have been used. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe test most frequently applied is whether the so-called \u2018lessee\u2019 is obligated to accept and pay for the property at some future time, or, on the other hand, whether his primary obligation is to return or account for the property to the so-called \u2018lessor\u2019 according to the terms of the \u2018lease.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>10 Ohio St.2d at 82, 39 O.O.2d at 88-89, 226 N.E.2d at 722, 723.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Under the terms of the contract here, the lessee \u201cleases\u201d and \u201cagrees to pay * * * rent\u201d; will keep the equipment insured in lessor\u2019s name; and, at termination, will surrender possession to lessor. The lessor \u201cis the owner\u201d and retains title, and can accelerate payment and repossess the equipment in the event of lessee\u2019s default or bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Our conclusion in <em>Equilease, supra, </em>10 Ohio St.2d at 82, 39 O.O.2d at 89, 226 N.E.2d at 722, is equally appropriate here: \u201c[U]nder the terms of the contracts involved here the lessees were not obligated to complete the transactions to the point of acquiring ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">In <em>CC Leasing Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 204, 207, 23 OBR 364, 366, 492 N.E.2d 421, 424, we characterized the holding in <em>Equilease, supra, </em>simply: \u201cThat case merely stands for the proposition that a lessor of leased property is the proper entity to be taxed on such property.\u201d Nothing presented here prompts us to depart from that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Custom Leasing attempted to establish that despite the use of a written lease, the transactions were really financing arrangements and constituted conditional sales. Some evidence was presented in support, but it falls far short of meeting the standard required by <em>Hatchadorian v. Lindley </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 66, 21 OBR 365, 488 N.E.2d 145, paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">\u201cWhen no competent and probative evidence is developed before the Board of Tax Appeals to show that the Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination of the value of the property is factually incorrect, it is error for the board to reverse that determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The decision of the BTA, being neither unreasonable nor unlawful, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
