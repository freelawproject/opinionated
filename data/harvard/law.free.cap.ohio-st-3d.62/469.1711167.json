It was, she argues, the obligation of Xyovest as owner of the equipment to pay personal property taxes due and the fact that Xyovest contractually shifted this responsibility to its lessees does not change that fact. Under Xyovest\u2019s master lease, it is argued, a lessee undertook an additional condition of its lease: as a part of the consideration paid or promised to be paid in return for the continued possession and use of the equipment, it would pay the pass-through personal property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Xyovest responds that, \u201c[a] statute must be read in its entirety,\u201d that the commissioner quotes out of context, and that she ignores a critical part of the applicable definition of \u201cprice.\u201d We agree with Xyovest.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">R.C. 5739.01(H)(1) defines \u201cprice\u201d as: \u201c * * * [T]he aggregate value in money of anything paid or delivered, or promised to be paid or delivered, in the complete performance of a retail sale, without any deduction on account of the cost of the property sold, cost of materials used, labor or service cost, * * * or any other expense. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Under R.C. 5739.01(B)(1) a \u201csale\u201d is a transaction \u201cby which title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property, is or is to be transferred, or a license to use or consume tangible personal property is or is to be granted * * *.\u201d The commissioner has failed to establish that at the time of the reimbursement of the additional tax amount there was a concomitant transfer of title or possession of tangible personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">The quoted sections of the master lease provide for divisible contracts. In addition to the right to use equipment there is a separate undertaking for the reimbursement of applicable personal property taxes. See <em>Material Contractors, Inc. v. Donahue </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 19, 43 O.O.2d 10, 235 N.E.2d 525, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In <em>Columbus Equipment Co. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 62, 63, 526 N.E.2d 294, 295-296, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cR.C. 5739.02 levies a tax on retail sales and this tax is measured by the \u2018price\u2019 of the sale. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201c * * * [However,] * * * not all sums paid in a transaction are part of the \u2018price\u2019. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">\u201cInterest is * * * the cost of borrowing money so that a person will have the money to purchase the item. Interest is not a part of the item\u2019s price because it is not related to the cost of the property sold or material used. R.C. 5739.01(H).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201cIn the instant case, taxpayer and its customers agreed that the lease payments would include interest. * * * When taxpayer did this, it was not adding compensation to the purchase price, but was retaining the interest that the parties had agreed was due on and paid with the lease payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">By analogy, the lessees\u2019 reimbursement payments of personal property taxes here were not part of the price, but were separate items agreed to by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The decision of the BTA was reasonable and lawful and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b649-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
