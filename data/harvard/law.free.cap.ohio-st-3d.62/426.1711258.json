Enright, Clerk of Courts, for summary judgment and the motion of respondent William Flaherty, Director of the Department of Administrative Services, to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">The motion to dismiss filed by the director relies upon matters not alleged in the complaint and, thus, does not properly present the issues sought to be raised. However, essentially, the same issue is properly raised by the motion for summary judgment filed by the clerk of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">Relator has filed no evidentiary materials in response to the motion for summary judgment. Respondent clerk of courts has, by affidavit, indicated that he has supplied to relator the requested public records to the extent they exist. Relator apparently assumed the records would be in a different form and filed this action under the mistaken belief that he had not been provided copies of all the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>It, thus, appears that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant respondent is entitled to summary judgment in his favor even when the evidence is construed most strongly in relator\u2019s favor. Such determination renders moot the relief sought against the respondent director, the evidence indicating that the records sought have been furnished insofar as they could be in the possession of said respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">For the foregoing reasons, respondents\u2019 motions are sustained, and the requested writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-8\">Strausbaugh and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
