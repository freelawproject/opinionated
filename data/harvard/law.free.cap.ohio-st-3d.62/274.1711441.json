Winkelman </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 465, 2 OBR 561, 442 N.E.2d 811. The issue allegedly in conflict is whether a person can be constitutionally convicted under R.C. 2923.13 for possessing a firearm while under the disability of a pending indictment, even though there is no evidence that the person was notified that the pendency of the indictment legally disqualified him from such possession. However, the Twelfth District overruled <em>Winkelman, </em>in pertinent part, in <em>State v. Frederick </em>(June 17, 1989), Butler App. Nos. CA88-07-111 and CA8807-118, unreported, 1989 WL 80493.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In order for a court of appeals to certify its judgment to this court, it must find that the judgment \u201cis in conflict with a judgment pronounced upon the same question by any other court of appeals of the state * * Section 3(B)(4), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. In this instance, the Twelfth District\u2019s partially overruled judgment in <em>Winkelman </em>lacks any jurisprudential weight on the \u201cnotice\u201d question and thus cannot be said to \u201cconflict\u201d with the Second District\u2019s decision herein. In any event, the two judgments do not present the \u201csame question,\u201d since the defendants were convicted under different, albeit similar, provisions of R.C. 2923.13. Compare R.C. 2923.-13(A)(2) (possessing firearm while under indictment for felony of violence) with R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) (possessing firearm while under indictment for drug offense). Because no conflict on the \u201cnotice\u201d question exists between the two judgments, the defendant\u2019s appeal in case No. 90-1829 must be dismissed. See <em>State v. Parobek </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 61, 550 N.E.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\n<em>Appeals dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, H.
