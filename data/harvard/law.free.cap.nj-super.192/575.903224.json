He was indicted in alternate counts for perjury <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-1) and false swearing <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-2). He moved to dismiss the indictment asserting that he could be found guilty of no greater offense than making \u201cunsworn falsifications to authorities\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-3. The trial court denied his motion and we granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Defendant\u2019s position is without merit. <em>R. </em>l:4-4(b) entitled \u201cCertification in lieu of Oath\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">In lieu of the affidavit, oath or verification required by these rules, the affiant may submit the following certification which shall be dated and immediately precede his signature:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u201cI certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true. I am aware that if any of the foregoing statements made by me are wilfully false, I am subject to punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">This is the precise certification that defendant is alleged to have employed. The annotation in <em>Pressler, Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment <em>R. </em>4:17-4 (1983) states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">Note that a wilfully false certification in lieu of oath will support a criminal prosecution for false swearing. <em>State v. Angelo\u2019s Motor Sales, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200 (App.Div.1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-10\"><em>State v. Parmigiani, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>154 (1974), further supports the quoted annotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Defendant argues that the adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-3* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reflects an intent by the Legislature to overrule <em>Angelo\u2019s Motor Sales </em>and <em>Parmigiani. </em>We find no such intent. This new section was created to prohibit misstatements to governmental agencies and public servants where the statements are not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>in solemn form such as under oath or a certification in lieu of oath. Volume II <em>Commentary, Final Report of the New Jersey Law Revision Commission, </em>at 278. It was not intended to apply to a certification in lieu of oath. The rules of court clearly require the same solemnity in the act of verification as is required when a document is formally sworn to. <em>R. </em>l:4-4(b); <em>State v. Parmigiani, supra </em>at 157. As we stated in <em>Angelo\u2019s Motor Sales:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">The change in rules was not intended to-degrade the solemnity of the affirmation of the truth of the answers, nor was it intended to reduce the penalty for providing false answers to interrogatories. In our view, the adoption of the certification procedure merely constituted a change in ritual and not in substance. Certification is only another way of swearing or affirming. It is nothing in itself except as a perceptible manifestation of the intent to verify the statement certified. [125 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 207]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion was properly denied. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\"> <em>Unsworn </em>falsification to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">a.
