The trial judge held that an employer\u2019s contractual undertaking with its employees to indemnify them for acts of their own negligence was \u201cin the nature of insurance\u201d and, to the extent the employer did not shift the risk of loss it had thus assumed to an insurance company, it was a \u201cself-insurer\u201d of that risk. He concluded, furthermore, that this \u201cself-insurance\u201d constituted \u201cother insurance\u201d within the scope of a standard other-insurance clause. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Defendant, Insurance Company of North America (INA) issued a hospital-medical institutional policy to defendant Passaic General Hospital (Hospital), a nonprofit charitable corporation. The policy contained an additional interest endorsement pursuant to which all Hospital employees were expressly included as insureds and were provided with liability coverage in the amount of $500,000 per claim. The endorsement further provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ed that the Hospital itself would assume the risk for the first $100,000 of each claim. This was referred to in the endorsement as the Hospital\u2019s \u201cself-insured sum.\u201d The endorsement also included a representation by the Hospital that it had entered into a contract with defendant ESIS, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of INA, whereby ESIS would provide the Hospital with such services as the investigation, defense and settlement of claims made against its employees. Finally, the endorsement provided that if any employee-insured \u201chas another policy or policies covering a loss insured hereunder, the insurance with respect to such loss under this policy shall be excess over the amount set forth as the limit of liability under such other policy or policies.\u201d There is no question that the coverage of the endorsement extended to the professional malpractice of nurses employed by the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">During the period of INA\u2019s policy coverage, plaintiff Flora Panicucci was a nurse in the Hospital\u2019s employ. She was also a member of plaintiff American Nurses Association, which is the named insured of a policy of insurance issued by plaintiff National Union Fire Insurance Company (National) insuring each of the association\u2019s members for loss due to professional negligence in the amount of $200,000 per claim. The policy contained a clause providing that \u201cif the member has valid and collectible insurance for an occurrence protected by this Agreement, the protection provided by this Agreement shall apply only as excess of such insurance.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The genesis of the controversy among these insurers and insureds is a malpractice action instituted by the guardian <em>ad litem </em>of one Frank Wade, an incompetent, seeking recovery against Panicucci for the personal injuries he allegedly sustained as a result of Panicucci\u2019s professional negligence in rendering nursing care to him in the Hospital\u2019s post-operative recovery room to which she was assigned. That action was ultimately settled for $375,000. Pursuant to a reservation of their rights as against each other, National contributed $150,000 to the settlement payment, INA contributed $125,000, and the Hospital contributed $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>This declaratory judgment was thereafter instituted by American Nurses Association, Panicucci and National seeking an adjudication that the coverage afforded by National\u2019s policy was excess both in respect of INA\u2019s coverage and the Hospital\u2019s undertaking to assume the first $100,000 of the loss covered by INA. This undertaking, it claimed, was self-insurance which constituted other valid and collectible insurance within the scope of its own other insurance clause. All parties moved for summary judgment asserting that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact, an assertion with which the trial judge agreed and with which we concur as well. It was the trial judge\u2019s conclusion, for the reasons stated in his opinion reported at 184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170 (Law Div.1981), that the Hospital was primarily responsible for the first $100,000 of the settlement payment and that National and INA were equally responsible for the $275,000 balance. .Judgment was entered requiring INA to reimburse National to the extent of $12,500. The Hospital appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The basis of the trial judge\u2019s determination was his agreement with National\u2019s contention that the Hospital, by reason of its assumption of the first $100,000 of loss pursuant to the terms of the INA policy, was a self-insurer to that extent and that that self-insurance of this indemnity undertaking was indeed other insurance within the intendment of National\u2019s policy. He therefore reasoned that the Hospital was the only insurer of the first $100,000 and therefore primarily obligated to pay that portion of the loss. As to the remaining $275,000, there was only the excess insurance afforded by both INA and National. Applying the doctrine of <em>Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>554 (1959), he concluded that these mutually repugnant excess provisions rendered each of the two carriers primarily liable for that portion of the loss on a shared basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">For the reasons hereafter stated, we disagree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the Hospital\u2019s undertaking constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>other insurance within the meaning of National\u2019s other-insurance clause. In our view, there was no other insurance within the intendment of that clause for the first $100,000 of the loss. Therefore, National is exclusively liable for that portion of the settlement. As to the balance thereof, we are satisfied that under <em>Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>National and INA share responsibility on a prorated basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We start from the premise that so-called self-insurance is not insurance at all. It is the antithesis of insurance. The essence of an insurance contract is the shifting of the risk of loss from the insured to the insurer. The essence of self-insurance, a term of colloquial currency rather than of precise legal meaning, is the retention of the risk of loss by the one upon whom it is directly imposed by law or contract. <em>See, e.g., Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Marriott Homes, Inc., </em>286 <em>Ala. </em>231, 238 So.2d 730, 732 (1970); <em>Johnson v. Yellow Cab Company of Philadelphia, </em>456 <em>Pa. </em>256, 317 A.2d 245, 249 (1974). Clearly then, one may be regarded as a self-insurer as to any risk of loss to which he is subject and which is susceptible to insurance coverage but as to which he has not obtained such coverage. As a matter of colloquial usage, he is a self-insurer of that risk. But as a matter both of common sense and the fundamentals of insurance law, a failure to purchase obtainable insurance is not itself insurance. That failure simply and inevitably means that there is no insurance for that risk. Thus, the undertaking to self-insure cannot, by definition, be regarded as insurance. The same is true when only part of the risk of loss is shifted to an insurer. The insured\u2019s retained portion of the risk is the so-called \u201cdeductible\u201d amount, if any, and the extent to which the risk exceeds the policy limits. The insured is a \u201cself-insurer\u201d as to both retained portions of the risk. Neither, however, constitutes insurance, and it has indeed been held that a deductible from coverage, which can be loosely termed self-insurance, does not constitute other insurance within the meaning of a standard other-insurance clause, irrespective of the size of the deductible and whether or not the deductible amount is funded and admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>istered by an insurance company. <em>See State Farm Mut. v. Universal Atlas Cement, </em>406 So.2d 1184, 1186 (Dist.Ct.App.Fla.1982); <em>Pacific Power and Light Co. v. Transport Indemnity, </em>460 F.2d 959 (9 Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We are aware that within the general, imprecise and amorphous concept of self-insurance there is one type of self-insurance which does have a legally-recognized identity and a clearly defined consequence. We refer to the situation in which compulsory liability insurance is mandated by a statute which also provides that a person subject to the mandate may, in accordance with specified standards and upon a satisfactory showing of financial ability to bear the risk, be exempted from the obligation to purchase insurance upon issuance by a designated administrative officer or agency of a certificate of self-insurance. <em>See, eg., N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-52 (permitting the Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles to issue a certificate of self-insurance to serve in the place of the liability insurance mandated by the Motor Vehicle Security Responsibility Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-23, <em>et seq.); N.J.S.A. </em>48:4^12 (permitting the Commissioner of Insurance to issue a certificate of self-insurance to specified bus companies in lieu of any compulsory motor vehicle insurance); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-77 (permitting the Commissioner of Insurance to exempt an employer by written order from the obligation to insure his workers\u2019 compensation liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This qualified self-insurance, as it may be termed for convenience in reference, has been held to require the self-insurer to provide the public sought to be protected by the compulsory insurance with the same \u201ccoverage\u201d and incidents of \u201ccoverage\u201d as he would have had to have purchased but for the certificate of self-insurance. <em>See Comorote v. Massey, et al., </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124 (Law Div.1970) (qualified self-insurer pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-52 is subject to the omnibus coverage requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-46); <em>Transport of New Jersey </em>v. <em>Watler, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453 (App.Div.1978), aff\u2019d as modified 79 <em>N.J. </em>400 (1979); <em>Mortimer v. Peterkin, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598 (App.Div.1979) (qualified self-insurer pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:4r-12 is required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>afford uninsured motorist protection in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The substantial equivalence between compulsory insurance and a certificate of self-insurance <em>vis-a-vis </em>the public does not, however, necessarily support the corollary principle that as between insureds and insurers, qualified self-insurance constitutes other insurance within the meaning of standard other-insurance clauses. To the contrary, the weight of authority rejects the premise that qualified self-insurance is other insurance on the theory that self-insurance and insurance are mutually exclusive concepts. <em>See, e.g., United National Ins. Co. v. Philadelphia Gas Works, etc., </em>221 <em>Pa.Super. </em>161, 289 A.2d 179 (1972); <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Marriott Homes, Inc., supra, </em>286 <em>Ala. </em>at 231, 238 So.2d at 730; <em>Home Indemnity Company v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>314 <em>S.W.2d </em>861 (Tex.Civ.App.1958), writ of error and reh\u2019g den. 159 <em>Tex. </em>224, 317 <em>S.W.2d </em>515 (1958); <em>American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Missouri P. &amp; L. Co., </em>517 S.W.2d 110 (Sup.Ct.Mo.1975). <em>See also Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v. Insurance Co., etc., </em>595 F.2d 128, 143 n. 53 (3 Cir.1979). And see 8A <em>Appleman, Insurance </em>(1981), \u00a7 4912 at 508-511. See contra <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Market Insurance Co., </em>296 So.2d 555 (Dist.Ct.App.Fla.1974); <em>Southern Home Ins. Co. v. Burdette\u2019s Leasing, </em>268 <em>S.C. </em>472, 234 <em>S.E.2A </em>870 (1977); <em>United States Steel Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Co., </em>241 <em>Cal.App.2d </em>461, 50 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>576 (Dist.Ct.App.1966). We note that New Jersey apparently follows the minority view. <em>See Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v. Belford, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583 (App. Div.1972), certif. den. 63 <em>N.J. </em>502 (1972). We express no view as to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Thus, while there is support for the view that qualified self-insurance constitutes other insurance, we have been unable to find any authority at all for the thesis that any other kind of so-called self-insurance constitutes other insurance. Compare, for example, the two Florida cases cited <em>supra. </em>In <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Market Insurance Co., </em>296 So.2d at 555, qualified self-insurance was held to be \u201cother insurance.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>State Farm Mut. v. Universal Atlas Cement, </em>406 So.2d at 1184, a deductible of a million dollars was held not to be \u201cother insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The final question is whether there should be any different result when the nature of the \u201cself-insured\u201d risk of loss is an obligation to indemnify. We do not perceive any viable conceptual basis for ascribing different consequences to that risk of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">As we have noted, the Hospital is a nonprofit charitable corporation. Its own tort liability to its beneficiaries, based on respondeat superior, is limited to a maximum exposure of $10,000. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-8. Therefore, when it assumed the risk of loss in respect of the first $100,000 of liability for an employee\u2019s negligence, it was not, beyond $10,000, assuming its own risk but rather the risk of its individual employees. To that extent, therefore, its undertaking constitutes an indemnification of another for the consequences of the negligent conduct of the other for which it would not otherwise be answerable. As we understand the implication of National\u2019s argument, it is also contending that this indemnification by the Hospital constitutes other valid and collectible insurance of its insured, Panicucci.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">It is clear that all contracts of insurance are, basically, indemnity agreements. But all indemnity agreements are not insurance contracts. <em>See, e.g., Brotherton Const. Co. v. Patterson-Emerson-Comstock, </em>406 <em>Pa. </em>400, 178 A.2d 696, 697 (1962). As a matter of common understanding, usage, and legal definition, an insurance contract denotes a policy issued by an authorized and licensed insurance company whose primary business it is to assume specific risks of loss of members of the public at large in consideration of the payment of a premium. There are, however, other risk-shifting agreements which are not insurance contracts. These include the customary private indemnity agreement where affording the indemnity is not the primary business of the indemnitor and is not subject to governmental regulation but is merely ancillary to and in furtherance of some other independent transactional relationship between the indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>nitor and the indemnitee. The indemnity is, thus, not the essence of the agreement creating the transactional relationship but is only one of its negotiated terms. Illustrative of these non-insurance private indemnity agreements are those customarily contained in construction contracts in which the general contractor holds the owner harmless and the subcontractors hold the general contractor harmless. There are myriad other examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In our view, the Hospital\u2019s undertaking here was just such a private indemnity agreement. Clearly, it had no legal obligation to indemnify its employees for their own negligent conduct. Its undertaking to do so was a contractual matter incidental to and in furtherance of the employment relationship. Obviously as a matter of economic reality, health-care professionals employed by a hospital must be protected against the risk of loss resulting from their malpractice. They can obtain protection either by purchasing malpractice insurance themselves or by receiving protection as an incident of employment. Protection as an incident of employment can be afforded by the employer either by a private indemnity agreement or by providing insurance or, as here, by a combination of both. It was the Hospital\u2019s business decision to itself indemnify each employee for the first $100,000 of each claim and to shift to an insurance company the risk of loss for the next $400,000. The employee therefore had protection, albeit no insurance, for the first $100,000 but did have insurance for the next $400,000. We are persuaded that the Hospital\u2019s undertaking to indemnify its employees for the first $100,-000 without itself shifting that contractually assumed risk to an insurer no more constitutes \u201cother insurance\u201d than does any other failure to obtain insurance for an insurable risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We are in complete accord with the observation of the Alabama Supreme Court that the term \u201cother insurance\u201d as used in the typical other-insurance clause of an insurance policy means, when tested by the standard of usual and ordinary meaning, \u201canother policy of insurance covering the same risks.... \u201d <em>Universal Underwriters Insurance Co. v. Marriott </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Homes, Inc., supra, </em>238 <em>So.2d </em>at 732. We also regard this meaning as consistent with the basic function of all other-insurance provisions, which is to permit insurance companies to \u201cdecide among themselves which is to bear the incidence of a single loss, or whether it is to be shared and in what proportion.\u201d <em>Cozzi v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 529 (App.Div.1977). Hence other-insurance clauses by definition implicate other insurance policies and not uninsured assumptions of risk of loss. Thus, whether or not the ordinary meaning of other insurance is extended to include qualified self-insurance, it clearly cannot rationally be extended to include the so-called self-insured indemnification here. We therefore hold that there was no other insurance within the intendment of the National policy covering the negligence of Panicucci up to the first $100,000 of the loss. As to that portion of the loss, National, as the only insurer, is primarily liable. The obligation for the balance of the loss is the prorated responsibility of INA and National.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The judgment appealed from is reversed, and we remand for the entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
