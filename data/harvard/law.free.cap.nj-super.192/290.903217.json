THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF THE COURT\u2019S ERRORS WAS TO DEPRIVE DEFENDANT OF A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The State\u2019s theory against defendant essentially is that he conspired with Holcomb and others to rob the University Savings Bank in North Brunswick between August 27 and 28, 1980. Defendant\u2019s role was to provide transportation with his girlfriend\u2019s automobile. Almost immediately after the robbery, the getaway car crashed into a tree while the police were in hot pursuit. The four co-felons and occupants of the getaway car were arrested on August 28, 1980 or shortly thereafter. Defendant, however, was not arrested until December 30, 1980. After the arrest by the FBI in Trenton, defendant was turned over to Detective Zimmerman of the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Zimmerman transported defendant to the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s office. Defendant was asked to give a statement. The following colloquy ensued between defendant and Zimmerman before the statement, later admitted as evidence, was given:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Q. Would you be willing to answer some questions about that car [1969 Cadillac registered to Bernice Evans, defendant\u2019s girlfriend] and about anything that you can tell me about the bank robbery?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">A. I will do my best to cooperate in every way that I can. But I must follow my lawyer\u2019s advice and not sign anything without consulting him first.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Q. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Before I even talk to you about anything, what I\u2019d like to do is read your <em>Miranda </em>warning, the rights that you have while you\u2019re in this room, and these rights would be consistent, any time that you feel you don\u2019t want to continue to talk to us, you just state that, all right?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">A. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Q. First, you have the right to remain silent. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Q. Second, if you decide to make any statement, you must understand that it may later be used against you in the event of a trial. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Q. If you initially decide to make a statement but during the course of questioning decide you do not wish to continue, you have the right to stop. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">Q. Four. You have a right to have a lawyer present. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">Q. In the event you cannot afford counsel, the State will provide counsel. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-17\">Q. I\u2019d like you to look at this card that I just read to you, and if you would, I\u2019d like to ask you to sign it, put the time on and date it. Would you do that?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-19\">Q. All right. I\u2019ll put my initials on it, and Investigator Rizzo, you put your initials on the card.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-20\">A. Now, as far as we know, my attorneys are not in the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">Q. The only thing I can tell you which I do know is that an attorney by the name of William Kunstler, and another one by the name of Richard Malgran, M-a-l-g-r-a-n, of Venezia, Nolan offices in Woodbridge, New Jersey, have called the F.B.I. office in Trenton, and spoke with the agent in charge, Dave Williams, and asked if you were arrested, and Mr. Williams explained to both of them in my presence that you were arrested on the charges from Middlesex County, and that you were going to be released to us and transported to Middlesex County on these charges. To my knowledge, again, neither one are in the building now.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">A. <em>We have to put in the record that this statement has to stand the approval of the attorneys before we can submit it as evidence. </em>Like I said, I want to cooperate 100 percent, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to do nothin\u2019 that my attorneys would, you know, rule against. <em>So what I\u2019m saying is, let it show in the </em>record <em>that I\u2019m making this statement, voluntarily, with the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>understanding that my attorneys have the final say about my signature and whatever.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Q. All right. The only thing that I could comment on is that attorneys eventually will have the opportunity to <em>read the statements during discovery. </em>If they want to make any motions to the Courts about the statement, any legality of anything like that there\u2019s no problem as far as we\u2019re concerned. Again, as long as it\u2019s a voluntary statement, you still have the right at any time not to answer any question or to stop. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">A. Yes. You\u2019re saying this statement will not be given to the attorneys until the trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Q. No. The attorneys have a procedure that they go by that they follow the rules set down by the State of New Jersey\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">(Mr. Graves is now in the room.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Q. (Continued)\u2014that they follow the rule that they request from the Prosecutor\u2019s office all of the materials that\u2019s involved in the case and discoverable. Just walking in the door is Assistant Prosecutor Frank Graves. I believe with his knowledge of the law he could comment a lot better on it than I can. If you\u2019d direct your questioning to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">A. Mr. Prosecutor, we\u2019re saying here that we want to give a statement, but we want to know if my lawyers will have access to this statement or will they have to request the statement from your office before they get a chance to go over this?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">MR. GRAVES: No, that will be part of discovery. After it\u2019s typed up, everybody gets a copy. Just like your lawyer is going to get a copy of everything that everybody else has said. They will all get a copy of anything you said. Upshaw talked to us, they will all get copies when they get discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">THE WITNESS: Well, then as long as it\u2019s understood that I\u2019m making this statement with the understanding that I\u2019m not signing it. My lawyers must okay this, you know, before I can say, you know, this is it. In other words, I want to be as helpful as I can without, you know, the lawyers saying, hey, what are you doin\u2019? You didn\u2019t give us the statements. I don\u2019t want to get myself in trouble with them. <em>I just want to make sure that everybody is getting a fair shake, especially me.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">Q. Like I said, and I believe Mr. Graves, if he wants to comment on it, as long as it\u2019s a voluntary statement and you\u2019ve been read your rights, if at any time you feel you don\u2019t want to answer questions, you\u2019ve got the right to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">A. Okay. [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">Dickens gave an oral statement consisting of 21 transcribed pages. At trial, the prosecutor introduced the statement pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>63(7) to suggest to the jury that defendant lied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>when he denied knowing Holcomb and when he described the locations and movements of the 1969 Cadillac in August 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On this appeal, defendant first contends that his oral statement was admitted as evidence in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). He argues that his discussion with Zimmerman and Graves demonstrates that he did not understand the evidentiary impact of making the statement without the presence of his attorney; consequently, he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his Fifth Amendment rights. We find this argument to be persuasive and consistent with our holding in <em>State v. Fussell, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>14 (App.Div.1980). See <em>also Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 <em>U.S. </em>477, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The trial judge\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>35 (1968) is misplaced. In <em>McKnight </em>defendant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and he refused to make a statement because he wanted a lawyer present. No one attempted to take a statement and defendant was placed in the county jail. Approximately six or seven hours later, defendant sent the prosecutor a note saying it was \u201cvery important that I see him right away for he wanted me to answer some question....\u201d The prosecutor met with defendant the same day the note was received. After defendant expressed the desire to tell what he knew about the murder without the aid of counsel, he was questioned after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were again given to him. Defendant then gave a full confession. When he was asked to sign his statement, only then did he ask if his attorney could read it before he signed it. The statement was never signed. The court rejected defendant\u2019s contention of no waiver of his right to counsel. It said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">[T]he warnings were perfectly clear that anything he said could be used against him. It is absurd to suppose that a man who confessed and led the police to the murder weapon could have thought that none of that would matter if he declined to sign a statement embodying what he had said and done. Rather <em>his request at the end of the statement that his attorney see it before it is signed </em>reflected a desire to be assured that it fairly related his version of the criminal event .... [at 46-47; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In <em>Fussell </em>defendant was asked if he would give a statement after he had been given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Defendant responded \u201cI would like to wait for legal counsel after taking [sic], I would like him to read the statement before I answer.\u201d Defendant was then asked \u201cDon\u2019t you want to give us this statement?\u201d The answer was \u201cSure, I\u2019ll give you a statement.\u201d Defendant then confessed to the crimes. There, we held that the confession was inadmissible because it was obtained after defendant had asserted his right to counsel. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alq\">While defendant\u2019s request for counsel may have been somewhat ambiguous, nevertheless we deem it to have been a sufficient assertion of his right to counsel to have required Detective Clark to stop any further substantive interrogation until it was clearly determined that defendant desired to proceed without counsel. <em>See United States v. Riggs, </em>537 F.2d 1219, 1222 (4 Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Chansriharaj, </em>446 F.Supp. 107, 108 (S.D.N.Y.1978). In <em>Riggs </em>the court set forth what we believe to be the proper procedure to follow in circumstances similar to those present here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">[Wjhere a suspect makes a statement which arguably amounts to an assertion of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the interrogating agent recognizes that the statement is susceptible of that construction, his questioning with regard to the crime he is investigating should immediately cease and he should then inquire of the suspect as to the correct interpretation of the statement. Only if the suspect makes clear that he is not invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights should substantive questioning be resumed. [174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 21]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Here, we are satisfied that the attempts made by the detective and assistant prosecutor to clear up the ambiguity and contradiction by informing defendant that his attorney would get the statement in the discovery fails to overcome the presumption that defendant did not waive his right to counsel. <em>See North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>369, 373, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1755, 1757, 60 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>286 (1979). Before defendant was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he made known he was willing to cooperate \u201c[b]ut I must follow my lawyer\u2019s advice.... \u201d Immediately after he had been given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, defendant stated \u201c[w]e have to put in the record that this statement had to stand the approval of the attorney before we can submit it as evidence.\u201d In the face of these assertions by defendant, it was incumbent upon the interviewer to cease questioning defendant until his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>attorney arrived. We perceive no meaningful difference between a defendant who says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to give a statement without the presence of counsel\u201d and one who says \u201cI will give a statement provided that it is approved by my attorney before it can be used as evidence.\u201d In either event there is no waiver of the right to the presence of counsel. The assertion in either case is that the accused does not wish to deal with the police except through counsel. <em>See State v. McCloskey, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>18, 26, n. 1 (1982). Assuring defendant that any statement would be given to his attorney in discovery in the circumstances here presented is functionally equivalent to tricking defendant into answering questions, a practice condemned by <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny. It was clearly the perception of defendant that his statement could not be used as evidence if his attorney objected after receiving it in discovery. The police and the assistant prosecutor knew that defendant was proceeding on the basis of this erroneous assumption induced by the police interviewer. Where, as here, the circumstances cast doubt on the knowing and intelligent quality of the alleged waiver, there can be no waiver. <em>State v. McCloskey, supra </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We are unable to conclude that the admission of defendant\u2019s statement is harmless error. The proofs against defendant were extremely slender and only circumstantial. The use of the statement to show that defendant lied to the police about knowing Holcomb and about the movements of the getaway car was designed to inform the jury that defendant had a motive for lying. The motive was to cover up his involvement in the robbery. In these circumstances, the error requires reversal. <em>See State v. McCloskey, supra </em>at 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The remaining contentions raised are clearly without merit. The judgment of conviction is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for a new trial. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
