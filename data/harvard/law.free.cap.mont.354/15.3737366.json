We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erroneously interpreted the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201cexhibitors\u201d from \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, to exclude jockeys;</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in holding that the Jockeys were not entitled to recovery from Scottsdale, but stated that the Jockeys had a claim against the Montana board of horseracing;</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erroneously held that the special event participant exclusion and the athletic or sports participants exclusion in the commercial general liability insurance policy (CGL policy) are unambiguous;</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in holding that the special event participant exclusion and the athletic or sports participants exclusion did not violate the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b67 The material facts in this case are undisputed. The Jockeys, Giacomelli and Hamilton, suffered injuries in horse races at MetraPark in Billings, Montana, in September 2003. Yellowstone County owns and operates MetraPark. Yellowstone Horse Racing Alliance Inc. (Alliance) leased MetraPark from Yellowstone County to conduct the horse races in which the Jockeys were injured. The Jockeys sued Yellowstone County and Alliance for their injuries, alleging negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b68 Pursuant to a requirement of its lease agreement, Alliance purchased a CGL policy from Scottsdale. Yellowstone County is listed as an additional insured in the CGL policy. The CGL policy covers bodily injuries (not subject to any of numerous exclusions) arising from \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of MetraPark or any operations \u201cnecessary or incidental\u201d to MetraPark or the horse racing track. Among the exclusions are a \u201cspecial event participant exclusion\u201d and an \u201cathletic or sports participants\u201d exclusion. The special event participant exclusion specifies that the CGL policy does not provide coverage \u201cto any \u2018participant\u2019 arising out of: 1. The practicing for or participation of any person in any athletic event, contest, game, demonstration, exhibition, race or show covered by this policy.\u201d The exclusion then defines participant to \u201cinclude performers, stage-hands, volunteers, drivers, setup crew, pitcrew and other persons located in the pit area, security personnel, mechanics, stewards, officials or attendants, or any other person taking part in paragraph 1. or 2. above.\u201d The athletic or sports participants exclusion reads, \u2018With respect to any operations shown in the Schedule, this insurance does not apply to \u201cbodily injury\u2019 to any person while participating in any sports or athletic contest or exhibition.\u201d The schedule refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>operation of a \u201cHorse Racing Track.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b69 Pursuant to statute, Alliance and Yellowstone County submitted the CGL policy to the Montana board of horseracing. The board of horseracing approved the CGL policy and apparently issued a license to Alliance to conduct horse races.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b610 After the Jockeys sued, Alliance and Yellowstone County contacted Scottsdale about insurance coverage. Scottsdale, citing the special events participant exclusion and athletic and sports participants exclusion, responded that the CGL policy did not cover the Jockeys\u2019 injuries. Consequently, Scottsdale refused to defend or indemnify Alliance and Yellowstone County.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b611 Eventually, the Jockeys settled their suits against Alliance and Yellowstone. Pursuant to the settlements, Alliance and Yellowstone consented to the entry of judgments, the Jockeys agreed not to execute on the judgments, and Alliance assigned to the Jockeys any claims that it had against Scottsdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b612 The Jockeys then filed the present declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that the CGL policy covered their claims and that Scottsdale had a duty to indemnify and defend Alliance and Yellowstone County. Eventually, the Jockeys moved for summary judgment to invalidate the special events participant and the athletic or sports participants exclusions for violating public policy and to enforce the remainder of the CGL policy (to provide coverage). Scottsdale opposed the motion. The District Court denied the Jockeys\u2019 motion, ruling that the exclusions do not violate public policy and are unambiguous, and that Alliance and Yellowstone had no reasonable expectation that the CGL policy would cover jockeys. The Jockeys appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo to determine if it complied with Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P. <em>Natl. Cas. Co. v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla., </em>2001 MT 28, \u00b6 13, 304 Mont. 163, 19 P.3d 223. Viewing the evidence in the light most flattering to the non-moving party and indulging all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor, a court correctly grants summary judgment when the evidence presents no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Peyatt v. Moore, </em>2004 MT 341, \u00b6 13, 324 Mont. 249, 102 P.3d 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s interpretations of statutes and contracts for correctness. <em>Signal Perfection, Ltd. v. Rocky Mt. Bank </em>- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Billings, </em>2009 MT 365, \u00b6 10, 353 Mont. 237, 224 P.3d 604; <em>State v. Skyline Broadcasters, Inc., </em>2009 MT 193, \u00b6 12, 351 Mont. 127, 211 P.3d 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court erroneously interpreted the term \u201cexhibitors\u201d from \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, to exclude jockeys.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b616 The Jockeys\u2019 principal argument is that \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, mandates people licensed to conduct horse races to carry liability insurance covering jockeys. Consequently, they contend, the special event participant and athletic or sports participants exclusions are contrary to public policy and therefore invalid. Thus, they conclude, the Court should enforce the CGL policy-sans the exclusions-to allow the Jockeys to recover the amounts of their judgments from Scottsdale. The District Court nipped this argument in the bud by rejecting its first premise: that \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, mandates liability insurance coverage for jockeys. The Jockeys contend that this was error. The first question, consequently, is whether \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, mandates liability insurance coverage for jockeys.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b617 Section 23-4-205, MCA, reads, \u201cFor the protection of the public, exhibitors, and visitors, a person licensed to conduct a race meet or operate a simulcast facility under this chapter shall carry public liability insurance in an amount and form of contract approved by the board.\u201d The Jockeys insist that the term \u201cexhibitors\u201d should include jockeys. The District Court, in denying summary judgment to the Jockeys, did not define the term \u201cexhibitor,\u201d but concluded that it did not include jockeys. We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b618 Statutory interpretation, the goal of which is to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent, begins with the text of the statute. <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 22, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639; <em>Fliehler v. Unisured Employers Fund, </em>2002 MT 125, \u00b6 13, 310 Mont. 99, 48 P.3d 746. When the legislature has not defined a statutory term, we consider the term to have its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Czajkowski v. Meyers, </em>2007 MT 292, \u00b6 24, 339 Mont. 503, 172 P.3d 94. To determine the meaning of a statutorily undefined term, we may consider dictionary definitions, <em>e.g. Colmore v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2005 MT 239, \u00b6 72, 328 Mont. 441, 121 P.3d 1007, prior case law, <em>e.g. Associated Press v. Mont. Sen. Republican Caucus, </em>286 Mont. 172, 179-80, 951 P.2d 65, 69-70 (1997), and the larger statutory scheme in which the term appears, <em>e.g. In re Mental Health of E.T., </em>2008 MT 299, \u00b6 13, 345 Mont. 497, 191 P.3d 470. We may also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>consider similar statutes from other jurisdictions and legislative history for guidance in interpreting a statute. <em>Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. State, </em>2009 MT 5, \u00b6 20, 348 Mont. 333, 201 P.3d 132; <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Assn. v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 25, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b619 Here, the term \u201cexhibitor\u201d is not defined in Title 23, chapter 3, MCA, which regulates horseracing at which a pari-mutuel system of wagering is used. <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>defines \u201cexhibitor\u201d as one that \u201cexhibits (as in an exhibition).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>796 (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1961). The relevant definition of \u201cexhibit\u201d then is \u201cto present to view: show, display: as ... to show publicly: put on display in order to attract notice to what is interesting or instructive or for purposes of competition or demonstration.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>796. \u201cExhibition\u201d is defined as \u201ca public show or showing: as ... a public display of athletic or other skill often in the form of a contest or other game but usu. without importance with respect to winning or losing.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>796.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b620  Here, consonant with these dictionary definitions, we determine that the exhibitors of a horse race where pari-mutuel wagering occurs are those people who organize the horse race-not the jockeys, who are the participants in the exhibition. The legislature originally defined \u201crace meet\u201d as \u201cany exhibition of thoroughbred, purebred, and/or registered horse racing where the pari-mutuel system of wagering is used.\u201d 1965 Mont. Laws ch. 196, sec. 2(3). In light of this definition, we conclude that an \u201cexhibitor\u201d as originally used in \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, means one who exhibits \u201cas an exhibition.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>796. The exhibition is the entire spectacle of the horse race-not, as the Jockeys propose, the exhibition of the strength, speed, and endurance of each individual horse. The organizers of the race present this exhibition, not the individual jockeys.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b621 That the term \u201cexhibitor\u201d does not include participants finds support in similar racing statutes from neighboring jurisdictions. Colorado requires people licensed to conduct race meets to carry public liability insurance to protect \u201cthe public and the exhibitors, <em>contestants, </em>and visitors.\u201d Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 12-60-509(1) (2009) (emphasis added). New Mexico and Oregon have similar statutes that distinguish between exhibitors of races and participants in the races. <em>See </em>N.M. Stat. \u00a7 60-2D-12(A) (2009) (requiring licensees of pari-mutuel bicycle racing to carry public liability insurance \u201cfor the protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the public, exhibitors, <em>contestants, </em>visitors, other licensees and spectators\u201d (emphasis added)); Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 462.110(1), (5) (2007) (mandating race licensees to carry liability insurance coverage to protect \u201cthe public, and all members thereof, the exhibitors and visitors\u201d and additional insurance to protect \u201cjockeys and, if appropriate, drivers\u201d); <em>see also Ross v. Golden St. Rodeo Co., </em>165 Mont. 337, 348, 530 P.2d 1166, 1172 (1974) (Daly, J., dissenting) (referring to rodeo company, rather than bull rider, as exhibitor of bull).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">\u00b622 The Jockeys, in support of their contention that the term \u201cexhibitors\u201d includes jockeys, cite a number of cases in which courts refer to horse riders as exhibitors. We, however, find these cases distinguishable. In <em>Hoyt v. Northern Maine Fair Assn., </em>118 A. 290, 292 (Me. 1922), the Maine Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">Within the scope and purpose of the larger fairs is included another class of exhibitors invited for precisely the same purpose as those named, and, an important purpose of inviting this class is to offer such attractions and exhibitions as will appeal to the sporting sense of the public and to allure them to the fair grounds to witness the sports of the day. This class of exhibitors is composed of the horsemen, who come to exhibit their horses in the races and unquestionably furnish by far the most attractive display of the entire exhibition and become the most important source of revenue, a consideration not only desirable but essential to the success of most large fairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The court further explained that at a state fair the horsemen show horses, \u201cresults of good husbandry ..., including draught, family and trotting horses ... for the purpose of stimulating an interest and arousing increased activity in the departments of agricultural opportunity.\u201d <em>Hoyt, </em>118 A. at 292. In this context, the riders exhibit the qualities of the horses, and are rightly considered \u201cexhibitors.\u201d We cannot say that this is the case with jockeys who race horses at meets where the purpose is not to display the \u201cresults of good husbandry\u201d to stimulate interest and activity in agriculture, but rather to allow parimutuel wagering. Thus, we find the statements from <em>Hoyt </em>unpersuasive in this case. For this same reason, we also distinguish <em>Haynes v. County of Missoula, </em>163 Mont. 270, 517 P.2d 370 (1973), <em>Lindemann v. American Horse Shows Assn., </em>164 Misc. 2d 937 (N.Y. Sup. 1994), and <em>Morrison v. Union Park Assn., </em>149 A. 804 (Me. 1930), which all involve either county fairs or horseshows, but not horse races with pari-mutuel betting.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b623 The Jockeys next advance that the District Court erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>disregarded Rule 32.28.501(10), Admin. R. M., when it interpreted \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA. This rule reads, \u201cEvery track licensee shall have on file with the board at least ten days prior to the opening of any race meeting, a copy of an adequate liability insurance contract <em>covering all persons at the race meeting.\u201d </em>Admin. R. M. 32.28.501(10) (2009) (emphasis added). The Jockeys assert that this rule supports their reading of \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA. Citing <em>Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6 29, 338 Mont. 402, 168 P.3d 615, the Jockeys further contend that the District Court was required to take judicial notice of the rule and enforce it (presumably by invalidating the special event participant exclusion and the athletic or sports participants exclusion) because it does not add to the requirements of \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, and because it helps effectuate the intent of \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA. We are unpersuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b624 Assuming for the sake of argument that Rule 32.28.501(10), Admin. R. M., requires coverage of jockeys,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then it would be invalid and not subject to judicial notice. In <em>Ruhr </em>we wrote, \u201cAn administrative rule will be considered invalid \u2018only upon a clear showing that the regulation adds requirements which are contrary to the statutory language or that it engrafts additional provisions not envisioned by the legislature.\u201d\u2019 <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>Christenot v. State, </em>272 Mont. 396, 400, 901 P.2d 545, 548 (1995)). Here, given our conclusion that \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, does not require persons licensed to conduct a horse race to carry public liability insurance for jockeys, Rule 32.28.501(10), Admin. R. M.-as interpreted by the Jockeys-would engraft an additional requirement onto the statute. Consequently, if Rule 32.28.501(10), Admin. R. M., required liability insurance covering jockeys, then it would be invalid and irrelevant to the District Court\u2019s analysis. Thus, the Jockeys\u2019 argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b625 [2] For the foregoing reasons we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that the term \u201cexhibitors\u201d-as used in \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA-does not include jockeys. Therefore, the District Court correctly dismissed the Jockeys\u2019 argument that the special event participant and athletic and sports participants exclusions violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b626 <em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred in holding that the Jockeys are not entitled to recover from Scottsdale, but stated that they had a claim against the state board of horseracing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u00b627 In its order denying the Jockeys\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the District Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-3\">The statute itself requires the insurance contract obtained for horseracing to be <em>\u201cin an amount and form of contract approved by the board.\u201d </em>The State of Montana approved the insurance contracts submitted by the County and the Alliance for several years. The evidence of this approval is in the licenses being issued and horse races being conducted. If the insurance policies had defective coverage based on certain exclusions, the Plaintiffs have a claim against the board, not the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">(Citation omitted.) The Jockeys assert that the District Court erred in suggesting that they had a claim against the board of horseracing. The correct remedy, the Jockeys maintain, when an insurance contract violates Montana law, is to void the offending provision and enforce the remainder of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b628 This argument has no merit because we have already concluded that the exclusion in the CGL policy did not violate Montana law. Accordingly, the Jockeys\u2019 proposed remedy is not available. Furthermore, the District Court\u2019s suggestion that the Jockeys have a claim against the board of horseracing was merely obiter dicta. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1102 (defining \u201cobiter dictum\u201d as \u201c[a] judicial comment made while delivering a judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the case and therefore not precedential\u201d). As such, it is not an appropriate basis for an assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b629 <em>Issue 3: Whether the District Court erroneously held that the special event participant exclusion and the athletic or sports participants exclusion in the CGL policy are unambiguous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b630 The Jockeys next contend that the District Court erred in holding that the special event participant exclusion and the athletic or sports participants exclusion are unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b631 When the language of an insurance contract is ambiguous, courts construe the ambiguous provisions against the insurer and in favor of extending coverage. <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 275, \u00b6 23, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389. Courts do so to further the object of the insurance contract, which is to give protection, <em>Natl. Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co. v. George, </em>1998 MT 205, \u00b6 12, 290 Mont. 386, 963 P.2d 1259, and because insurers draft the language of insurance contracts, <em>see Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 22, 298 Mont. 393, 995 P.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b632 A contract provision is ambiguous if it is susceptible, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>violence, to more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Libby Lumber Co. v. Pacific Sts. Fire Ins. Co., </em>79 Mont. 166, 175, 255 P. 340, 343 (1927). Whether a provision is ambiguous is a question of law, which courts resolve from the viewpoint of the layperson \u201cuntrained in the law or the insurance business.\u201d <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23. \u201cAmbiguity does not exist just because a claimant says <em>so,\u201d Holmstrom v. Mut. Benefit Health &amp; Accident Assn., </em>139 Mont. 426, 428, 364P.2d 1065, 1066 (1961), or just because the parties disagree as to the meaning of the contract provision, <em>Dollar Plus Stores, Inc. v. R-Mont. Assocs., L.P., </em>2009 MT164, \u00b6 17,350 Mont. 476,209 P.3d 216. Further, courts will not distort contractual language to create an ambiguity where none exists. <em>See Johnson v. Eq. Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>142 Mont. 128,131,381 P.2d 778,779 (1963) (emphasizing that courts may not \u201cseize upon certain and definite covenants expressed in plain English with violent hands, and distort them so as to include a risk clearly excluded by the insurance contract\u201d (quoting <em>Mitchell v. German Com. Accident Co., </em>161 S.W. 362, 363 (Mo. App. 1913))).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b633 Here, we need not address the special events participant exclusion, because the athletic or sports participants exclusion is dispositive. The athletic or sports participants exclusion provides, \u201cWith respect to any operations shown in the Schedule, this insurance does not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 to any person while participating in any sports or athletic contest or exhibition.\u201d The schedule contains the following provision: \u201cDescription of Operations: Horse Racing Track.\u201d \u00b634  This provision applies generally to operations of the horse racing track. Here, the Jockeys\u2019 theories of liability all pertain to Alliance\u2019s operations of the racetrack. As a result of Alliance\u2019s mismanagement of the racetrack, the Jockeys allege, they were injured while participating in horse races. The J ockeys\u2019 theories of liability and allegations fit neatly within the language of the athletic or sports participants exclusion. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err in holding that the Jockeys\u2019 claims are excluded under the unambiguous terms of the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b635 The Jockeys argue that the athletic or sports participants exclusion is ambiguous because it could also be reasonably interpreted to \u201capply only to injuries arising from the natural or inherent risks of horse racing,\u201d but not to \u201cinjuries allegedly caused by an insured\u2019s breach of duty to design, inspect, maintain, or operate the race track in a safe condition before the race.\u201d We find no support for this interpretation in the language of the exclusion. Indeed, to read such a limitation into the athletic or sports participants exclusion would be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>distort or \u201cdo violence\u201d to the language of the policy. This we decline to do. <em>Johnson, </em>142 Mont, at 131, 381 P.2d at 779; <em>Libby Lumber, </em>79 Mont, at 175, 255 P. at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">\u00b636 The Jockeys further contend that the athletic and sports participants exclusion is ambiguous because there is a split in authorities that have construed similar contractual provisions. The Louisiana Court of Appeals, the Jockeys point out, held that a similar exclusion did not exclude coverage of injuries suffered by a jockey during a practice race where the jockey alleged \u201cnegligent failure to maintain the racetrack and failure to provide adequate medical care following the accident.\u201d <em>Colson v. La. St. Racing Commn., </em>726 So. 2d 432, 433-35 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1999). Subsequently, the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Florida distinguished <em>Colson </em>and held that a similar exclusion excluded coverage of injuries suffered by pugilists during a match where the fighters alleged negligence by the promoters before and after the fight. <em>Natl. Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Adoreable Promotions, </em>Inc., 451 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1307-10 (M.D. Fla. 2006). This split in authority, the Jockeys advance, demonstrates that the exclusion in the CGL policy here is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b637 The Jockeys\u2019 argument requires us to clarify a statement from prior case law. In <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 29, 293 Mont. 140, 974 P.2d 623, we stated, \u201cThe fact that courts are split as to the meaning of \u2018accident\u2019 further confirms our belief that the term is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d The Jockeys read this statement, as subsequently repeated in <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 15, 298 Mont. 393, 995 P.2d 460, to mean that a split in authority with respect to a contractual term conclusively demonstrates that the term is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b638 While we did ultimately conclude in both <em>Pablo </em>and <em>Wendell </em>that the terms in question were ambiguous, <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 41, we do not read these cases to establish the rule that the Jockeys advocate. In both <em>Pablo </em>and <em>Wendell, </em>we noted the split in authority as additional support for concluding that there was ambiguity. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 29. Thus, neither case stated that a split in authority conclusively demonstrates ambiguity. Furthermore, the rule advanced by the Jockeys is inconsistent with the role of the Court in determining whether a contract is ambiguous. As the Maryland Court of Appeals observed, \u201cSurely we would be abdicating our judicial role were we to decide such cases by the purely mechanical process of searching the nation\u2019s courts to ascertain if there are conflicting decisions.\u201d <em>Sullins </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>667 A.2d 617, 624 (Md. 1995) (quoting <em>Lower Paxton Township v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>557 A.2d 393, 400 n. 4 (Pa. Super. 1989)). We determine that the better rule is that a split in authority over the interpretation of language in an insurance policy does not conclusively establish ambiguity, but rather is a <em>factor </em>that we will consider in determining whether ambiguity exists. <em>See Sullins, </em>667 A.2d at 624 (announcing similar rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b639  Applying this rule, we conclude that the split in authority with respect to the athletic or sports participants exclusion does not render the policy language in this case ambiguous. In particular, we do not find <em>Colson, </em>a decision from an intermediate court of appeals in Louisiana, persuasive or analogous to this case. First, the court in <em>Colson </em>failed to analyze the language of the exclusion, and simply made the conclusory statement that the exclusion did not apply because the plaintiffs claims were \u201cindependent\u201d of his participation in the race. 726 So. 2d at 435. Moreover, in <em>Colson, </em>unlike the present case, the plaintiff alleged harm caused by inadequate medical care after the race, and the court stated that the plaintiffs \u201cpersonal injuries sustained in the accident which occurred during [the] race are clearly excluded from coverage.\u201d <em>Colson, </em>726 So. 2d at 435. Here, conversely, the Jockeys have only alleged injuries that occurred during the races. Thus, we find <em>Colson </em>of little help in interpreting the athletic or sports participants exclusion. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that the athletic or sports participants exclusion is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b640 <em>Issue 4: Whether the District Court erred in holding that the special event participant exclusion and the athletic or sports participants exclusion did not violate the reasonable expectations of Alliance and Yellowstone County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b641 The Jockeys\u2019 final argument is that the District Court erred in holding that the special event participant exclusion and the athletic or sports participants exclusion violated their reasonable expectations of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b642 \u201cThe reasonable expectations doctrine provides that the objectively reasonable expectations of insurance purchasers regarding the terms of their policies should be honored notwithstanding the fact that a painstaking study of the policy would have negated those expectations.\u201d <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Livengood, </em>1998 MT 329, \u00b6 32, 292 Mont. 244, 970 P.2d 1054. The genesis of this doctrine is \u201cthe judicial recognition that most insurance contracts, rather than being the result of anything resembling equal bargaining between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>parties, are truly contracts of adhesion in which many insureds face two options: (1) accept the standard insurance policy offered by the insurer, or (2) go without insurance.\u201d <em>Couch on Insurance </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 22:11, 22-23 (3d ed., Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, eds., Thompson West 1997) (citation omitted); <em>see also Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle, </em>202 Mont. 173, 180-81, 656 P.2d 820, 824 (1983) (applying reasonable expectations doctrine to invalidate exclusion becaus\u00e9 automobile insurance policy was \u201cadhesion contract\u201d). The reasonable expectations doctrine, however, \u201cis inapplicable where the terms of the policy at issue clearly demonstrate an intent to exclude coverage.\u201d <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6 33. This is because expectations \u201ccontrary to a clear exclusion are not \u2018objectively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co., </em>257 Mont. 354, 359, 849 P.2d 190, 194 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b643  Here, Alliance and Yellowstone County expected the CGL policy to cover injuries to jockeys. This expectation, however, was not objectively reasonable. Contrary to the Jockeys\u2019 assertions, we have concluded that the athletic or sports participants exclusion unambiguously expresses an intent to exclude coverage for jockeys injured while participating in horse races. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b644 The Jockeys, noting that both exclusions refer to \u201cexhibitions,\u201d assert that it is inconsistent to interpret the exclusions to apply to jockeys while interpreting \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, which is for the protection of \u201cexhibitors,\u201d to not apply to jockeys. We are unconvinced by this argument. First, the CGL policy excludes coverage for participants in a \u201csports or athletic contest <em>or </em>exhibition\u201d (emphasis added). The horse races in which the Jockeys were injured qualify as \u201csports or athletic contests.\u201d Therefore, we need not address the term \u201cexhibition\u201d as used in the CGL policy exclusions. Second, the Jockeys\u2019 charge of inconsistency is illusory. According to our interpretation of \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, a jockey participating in an exhibition of horseracing is not an \u201cexhibitor,\u201d but a \u201cparticipant.\u201d The \u201cexhibitor\u201d is the organizer of the horse race. Given these definitions, there is no inconsistency in applying the athletic or sports participants exclusion to jockeys, as participants in an exhibition, while not applying the protection of \u201cexhibitors\u201d in \u00a7 23-4-205, MCA, to jockeys (because the organizers, not the jockeys, are the exhibitors).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b645 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\"> Rule 32.28.501(10), Admin.

In any case, we need not resolve this issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
