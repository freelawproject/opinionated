As a condition of his suspended sentence, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ordered that Brown reimburse the State for the costs of his court-appointed counsel by making payments to the Ravalli County Clerk of Court. Brown appeals this portion of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal, as rephrased by this Court, is: Did the District Court err when it ordered Brown to reimburse the State for the cost of his court-appointed counsel by making payments to the Ravalli County Clerk of Court rather than the Office of the State Public Defender (OSPD)?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b63 On November 28, 2008, Brown was charged by Information with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs (DUI) in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Because this was Brown\u2019s fourth offense, the charge was raised to a felony. Brown originally pled not guilty, but, pursuant to a plea agreement, he eventually pled guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b64 At the June 24, 2009 sentencing hearing, the court ordered that Brown be committed to the Department of Corrections for thirteen months to be followed by a five-year suspended sentence. Because the court determined that Brown had the ability to pay his attorney\u2019s fees, it ordered the OSPD to calculate the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and that those fees should be paid through the Clerk of Court at a rate set by Brown\u2019s probation officer. The following exchange then took place between the court and Brown\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">MS. JOHNS [Brown\u2019s counsel]: Objection, Your Honor, to the Clerk of Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">THE COURT: The payments will be paid to the Clerk of Court, who in turn will keep a record of those and send them to the [OSPD],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">MS. JOHNS: It\u2019s my understanding that those are to be paid directly to the [OSPD].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">THE COURT: Well, that\u2019s not my understanding. They are payable to the [OSPD]. There\u2019s no reason they cannot or should not be paid through the Office of the Clerk of District Court. We have no way of knowing whether they were paid; and if so, how much, unless they are paid through the clerk. They will maintain an independent record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">MS. JOHNS: Would there be an order regarding the distribution of amounts paid. I understand that the Clerk of Court, there\u2019s a set order as to how his payments are to be disbursed for certain fees and fines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">THE COURT: How they allocate the payments as to what he owes should be governed by statutes. You are welcome to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>input with the clerk as to how they do that, but I believe that\u2019s all set by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Thereafter, in its written Judgment and Commitment, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">The Defendant will reimburse the State of Montana $500.00 for the cost of his Court-appointed attorney. All payments will be made by money order or cashiers check and sent to the Ravalli County Clerk of District Court. 205 Bedford. Suite D. Hamilton. MT 59840. who in turn will keep a record of these payments and forward them to the [OSPD].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b65 Brown now appeals this condition of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b66 The interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and construction of the statute is correct. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534 <em>(citing Miller v. Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121; <em>Thompson v. State, </em>2007 MT 185, \u00b6 14, 338 Mont. 511, 167 P.3d 867).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err when it ordered Brown to reimburse the State for the cost of his court-appointed counsel by making payments to the Ravalli County Clerk of Court rather than the OSPD?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">\u00b68 Brown contends on appeal that the District Court had no statutory authority to order repayment of attorney\u2019s fees to the Clerk of Court, and that repayment must be made, instead, directly to the OSPD. Brown\u2019s ability to pay the $500 in attorney\u2019s fees is not disputed. Rather, Brown argues that the court\u2019s order \u201cis contrary to the mandatory language\u201d of \u00a7 46-8-114, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">Time and method of payment. When a defendant is sentenced to pay the costs of assigned counsel pursuant to 46-8-113, the court may order payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. <em>Payments must be made to the office of state public defender, </em>provided for in 47-1-201, and deposited in the account established in 47-1-110 [the public defender account in the State special revenue fund]. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">\u00b69 The State argues that Brown relies on \u00a7 746-8-114, MCA, in isolation, while ignoring other statutory provisions that provide district courts with authority to order payments to be paid through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>their clerks of court. The State contends that district courts have the authority to use their own clerks of court to monitor and transmit court-ordered payments, including payments to the OSPD. To that end, the State relies on the following statutory provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">When a defendant who is sentenced to pay the costs of assigned counsel defaults in payment of the costs or of any installment, the court on motion of the prosecutor or on its own motion <em>may require the defendant to show cause why the default should not be treated as contempt of court and may issue a show cause citation or an arrest warrant requiring the defendant\u2019s appearance.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A57\">Section 46-8-115(1), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Except as otherwise provided in 46-18-236(7)(b) and this section, if a defendant is subject to payment of restitution and any combination of fines, costs, charges under the provisions of 46-18-236, or other payments, 50% of all money collected from the defendant must be applied to payment of restitution and the balance must be applied to other payments in the following order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">(a) payment of charges imposed pursuant to 46-18-236;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">(b) payment of supervisory fees imposed pursuant to 46-23-1031;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">(c) payment of costs imposed pursuant to 46-18-232 or 46-18-233;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">(d) payment of fines imposed pursuant to 46-18-231 or 46-18-233; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">(e) any other payments ordered by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Section 46-18-251(2), MCA,</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">\u00b610 This Court\u2019s rules of statutory construction require consideration and application of all three statutes if possible. A presumption exists that the Legislature does not pass meaningless legislation; accordingly, this Court must harmonize statutes relating to the same subject, as much as possible, giving effect to each. <em>Oster v. Valley County, </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 76, 140 P.3d 1079 (citing <em>Chain v. Montana Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>2001 MT 224, \u00b6 15, 306 Mont. 491, 36 P.3d 358). This Court also presumes that the Legislature acted with deliberation and with full knowledge of all existing laws on a subject. <em>State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448 (citing <em>Ross v. City of Great Falls, </em>1998 MT 276, \u00b6 17, 291 Mont. 377, 967 P.2d 1103).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">\u00b611 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the plain language of \u00a7 46-8-114, MCA, demonstrates a legislative intent that funds intended for the reimbursement of a court-appointed attorney be deposited, without allocation to other fees and costs, into the public defender account in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the State special revenue fund. If the Legislature had wanted to make the reimbursement of court-appointed attorney\u2019s fees subject to \u00a7 46-18-251(2), MCA, it would not have used the language that it did in \u00a7 46-8-114, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b612 Consequently, we agree with Brown that the OSPD statutory scheme prevails over the more general statutes pertaining to clerks of court. <em>See State v. Oie, </em>2007 MT 328, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 205, 174 P.3d 937 (citing \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA (\u201cWhen a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d)). That is not to say, however, that, in this case, the various statutes cited by the parties cannot be reconciled to give effect to all as the State suggests. <em>See Brendal, </em>\u00b6 29 (citing \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cWhere there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b613 While we conclude in the instant case that the District Court was not prohibited under our statutory scheme from ordering payments to be made to the Clerk of Court in order for the court to monitor whether Brown indeed made the required payments, we also point out that there are other options available to sentencing courts. As Brown points out in his brief on appeal, since the reimbursement of court-appointed attorney\u2019s fees was made a condition of his probation, Brown\u2019s probation officer could have monitored whether Brown was making the payments as required. In addition, if the court or the prosecution required, there was nothing preventing OSPD from advising them when or if it had not received payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b614  Nevertheless, we hold that the District Court did not err in requiring Brown to reimburse the State for the cost of his court-appointed counsel by making payments to the Clerk of Court rather than the OSPD. However, we further hold that because of the specific OSPD statutes, \u00a7 46-8-114, MCA, in particular, the clerk cannot allocate those funds as provided in \u00a7 46-18-251(2), MCA. Instead, the clerk must transmit all of the funds earmarked as reimbursement for court-appointed counsel to the OSPD and the OSPD must deposit those funds into its trust account in the State special revenue fund as provided in \u00a7 47-l-110(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
