These rules read in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">Rule 3.4-Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-18\">(a) unlawfully obstruct another party\u2019s access to evidence, unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>having potential evidentiary value, or counsel or assist another person to do any such act....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Rule 8.4-Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"AIY\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b62 Olson contested the charges. On January 17 and 18, 2008, the Commission on Practice (Commission) held a hearing on ODC\u2019s complaint. Testimony and documentary evidence was presented at the hearing. On July 28,2009, the Commission issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation regarding ODC\u2019s complaint against Olson. The Commission concluded that ODC had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Olson had violated Rules 3.4 and 8.4(b)-(d) of the MRPC. The Commission recommended that ODC\u2019s complaint be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u00b63 The ODC now obj ects to the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation of the Commission. For the reasons set forth below, we deny ODC\u2019s objections and adopt the Commission\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">\u00b64 Olson was admitted to the practice of law in Montana in 1993. Olson was the Chief Public Defender in Cascade County until February 28, 2006. On or about December 25, 2005, police in Great Falls, Montana, searched the apartment of Shaun and Kelly Mortenson, seizing various items of evidence related to child pornography. The Mortensons were charged with 38 counts of sexual abuse of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">\u00b65 Olson undertook the representation of Kelly Mortenson. Neither Olson nor anyone else in his office had ever represented a client in a child pornography case. Olson met with Kelly for 2 to 3 hours after her arrest and began to form a compulsion defense to the charges against her. Olson also retained the services of Dan Kohm (Kohm), a retired detective from the Cascade County Sheriffs Office and an experienced investigator. On or about January 9, 2006, Kohm and Olson were contacted by Kelly\u2019s mother regarding items left in the Mortensons\u2019 apartment that the defense should look at. Olson and Kohm confirmed that an eviction notice had been issued, and were further aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the apartment had been searched and released by the Great Falls Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b66 Olson and Kohm went to the Mortensons\u2019 apartment. While there, they collected items they believed would be potentially helpful in formulating a defense. Among the items taken were 13 photographs which had been apparently downloaded from the Internet. All the removed items were bagged, tagged, sealed as evidence, inventoried, and stored under lock and key in Kohm\u2019s office. The 13 photographs were introduced by ODC at the hearing in this matter and have been included in the record on appeal. They depict young girls in various erotic poses. In many of these pictures, the genital areas of the girls are exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b67 At the hearing, Olson and Kohm testified that they did not believe any of the photographs were child pornography. Olson further testified that he did not believe any of the items were contraband. However, Olson did harbor concerns that someone else might think so in light of the language in \u00a7\u00a7 45-620(l)(f) and -625, MCA (2005). These statutes read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">45-5-620.- Definitions. As used in 45-5-625, the following definitions apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">(1) \u201cSexual conduct\u201d means actual or simulated ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">(f) lewd exhibition of the genitals, breasts, pubic or rectal area, or other intimate parts of any person ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">45-5-625. Sexual abuse of children. (1) A person commits the offense of sexual abuse of children if the person ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">(d) knowingly processes, develops, prints, publishes, transports, distributes, sells, exhibits, or advertises any visual or print medium, including a medium by use of electronic communication, as defined in 45-8-213, in which a child is engaged in sexual conduct, actual or simulated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">(e) knowingly possesses any visual or print medium, including a medium by use of electronic communication, as defined in 45-8-213, in which a child is engaged in sexual conduct, actual or simulated....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">\u00b68 Kohm also expressed concerns to Olson about whether they could be subject to criminal culpability for possessing the photographs. Accordingly, Olson sought the advice and counsel of Tony Gallagher (Gallagher), the Chief Federal Defender in the District of Montana, who had extensive experience in handling child pornography cases. Gallagher advised Olson to seek a protective order in the event someone might consider the items child pornography. At the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Gallagher testified that such orders are commonplace in these matters and are obtained ex parte from the court. Gallagher also testified that Olson did not believe he was in possession of contraband or child pornography. Gallagher further testified that Olson had an obligation to gather items in preparation of a defense, and did not have a duty to turn over the information at that point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b69 Based on Gallagher\u2019s advice, Olson sought and received a protective order from Cascade County District Court Judge Thomas M. McKittrick authorizing him and Kohm to retain possession of the seized items. Judge McKittrick testified at the hearing that he believed Olson was an aggressive defense attorney and needed to investigate the case adequately. Judge McKittrick also stated that the criminal statutes noted above could expose criminal defense lawyers to criminal liability when investigating charges against their clients. Judge McKittrick expressed the view that these statutes could potentially have a chilling effect on the conduct of criminal defense attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"AUe\">\u00b610 In early 2006, Olson retained forensic psychologist Dr. Michael J. Scolatti to evaluate his client, review the evidence, and advise him on the compulsion theory of his defense. Dr. Scolatti reviewed the photographs, opined that none of the photographs were child pornography, and agreed with Olson\u2019s compulsion theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"Axa\">\u00b611 On January 17, 2006, Cascade County Attorney Brant Light informed Olson via email that the Mortensons\u2019 case would likely \u201cgo federal\u201d and that the state charges would probably be dismissed. That same month, Olson was hired as the state training coordinator for the Office of the State Public Defender. By reason of the email and Olson\u2019s new job, he did not go forward with his defense of Kelly Mortenson. Olson started his new job on March 1, 2006, and left the Cascade County Public Defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b612 Olson did not turn over any of the seized evidence to law enforcement officials, or advise them of the existence of this evidence prior to leaving the public defender\u2019s office. After Olson left, Kelly Mortenson\u2019s case was assigned to Carl Jensen (Jensen). Olson attempted to talk to Jensen about the matter, but Jensen did not have time to discuss it and simply asked for a memo. Olson prepared an email memo on the case. Sometime after reading the email, Jensen learned of the existence of the seized evidence. Jensen contacted Kohm and ordered him to take the items out of the tagged and secured envelopes and turn them over to County Attorney Light. Jensen did not review any of the evidence, which included some of Kelly Mortenson\u2019s private writings, along with the photographs. Kohm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>objected to Jensen\u2019s request but did carry it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b613 When County Attorney Light received the material, he turned it over to the Great Falls Police Department. At the hearing, County Attorney Light testified that he never had any thought of prosecuting Olson for possessing the material.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b614 Marcia Hurd is the Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted Kelly Mortenson in federal court. AUSA Hurd testified at the hearing that most of the photographs had already been found elsewhere by the police in their search of the apartment. Because the items had been removed from the tagged and sealed envelopes at Jensen\u2019s request, Hurd was unable to use any of the recovered items in the federal case. However, she clearly testified that she had sufficient evidence to prosecute and convict. Furthermore, Brian Norcross represented Kelly Mortenson in the federal trial, and independently developed the same compulsion defense formulated by Olson in response to the state charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b615 ODC\u2019s complaint alleged that Olson violated MRPC 3.4 when he \u201cunlawfully obstructed another party\u2019s access to evidence and/or concealed documents or other materials having potential evidentiary value.\u201d The complaint alleged Olson violated MRPC 8.4(b), referencing the criminal offense of \u201ctampering with or fabricating physical evidence\u201d in \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA. This statute reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">45-7-207. Tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. (1) A person commits the offense of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">(a) alters, destroys, conceals, or removes any record, document, or thing with purpose to impair its verity or availability in such proceeding or investigation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u00b616 Based on ODC\u2019s references to this statute in conjunction with the purported MRPC 8.4 violation, the Commission inferred that ODC was alleging that Olson violated \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA. The complaint also alleged Olson violated MRPC 8.4(c) by virtue of his \u201cdishonest and deceitful\u201d conduct. The violation of MRPC 8.4(d) allegedly occurred because Olson\u2019s conduct in this matter was \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\u00b6 17 At the hearing, the Commission received testimony from Professor Norm Lefstein (Lefstein), former Dean of the Indiana University School of Law, and an expert on professional responsibility and defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>representation in criminal cases. Lefstein was familiar with the Montana criminal statutes, the Model Penal Code upon which Montana\u2019s criminal statutes are based, the MRPC, and the American Bar Association\u2019s (ABA) Criminal Justice Standards. Lefstein opined that the drafters of the Model Penal Code never considered the impact that a tampering with evidence offense could have on criminal defense attorneys, or the possibility this offense could be used against a criminal defense attorney. Lefstein also reviewed portions of the ABA\u2019s Criminal Justice Standards pertaining to the possession of items of physical evidence in connection with an ongoing criminal matter. Under ABA Defense Function Standards 4-4.6(a) and 4-4.6(c), Lefstein opined that Olson was not required by law or the court to turn the physical items over to law enforcement or the prosecution during the time he worked on this case. These Criminal Justice Standards provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">Defense counsel who receives a physical item under circumstances implicating a client in criminal conduct should disclose the location of or should deliver that item to law enforcement only: (1) if required by law or court order, or (2) provided in [4-4.6(d)],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Defense Function Standard 4-4.6(a), Physical Evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Defense counsel may receive the item for a reasonable period of time during which defense counsel: (1) intends to return it to the owner; (2) reasonably fears that return of the item to the source will result in destruction of the item; (3) reasonably fears that return of the item to the source will result in physical harm to anyone; (4) intends to test, examine, inspect, or use the item in any way as part of defense counsel\u2019s representation of the client; or (5) cannot return it to the source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Defense Function Standard 4-4.6(c), Physical Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u00b618 In its findings, the Commission specifically found that \u201cthe fact that Olson obtained a court protective order to retain the items is totally inconsistent with the intent required under the tampering with physical evidence statute.\u201d While the Commission noted there was no \u201cbright line\u201d rule in the MRPC or model rules directly bearing on this case, it found the testimony of Lefstein and consideration of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards helpful. The Commission noted that the duty to investigate criminal cases is a \u201cvery broad responsibility and the failure to perform said duty would be a serious failure upon the part of defense counsel.\u201d Further, the Commission noted the ABA\u2019s recognition of diligent investigation, and the importance of a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>lawyer taking possession of material produced by his client in order to make a judgment about its possible utility in defending his client. In comparing Olson\u2019s conduct to the ABA Criminal Justice Standards noted above, the Commission concluded that his conduct was a \u201ctext book example\u201d of the type of functioning expected of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AI3\">\u00b619 Additionally, the Commission noted that the case before it involved a complicated area in which the lawyer\u2019s judgment must be given some leeway and understanding. The Commission also noted testimony to the effect that there was \u201cbad blood\u201d between Jensen and Olson prior to Jensen\u2019s handing of the materials over to County Attorney Light.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b620 In its conclusions of law, the Commission concluded that Olson had a \u201cgood faith belief\u2019 that the items taken from the Mortenson apartment were possibly supportive of the defense, needed for examination and evaluation, contained privileged attorney-client information, and were not child pornography or contraband. The Commission noted that Olson had an obligation to provide competent representation to his client, and did so in trying to establish a compulsion defense. The Commission also concluded Olson had a good faith belief that he could not reveal the information in this case, except as required by a discovery statute or court order. In this case, no such statute or order applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b621 With regard to the allegations under MRPC 3.4, the Commission concluded that Olson did everything to comply with this rule as he preserved the evidence in a manner that was safe, and sought a protective order for its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b622 Under MRPC 8.4(b) and (c), the Commission found no misconduct by Olson. The Commission found no unlawful obstruction of a party\u2019s access to evidence, and no evidence of Olson\u2019s intent to commit the offense of tampering with evidence. In order to establish a violation MRPC 8.4(d), the Commission, citing <em>People v. Jaramillo, </em>35 P.3d 723 (Colo. O.P.D.J. 2001), concluded that ODC must prove some nexus between the conduct charged and an adverse effect upon the administration of justice. The Commission determined that Olson\u2019s conduct had no adverse effect on the administration of justice, and did not affect the federal case against the Mortensons.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b623 The Commission concluded by noting that ODC has the burden of proof in a lawyer disciplinary proceeding, and must make its proof by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 11(7) of the Montana Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement; <em>Matter of Halprin, </em>244 Mont. 363, 367, 798 P.2d 80, 82 (1990); <em>Matter of LaFountain, </em>226 Mont. 296, 302, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>738 P.2d 472, 475 (1987). The Commission determined that the ODC had simply failed to meet its burden, and had not proven that Olson\u2019s conduct was fraudulent, intentional, or the result of improper motives.</p>\n<p id=\"AP-\">\u00b624 This Court possesses original and exclusive jurisdiction and responsibility in all matters involving the disciplining of lawyers in the state of Montana. <em>In re Engel, </em>2008 MT 42, \u00b6 3, 341 Mont. 360, 177 P.3d 502. We review de novo the Commission\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations, and weigh the evidence upon which the Commission\u2019s findings rest. <em>In re Engel, </em>\u00b6 3 (citing <em>In re Potts, </em>2007 MT 81, \u00b6 32, 336 Mont. 517, 158 P.3d 418).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b625 ODC\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s recommendation and findings boils down to two main points. First, ODC claims that the Commission erred when it failed to determine whether or not the 13 photographs were child pornography. Instead, the Commission merely determined that Olson had a good faith belief that these items were not child pornography or contraband. ODC has included the photographs in the record on appeal and asks this Court to review them and make a determination as to whether they are actually contraband. ODC claims this is an important issue which was not determined in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b626 Second, ODC contends that because these items were child pornography, they were either the fruits or instrumentalities of a crime, and that Olson was required to turn them over to the authorities under the MRPC. In this connection, ODC asserts that a violation of Rule 3.4(a) does not require a violation of a criminal statute. With regard to MRPC 8.4, ODC generally contends that Olson had an ethical obligation to turn the contraband over to the authorities, and that his \u201cgood faith belief\u2019 that the items were not in fact contraband cannot defeat this obligation. ODC argues that the evidence in this case demonstrates that Olson knew he had child pornography because he obtained an ex parte order for its possession. ODC contends that the fact the apartment had been searched and released by the police does not defeat Olson\u2019s duty under the MRPC. ODC also disputes the correctness of the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Olson believed in good faith that he did not need to turn these items over in the absence of a court order or applicable discovery statute. Again, ODC argues that a criminal statute or court order would not obviate Olson\u2019s ethical duties in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b627 Finally, ODC disputes the contention that Olson\u2019s conduct in this case was a \u201ctext book example\u201d of what the ABA Criminal Justice Standards require. ODC contends that there is nothing in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>standards which permitted Olson to illegally possess the contraband. Further, ODC disputes the tenability of the claim that Olson had to retain the evidence in order to inspect it. ODC argues that it was apparent that the evidence in this case was child pornography, and that Olson could have still used this material even if it was in possession of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b628 In <em>Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, </em>378 U.S. 184, 84 S. Ct. 1676 (1964), Justice Potter Stewart famously said of illegal pornography that \u201cI know it when I see it....\u201d <em>Jacobellis, </em>378 U.S. at 197, 84 S. Ct. at 1683 (Stewart, J., concurring). ODC has included the disputed photographs on file, and it is difficult for the Court to comprehend how anyone would not \u201cknow\u201d that these are examples of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b629  However, the dispositive question in this case is not whether the seized items in this case are child pornography. Rather, it is whether ODC has demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that Olson violated MRPC 3.4(a) and 8.4(b)-(d), as alleged in ODC\u2019s complaint. In its complaint, ODC charged that Olson violated MRPC 3.4 by unlawfully obstructing another party\u2019s access to evidence and/or concealing documents or other materials having potential evidentiary value. The Commission correctly determined that Olson did not engage in such conduct. The items were stored, bagged, and tagged, and kept under lock and key in Kohm\u2019s office. Olson was not, at that point in the proceedings, obligated to turn the items over to the police or prosecutor by virtue of a statute or court order. Moreover, Olson had a duty to conduct an investigation on behalf of his client and prepare a defense. While we have not yet formally adopted the ABA\u2019s Criminal Justice Standards in Montana, the Commission properly relied on them for guidance in analyzing this matter. ODC has simply failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that this conduct amounted to unlawfully obstructing or concealing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b630 The violation of MRPC 8.4(b) was premised on allegations that Olson committed the criminal act of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. There is no evidence in this record of Olson\u2019s intent to tamper with or fabricate physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b631 The violation of MRPC 8.4(c) was premised on Olson\u2019s dishonest and deceitful conduct. While ODC disputes whether Olson could have had a good faith belief that the photographs were not contraband, it has failed to demonstrate that Olson\u2019s conduct in this case was dishonest or deceitful. And although we do review the Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations de novo, the fact remains that the Commission is still in the best position to assess and observe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>demeanor of the witnesses in this case. <em>See Matter of Matt, 252 </em>Mont. 345, 354, 829 P.2d 625, 630 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b632  The MRPC 8.4(d) violation requires conduct on Olson\u2019s part which is \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d In order to establish a violation of this rule, the Commission concluded that ODC must demonstrate some nexus between Olson\u2019s conduct and an adverse effect upon the administration of justice. <em>See Jaramillo, </em>35 P.3d at 731. We agree with the Commission that ODC has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Olson\u2019s conduct met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b633 Finally, the Dissent opines that there is evidence in the record that Olson misled the District Court into believing he had obtained the photographs from the County Attorney\u2019s files, and that such conduct implicates MRPC 8.4(c) and (d). See Dissent, \u00b6 44-45. If the record before us supported a finding that such conduct occurred, we would not hesitate to find a rule violation. However, because there is not clear and convincing evidence in the record that Olson in fact made such misrepresentations to the court, we decline to find that this violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b634 For the foregoing reasons, we adopt the recommendation of the Commission and conclude that ODC has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Olson violated MRPC 3.4 and 8.4 in his conduct in this matter. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u00b635 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint against Eric Olson in this matter be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u00b636 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court is directed to mail copies of this Order to Eric Olson, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular mail to Eric Olson\u2019s attorney of record, the Chairman and the Secretary of the Commission on Practice, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and the Executive Director of the State Bar of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">DATED this 31st day of December, 2009.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-11\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b391-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"AMz\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">\u00b637 While I concur with the majority decision, the dissent raises valid considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">\u00b638 Initially, in my view it is immaterial in this case whether the photographs in question are pornographic. The District Court\u2019s protective order insulated Olson from criminal prosecution as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>claims of ethical mi sconduct. It is difficult to conclude that Olson was either unlawfully obstructing access to evidence or unlawfully concealing material having potential evidentiary value, as required by M. R. P. C. 3.4(a), when he brought the matter to the attention of the District Court and obtained the order. Moreover, the record does not contain sufficient evidence to conclude Olson misled the District Court. Judge McKittrick testified that he specifically requested not to be told about the facts because he was sitting on the pending case against Olson\u2019s client. Thus, I concur with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b639 The dissent is correct, however, that as a general matter, \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA, as well as M. R. P. C. 3.4(a), prohibit a criminal defense counsel from concealing contraband and physical evidence of a client\u2019s criminal conduct. This obligation pertains whether or not counsel intends to use the subject evidence at trial. Moreover, neither federal procedures nor ABA criminal justice standards is determinative of the rule in Montana. Unlike the federal system, Montana has a mutual discovery policy; <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-15-323, MCA; <em>State, ex rel. Carkulis v. District Court, </em>229 Mont. 265, 746 P.2d 604 (1987). If the case against Olson\u2019s client had proceeded in state court and if Olson had intended to use the photographs at trial, he would have been required to disclose them.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b392-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AlD\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b640 As noted in the Court\u2019s Opinion, our review of disciplinary proceedings is de novo.

Accordingly, based on the record, and with due respect to the Court and the Commission on Practice (COP), I cannot join the Court\u2019s Opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b641 Olson\u2019s defense derails over his Clintonesque claim that he did not believe that the 13 photographs at issue were child pornography. Similarly, the OOP\u2019s decision runs off the track for the same reason-that \u201cOlson had the good faith belief that the items taken from the Mortenson apartment following the search and release of the scene by the police were ... not child pornography or contraband.\u201d COP, Conclusion of Law No. 3. Since the COP never determined whether the photographs at issue were or were not child pornography, Opinion, \u00b6 25, the adjudicative panel was hardly in a position to conclude anything about Olson\u2019s good faith belief in possessing it or determining the <em>bonafides </em>of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b642 Suffice it to say that the photographs at issue are of preadolescent girls: one is dressed in a French maid\u2019s costume, others are completely naked, and others are partially clothed. All are posed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>erotically, and the photographs focus on the girls\u2019 exposed genitals and breasts. If these photographs are not child pornography under \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-620(1)(e) and 45-5-625(l)(e), MCA (2005), then I am at a loss to know what constitutes child pornography. At least the Court and I agree on that. Opinion, \u00b6 28. Indeed, I believe that any \u201cgood faith\u201d conclusion to the contrary would be absurd. <em>See Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S. Ct. 1676, 1683 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"AAH\">\u00b643 The COP, however, failed to make this elemental determination, and, as a result, rendered its decision on a faulty underlying premise-Olson\u2019s good faith belief. The COP\u2019s decision errs in its deference to Olson, and the Court\u2019s decision fails in its deference to the COP. In my view, Olson, an experienced criminal defense attorney, could not hold a good faith belief that the photographs of which he took possession were not child pornography and, thus, were not contraband and evidence of the criminal acts of his client. Indeed, the photographs were exactly the sort of child pornography which formed the basis of the charges against Olson\u2019s client. More to the point, if Olson really believed, in good faith, that the photographs were not child pornography, then he had no need to obtain the protective order from Judge McKittrick in order to retain possession of the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">\u00b644 Having concluded that the photographs were contraband and evidence, I also agree with Disciplinary Counsel that Olson violated Montana Rules of Professional Conduct (M. R. P. C.) 3.4(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Rule required that Olson make the photographs available to the County Attorney. The offense of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence under \u00a7 45-7-207(l)(a), MCA, is committed when one <em>conceals </em>evidence in an official proceeding or investigation. There is no exception in this criminal statute for the possession by defense counsel of actual <em>evidence </em>of the criminal conduct at issue. Regardless of what the ABA Criminal Justice Standards might suggest as \u201cguidelines,\u201d these cannot supersede Montana\u2019s statutes. I am, thus, persuaded that once a criminal defense attorney comes into possession of physical evidence of his or her client\u2019s criminal conduct, that he or she is neither legally permitted under \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA, nor ethically privileged under M. R. P. C. 3.4(a), to conceal that evidence from the authorities and from the prosecutor. I have a hard time understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>how, if defense counsel comes into possession of the bloody knife used to commit a homicide, that he or she can legally and ethically conceal that evidence from the police and prosecutor. While it goes without saying that the defendant is entitled to all exculpatory evidence in the hands of the prosecutor, <em>State v. Thompson, </em>2001 MT 119, \u00b6 31, 305 Mont. 342, 28 P.3d 1068, I believe that the law, likewise, requires that the prosecutor be entitled to inculpatory physical evidence and contraband in the hands of the defense, <em>see Clutchette v. Rushen, </em>770 F.2d 1469, 1472-73 (9th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1088, 106 S. Ct. 1474 (1986) (holding that a lawyer\u2019s conduct in possessing evidence of a crime is not protected by the Sixth Amendment right to counsel). Moreover, a lawyer\u2019s conduct in holding fruits and instrumentalities of a crime is not protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>Wemark v. State, </em>602 N.W.2d 810, 816 (Iowa 1999). That the former evidence may \u201cchill\u201d the prosecution and latter evidence may \u201cchill\u201d the defense, <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 9, should not take precedence over the fact that our criminal justice system is fundamentally charged with searching for and finding the \u201ctruth.\u201d Or, so we claim. <em>See e.g. State v. Waters, </em>228 Mont. 490, 495, 743 P.2d 617, 620 (1987) (\u201cThe purpose of Montana\u2019s discovery scheme is to enhance the search for truth.\u201d); <em>State v. Dezeeuw, </em>1999 MT 331, \u00b6 16, 297 Mont. 379, 992 P.2d 1276 (holding that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s eyewitness to the altercation, when his only defense was self-defense, hindered the search for truth and, therefore, was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"AvB\">\u00b645 The same is true here. The photographs were clearly evidence of the charges filed by the Cascade County Attorney against Olson\u2019s client, and Olson had the legal and ethical obligation to make the photographs available to the prosecution. I agree with Disciplinary Counsel that Olson violated M. R. P. C. 3.4(a). We are not cited to any authority that permits a lawyer defending or prosecuting a criminal case to break the law in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b646 Similarly, Olson was charged with violating M. R. P. C. 8.4(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even though Olson was never charged with violating \u00a7 45-7-207(l)(a), MCA, that is not a bar to concluding that he, nonetheless, violated this Rule. <em>See generally ABA Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct </em>579 (6th ed. 2007). As already noted, having concealed evidence of his client\u2019s criminal conduct, I conclude that Olson violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>this Rule as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b647 Finally, as to the ex parte, sealed protective order which Olson obtained from Judge McKittrick, there is evidence in the record that Olson misled the court into believing that the photographs were obtained from the County Attorney under that office\u2019s open-file policy. In regards to his conversation with Olson about the need for a protective order, Judge McKittrick testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">I said, \u201cHave you gone through discovery, did you get an open file from the County Attorney\u2019s Office?\u201d... And he said, \u201cYes, open file, yes,\u201d and I said something to the effect, \u201cDo you have what may be considered child pornography?\u201d and he said, \u201cWell, look at the Code,\u201d and he said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m very, very concerned about that....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b648 M. R. P. C. 8.4(c) makes it professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation ....\u201d Likewise, M. R. P. C. 8.4(d) proscribes a lawyer from \u201cengaging] in conduct that is prejudical to the administration of justice ....\u201d I conclude that these Rules were violated by Olson\u2019s lack of candor with Judge McKittrick concerning where and how he obtained the photographs. I also conclude that Judge McKittrick\u2019s testimony clearly and convincingly demonstrates that he was under the false impression that Olson obtained the photographs from the County Attorney\u2019s Office. Obviously, Olson did not obtain the photographs by way of the County Attorney\u2019s open-file policy; and Olson was ethically obligated to be candid and truthful with the trial court when he applied for the order of protection. Attorneys should not put trial judges in the position of issuing orders based on the court\u2019s misapprehension of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b649 In summary, on the facts of this case and on the record before us, I conclude that Disciplinary Counsel got it right. I would reverse and remand to the COP for further proceedings and a recommendation of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b650 Therefore, respectfully, I dissent from our decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-4\"> M.R.P.C. 3.4(a) provides that a lawyer shall not \u201cunlawfully obstruct another party\u2019s access to evidence, unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value, or counsel or assist another person to do any such act...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-5\"> M.E.P.C. 8.4(b) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201ccommit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustwort\u00eddness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
