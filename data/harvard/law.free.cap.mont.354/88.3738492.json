We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are restated on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">\u00b63 I. Does the enforcement of <em>Schmill I </em>and <em>Schmill II </em>violate the due process rights of the Responding Insurers?</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\u00b64 II. Does Cassandra Schmill (Schmill) have standing to pursue global common fund benefits and an attorney fees lien on the fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">\u00b65 This is the third time we have seen this litigation. In <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MT 80, \u00b6 23, 315 Mont. 51, 67 P.3d 290 <em>(Schmill I), </em>we held that allowing for apportionment deductions for nonoccupational factors in the Occupational Disease Act (ODA) but not in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA) constituted a violation of the equal protection guarantee in the Montana Constitution. <em>Schmill I, </em>\u00b6 23. We held that the ODA\u2019s apportionment provisions in \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, were unconstitutional. <em>Schmill I, \u00b6 </em>23.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">\u00b66 In the second appeal, <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2005 MT 144, \u00b6 28, 327 Mont. 293, 114 P.3d 204 <em>(Schmill II), </em>we held that the decision in <em>Schmill I </em>is retroactive to all cases not yet final or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>settled at the time of its issuance. We further held that Schmill\u2019s attorneys properly requested common fund attorney fees and that the common fund created in <em>Schmill I </em>results in a global lien for the benefit of all claimants affected by the decision. <em>Schmill II, \u00b6 </em>28.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b67 Six months after <em>Schmill II </em>was decided, the WCC issued summonses to more than 500 insurers regarding their obligation under <em>Schmill II </em>to identify and pay past Schmill-type claims. Responding Insurers comprise 96 of those insurers and self-insured employers. Responding Insurers moved to dismiss. The WCC referred these issues to Special Master Jay Dufrechou. On July 29, 2008, the WCC entered an \u201cOrder Adopting Order of Special Master,\u201d in which the WCC denied the Responding Insurers\u2019 motion and certified the issues as final for purposes of appeal pursuant to ARM 24.5.348(2). The Responding Insurers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b68 We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Lanes v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2008 MT 306, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 10, 192 P.3d 1145; <em>Van Vleet v. Mont. Assn. of Counties Workers\u2019 Comp. Trust, </em>2004 MT 367, \u00b6 9, 324 Mont. 517, 103 P.3d 544. We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Lanes, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Van Vleet, </em>\u00b6 9. Substantial credible evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Lanes, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>S.L.H. v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2002 MT 362, \u00b6 42, 303 Mont. 364, 15 P.3d 948). If there is conflicting evidence, we consider whether \u201csubstantial evidence supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, not whether the evidence might support contrary findings.\u201d <em>Caekaert v. State Compen. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>268 Mont. 105, 110, 885 P.2d 495, 498 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u00b69 <em>Does the enforcement of Schmill I and Schmill II violate the due process rights of the Responding Insurers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">\u00b610 The Responding Insurers argue that the WCC\u2019s enforcement of <em>Schmill I </em>and <em>Schmill II </em>violates due process under the Montana and United States Constitutions. Responding Insurers argue that they were not named parties and were not given notice or opportunity to be heard when this Court found \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, unconstitutional and when we determined that <em>Schmill I </em>created a global common fund. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>They aver that the summons, which they call \u201cafter-the-fact notice,\u201d failed to satisfy the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">\u00b611 The WCC held that it is not the Responding Insurers\u2019 status as either a party or nonparty that determines their duty to pay benefits, but rather that a vested right exists for beneficiaries as a matter of law and imposes a corresponding duty on Responding Insurers to retroactively pay all Schmill-type benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b612 We addressed this type of vested right in <em>Murer, </em>in which we considered workers\u2019 compensation claims in relation to a temporary cap in benefits articulated in statute. <em>Murer v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>283 Mont. 210, 942 P.2d 69 (1997). We concluded that State Fund was \u201cobligated to increase benefit payments to a substantial number of claimants who were neither parties to, nor directly involved in the <em>Murer </em>litigation.\u201d <em>Murer, </em>283 Mont. at 215, 942 P.2d at 72. We further held that \u201cclaimants established a vested right on behalf of the absent claimants to directly receive immediate monetary payment of past due benefits underpayments,\u201d and concluded the insurer \u201cbecame legally obligated to make the increased benefits payments.\u201d <em>Murer, </em>283 Mont. at 223, 942 P.2d at 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b613 While <em>Murer </em>addresses a single insurer scenario, the decision establishes the principle that a right to past benefits due arises automatically. Once retroactivity is established, beneficiaries are not required to file a second claim. Qualifying individuals have already filed claims and are entitled to benefits under the statute, <em>regardless of which insurer they happen to be insured under. </em>The beneficiaries\u2019 right to increased benefits arises automatically and the same is true of all insurers\u2019 responsibility to pay each beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b614 This understanding of the relationship between insurers\u2019 statutory obligations and beneficiaries\u2019 automatically-vested rights is buttressed by our decisions following the <em>Murer </em>trilogy. We specifically considered retroactivity in <em>Ruhd v. Liberty NW Ins. Corp., </em>2004 MT 236, 322 Mont. 478, 97 P.3d 561. In the WCC case prompting <em>Ruhd, </em>a permanently and totally disabled claimant filed a petition for hearing before the WCC seeking payment of an impairment award from the insurer, Liberty Northwest. The WCC had previously concluded that permanently totally disabled claimants whose employers were insured by the State Fund were not entitled to impairment awards. <em>Rausch v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2001 MTWCC 15. Both <em>Ruhd </em>and <em>Rausch </em>were appealed to this Court. We reversed the WCC\u2019s decision in <em>Ruhd, </em>holding: \u201cAs soon as we decided <em>Rausch, </em>however, liability for immediate payment of impairment awards was established against <em>all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>insurers.\u201d Ruhd, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b615  The <em>Murer </em>and <em>Ruhd </em>holdings confirm that claimants have a vested right to payment of past due benefits, regardless of which insurer is responsible. Due process is not violated when a court construes the meaning of a statute applicable to all workers\u2019 compensation insurers bound by uniform laws. Once all potential beneficiaries are granted a vested right, which was manifested in <em>Schmill II, </em>a corresponding duty to pay on the part of all insurers arises automatically as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b616 The Responding Insurers also argue that the parameters of \u201cpaid in full\u201d are unclear. We decline to rule on this issue at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b617 <em>II. Did Schmill have standing to pursue a claim for common fund benefits and enforce a common fund attorney fees lien on the fund?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b618 Responding Insurers argue Schmill lacks standing because she does not allege a personal injury traceable to the Responding Insurers\u2019 conduct. The Insurers argue that all of Schmill\u2019s specific claims were resolved in <em>Schmill I </em>and she failed to appeal the WCC\u2019s decision regarding the award of attorney fees. While Schmill seeks to enforce common fund entitlements and the petitioner\u2019s attorney fees lien, Responding Insurers argue that she has no interest in the outcome of the former and no actual property interest in the latter. That interest, they aver, belongs to her counsel, Laurie Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b619 Responding Insurers have misidentified the legal nature of a common fund attorney fees lien. Our <em>Schmill </em>decisions resulted not only in an entitlement to benefits, but an entitlement to payment of benefits owed. The common fund consists of <em>Schmill </em>claimants\u2019 benefits. By filing an attorney fees lien against this fund, Wallace initiated an in rem action. This is an action that simply adjudicates the status of a particular subject matter; here, the common fund from which the fees will be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b620  Schmill\u2019s standing to bring an in rem action to enforce the common fund attorney fees lien is reinforced by our <em>Murer </em>decision, in which we held: \u201c[w]hen a party, through active litigation, creates a common fund which directly benefits an ascertainable class of nonparticipating beneficiaries, those non-participating beneficiaries can be required to bear a portion of the litigation costs, including reasonable attorney fees.\u201d <em>Murer, </em>283 Mont. at 223, 942 P.2d at 76. The common fund includes benefits payable from all insurers who had previously apportioned occupational disease benefits. In essence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lien does not simply attach to Schmill\u2019s benefits alone. It attaches to the entire common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">\u00b621 For the above reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, RICE, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
