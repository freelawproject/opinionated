Appellants John Doe (Doe), Ray St. Onge (St. Onge), and Loius Goaziou (Goaziou), all held the rank of lieutenant in Cascade County and brought similar claims against the defendants. These individuals appeal from the decision of the Eighth Judicial District Court which, by summary judgment, dismissed most of their claims. We affirm in part, and reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">\u00b63 <em>Issue One: Were Deputies Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka required to exhaust the Collective Bargaining Agreement grievance procedure before pursuing their political discrimination, wage, and related claims </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>in the District Court?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">\u00b64 <em>Issue Two: Does the Montana Human Rights Act constitute the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for the claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka, as well as sheriffs\u2019 lieutenants Doe and St. Onge and detention lieutenant Goaziou, precluding any other constitutional, statutory, or tort claims which are premised upon their Montana Human Rights Act claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOG\">\u00b65 <em>Issue Three: Were all of the Appellants deprived of their constitutional rights to a jury trial, access to the courts, and full legal redress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b66 Appellants\u2019 complaints involve proceedings at the local administrative level, before the Montana Human Rights Bureau (HRB), and in both state and federal courts. A summary of the procedural history related to five of the Appellants\u2019 HRB claims is set forth in <em>Edwards v. Cascade Co., </em>2009 MT 229, 351 Mont. 360, 212 P.3d 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b67 At the time of the 2004 sheriffs primary election in Cascade County, Appellants Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka were full-time deputy sheriffs covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Doe and St. Onge were sheriff lieutenants, and Goaziou was a detention staff lieutenant. These latter three positions (Doe, St. Onge, and Goaziou) were not covered by the CBA. Doe used a fictitious name due to the nature of his work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All six Appellants actively supported the losing candidate for sheriff in the Democratic primary election. Respondent Dave Castle (Castle) won the primary election, defeating Sheriff Funyak. There was no Republican opponent. When Funyak resigned as sheriff, Castle was sworn in and immediately appointed Clyde \u201cBlue\u201d Corneliusen (Corneliusen) as undersheriff. The Appellants allege the undersheriff soon expressed and undertook to carry out Castle\u2019s retaliatory objective: \u201cI won\u2019t be done with any of the Funyak supporters until they are either out of this f-ing office or in their place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b68 All of the Appellants except Deputy Edwards ultimately resigned from their employment with Cascade County Sheriffs Department and Cascade County (collectively referred to as the \u201cCounty\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b69 The contracted terms of the CBA define the circumstances under which deputy sheriffs covered by the CBA must file a written grievance. A \u201cgrievance,\u201d as defined in the CBA, \u201cis limited to a complaint or request of an Employee which involves the interpretation of, application of or compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.\u201d CBA, Art. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b610 The terms of the 2004-2005 CBA define \u201cEmployee\u201d as full-time regular deputy sheriffs represented by the Cascade County Deputy Sheriffs Association for the purposes of collective bargaining. The \u201cAssociation\u201d refers to the Cascade County Deputy Sheriffs Association. The \u201cEmployer\u201d is defined as the Board of Commissioners of Cascade County and the Cascade County Sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b611 The management rights and statutory duties of the office of the sheriff are specifically excluded from the CBA grievance procedure. CBA, Art. 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201coffice of the sheriff\u2019 is not defined in the CBA. Promotions are specified as a management right of the sheriff. CBA, Art. 7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b612 The CBA contains a non-discrimination clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">It is the permanent policy of the Employer to provide equal opportunities for employment, retention, and advancement to all Employees regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, marital status or <em>political belief. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">The Employer will not discriminate against any Employee because of Association membership or activity and the Association will not discriminate against any Employee because of lack of membership or lack of activity in the Association. CBA, Art. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcW\">\u00b613 Article 16 of the CBA requires the Employer to pay wages to employees \u201ccalculated according to applicable Montana State Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAB\">\u00b614 To initiate a CBA grievance, a dispute must be submitted in writing \u201cto the Lieutenant who is the grievant\u2019s immediate supervisor.\u201d CBA, Art. 10. Five progressive resolution levels exist in the CBA\u2019s grievance process, culminating in binding arbitration. CBA, Art. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Grievance History.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">\u00b615 Appellants Edwards and Kohm filed grievances in early October 2004 with the Board of Commissioners for Cascade County, and claimed violations of the County\u2019s promotion policies. Edwards asserted Undersheriff Corneliusen failed to follow accepted procedure for considering Edwards as a candidate for promotion from Deputy Coroner to Chief Deputy Coroner. Kohm alleged Sheriff Castle failed to follow proper process in considering Kohm as a candidate for promotion from sergeant to lieutenant. In December 2004, the Board of County Commissioners found in favor of Edwards and Kohm and directed the promotion processes be restarted and redone.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b616 Appellant Zrowka wrote a letter to Sheriff Castle expressing concerns over the elimination of an evidence technician/photo lab technician position. Zrowka delivered copies of this letter to the County Attorney\u2019s office and to the human resources officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2p\">\u00b617 In late October 2004, Edwards and Kohm also filed complaints of discrimination with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (Department) alleging that they were subjected to employment discrimination based on their political beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b618 In December 2004, Doe, Goaziou, and Zrowka filed similar complaints of discrimination with the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Human Rights Bureau Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b619 In April 2005, the HRB issued its report finding reasonable cause that Edwards was subjected to discrimination, and the HRB retained jurisdiction. On that same date, the HRB issued a report finding no reasonable cause to support Kohm\u2019s complaint, and dismissed it. The Department issued Kohm a Notice of Dismissal, accompanied by a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter informing Kohm he could pursue his complaint of discrimination in district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u00b620 In June 2005, the HRB found a lack of reasonable cause to support the complaints of Doe, Goaziou, and Zrowka. Those complaints of discrimination were dismissed, and \u201cright to sue\u201d letters were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\u00b621 In July 2006, the HRB issued its final order and judgment for Deputy Edwards, resulting in a $40,948.83 award for emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>damages and loss of past wages, a $795.42 per month award of future wages for a year, health care costs for anxiety and depression, and restoration to duty status. The HRB decision permanently enjoined the County from further adverse discriminatory employment action based upon political ideas or beliefs. Neither party appealed this award. Although Edwards prevailed before the HRB on his claim that he was unlawfully retaliated against because of his political beliefs and ideas, he contends he is entitled to pursue independent constitutionally-based claims, including constitutionally-based privacy claims which derive from wrongful disclosure of his private personnel matters and false allegations that he used marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b622 Before the HRB investigations were completed, Edwards and Kohm filed this lawsuit in District Court alleging violations of their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association under the Montana Constitution and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, in addition to Edwards\u2019 alleged right to privacy violation. The First Amended Complaint added Doe, Goaziou and Zrowka as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Montana District Court Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b623 Because federal civil rights violations were alleged under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the County removed all of these claims to federal court. The County then filed a motion in the United States District Court to stay the federal court proceedings on the ground that the administrative proceedings under the Montana Human Rights Act had not been exhausted and finalized. In its motion to stay, the County argued the gravamen of Appellants\u2019 claims was grounded in discrimination. The County asserted the Montana Human Rights Act, codified at Title 49, MCA (MHRA), provides the exclusive remedy for illegal discrimination, and in any event, the MHRA required exhaustion of its informal and formal administrative proceedings before these matters could proceed in a district court setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b624 Before the United States District Court issued a ruling on the County\u2019s motion to stay, Appellants determined that their allegations of violations of civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 were redundant with their claims under the Montana Constitution and sought leave to file their Third Amended Complaint which dismissed their \u00a71983 claims. Appellants concurrently moved to remand this case to the state district court. The United States District Court granted Appellants\u2019 motion to file the Third Amended Complaint and remanded this case to the Montana Eighth Judicial District Court in Cascade County.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b625 The three Appellants who were deputy sheriffs (Edwards, Kohm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Zrowka) subsequently sought leave to file their Fourth Amended Complaint to add statute-based wage claims, alleging they \u201crecently learned information which, if true, supports a claim that the County has been paying them less than the amounts required by law for deputies sheriff....\u201d The District Court granted leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">\u00b626 In April 2006, the County for the first time raised the defense that the three Appellants who were deputy sheriffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the requirements of the CBA Appellants initially did not oppose the addition of this affirmative defense and filed a notice so indicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b627 In May 2006, the Fifth Amended Complaint added St. Onge as a plaintiff. St. Onge alleged his constitutional rights were violated, he was forced to resign, and is owed wages due. St. Onge admits he filed no discrimination claim under the MHRA. He disputes, however, that the exclusive remedy provision of the MHRA preempts his constitution-based political retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b628 In July 2006, the County requested dismissal of the political discrimination and wage claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka because of their failures to exhaust the remedies under the CBA. Appellants opposed dismissal on the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">1. The terms of the CBA\u2019s provision requiring arbitration of an individual\u2019s legislatively created cause of action must be \u201cclear and unmistakable,\u201d citing <em>Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., </em>525 U.S. 70, 119 S. Ct. 391 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">2. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 94 S. Ct. 1011 (1974) and <em>Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc. </em>450 U.S. 728, 101 S. Ct. 1437 (1981), stand for the proposition that Appellant deputies\u2019 constitutional and tort claims, and statutory discrimination and wage claims, are based upon the law of the land rather than the \u201claw of the shop,\u201d cannot be waived, and are independent of the collective bargaining process, and thus are exempt from the grievance process in the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">3. The doctrine of equitable estoppel precluded the County\u2019s \u201cfailure to exhaust remedies\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\u00b629 Various claims in the Fifth Amended Complaint were then dismissed by consent of the parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>judgment decision addressed Appellants\u2019 remaining claims for relief under Counts I, II, IV, and V of the Fifth Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b630 In Count I, the Appellants alleged various constitutional violations. They claimed that Castle and Corneliusen retaliated against them \u201con the basis of their exercise of their freedom to associate with others of similar political beliefs and their exercise of their freedom of speech, when they supported Kent Funyak, and in retaliation for their political ideas and activity.\u201d This count also alleged that the defendants made employment decisions which caused these Appellants to suffer damages, and that these decisions were motivated by the Appellants\u2019 \u201cexercise of their constitutional rights to freedom of association and freedom of speech.\u201d They also claimed that the defendants violated their constitutionally-guaranteed right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"AHs\">\u00b631 Count II directly alleged that the defendants discriminated against them in violation of the Montana Constitution, the Montana Governmental Code of Fair Practices, and Title 49, chapters 2 and 3, of the MHRA. Kohm, Zrowka, Doe, Goaziou, and Edwards brought these discrimination claims before the HRB. The HRB awarded Edwards damages based on this claim. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6 21. The HRB denied the claims of Kohm, Zrowka, Doe, and Goaziou, and issued them \u201cright to sue\u201d letters. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. St. Onge did not file a discrimination claim with the HRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b632 Count IV alleged intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress. Included in this claim is the assertion that Appellants \u201chave suffered severe mental and emotional distress ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b633 Count V alleged that unpaid wages are owed to Edwards, Kohm, Zrowka, Doe, and St. Onge. The Appellants claimed that they were entitled to compensation for lost wages and liquidated damages pursuant to Title 39, chapter 3, part 2, MCA, and Title 7, chapter 4, part 2, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b634 The District Court determined that the essence of Appellants\u2019 claims involved discrimination and wage claims. Under the rule in <em>MacKay v. State, </em>2003 MT 274, 317 Mont 467, 79 P.3d 236, the District Court dismissed all of the remaining claims of Deputies Edwards, Kohm and Zrowka, under Counts I (violation of constitutional rights), II (political discrimination), IV (infliction of emotional distress) and V (unpaid wages), on the ground they were barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies through the CBA grievance process before pursuing their civil claims in District Court. The District Court concluded that the discrimination claims could have been brought under the CBA\u2019s discrimination clause, and that the unpaid wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>claims could have been brought under Article 16 of the CBA. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 13. The District Court rejected Appellants\u2019 estoppel argument, and Appellants do not raise it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u00b635 Relying on a line of cases beginning with <em>Harrison v. Chance, </em>244 Mont. 215, 223, 797 P. 2d 200, 205 (1990), the District Court also dismissed the constitutional claims (Count I) and infliction of emotional distress (Count TV) claims of Doe and Goaziou. The District Court determined that the gravamen of these claims was discrimination and that the MHRA provides the exclusive remedy for discrimination-related claims. Because Doe and Goaziou failed to bring these claims before the Department, the District Court concluded they were now barred. On similar grounds, the District Court dismissed St. Onge\u2019s claims under Counts I and IV. The District Court ruled St. Onge was required to have first filed an MHRA claim to preserve his constitutional and emotional distress claims, since they are subsumed within the exclusivity provision of the MHRA. The political discrimination claims of Doe and Goaziou under Count II remained for trial since these claims had been submitted to the HRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b636 The District Court permitted the statutory wage claims of Doe and St. Onge to proceed, provided they amended their complaint to include a contract theory. They complied, filing a Sixth Amended Complaint. Goaziou, the detention officer, filed no wage claim for sheriffs deputy wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b637 The District Court thereafter granted M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification, allowing Appellants to appeal the District Court\u2019s summary judgment rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b638 Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>GRB Farm v. Christman Ranch, Inc., </em>2005 MT 59, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 236,108 P.3d 507. When the material facts are undisputed, we review whether the district court correctly applied the law. <em>Farmers Union Mutual Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 18, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381; <em>Hogenson Const. of N.D. v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2007 MT 267, \u00b611, 339 Mont. 389, 170 P.3d 471. The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law. <em>Ophus v. Fritz, </em>2000 MT 251, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 447, 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>P.3d 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b639 Appellants fall into two categories:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">1. The three full-time deputy sheriffs who were defined as an \u201cEmployee\u201d under the negotiated terms of the CBA: Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">2. The sheriffs lieutenants Doe and St. Onge and detention lieutenant Goaziou who were not included in the definition of \u201cEmployee\u201d under the terms of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b640 We address the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">I. Were Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka-the three full-time deputy sheriffs defined as \u201cEmployees\u201d under the CBA-required to exhaust the CBA grievance procedure before pursuing their political discrimination, wage and related claims in the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">II. Does the MHRA constitute the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for the claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka, as well as sheriffs lieutenants Doe and St. Onge and detention lieutenant Goaziou, precluding any other constitutional, statutory based, or tort claims which are premised upon their MHRA claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">III. Were all of the Appellants deprived of their constitutional rights to a jury trial, access to the courts, and full legal redress?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">\u00b641 At the outset we note a grievance under the CBA must be initiated by a written notification to the \u201cLieutenant who is the grievant\u2019s immediate supervisor ....\u201d The grievances filed by Edwards and Kohm in October 2004 with the Board of Commissioners for Cascade County involved promotion disputes which were management rights specifically excluded from the CBA grievance process. CBA, Art. 4 and Art 7. Zrowka delivered his letter to the Cascade County Attorney\u2019s Office and human resources officer, rather than to his supervising lieutenant. The District Court correctly concluded none of these deputies initiated any grievance under the terms of the CBA before bringing these claims in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">\u00b642 <em>Issue One: Were Deputies Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka required to exhaust the CBA grievance procedure before pursuing their political discrimination, wage, and related claims in the District Court?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">\u00b643 We start this analysis by confirming that because Doe, St. Onge, and Goaziou were not covered by the CBA, their respective claims are unaffected by the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">\u00b644 The District Court determined that the gravamen of Counts I, II, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and IV, was discrimination, and that the gravamen of Count V was unpaid wages. Relying upon the CBA\u2019s non-discrimination clause, Article 16 of the CBA, and this Court\u2019s precedent in <em>MacKay, </em>the District Court determined that Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka were required to grieve their discrimination and wage claims before they could present them in District Court. Because they failed to do so, these claims were now barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">\u00b645 Deputies Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka argue that because their constitutional and statutory rights do not derive from the CBA, these claims are not subject to preemption under the CBA. It follows, they assert, they are not required to exhaust the CBA grievance procedure before filing a lawsuit for redress of violations they claim under Montana\u2019s Constitution: Article II, Section 6 (freedom of assembly), Section 7 (freedom of speech), Section 8 (right of participation in government), Section 10 (right of privacy-Edwards), and Section 17 (due process of law); MHRA statutory discrimination claims (Title 49, MCA); and statutory wage claims under \u00a7\u00a7 7-4-2503 through -2508, MCA. They additionally argue the wording of the CBA makes clear its grievance procedure is limited, i.e., its coverage excludes statute-based claims and only prohibits discrimination for \u201cAssociation\u201d activities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00b646 Appellants, joined by Amicus Montana Trial Lawyers Association, further contend any collective bargaining agreement governs only limited employment issues such as wages, hours, or fringe benefits for the good of the whole of the members of a collective bargaining unit. They assert a collective bargaining agreement may never bargain away or waive any individual member\u2019s statutory or constitutionally-based rights and remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b647 The County counters that the CBA includes express provisions that the Employer will \u201cprovide equal opportunities... to all Employees regardless of ... political belief,\u201d and will pay wages \u201caccording to applicable Montana State Law ....\u201d Since these contractual provisions were negotiated, bargained for, and written into the CBA, and specifically address the two primary categories in dispute, the County reasons that Appellants Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka were required to invoke the CBA grievance procedure to attempt to resolve these two categories of their claims before proceeding in District Court. The County asserts that since the Appellants\u2019 constitutional and statute-based discrimination claims are intertwined with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>discrimination claims covered under the CBA grievance procedure, these claims also fall within the scope of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b648 The parties\u2019 arguments mirror the tension that has long-existed between two competing aspects of management labor relations policy. These competing policies are well described in <em>Barrentine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">The first, reflected in statutes governing relationships between employers and unions, encourages the negotiation of terms and conditions of employment through the collective-bargaining process. The second, reflected in statutes governing relationships between employers and their individual employees, guarantees covered employees specific substantive rights.

However, when the scope of a collective bargaining agreement is written more narrowly than \u201cany controversy\u201d or \u201call claims,\u201d the contract wording must be reviewed to determine which claims are not rooted in the collective bargaining agreement and are capable of being litigated directly in court. <em>Miller, </em>257 Mont. at 427, 851 P.2d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">\u00b655 We apply the above labor law rules to the constitutional, statutory discrimination, emotional distress, and statutory wage claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka. Each claim must be evaluated to determine to what extent, if any, if it is covered by the wording of the collective bargaining agreement. The claims fall into three categories:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">1. Constitution-based claims (assembly, speech, participation,</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">privacy, due process);</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">2.

II, Section 7), Right of Privacy (Art. II, Section 10), and Due Process of Law (Art. II, Section 17) are self-executing constitutional provisions, wholly independent of the CBA. The District Court concluded the constitutional claims of interference with assembly, speech, privacy and due process made by Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka are actually components of their underlying political discrimination claims. Accordingly, it held that the Appellants were required both to grieve them under the CBA\u2019s discrimination clause and present them to the HRB in order to preserve them in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">\u00b657 [1] As discussed below, <em>see Opinion, </em>\u00b6 78, we agree with the District Court that for purposes of the MHRA the gravamen of Count I was discrimination and that the Appellants were required to bring these claims before the HRB as a precondition to filing suit in District Court. <em>See Shields v. Helena School District No. </em>1, 284 Mont. 138, 149, 943 P.2d 999, 1005 (1997). Thus, irrespective of whether the claims in Count I were covered by the CBA itself, these Appellants are now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>barred from bringing the claims in Count I for failure to comply with the MHRA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">2. Statutory discrimination and wage claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b658 The District Court determined the CBA, on its face, covered the discrimination and wage claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka. Appellants Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka assert the CBA only prohibits discrimination \u201cbecause of Association membership or activity.\u201d They also argue Article 4 of the CBA excludes the statutory duties of the office of the sheriff from the grievance process, including Appellants\u2019 statute-based discrimination claims and wage claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b659 The County responds that the first paragraph of the nondiscrimination clause in the CBA clearly addresses discrimination, including political discrimination. The full text of the nondiscrimination clause found at Article 6 in the CBA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">It is the permanent policy of the Employer to provide equal opportunities for employment, retention, and advancement to all Employees regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, marital status or <em>political belief. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">The Employer will not discriminate against any Employee because of Association membership or activity and the Association will not discriminate against any Employee because of lack of membership or lack of activity in the Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\u00b660 The wage clause, Article 16 of the CBA, simply requires the Employer to pay wages to employees \u201ccalculated according to applicable Montana State Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">\u00b661 In <em>Wright, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a collective bargaining agreement does not waive an employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum for a legislatively created cause of action unless it contains a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d waiver of that right. <em>Wright, </em>525 U.S. at 81, 119 S. Ct. at 397; <em>see also 14 Penn Plaza, LLC v. Pyett, </em>129 S. Ct. 1456, 1474 (2009) (holding that a collective bargaining agreement which \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d requires union members to arbitrate claims brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, is enforceable as a matter of federal law). Nothing in the language of the CBA, including Art. 6, \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d announces any requirement to arbitrate the statutory discrimination or wage claims presented here. The first paragraph of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Article 6 merely announces the County\u2019s general policy regarding nondiscrimination. The second paragraph refines the general policy by further announcing that the County will not discriminate \u201cbecause of Association membership or activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">\u00b662 Moreover, Art. 4 of the CBA specifically excludes the duties of the office of the sheriff from the CBA grievance procedure. The duties of a sheriff include adherence to Montana\u2019s statutory non-discrimination policy commanded by the MHRA, as well as the duty of complying with the statutory wage scheme for deputy sheriffs set forth in \u00a7 7-4-2508, MCA. A statutory enforcement mechanism exists for wage claims under Title 39, chapter 3, part 2, MCA. No language in the CBA unmistakably waives the Appellants\u2019 rights to seek judicial relief to enforce the County\u2019s corresponding duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b663  We therefore conclude that the CBA does not \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d cover Appellants\u2019 statutory discrimination and wage claims. The scope of the CBA does not require arbitration of the discrimination claims of Kohm and Zrowka, and the wage claims brought by Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka, as a precondition to filing suit in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">3. Emotional distress tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b664 Count IV alleges emotional distress, presumably stemming from Appellants alleged constitutional and discrimination injuries. Infliction of emotional distress can be an independent cause of action. <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc., </em>271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411 (1995). However, emotional distress damages are specifically covered by the remedy provisions of the MHRA. Section 49-2-506, MCA; <em>Benjamin v. Anderson, </em>2005 MT 123, 327 Mont. 173, 112 P.3d 1039. In fact, the District Court determined that Appellants\u2019 emotional distress claims, like the claims in Count I, at their essence arose out of the discrimination claims which fall within the exclusive remedy provisions of the MHRA. We agree with the District Court. Thus, irrespective of whether the claims in Count IV were covered by the CBA itself, the Appellants are prohibited from bringing them in District Court because they failed to properly bring them before the HRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b665 For these reasons, we hold that the Appellants\u2019 failure to bring the claims in Counts I and IV before HRB bars them from pursuing them now, regardless of whether they are covered by the terms of the CBA. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Counts I and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AIn\">\u00b666 However, we reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the statutory discrimination claims of Kohm and Zrowka. We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>that the CBA does not \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d cover these claims and that Kohm and Zrowka may pursue their statutory discrimination claims in District Court, since they did bring them before the HRB and were issued \u201cright to sue\u201d letters.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b667 We also reverse the dismissal of the statutory wage claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka. These Appellants did not waive their right to seek relief for violations of Montana\u2019s wage protection statutes. These claims may now proceed in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b668 <em>Issue Two: Does the MHRA constitute the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for the claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka, as well as sheriffs\u2019 lieutenants Doe and St. Onge and detention lieutenant Goaziou, precluding any other constitutional, statutory, or tort claims which are premised upon their MHRA claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b669 Following the reasoning in a line of cases commencing with <em>Harrison, </em>the District Court ruled the gravamen of the constitutional and emotional distress tort claims of Doe, St. Onge and Goaziou was based on political discrimination for their individual, personal political beliefs. As such, these claims fell within the exclusive remedy provision of the MHRA. Section 49-2-509(7), MCA, recodified in 2007 as \u00a7 49-2-512(1), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">The provisions of this chapter establish the exclusive remedy for acts constituting an alleged violation of chapter 3 or this chapter, including acts that may otherwise also constitute a violation of the discrimination provisions of Article II, section 4, of the Montana constitution or 49-1-102. A claim or request for relief based upon the acts may not be entertained by a district court other than by the procedures specified in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b670 The District Court permitted Doe and Goaziou to pursue their constitutional and emotional distress claims only in the context of their political discrimination claims. Counts I (violation of constitutional rights) and IV (infliction of emotional distress), as independent claims, were dismissed. Since St. Onge did not file a discrimination complaint under the MHRA, the District Court ruled St. Onge is disallowed from proceedings with his Count I and Count IV claims. We uphold the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u00b671 Appellants Doe, St. Onge and Goazion argue a plain reading of \u00a7 49-2-509(7), MCA, extends the MHRA\u2019s exclusive remedy provision only to the discrimination provisions of Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These Appellants assert none of their claims were raised under Article II, Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">\u00b672 In response, the County argues the District Court properly determined that the underlying basis for all of the Appellants\u2019 claims under Counts I and IV is discrimination based upon political belief. We have consistently held the MHRA provides \u201cthe exclusive remedy for illegal discrimination.\u201d <em>Shields, </em>284 Mont. at 149, 943 P.2d at 1005 (citing <em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 223, 797 P.2d at 205); <em>Arthur v. Pierre Ltd., </em>2004 MT 303, \u00b6 18, 323 Mont. 453, 100 P.3d 987 (The MHRA \u201cbars a plaintiff from pursuing other tort claims where those claims arise from underlying allegations of ... discrimination ....\u201d). More recently we upheld the converse position in a dual MHRA and Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA) claim, holding a WDEA claim which is not based upon \u201cunderlying allegations of ... discrimination\u201d is not precluded by the exclusive remedy provisions of the MHRA. <em>Vettel-Becker v. Deaconess Med. Ctr. of Billings, Inc., </em>2008 MT 51, \u00b6 40, 341 Mont. 435, 177 P.3d 1034 (\u201cDiscrimination can occur without a wrongful discharge and a wrongful discharge can occur without a discriminatory act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b673 Section 49-2-509(7), MCA (2007), extends the exclusive remedy under the MHRA to any violation of Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. Article II, Section 4 forbids discrimination against any person for exercising his or her political rights or expressing their political ideas. The MHRA implements the nondiscrimination rights enumerated in Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. The exclusivity rule applies to the political discrimination claims of Doe, Goaziou, and St. Onge, which may only be raised within the statutory framework of a MHRA discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b674 The District Court correctly ruled the gravamen of the non-wage claims of Doe, Goaziou and St. Onge are grounded in allegations of political discrimination. All of the Appellants alleged that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>damages, including for severe emotional distress, were \u201ca direct and proximate result of the discrimination ....\u201d Doe\u2019s and Goaziou\u2019s MHRA complaints before the Department alleged discrimination and retaliation in employment based upon political ideas, beliefs, and activity, all in violation of the MHRA, the Montana and United States Constitutions, and the \u201cCivil Rights Act of 1964 and 1991, as amended.\u201d Each of the Appellants except St. Onge sought damages under the MHRA, including for emotional distress. Before the District Court, Doe, Goaziou and St. Onge alleged that the County and Sheriff s office \u201cemployees acting at their direction began to retaliate against [Appellants] ... on the basis of their exercise of their freedom to associate with others of similar political beliefs ... in retaliation for their political ideas and activity\u201d and that the County \u201cemployed hiring, promotion, and transfer procedures which altered [Appellants\u2019] terms and conditions of employment, and which retaliated against [Appellants].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b675  We conclude the essence of the Appellants\u2019 constitution-based claims under Count I, as well as their emotional distress claims under Count IV, is grounded in their allegations of politically-motivated discrimination that was initiated by the sheriff. The exclusive remedy for this form of alleged political discrimination is the MHRA. We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling that the discrimination claims of Doe and Goaziou were covered by the MHRA. Because they were issued \u201cright to sue\u201d letters, they may now pursue their claims in District Court. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling that St. Onge failed to preserve his discrimination claims by failing to file a complaint under the MHRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b676 <em>Issue Three: Were all of the Appellants deprived of their constitutional rights to a jury trial, access to the courts, and full legal redress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b677 Appellants broadly argue on appeal that the effect of the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order deprived them of the right to access the court system to redress that remedy. These arguments are undeveloped on appeal and were neither raised in nor addressed by the District Court. Moreover, the record contains no evidence of compliance</p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">\u00b678 In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2005 MT 48, 326 Mont. 161, 108 P.3d 485, we declined to address the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge because we could not \u201cmake such a determination on the basis of the abbreviated arguments before us.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b611. Likewise, in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, 334 Mont. 1, 145 P.3d 946, the defendant asserted that Article II, Sections 24 and 26 of the Montana Constitution afford a greater jury trial right than does the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; yet, critically, he \u201cfail[ed] to offer a compelling reason why the greater jury trial right in Montana dictate[d] a different result in his case.\u201d <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b639. As a result, we found his argument \u201ctoo undeveloped to undertake a distinctive application of state constitutional principles,\u201d and we accordingly did not consider the argument further. <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. The identical situation exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">\u00b679 Moreover, Appellants conceded in their reply brief that \u201cPlaintiffs have not raised the issue of the constitutionality of the MHRA ....\u201d Accordingly, we decline to address this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b680 The District Court did not err in dismissing Counts I and IV of the Appellants\u2019 complaint. The gravamen of these constitutional and emotional distress claims is political discrimination, and these claims are therefore governed by the exclusivity provisions of the MHRA. Moreover, Edwards\u2019 violation of privacy claims relate to his discrimination claims under the MHRA, which have been finalized by the HRB. Thus, irrespective of whether these claims were covered by the CBA itself, Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka were required to submit them to the HRB. Because all of the Appellants failed to present the claims in Counts I and IV before the HRB in the context of a claim for discrimination, none of the Appellants may now pursue these claims in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b681 However, the District Court did err in concluding that the statutory discrimination and wage claims of Edwards, Kohm, and Zrowka were covered by the CBA. The statutory wage claims of these Appellants may be presented in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b682 Moreover, Kohm and Zrowka are not prohibited from pursuing their discrimination claims in District Court since they properly presented them to the HRB and were issued \u201cright to sue\u201d letters. Edwards may not, however, bring a discrimination claim since his discrimination claim was resolved by the HRB and has not been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b683 Doe, St. Onge, and Goaziou are not covered by the CBA. Appellants Doe, St. Onge, and Goaziou filed claims of violations of their constitutional rights as well as claims of intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress.
