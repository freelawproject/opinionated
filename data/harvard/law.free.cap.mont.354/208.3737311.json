(Axmen) claiming they had defaulted under the terms of a promissory note. After Pruyn\u2019s death in June 2008, his estate was substituted as plaintiff in this case. Eventually, the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, denied Pruyn\u2019s motions for summary judgment and granted Axmen\u2019s cross-motions for summary judgment and awarded Axmen its attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\u00b62 Pruyn raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in overturning a prior order granting summary judgment to Pruyn?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Axmen on Pruyn\u2019s contract claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Axmen on Pruyn\u2019s unjust enrichment claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u00b66 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding Axmen its attorney\u2019s fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b67 5. Were Pruyn\u2019s due process rights violated as a result of Axmen\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communications with the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b68 Edward Kimbrell, Guy Hanson and Grant Hanson co-owned Axmen, a full-service propane retailer in Missoula, Montana. Because Kimbrell had expertise in the propane business, he became managing partner when the partnership was formed in 1999, and then President when Axmen was incorporated in 2000. Kimbrell and the Hansons were Axmen\u2019s only shareholders, its only officers, and its only directors. The three provided the companys initial capitalization from their own pockets and they held equal shares in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b69 Kimbrell ran the day-to-day operations at Axmen while the Hansons worked at another location running their other business ventures. A large part of Kimbrell\u2019s duties involved purchasing propane. He often bought thousands of gallons of propane by simply picking up the phone and calling a supplier. Besides purchasing propane to maintain Axmen\u2019s normal stock levels, Kimbrell also purchased large quantities of propane to \u201chedge\u201d against price fluctuations. In these transactions, Kimbrell would purchase large amounts of propane for delivery over several months rather than a few days to \u201clock in\u201d a fixed price for Axmen and its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b610 Powderhorn Petroleum (Powderhorn) was one of Axmen\u2019s main propane suppliers, and Kimbrell entered into numerous propane procurement and futures transactions with Powderhorn. In March 2003, Kimbrell and two others, John Giuliani and Shawn Diehl, entered into a propane transaction with Powderhorn for the purchase of 1.7 million gallons of propane, almost 20 times the volume of any previous order by Axmen. Shortly after entering into this transaction with Powderhorn, propane prices dropped and Kimbrell incurred a substantial loss. To finance this loss, Kimbrell approached Pruyn for a loan. Pruyn was a local businessman who often lent money on business ventures. Pruyn later testified that he understood from Kimbrell that Axmen needed to borrow money to acquire property in the Bitterroot for a larger supply of tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b6 11 Kimbrell had several meetings with Pruyn wherein he gave Pruyn information relating to Axmen\u2019s assets, cash flow and accounts receivable. Pruyn testified that based upon the documentation from Axmen as well as his own investigation into the companys reputation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>and overall business prospects, he decided to lend Axmen $544,500. Pruyn also testified that although he told his attorney to draft the promissory note \u201cto Axmen Propane guaranteed by Guy and Grant Hansen [sic], personally,\u201d Axmen was not specifically mentioned in the note. The promissory note included signature blocks for Kimbrell and both of the Hansons, but it did not indicate that they would be signing in any representative capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">\u00b612 On April 4,2003, Kimbrell executed the note forging the Hansons\u2019 signatures. After Kimbrell returned the signed note to Pruyn, the money was wired to Powderhorn\u2019s bank to pay off the debt to Powderhorn. Although the promissory note was not paid as agreed, Pruyn did receive two cashier\u2019s checks from Kimbrell, one dated August 11, 2003, for $20,000, and one dated October 1, 2003, for $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b613 On Christmas Eve 2003, Pruyn discussed the promissory note with Guy Hanson. Pruyn learned at that time that neither of the Hansons knew anything about the loan, the promissory note, or the Powderhorn debt. Kimbrell subsequently admitted that he had forged the Hansons\u2019 signatures on the note.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b614 Pruyn filed this action against Axmen and Kimbrell on July 8, 2004, seeking the unpaid principal balance on the promissory note, accrued interest, all costs and expenses of suit, and attorney\u2019s fees. Axmen filed its Answer, Cross Claim and Demand for Jury Trial on September 2, 2004, wherein Axmen contended that the note was barred by the statue of frauds because Axmen is not mentioned in the note. Axmen also filed a cross claim against Kimbrell for, among other things, fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b615 On July 25, 2005, Pruyn moved for summary judgment asserting that the undisputed material facts showed that because Kimbrell had authority to speak on behalf of Axmen and to enter into the subject loan transaction, Axmen was liable on the promissory note. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefing and hearing oral argument, then District Court Judge Henson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of Pruyn. In his March 20, 2006 Opinion and Order, Judge Henson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>determined that Kimbrell had ostensible authority to bind Axmen in the loan transaction, and that Axmen had retained the benefit of the loan by applying it toward its debt with Powderhorn. Judge Henson also determined that Pruyn should not be made to suffer for Kimbrell\u2019s actions even if the loan transaction was accomplished fraudulently and without actual authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b616 On April 28, 2006, Axmen filed a Motion for Relief from Opinion and Order. When the District Court failed to make a decision on the motion within 60 days of its filing, Pruyn filed a \u201cNotice of 60 Day Pendency of Axmen Propane\u2019s Motion for Relief from Opinion and Order\u201d on June 28, 2006, arguing that the motion had been deemed denied. The following day, Axmen filed its Renewed Motion for Relief from Opinion and Order. Since Judge Henson had retired and his successor had not yet been appointed or sworn in, the matter was called to the attention of Judge McLean, who, on July 6,2006, granted Axmen\u2019s request and vacated Judge Henson\u2019s order. Pruyn moved to set aside Judge McLean\u2019s order claiming the 60-day time period for considering Axmen\u2019s motion had expired prior to Judge McLean\u2019s ruling. Thereafter, the case was assigned to newly-appointed Judge Deschamps for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b617 On January 24,2007, Judge Deschamps, confronted with what he considered to be mistakes by both of his predecessors, declined to set aside Judge McLean\u2019s order. In his Opinion and Order, Judge Deschamps stated that the \u201csimple solution\u201d would be to set aside Judge McLean\u2019s order as untimely thereby reinstating Judge Henson\u2019s original order, and allow Axmen to appeal. However, Judge Deschamps, \u201cconvinced that Axmen would prevail on appeal,\u201d decided to forego the appeal process altogether and opted for \u201cthe more just, albeit risky, approach of upholding Judge McLean\u2019s order.\u201d In doing so, Judge Deschamps stated that \u201cfor reasons of equity and avoiding enforcing an order that was issued in error, Judge McLean\u2019s order must stand and the parties must have their day in court.\u201d Judge Deschamps further stated that \u201cJudge McLean\u2019s weeklong delay in ruling on Axmen\u2019s motion due to administrative upheaval in the District Court is unfortunate, but excusable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b618 Both Axmen and Pruyn again moved for summary judgment. On July 23, 2007, Judge Deschamps granted partial summary judgment to Axmen finding that the promissory note was not a corporate obligation of Axmen. In dismissing Pruyn\u2019s contract claim, Judge Deschamps determined that Pruyn might still be entitled to restitution from Axmen under one of the unjust enrichment claims pled in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b619 Axmen urged a stay of the civil proceedings while the criminal matter against Kimbrell was pending. Pruyn, who was 83 years old at the time, objected to further delaying the lawsuit, but Judge Deschamps ruled in Axmen\u2019s favor and stayed the proceedings. Kimbrell was found guilty of forgery on January 3, 2008. After Kimbrell was sentenced, the court lifted the stay in the instant case, and the parties briefed the unjust enrichment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b620 Pruyn passed away on June 11, 2008, and his estate was substituted as plaintiff in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an Opinion and Order dated June 27, 2008, Judge Deschamps determined that Axmen was not unjustly enriched at the expense of Pruyn, thus Axmen was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Pruyn\u2019s unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AmE\">\u00b621 Pruyn filed a Notice of Appeal on July 25, 2008. On August 7, 2008, Axmen moved the District Court for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, and also moved this Court to dismiss Pruyn\u2019s appeal as premature. We denied Axmen\u2019s motion to dismiss Pruyn\u2019s appeal, but remanded the case to the District Court for a ruling on Axmen\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Est. of Pruyn ex rel. Meyer v. Axmen </em>Prop., 2008 MT 329, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 346 Mont. 162, 194 P.3d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b622 On remand, the District Court awarded Axmen its attorney\u2019s fees stating that \u201cPruyn\u2019s actions in this matter were in the very least frivolous and perhaps even malicious.\u201d Pruyn now appeals the various orders of the District Court on summary judgment as well as the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Axmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b623 Summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Eastgate Village Water and Sewer v. Davis, </em>2008 MT 141, \u00b6 18, 343 Mont. 108, 183 P.3d 873 (citing <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620). Our standard in reviewing a district court's summary judgment ruling is de novo; we use the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria applied by the district court. <em>Eastgate, </em>\u00b6 18. Moreover, all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the offered proof must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Eastgate, </em>\u00b6 18. If there is any doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>regarding the propriety of the summary judgment motion, it should be denied. <em>Eastgate, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>360 Ranch Corp. v. R &amp; D Holding, </em>278 Mont. 487, 491, 926 P.2d 260, 262 (1996); <em>Whitehawk v. Clark, </em>238 Mont. 14, 18, 776 P.2d 484, 486-87 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b624 In addition, we review a district court's conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Montana Pet. Tank Comp. Bd. v. Crumleys, </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 32, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948 (citing <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Gibson, </em>2007 MT 153, \u00b6 9, 337 Mont. 509, 163 P.3d 387).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b625 We review a district court\u2019s order awarding attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Harding v. Savoy, </em>2004 MT 280, \u00b6 68, 323 Mont. 261, 100 P.3d 976 (citing <em>Trustees of Indiana University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 15,315 Mont. 210,69 P.3d 663). A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 19, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451 (citing <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Co-op., Inc., </em>1998 MT 306, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 118, 970 P.2d 84; <em>C. Haydon Ltd. v. MT Min. Properties, Inc., </em>286 Mont. 138, 146, 951 P.2d 46, 51 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b626 <em>Did the District Court err in overturning a prior order granting summary judgment to Pruyn?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b627 Pruyn contends that Axmen\u2019s Motion for Relief from Opinion and Order was a poorly disguised motion for reconsideration that is not authorized by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. Pruyn also contends that even if Axmen\u2019s motion were considered a motion to alter or amend judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 59(g), it was error for Judge McLean to rule on that motion after the expiration of the 60-day time period set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 59(g), and error for Judge Deschamps to affirm Judge McLean\u2019s mistake. Pruyn further contends that Judge Henson\u2019s Opinion and Order was the law of the case and that it could only be altered under certain limited circumstances, or after appeal to this Court. To that end, Pruyn argues that in vacating Judge Henson\u2019s order, Judge McLean improperly exercised appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u00b628 Axmen argues on the other hand that because no notice of entry of judgment or order pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 77(d) was ever filed or served in this case, Judge Henson\u2019s summary judgment order did not constitute a final judgment, thus it could be changed at any time by Judge Henson or a successor judge in that court. Axmen further argues that contrary to Pruyn\u2019s contentions, Judge McLean\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>vacate Judge Henson\u2019s order was not untimely. Axmen also argues that Pruyn\u2019s \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b629 First, concerning the procedural problems surrounding Axmen\u2019s motion and the various rulings of the successor district court judges, we note that \u201c[a] judgment is the <em>final </em>determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding ....\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 54(a) (emphasis added). When there are multiple claims for relief or multiple parties, a judgment is not final unless it is certified as such by the court, and if it is not so certified, it \u201cis <em>subject to revision </em>at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b630 Although Axmen claimed in its Motion for Relief from Opinion and Order that it was filing the motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60, that rule applies to <em>final </em>judgments, orders, or proceedings. M. R. Civ. P. 60(b). As Judge Deschamps pointed out in his January 25, 2007 Opinion and Order, Judge Henson\u2019s order was \u201cinterlocutory in nature and is subject to a motion under Rule 54(b) where the only time limit is that it be ruled upon prior to final judgment being entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b631 In <em>Smith v. Foss, </em>177 Mont. 443, 447, 582 P.2d 329, 332 (1978), this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">[s]o long as a court has jurisdiction over an action, it should have plenary power over its interlocutory orders and should be able to revise them when it is consonant with justice so to do. Court control over an interlocutory order should not be subject to the restrictions of Rule 60(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b632 We made a similar ruling in <em>Teamsters Union v. C.N.H. Acquisitions, </em>2009 MT 92, 350 Mont. 18, 204 P.3d 733, regarding M. R. Civ. P. 59 motions to alter or amend. In <em>Teamsters, </em>the defendant argued that a renewed motion for summary judgment was improperly granted because it constituted an M. R. Civ. P. 59 motion to alter or amend a judgment. We held in that case that M. R. Civ. P. 59 was not applicable because that rule concerns judgments and when the plaintiffs filed their renewed motion, there was no judgment. <em>Teamsters, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b633 Here, final judgment as applied to all parties was never entered following Judge Henson\u2019s Opinion and Order-no monetary judgment and no notice of entry of judgment against Axmen or Kimbrell was ever filed. In addition, Kimbrell did not appear in this case until long after Judge Henson had issued his decision and, although there were multiple defendants, Judge Henson directed entry of judgment only against Axmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b634 Because Judge Henson\u2019s Opinion and Order did not adjudicate all of the claims, rights and liabilities of all of the parties, there was no final disposition of the case prior to Judge McLean\u2019s and Judge Deschamps\u2019 rulings. Consequently, Judge Henson\u2019s Opinion and Order was \u201csubject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Hence, the 60-day time restrictions for ruling on motions filed under Rules 59(g) and 60(b) did not apply. Thus, we hold that Judge McLean\u2019s ruling vacating Judge Henson\u2019s Opinion and Order was timely. Under that same rationale, we hold that Pruyn\u2019s law-of-the-case argument is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b635 As to the merits of Axmen\u2019s claim in its Motion for Relief from Opinion and Order, we hold that Judge McLean and Judge Deschamps were correct in vacating Judge Henson\u2019s order. Axmen presented newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence regarding a statement to police made by Pruyn\u2019s attorney, Dermis Starkel, in connection with Kimbrell\u2019s criminal trial. Even though this statement was taken more than a year prior, the statement was not available to the parties at the time of Judge Henson\u2019s decision because it was part of the confidential criminal justice information in the criminal proceedings against Kimbrell. The County Attorney had not disclosed this information as of the date of the initial summary judgment proceedings in this case. In addition, Axmen was unable to obtain this information through discovery in the civil matter because Pruyn asserted attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b636  This previously unavailable statement of Starkel\u2019s concerning the facts surrounding the creation of the promissory note created an issue of material fact regarding whether the note obligated Axmen precluding summary judgment. Given this, we conclude that Judge McLean\u2019s decision to vacate Judge Henson\u2019s order was appropriate and, indeed, mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b637 \u201c[T]he purpose of summary judgment is to eliminate unnecessary trials, but... summary adjudication \u2018should never be substituted for a trial if a material factual controversy exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bradley v. Crow Tribe of Indians, </em>2005 MT 309, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 448, 124 P.3d 1143 (quoting <em>Boyes v. Eddie, </em>1998 MT 311, \u00b6 16, 292 Mont. 152, 970 P.2d 91).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b638  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in overturning Judge Henson\u2019s prior order granting summary judgment to Pruyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b639 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Axmen on Pruyn\u2019s contract claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">\u00b640 Concluding that the promissory note was not a corporate obligation for Axmen, the District Court granted summary judgment to Axmen on this claim. Pruyn now argues on appeal that in making this determination, the District Court disregarded undisputed facts demonstrating Kunbrell\u2019s ostensible authority to bind Axmen to the agreement. Pruyn also argues that the District Court misapplied the parole evidence rule as well as provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b641 In Montana, one entrusted with the management of a business can have either actual, implied or ostensible authority to make contracts on behalf of a business. <em>Audit Serv., Inc. v. Elmo Road Corp., </em>175 Mont. 533, 536-37, 575 P.2d 77, 79 (1978). \u201cOstensible authority is such as a principal, intentionally or by want of ordinary care, causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to possess.\u201d Section 28-10-403, MCA. Ostensible authority may be established \u201cby omissions as well as by commissions.\u201d <em>Northwest Polymeric v. Farmers State Bk., </em>236 Mont. 175, 178, 768 P.2d 873, 875 (1989). But, ostensible authority cannot be proven by the declarations of an agent whose statements are sought to be charged to the principal. <em>See Northwest Polymeric, </em>236 Mont, at 177-78, 768 P.2d at 875; <em>Phelps v.

The rule refers to declarations made by the agent out of court, off the witness stand, or otherwise than in his sworn testimony, and it means that such declarations cannot be testified to by a third person for the purpose of proving the scope or extent of the authority of the agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\"><em>Phelps, </em>105 Mont, at 199, 71 P.2d at 889; <em>see also Exchange State Bank v.

The promissory note clearly contemplates only individual liability with no reference to Axmen or any indication that the individuals were signing in a representative capacity. The promissory note specifically provides that Kimbrell and the Hansons are the \u201cMakers.\u201d The note also provides that \u201ceach Maker is jointly and severally bound hereon as a principal and not as a surety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b644 We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable lender in Pruyn\u2019s shoes, had he intended to bind Axmen to the Note, would have made sure Kimbrell had the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b645 In addition, Pruyn\u2019s attorney, Dennis Starkel, testified in his deposition that he drafted the promissory note at Pruyn\u2019s request with Kimbrell and the Hansons as obligors. Starkel further testified that, in preparing the note, it was not his intention that the specific entity, Axmen, be an obligor on the note. Instead, Starkel testified that it was his goal in drafting the note to create individual liability to the three individuals who were to sign the note, Kimbrell, Guy and Grant Hanson, and not to create liability on behalf of Axmen or any other entity. Because of attorney-client privilege, Starkel did not testify whether he followed Pruyn\u2019s instructions in drafting the note, but he did testify that in preparing the note he did not breach any professional duty owed to Pruyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b646 Pruyn testified that he instructed Starkel to put the names of Kimbrell, Guy and Grant Hanson on the promissory note and that Starkel drafted the note as he, Pruyn, had instructed.

An ambiguity exists when a contract is subject to two different interpretations, and under such circumstances, parol evidence can be used to determine the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Carelli, </em>279 Mont. at 209, 926 P.2d at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">\u00b648 Section 28-2-905, MCA, Montana\u2019s parole evidence rule, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">When extrinsic evidence concerning a written agreement may be considered. (1) Whenever the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing by the parties, it is to be considered as containing all those terms. Therefore, there can be between the parties and their representatives or successors in interest no evidence of the terms of the agreement other than the contents of the writing except in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">(a) when a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue by the pleadings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">(b) when the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">(2) This section does not exclude other evidence of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">circumstances under which the agreement was made or to which it relates, as described in 1-4-102, or other evidence to explain an extrinsic ambiguity or to establish illegality or fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">\u00b649 We find no ambiguity in the promissory note at issue here. It is clear on the face of the note that Kimbrell and the Hansons were to sign as individuals and not in any representative capacity. Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Pruyn intended that the Note was to be a personal responsibility of Kimbrell and the Hansons and specifically not an obligation of Axmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b650 Among his other arguments, Pruyn contended on appeal that the District Court misapplied various provisions of the UCC to the facts of this case. As the parties suggest, the promissory note in this case is an \u201cinstrument\u201d as defined by the UCC, Title 30, chapter 3, MCA, referring to negotiable instruments. Section 30-3-104, MCA. Under the UCC, a person or entity \u201cis not liable on an instrument unless: (a) the person signed the instrument; or (b) the person is represented by an agent or representative who signed the instrument and the signature is binding on the represented person under 30-3-403.\u201d Section 30-3-401, MCA. The UCC further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">(2) If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and that signature is an authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">(a) If the form of the signature shows unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the represented person who is identified in the instrument, the representative is not liable on the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">(b) ... <em>if the form of the signature does not show unambiguously that the signature is made in a representative capacity, or the represented person is not identified in the instrument, </em>the representative is liable on the instrument to a holder in due course that took the instrument without notice that the representative was not intended to be liable on the instrument. <em>With respect to any other person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that the original parties to the instrument did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Section 30-3-403, MCA (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b651 In the instant case, Kimbrell\u2019s signature of his own name and his forgery of the Hansons\u2019 signatures only binds Kimbrell individually. The promissory note does not show unambiguously that Kimbrell was signing as a representative of Axmen. In addition, Axmen, as the represented person, is not identified in the promissory note. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Pruyn was the holder of the note and not a \u201cholder in due course,\u201d the last sentence of \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), refers to \u201cany other person.\u201d Thus, \u201c[w]ith respect to any other person,\u201d such as Pruyn, Kimbrell alone is liable on the promissory note unless he can prove that Pruyn did not intend Kimbrell to be liable on the note. Section 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA. No such showing has been made here. On the contrary, as indicated in \u00b6\u00b6 45 and 46 of this Opinion, the evidence shows that Pruyn wanted the individuals-Kimbrell, Guy Hanson and Grant Hanson-liable on the note, not Axmen. The evidence further shows that Kimbrell made two payments to Pruyn on the note from Kmibrell\u2019s personal accounts and not from any account of Axmen\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b652 The evidence indicates that although Kimbrell was given authority by Axmen to purchase propane for Axmen\u2019s customers, Kimbrell was not given authority to speculate in such large amounts. The 1.7 million gallons of propane purchased from Powderhorn in this speculative transaction was a quantity that Axmen could not take possession of nor sell in its business operations. Such a large, short term, speculative transaction had never been entered into between Axmen and any supplier before this. While Axmen occasionally purchased propane for future use to minimize risk due to price fluctuations, the amounts purchased were closer to 80,000 gallons based on Axmen\u2019s available storage capacity. We cannot conclude from these facts that Kimbrell\u2019s signature alone would bind Axmen to a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b653 The Dissent contends that Kimbrell had ostensible authority to act as Axmen\u2019s agent. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that is true, Pruyn nonetheless made a conscious decision to make the loan personally to Kimbrell and the Hansons; to have Kimbrell personally sign the note; and to not name Axmen as the payor. //'Pruyn believed that Kimbrell-exercising his ostensible authority-was acting on behalf of Axmen and, accordingly made Axmen the payor, and \u00bf/\"Kimbrell had signed the note on behalf of Axmen, then we would have a different case. Those are not the facts, however. Pruyn was uniquely in the position to determine in whom he was creating a debt. Pruyn chose to create a debt personally in Kimbrell and the Hansons, and not in the entity he now, belatedly, contends owes him repayment on the loan. Once Kimbrell obtained the loan funds, they were his to do with as he pleased. The debt on which Pruyn is suing was never Axmen\u2019s because Pruyn never <em>made </em>it Axmen\u2019s obligation. Pruyn is the author of his own misfortune.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b654 As pointed out in \u00b6\u00b6 88 and 89 of the Dissent, there are two parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to the test for determining ostensible authority. However, because the test is worded in the conjunctive rather than the disjunctive, <em>both </em>parts of the test must be met for ostensible authority to exist. Even if we were to assume that the first part of the test had been met here, Pruyn has failed to establish that the facts in this case meet the second part of the test, i.e., that \u201ca prudent person, acting in good faith, under the circumstances, would reasonably believe the authority to be.\u201d <em>Youderian, </em>285 Mont. at 10, 945 P.2d at 914. Pruyn\u2019s own actions demonstrate that Pruyn himself was not convinced that Kimbrell had ostensible authority to bind Axmen to the note. If Pruyn believed so, he would not have instructed his attorney to require the Hansons\u2019 signatures on the note. Under the theory of ostensible authority suggested by Pruyn, Khnbrell\u2019s signature alone would have been enough to bind Axmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b655 Because Pruyn instructed his attorney to draft the promissory note with the signatures of Kimbrell and the Hansons individually, any uncertainty in the note must be construed against Pruyn. \u201cIn cases of uncertainty... the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.\u201d Section 28-3-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b656 The Dissent states in \u00b6 98 that if Kimbrell and Pruyn had intended to draft a loan agreement based solely on individual liability, Kimbrell would not have provided or needed to provide Pruyn with information about the company\u2019s assets, cash flow and accounts receivable. Kimbrell would have simply shown Pruyn his own personal financial documents. First, the Dissent wrongly focuses on Khnbrell\u2019s actions to support its ostensible authority theory. Second, as already indicated, this raises the following questions: If Pruyn believed that Kimbrell had ostensible authority to bind Axmen to the agreement, why did Pruyn insist on having the Hansons\u2019 names on the note as well? And, assuming ostensible authority existed here, wouldn\u2019t Kimbrell\u2019s signature have been sufficient to bind Axmen?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b657 The Dissent claims in \u00b6 93 that \u201c[i]t was only when the company suffered a financial loss that the Hanson brothers suddenly claimed that Kimbrell acted outside the scope of his authority.\u201d That supposition is not supported in the facts. Pruyn himself testified that when he approached Guy Hanson on Christmas Eve 2003 contending that Axmen owed Pruyn money, Guy Hanson disclaimed any knowledge of the promissory note or that Kimbrell had authority to enter into the note on behalf of Axmen. And, it was only after this encounter that Axmen learned that the promissory note was used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>cover Kimbrell\u2019s speculative transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">\u00b658 Moreover, in analyzing the second prong of the ostensible authority test, rather than focusing on \u201cwhat the principal did\u201d as the Dissent says we must, the Dissent claims in \u00b6 97 that Axmen is at fault because <em>Kimbrell </em>\u201cmet with Pruyn several times to discuss the loan\u201d and that <em>Kimbrell </em>\u201cgave Pruyn information relating to Axmen\u2019s assets, Axmen\u2019s cash flow and Axmen\u2019s accounts receivable.\u201d The Dissent also states in \u00b6 97 that \u201c[a] prudent person in Pruyn\u2019s position would believe that Kimbrell had authority to act on behalf of Axmen....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b659 As already noted in this Opinion, \u201cit is elementary that the acts, declarations, admissions, statements, or representations of an agent are not admissible against the principal to prove the power or authority of the agent or extent thereof....\u201d <em>Phelps, </em>105 Mont. at 199, 71 P.2d at 889. In other words, <em>Kimbrell\u2019s </em>actions in producing certain information regarding Axmen are not relevant to a determination of ostensible authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b660  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Axmen on Pruyn\u2019s contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b661 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Axmen on Pruyn\u2019s unjust enrichment claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b662 Pruyn argues that regardless of any finding relative to Krnibrell\u2019s authority, the fact remains that Pruyn\u2019s money was used to pay off Axmen\u2019s account at Powderhorn, thus Pruyn contends he is entitled to <em>quantum meruit </em>as a matter of law. Axmen argues, on the other hand, that Pruyn\u2019s unjust enrichment claim fails because the obligation is governed by an express contract; Pruyn waived any unjust enrichment claim against Axmen when he accepted payments from Kimbrell; Pruyn cannot establish the required elements of unjust enrichment; and such a claim is inconsistent with the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\u00b663 Unjust enrichment is an obligation created by law in the absence of an agreement between the parties. <em>Maxted v. Barrett, </em>198 Mont 81, 87, 643 P.2d 1161, 1164 (1982). In other words, courts have applied the theory of unjust enrichment when no contract exists between the parties, but a contract in law is implied. <em>Maxted, </em>198 Mont. at 87, 643 P.2d at 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">\u00b664 The doctrine of unjust enrichment is an equitable means of preventing one party from benefiting from his or her wrongful acts. <em>Albinger v. Harris, </em>2002 MT 118, \u00b6 21, 310 Mont. 27, 48 P.3d 711 (citing <em>Sebena v. State, </em>267 Mont. 359, 367, 883 P.2d 1263, 1268 (1994); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Randolph </em>V. <em>Peterson, Inc. v. J.R. Simplot </em>Co., 239 Mont. 1, 8, 778 P.2d 879, 883 (1989)). Among other things, a claim of unjust enrichment requires a plaintiff to show the element of misconduct or fault on the part of the defendant or that the defendant somehow took advantage of the plaintiff. <em>Ragland v. Sheehan, </em>256 Mont. 322, 327, 846 P.2d 1000, 1004 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b665 The undisputed facts show that Pruyn fails to meet this latter requirement to show misconduct or fault on Axmen\u2019s part. Axmen had no knowledge of the speculative transaction between Kimbrell and Powderhorn or the transaction between Kimbrell and Pruyn until Guy Hanson was confronted by Pruyn in December 2003. Since Guy and Grant Hanson were not aware of either transaction until shortly before suit was filed, Pruyn could not show any misconduct or fault on Axmen\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b666 The Dissent maintains that Axmen was unjustly enriched because Kimbrell engaged in misconduct by using Pruyn\u2019s loan to pay off Axmen\u2019s debt to Powderhorn. First, the Dissent fails to recognize the significance of the fact that it was Kimbrell who engaged in misconduct, not Axmen. Second, it has never been established that this was Axmen\u2019s debt. We pointed out in \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 52 of this Opinion that although Kimbrell was given authority by Axmen to purchase propane for Axmen\u2019s customers, Kimbrell was not given authority to speculate in this fashion. The 1.7 million gallons of propane purchased from Powderhorn in this transaction was a quantity that Axmen could not take possession of nor sell in its business operations. This amount was almost 20 times the volume of any previous order. Such a large, short term, speculative transaction had never been entered into between Axmen and any supplier before this. While Axmen occasionally purchased propane for future use to minimize risk due to price fluctuations, the amounts purchased were closer to 80,000 gallons based on Axmen\u2019s available storage capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b667 The Dissent also claims in \u00b6 93 that \u201c[tjhere is no indication that if the prices had risen instead of dropped, that Axmen would have rejected the propane and large profits resulting from Kunbrell\u2019s dealings ....\u2019\u2019However, there is also no indication that if there had been profits from this speculative deal of Kimbrell\u2019s that Axmen would have received any of said profits or that Axmen would even have known of the transaction to be able to reject or accept any such profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b668 And, finally, the Dissent claims in \u00b6 102 that \u201c[t]he record shows that the money was wired to the Axmen Propane account at Powder Horn.\u201d The record shows no such thing. The \u201cWire/Funds Transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Payment Order\u201d shows the originator of the wire transfer as \u201cPruyn Ranch\u201d and the beneficiary of the wire transfer as \u201cPowder Horn Petroleum\u201d referencing \u201cEd Kimbrell,\u201d not Axmen. Axmen is not mentioned anywhere in the wire transfer document. While the document the Dissent refers to in \u00b6 102 was attached as an exhibit to Pruyn\u2019s deposition, that document makes no sense. As the Dissent points out, that document is signed by Kimbrell, which begs the question: How could Kimbrell authorize a wire transfer from Pruyn\u2019s account?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">\u00b669  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Axmen on Pruyn\u2019s unjust enrichment claim</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b670 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding Axmen its attorney\u2019s fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b671 In awarding Axmen its attorney\u2019s fees, the District Court determined that Axmen was drawn into this lawsuit by Pruyn and forced to defend itself, and that \u201cPruyn doggedly persisted in seeking compensation from Axmen\u201d even though Pruyn knew \u201cfairly early on\u201d that Kimbrell forged Guy and Grant Hansons\u2019 signatures. The court concluded that \u201cPruyn\u2019s actions in this matter were in the very least frivolous and perhaps even malicious,\u201d thus the court granted Axmen\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees \u201c[i]n order to make Axmen whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b672 \u201cThe longstanding rule in Montana, also known as the American Rule, is that, absent a contractual or statutory provision to the contrary, attorney fees will not be awarded to the prevailing party in a lawsuit.\u201d <em>Pankratz Farms, Inc. v.

Anderson, </em>176 Mont. 507, 511-12, 580 P.2d 114, 116-17 (1978)). However, such awards are to be determined on a case-by-case basis, and \u201conly when a party has been forced to defend against a wholly frivolous or malicious action.\u201d <em>Pankratz, </em>\u00b6 93; <em>see also El Dorado Heights Homeown.

The promissory note specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">If legal action is commenced to collect this Note, each Maker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>agrees that the venue of such action shall be in Missoula County, Montana, that such action may be maintained without regard to the residence of any of the defendants, and that in any such action, both at trial and on appeal, each Maker will pay all costs and expenses and such sum as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b674 The District Court pointed out that this is an unusual case in that, had Pruyn prevailed, he would have been entitled to his attorney\u2019s fees under Montana contract law, yet when Axmen prevailed, it was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because it was not a party to the promissory note. The court concluded that such a result is inequitable and that, under its equity powers, the court may award attorney\u2019s fees to make an injured party whole. <em>See Braach v. Graybeal, </em>1999 MT 234, \u00b6 9, 296 Mont. 138, 988 P.2d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b675 However, as Pruyn noted, the equitable exception has been invoked infrequently, and only in cases with particularly limited facts. The exception does not apply where the losing party had a reasonable basis to believe his cause might prevail. <em>See Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s Inc., </em>255 Mont. 430, 446-47, 843 P.2d 765, 775-76 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b676 In this case, we conclude that whether or not Judge Deschamps agreed with Pruyn\u2019s position, there is no merit to the idea that Pruyn lacked a reasonable basis to believe he could recover his money from Axmen.

No matter what Kimbrell may have told him or showed him, Pruyn chose not to deal with Axmen and instead dealt only with Kimbrell as an individual. The Court is entirely correct that \u00a7 30-3-401, MCA, does not apply. It was solely Pruyn\u2019s mistake to trust Kimbrell and not check with the Hansons to make sure they signed the note. Axmen simply was not involved in Kimbrell\u2019s deal with Pruyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">\u00b685 I am willing to accept that Axmen, Inc., could have made a mistake and granted Kimbrell ostensible authority to deal with Powderhorn.

It is not established in the record, but maybe Axmen also made a mistake and granted Kimbrell ostensible authority to deal with Powderhorn. However, Axmen\u2019s mistake does not translate into a conclusion that it has been unjustly enriched by Pruyn\u2019s carelessness. In my opinion, Pruyn\u2019s carelessness was far more egregious than any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mistake Axmen might have made. However, at most, Pruyn and Axmen are equally at fault \u2014 and between those who are equally in the wrong, the law does not interpose.

The Court has failed to apply both parts of the test for determining ostensible authority. The Court has analyzed only the second step: \u201cPart of the test to determine whether ostensible authority exists is to determine what a prudent person, acting in good faith, under the circumstances, would reasonably believe the authority to be.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 42. While it is true that <em>part </em>of the test is, indeed, a \u201cprudent person\u201d perspective, the Court fails to analyze the first part of this Court\u2019s long-established test for determining ostensible authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b689 As we have held in <em>Butler, Audit Services, </em>and Yanzick: \u201cThe test is found in a determination of the exact extent to which the principal held the agent out or permitted him to hold himself out as authorized, <em>and </em>what a prudent person, acting in good faith, under the circumstances would reasonably believe the authority to be.\u201d <em>Butler Mfg. Co. v. J &amp; L Imp. Co., </em>167 Mont. 519, 527, 540 P.2d 962, 969 (1975) (emphasis added); <em>Yanzick v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>177 Mont. 459, 462-63, 582 P.2d 338, 340 (1978); <em>Audit Servs. v. Elmo Rd. Corp., </em>175 Mont. 533, 540, 575 P.2d 77, 81 (1978). Ostensible authority is \u201csuch as a principal, intentionally or by want of ordinary care, causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to possess.\u201d <em>Butler Mfg. Co., </em>167 Mont. at 524, 540 P.2d at 965. Ostensible authority \u201ccan be implied from the words and conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the particular case notwithstanding a denial by the alleged principal.\u201d <em>Youderian Constr. v. Hall, </em>285 Mont. 1, 7, 945 P.2d 909, 913 (1997) <em>(citingAudit Serv., Inc., </em>175 Mont. at 541, 575 P.2d at 81). Further, the agency relationship \u201cmay be implied from the conduct and from all the facts and circumstances in the case and it may be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Youderian, </em>285 Mont. at 7, 945 P.2d at 912-13. As outlined below, both requirements for ostensible authority are met in this case. Axmen is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u00b690 The words, conduct, circumstances and facts of this case all indicate that Kimbrell was acting with ostensible authority on behalf of Axmen. Axmen\u2019s sole officers, directors and shareholders were Edward Kimbrell, Grant Hanson, and Guy Hanson. Axmen, by \u201cwant of ordinary care,\u201d had failed to monitor or set limits on Kimbrell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>authority to act on behalf of the company. Kimbrell was Axmen\u2019s president and was vested with authority from the Hanson brothers to conduct day-to-day operations. Indeed, he was the <em>only </em>person in charge of daily operations at Axmen. Kimbrell was held out by the company to enter propane procurement contracts, which included both large and small amounts. No meetings, resolutions or authorization were ever required prerequisites of Kimbrell entering contracts on behalf of the company. It is difficult to understand how the Court can assert that Kimbrell was \u201cnot given authority to speculate in this fashion\u201d when there is no indication that the corporation had ever established that there were limits to the scope of Kimbrell\u2019s authority in the first place. Opinion, \u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b691 The Court makes a strained distinction between what it describes as this \u201cspeculative\u201d transaction and the other transactions Pruyn has engaged in on behalf of Axmen. Opinion, \u00b6 66. The record shows that Axmen allowed Kimbrell to engage in both, and he did so without limitation or question from the corporation. In the course of his employment at Axmen, Kimbrell engaged in \u201chedging transactions,\u201d in which he would purchase large amounts of propane at a fixed price, then sell it to customers at a future date. The company never objected. In fact, Guy Hanson\u2019s testimony indicates that Axmen had no written policy, oversight, or internal controls establishing the scope of Krmbrell\u2019s purchasing and/or hedging authority. And it is not this Court\u2019s prerogative to decide how much authority is too much authority. That is a decision Axmen should have made and enforced prior to what amounted to a financially deleterious outcome for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b692 Further, the majority of Kimbrell\u2019s actions as day-to-day business manager at Axmen were done on credit. Axmen admitted that Kimbrell was authorized to incur debt on behalf of Axmen. The corporation had no written policy articulating the scope of Kimbrell\u2019s borrowing authority. Therefore, the ex post facto claim that Kimbrell acted outside of his authority is untenable given that the company never articulated the scope of the authority it now claims has been overstepped.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b693 There is no indication that if the prices had risen instead of dropped, that Axmen would have rejected the propane and large profits resulting from Kimbrell\u2019s dealings on behalf of Axmen. It was only when the company suffered a financial loss that the Hanson brothers suddenly claimed that Kimbrell acted outside the scope of his authority. This is the exact type of \u201cwant of ordinary care\u201d on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of Axmen that satisfies the first prong of the ostensible authority test. The existence of ostensible authority is simply not dependent on the success or failure of the agent\u2019s dealings on behalf of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"ADf\">\u00b694 In determining whether Kimbrell was authorized to enter the transaction with Pruyn as a representative of Axmen, the Court focuses solely on the promissory note and the alleged individual liability it created. We have, however, made clear that the ostensible authority analysis is not a \u201cfour corners\u201d inquiry. It is measured by the conduct, all the facts and circumstances in the case, and may be shown by circumstantial evidence. <em>Youderian, </em>285 Mont. at 7, 945 P.2d at 912-13. Likewise, the Court improperly focuses on the inability of Axmen to store the propane resulting from the transaction. Opinion, \u00b6 52. Kimbrell had done this <em>type </em>of transaction in the past without objection from the corporation. Regardless, Axmen\u2019s ability to store the propane plays no part in the legal determination required under the two-part ostensible agency analysis. The germane fact here is that Axmen has a long track record of allowing Kimbrell to buy propane with no limits on his scope of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b695 The weight of responsibility under the first prong of the ostensible authority test lies not on Kimbrell\u2019s or Pruyn\u2019s shoulders, but on the shoulders of the corporation to exercise \u201cordinary care\u201d in establishing the boundaries of its president\u2019s authority. Under the legal standard for ostensible authority, the corporation-not Pruyn-authored this misfortune by failing to establish the scope of their president\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b696 The Court next concludes that the second prong of the ostensible authority test is not satisfied. Opinion, \u00b6 54. The assertion is not supported by any analysis under the \u201cprudent person\u201d standard. Instead, the Court states: \u201cPruyn himself was not convinced that Kimbrell had ostensible authority to bind Axmen to the note.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 54. This speculation about a party\u2019s thought process plays no role in the two-step analysis required by this Court\u2019s precedent on ostensible authority. The ostensible authority test does not ask the Court to divine whether Pruyn was convinced. It requires this Court to embark on a careful inquiry regarding \u201cwhat a prudent person, acting in good faith, under the circumstances would reasonably believe the authority to be.\u201d <em>Butler Mfg. Co. v. J &amp; L Imp. </em>Co., 167 Mont. at 527, 540 P.2d at 969; <em>Yanzick v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>177 Mont. at 462-63, 582 P.2d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"AZu\">\u00b697 This second prong of the ostensible authority test is satisfied. Kimbrell met with Pruyn several times to discuss the loan and details about the company. During the meetings, Kimbrell gave Pruyn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>information relating to <em>Axmen\u2019s </em>assets, <em>Axmen\u2019s </em>cash flow and <em>Axmen\u2019s </em>accounts receivable. Pruyn himself testified that based on the documentation from Axmen and his own investigation into the company\u2019s reputation and overall business prospects, he decided to lend Axmen $544,500. A prudent person in Pruyn\u2019s position would believe that Kimbrell had authority to act on behalf of Axmen: he was the company\u2019s president, ran day-to-day business operations, and appeared to have the authority to possess and share the company\u2019s private financial documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">\u00b698 If the two men intended to draft a loan agreement based solely on individual liability, as the Court concludes, Kimbrell would not have provided or needed to provide Pruyn with information about the company\u2019s assets, cash flow and accounts receivable. He would have simply shown Pruyn his own personal financial documents. The same applies to the Hanson brothers. Only their personal documents would have been necessary, <em>not </em>the corporation\u2019s financial documents. It was Pruyn\u2019s understanding that the money was to be used by Axmen to buy a tract of land on which a large number of propane tanks were to be stored. The financial disclosures and stated purpose do not suggest a personal, individual propane storage project.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b699 A prudent person under these circumstances would reasonably believe that Kimbrell, after providing and discussing the company\u2019s private financial documents, was acting on behalf of the company, not himself. Kimbrell had engaged in business transactions-whether they be hedging transactions or otherwise-for years on behalf of the company without a word from the Hanson brothers. The facts, conduct, and circumstances clearly indicate that Axmen\u2019s \u201cwant of ordinary care\u201d allowed Kimbrell to act, unbridled, on behalf of the corporation, and that a prudent person would have believed that Kimbrell was authorized to act on the company\u2019s behalf. Therefore, both of the required elements of the ostensible authority test are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b6100 The Court analyzes this case under \u00a7 30-3-403(2), MCA. Opinion, \u00b6 50. However, it is subsection one that directly applies. The statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">If a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing either the name of the represented person or the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature to the same extent the represented person would be if the signature were on a simple contract. If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the \u201cauthorized signature of the represented person\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>represented person is liable on the instrument, <em>whether or not identified in the instrument.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Section 30-3-403(1), MCA (emphasis added). The presence of the Axmen name on the contract is simply not necessary for the company to be held liable. Kimbrell, acting as a representative of Axmen, signed his name (\u201cthe signer\u201d). Under the statute, Axmen (the \u201crepresented\u201d) is bound by the signature, regardless of whether Axmen was identified in the instrument. Section 30-3-403(1), MCA. Kimbrell, via ostensible authority, signed as an authorized representative of the corporation, thus making Axmen liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b6101 Issue three addresses the unjust enrichment claim. The doctrine of unjust enrichment is an equitable means of preventing one party from benefitting from his or her wrongful acts and requires a showing of misconduct, fault or that one party took advantage of the other. <em>LeFeber v. Johnson, </em>2009 MT 188, \u00b6 26, 351 Mont. 75, 81, 209 P.3d <em>254, 260; Albinger v. Harris, </em>2002 MT 118, \u00b6 21, 310 Mont. 27, 33, 48 P.3d 711, 716; <em>Randolf v. Peterson, Inc. v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>239 Mont. 1, 8, 778 P.2d 879, 883 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b6102 Kimbrell, with ostensible authority from the corporation, borrowed money from Pruyn. The record shows that the money was wired to the <em>Axmen Propane </em>account at Powder Horn. Kimbrell is the only person who signed the wire transfer form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cOriginator\u2019s Name\u201d space reads: \u201cAxmen Propane, Inc.-Reference.\u201d The \u201cOriginator\u2019s Address\u201d is filled in with the business address of Axmen Propane. While \u201cPruyn Ranch\u201d is written in a blank space at the top of the page, the wire is signed by Edward Kimbrell, Axmen\u2019s president. The critical fact here, however, is that the money was received by Powder Horn, credited to Axmen Propane\u2019s account, and paid off the propane futures loss for Axmen Propane. The company unjustly benefited from the acts of its president. This scenario goes to the heart of unjust enrichment, in which the goal is to identify and ameliorate a breed of misconduct in which one party unjustly benefits from its own actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b6103 The Court bases its conclusion on the observation that the Hanson brothers were unaware of Krnibrell\u2019s purchase and the loan. However, under this Court\u2019s test for ostensible authority, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that the brothers granted Kimbrell the authority to engage in business on the corporation\u2019s behalf. Therefore, the focus of the analysis should not be on the brothers\u2019 alleged ignorance, but rather on the misconduct of the company through Kunbrell\u2019s ostensible authority. Axmen directly benefited from the misconduct of the corporation through its president, who illegitimately borrowed from Pruyn and applied the proceeds of the loan to pay off Axmen\u2019s debt to Powderhorn. Unjust enrichment therefore applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\">\u00b6104 For the above reasons, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on Pruyn\u2019s contract and unjust enrichment claims.</p>\n<judges id=\"b257-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> The Court refers to another document, titled \u201cWire/Fund Transfer Payment Order.\u201d The form we reference and the payment order reflect the same transaction. There is no indication in the record regarding the precise interaction or relative weight the two forms should be granted. Regardless, both documents reflect the reality that the money was used to pay off the Power Horn Petroleum debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
