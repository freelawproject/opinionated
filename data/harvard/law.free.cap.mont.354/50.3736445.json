The District Court concluded that a portion of the Clinic partnership agreements is void under \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, as a restraint upon exercising a lawful profession and granted summary judgment in favor of the Appellees. The Clinic appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b62 The facts which relate to the positions of Doctors Mungas, Dube, Mortenson, Harrer and Spencer differ from those relating to Doctors English and Key. The issues presented are:</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Did the District Court err in not dismissing the claims of Doctors Mungas, Dube, Mortenson, Harrer and Spencer, because the Clinic\u2019s obligations to them have been satisfied?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Is the claim of Dr. English barred by the provisions of \u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA, a statute of limitation in Montana\u2019s version of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">\u00b65 Issue 3: Did the District Court err in holding that the goodwill exception to the prohibition against contracts restraining trade does not apply?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">\u00b66 Issue 4: Did the District Court err in concluding that the provision of the Clinic\u2019s partnership agreements providing for forfeiture by a dissociating partner who practices in the Great Falls area is void as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">\u00b67 Issue 5: Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">\u00b68 The Great Falls Clinic is a medical partnership that has been operating in Great Falls since 1916. Over the years, the partners in the Clinic have practiced under various partnership agreements. The 2001 and 2004 partnership agreements are pertinent to this case. The 2001 partnership agreement contains the following provision entitled \u201cCovenant Not To Compete\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">Each Partner agrees that he or she will not, for a period of three years following his or her voluntary withdrawal from the Partnership, enter into or engage in the practice of medicine in the county of the principal place of his or her practice and in any contiguous county thereof, directly or indirectly, as owner, sole proprietor, partner, shareholder, member, employee, consultant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>or in any other capacity. In the event said Partner violates this covenant such partner shall forfeit the accounts receivable of his or her capital account referred to in Article 6. l(b)ii and all interest whatsoever in the MontanaCare capital account referred to in Article 6.1(b)iii<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The partnership agreement also provides that if a partner leaves the Clinic and is not in full compliance with the partnership agreement or is expelled, he or she suffers the same forfeitures. A dissociating partner is paid, over time, his share of the operational profits, capital contributions to the investment and equipment fund, stock, the actual value of their equity interest in the Clinic, and his interest in other entities in which the Clinic may have participated, regardless of his reason for leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b69 The 2004 partnership agreement changed the title of the covenant not to compete provision to \u201cCompeting After Withdrawal or Retirement.\u201d The 2001 and 2004 covenants restricting a departing partner\u2019s practice differed only in that a partner choosing to practice in Great Falls and the surrounding area within three years of separation would forfeit his interest in the Great Falls Surgery Center (a new subsidiary), in addition to the forfeitures listed under the 2001 partnership agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b610 All of the Appellees were parties to either the 2001 or 2004 partnership agreements and all of them were aware of the noncompetition covenants. The record shows that none of the Appellees voiced an objection to the noncompetition covenants during any partnership meetings or at any other time before they left the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b611 Upon their separation from the Clinic, each of the Appellees was asked to sign a separation agreement. Doctors Mungas, Mortenson, Dube, Harrer and Spencer signed such an agreement. The separation agreements signed by these Appellees itemized the amounts paid to them (profits, stock, partnership interest, etc.) and stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">Both parties agree that the following amounts represent all remaining interest of [the doctor], his heirs, representatives and assigns, in the Partnership and its assets and that payment of the same as herinafter set forth by the GREAT FALLS CLINIC, LLP to [the doctor] shall fully account to him and them for all amounts owing to or to become owing to him by the GREAT FALLS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>CLINIC, LLP by reason of his Partnership interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b612 Dr. English separated from the Clinic in September 2004. The Clinic sent him a separation agreement but he refused to sign it. When English notified the Clinic he was leaving the partnership, he requested that his MontanaCare account and accounts receivable be paid to him because, in addition to practicing in Great Falls, he would be practicing outside the geographic area delineated in the noncompetition covenant. The Clinic denied his request. English received a check and a statement of distribution from the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b613 Dr. Key did not sign a separation agreement, as well. He received a proposed separation agreement several months after he left the Clinic in November 2005. Key understood the proposed agreement was a statement of what he should anticipate receiving with his separation from the Clinic. He stated in his deposition he did not sign the separation agreement because he believed the forfeiture clause drives doctors out of the community and because doctors who have contributed through earnest hard work should not be penalized financially for a decision that they change their lives and change their practices. Key further expressed dissatisfaction with the Clinic\u2019s calculation of the amount he was to receive because, although his day-to-day practice was steady, the accounting of his production fluctuated.</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u00b614 From the record, it appears that in February 2006, Key received a check from the Clinic accompanied by a letter explaining that the amount of his separation payments had been miscalculated. Key has received and accepted monthly payments of $1,294.48 for his interest in the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b615 In February 2006, the Appellees filed this action and made several claims. However, by the time of the final pretrial conference only two claims remained: (1) the prayer for a declaratory judgment that the portion of the partnership agreements reducing the buyouts for former partners competing in Great Falls was void, and (2) the claim for recovery of the amounts forfeited under the provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u00b616 In the District Court, the Appellees asserted that the provision of the partnership agreements reducing payments to them was void as a matter of law because they are prohibited restraints on the ability to practice their profession under \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA. They further argued that the forfeiture portion of the partnership agreements are unreasonable because they are arbitrary and the forfeitures are not related to a legitimate business interest, as required by <em>Dobbins, Deguire &amp; Tucker, P.C. v. Rutherford, MacDonald &amp; Olson, </em>218 Mont. 392, 708 P.2d 577 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00b617 The Clinic responded that the forfeiture provision of the partnership agreements was not void under \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, because the reduction in payments to departing physicians fall within the exception for sale of goodwill, as is provided in \u00a7 28-2-704, MCA. At a hearing on pending motions, the Clinic also argued that Doctors Mungas, Dube, Mortenson, Harrer and Spencer may not recover any additional amounts because they reached an accord with the Clinic which had been satisfied. The Clinic also argued that the forfeiture provision of the partnership agreements was reasonable as a matter of law and therefore, the claims of the Appellees must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"AOd\">\u00b618 The District Court determined, as a matter of law, that the Appellees are entitled to recover the amounts they forfeited under the noncompetition covenants because neither exception provided in \u00a7\u00a7 28-2-704 and -705, MCA, applied, thus the covenants constituted an unenforceable restraint on trade under \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA. The District Court also held that no waiver existed and the statute of limitations did not apply. The District Court then calculated the amount owed by the Clinic to the Appellees and entered judgment in their favor for such amounts, plus attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s rulings on summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Paull v. Park County, </em>2009 MT 321, \u00b6 17, 352 Mont. 465, 218 P.3d 1198. We review the conclusions of law upon which the district court bases its decision to grant or deny summary judgment to determine if they are correct. <em>Apple Park, L.L.C. v. Apple Park Condominiums, L.L.C., </em>2008 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 345 Mont. 359, 192 P.3d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b620 <em>Issue 1: Did the District Court err in not dismissing the claims of Doctors Mungas, Dube, Mortenson, Harrer and Spencer, because the Clinic\u2019s obligations to them have been satisfied?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b621 Section 28-2-703, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">Any contract by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind, otherwise than is provided for by 28-2-704 or 28-2-705, is to that extent void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">\u00b622 The exception to \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, provided in \u00a7 28-2-704, MCA, concerning the sale of goodwill is discussed in Issue 3 below. The exception to \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, provided for in \u00a7 28-2-705, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>concerning dissolved partnerships, is not applicable as the Clinic partnership has not been dissolved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b623  The Clinic, citing \u00a7 28-1-1403, MCA, asserts that the five doctors who signed separation agreements-Mungas, Mortenson, Dube, Harrer and Spencer-may not recover further payments. Section 28-1-1403, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">Part performance of an obligation, either before or after a breach thereof, when expressly accepted by the creditor in writing in satisfaction or rendered in pursuance of an agreement in writing for that purpose, though without any new consideration, extinguishes the obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">If the forfeiture provision of the partnership agreements in question is void under \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, then in law, it is the same thing as if this provision had never existed. <em>School Dist. No. 1 of Silver Bow Co. v. Driscoll, </em>176 Mont. 555, 563-64, 568 P.2d 149, 154 (1977) (citing <em>Lowery v. Garfield Co., </em>122 Mont. 571, 584, 208 P.2d 478, 485 (1949)). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the forfeiture provision of the partnership agreements never existed, the record is clear that the creditors-Mungas, Mortenson, Dube, Harrer and Spencer-wouldhave been due an amount greater than that paid to them for their partnership interests. However, they expressly accepted payments representing a reduced amount of profits, stock, and partnership interest and signed written separation agreements which clearly state that the payments called for by these agreements constitute the full amount the Clinic is going to pay. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 28-1-1403, MCA, any obligation of the Clinic to pay more to Mungas, Mortenson, Dube, Harrer and Spencer is extinguished. The summary judgment of the District Court in favor of these five Appellees must be reversed and their claims dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b624 Because Doctors English and Key did not sign separation agreements, \u00a7 28-1-1403, MCA, does not apply to them. The Clinic does not argue that the claims of English and Key are extinguished by an accord and satisfaction or by the provisions of \u00a7 28-1-1403, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u00b625 <em>Issue 2: Is the claim of Dr. English barred by the provisions of\u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA, a statute of limitation in Montana\u2019s version of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u00b626 Dr. English withdrew from the Clinic on September 17, 2004. Near that time, the Clinic offered to pay the amount due to English under the partnership agreement. The Clinic claims that by the time this action was commenced in February 2006, English\u2019s claim was time barred as he did not file a complaint within 120 days of the time the Clinic offered to pay him. The statutes concerning the time within which English was required to bring this action are complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b627 Section 35-10-409, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">(2) A partner may maintain an action against the partnership or another partner for legal or equitable relief, including an accounting as to partnership business, to enforce:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">(b) a right under this chapter, including the partner\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">(ii) right on dissociation to have the partner\u2019s interest in the partnership purchased pursuant to 35-10-619 or enforce any other right under 35-10-616 through 35-10-623;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">(3) The accrual of and any time limitation on a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">\u00b628 Section 35-10-618(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">If a partner\u2019s dissociation results in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, 35-10-602, 35-10-609, and 35-10-624 through 35-10-629 apply; otherwise 35-10-619 through 35-10-623 apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\u00b629 Section 35-10-619(2) through (8), MCA, direct how a court determines the amount a dissociating partner is paid when, as in this case, his dissociation does not result in the dissolution and winding up of the partnership business. These subsections do not, however, refer to a calculation that is made under a partnership agreement. Then, \u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to 35-10-409(2)(b)(ii), to determine the buyout price of that partner\u2019s interest, any offsets under subsection (3), or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within 120 days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within 1 year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>dissociated partner\u2019s interest, any offset due under subsection (3), and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8), the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership\u2019s failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with the requirements of subsection (7).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaG\">\u00b630 As noted above, \u00a7 35-10-409(b)(2)(ii), MCA, provides that a dissociating partner, such as English, may maintain an action against a partnership, such as the Clinic, to enforce his right to have his interest in the partnership purchased pursuant to \u00a7 35-10-619, MCA. Section 35-10-619, MCA, subparagraphs (2) through (8), provide how the amount due is to be determined by a court. Subsection (9) of \u00a7 35-10-619, MCA, states that an action to determine how much is owed must be commenced within 120 days of the time the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay. However, it is uncertain whether the 120-day period within which to commence an action contained subsection (9) includes a case such as this, where the amount due is determined by reference to a partnership agreement, or whether the 120-day limitation only applies where no partnership agreement exists and a court must set the amount of the payment. The uncertainty is compounded by \u00a7 35-10-409(3), MCA, that provides the time limitation on a right of action is governed by other law, without stating whether \u201cother law\u201d includes \u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA, or requires a reference to periods of limitation found outside of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b631 The 120-day period of limitation in \u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA, could logically apply. The Appellees, in essence, bring this action to determine the buyout price of their partnership interest. On the other hand, it is also logical to interpret \u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA, to say that the 120-day limitation period only applies to an action where a court must set a buyout price as provided in \u00a7 35-10-619(2) through (8), MCA, without reference to a controlling partnership agreement. It is also logical to interpret \u00a7 35-10-409(3), MCA, to provide that the time within which an action must be commenced must be found in law other than \u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b632  Where a substantial question exists regarding which limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>statute should apply, a district court should, in accordance with public policy, resolve the doubt in favor of a statute containing the longer limitation. <em>Kearney v. KXLF Communications, Inc., </em>263 Mont. 407, 413, 869 P.2d 772, 775 (1994); <em>Demarest v. Broadhurst, </em>2004 MT 147, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 470, 92 P.3d 1168. Resolving the doubt about whether the 120-day limitation on bringing this action contained in \u00a7 35-10-619(9), MCA, bars English\u2019s claim in favor of a longer period of limitation, we conclude the District Court did not err in holding that the claim of English is not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b633 <em>Issue 3: Did the District Court err in holding that the goodwill exception to the prohibition against contracts restricting the ability to engage in a lawful profession does not apply ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b634 Section 28-2-704(1), MCA, provides an exception to the prohibition of restraints on trade:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">One who sells the goodwill of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business within the areas provided in subsection (2) so long as the buyer or any person deriving title to the goodwill from him carries on a like business therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b635  The Clinic argues that the forfeiture provision in the partnership agreements constitutes the sale of the goodwill of a business, and therefore fall within \u00a7 28-2-704, MCA. However, in interpreting \u00a7 28-2-704(1), MCA, this Court has held that a sale is a contract by which, for a pecuniary consideration called a price, one transfers to another an interest in property. Section 30-11-101, MCA; see <em>Western Montana Clinic v. Jacobson, </em>169 Mont. 44, 51, 544 P.2d 807, 811 (1976). In this instance, there is no payment or agreement to pay a pecuniary consideration in exchange for the transfer to another of an interest in property. There is no \u201csale\u201d of property. Section 28-2-704(1), MCA, the sale of goodwill exception to the prohibition on contracts in restraint of trade, does not apply to the partnership agreements at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b636 <em>Issue 4: Did the District Court err in concluding that the provision of the Clinic partnership agreements, which provide for forfeiture by a dissociating partner who practices in the Great Falls area, is void as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">\u00b637 As noted above in \u00b6 21, \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, provides that a contract which is determined to unreasonably restrain trade \u201cis to that extent void.\u201d Section 28-2-604, MCA, titled \u201cwhen contract partially void,\u201d provides that a contract with several distinct objects of which one is lawful and one is unlawful, the contract is void as to the latter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>valid as to the rest. Therefore, the noncompetition covenant in the Clinic partnership agreements would be severable from the remainder of the agreement should a determination be made that it is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"AVi\">\u00b638 In interpreting \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, this Court held in <em>J. T. Miller Co. v. Madel, </em>176 Mont. 49, 55, 575 P.2d 1321, 1324 (1978), that a noncompetition contract which completely barred an insurance salesman from selling insurance in Montana for five years after he left an insurance company was void. Later in <em>Dobbins, </em>the Court held that the holding in <em>Madel </em>applied only to those cases in which a covenant not to compete is, in effect, an absolute prohibition upon a person\u2019s right to engage in his business. <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont, at 395-96, 708 P.2d at 579. The restriction at question in <em>Dobbins </em>did not bar the dissociating partners from practicing their professions in the vicinity, but rather required that if they did so and represented clients of their former firm within one year of their dissociation, they must pay their former partnership an amount calculated under the agreement. <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont, at 396, 708 P.2d at 579. Under those circumstances, the Court held that the restraint on trade provision of the partnership agreement was not void under \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA. <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont, at 397, 708 P.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b639 The <em>Dobbins </em>Court concluded that in those instances where a contract contains a restraint on a person\u2019s ability to practice their profession, but such restraint is not an absolute prohibition, a factual determination must be made as to whether the covenant not to compete is reasonable. <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont, at 396, 708 P.2d at 579. The Court adopted the following three-part rule to be applied in determining whether a covenant is a reasonable restraint under \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA: (1) the covenant should be limited in operation either as to time or place; (2) the covenant should be based on some good consideration; and (3) the covenant should afford a reasonable protection for and not impose an unreasonable burden upon the employer, the employee or the public. <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont, at 397, 708 P.2d at 580. This interpretation of \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA, has been consistently followed. <em>Access Organics, Inc. v. Hernandez, </em>2008 MT 4, \u00b6\u00b6 16-27, 341 Mont. 73, 175 P.3d 899; <em>Montana Mountain Products v. Curl, </em>2005 MT 102, \u00b6\u00b6 11-17, 327 Mont. 7, 112 P.3d 979; <em>Daniels v. Thomas, Dean &amp; Hoskins, Inc., </em>246 Mont. 125, 144, 804 P.2d 359, 370-71 (1990); and <em>State Medical Oxygen and Supply, Inc. v. American Medical Oxygen Co., </em>240 Mont. 70, 74-75, 782 P.2d 1272, 1274-75 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b640  In this case, unlike <em>Madel </em>and like <em>Dobbins, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>noncompetition covenant in question is not an absolute prohibition on the right of English and Key to engage in their professions. But because they have chosen to practice in the proscribed area, the partnership agreements provide that they will not be paid as much. Still, they are entitled to receive a substantial amount of money for their partnership interests in the Clinic. Thus, the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of English and Key. The question of whether the covenants not to compete are reasonable must be remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b641 <em>Issue 5: Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b642 A district court\u2019s underlying decision as to whether legal authority exists to award attorney fees is a conclusion of law which this Court reviews to determine if the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Trustees of Indiana Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 15, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663; <em>Braach v. Graybeal, </em>1999 MT 234, \u00b6 6, 296 Mont. 138, 988 P.2d 761. A district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney fees is a discretionary ruling which this Court reviews for abuse of discretion. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b643 Generally, Montana follows the American Rule that a party in a civil action is not entitled attorney fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 19. The Clinic partnership agreements do not contain language regarding attorney fees. However, the Appellees prayed for declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, \u00a7\u00a7 27-8-101, MCA, <em>et seq. </em>In an action for a declaratory judgment, \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, may provide a statutory basis for awarding attorney fees as supplemental relief, if such an award is determined to be necessary and proper. <em>Martin v. SAIF Corp., </em>2007 MT 234, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 167, 167 P.3d 916; <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 41. This Court has adopted a \u201ctangible parameters\u201d test to determine whether a grant of attorney fees is necessary and proper. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 23. In this case, the District Court awarded attorney fees to the Appellees because it concluded an award of attorney fees is necessary and proper under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b644 In <em>Buxbaum, </em>while the Court determined that \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, may provide a statutory basis for awarding attorney fees, it also recognized that simply because a party filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment it is not automatically presumed that an award of attorney fees is necessary and proper. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 45. If such were the case, an award of fees to the prevailing party would be warranted in every garden variety declaratory judgment action and the American Rule on attorney fees would be eviscerated. This Court has upheld the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>American Rule in the face of similar concerns. <em>See Sampson v. National Farmers Union Prop. and Cas. </em>Co., 2006 MT 241, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22, 333 Mont. 541, 144 P.3d 797; <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 23, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649. In both of these instances, the Court rejected claims for an exception to the American Rule that were more compelling than the claims for fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b645 In <em>United National Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 38, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260, this Court recently held that implicit in the determination of whether an award of attorney fees is necessary and proper is a threshold question of whether the equities support a grant of attorney fees. Thus, while a district court has the discretion to award attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, such fees are only appropriate if equitable considerations support the award. This determination must be made before a court applies the criteria of the tangible parameters test. <em>United National, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b646  As stated in their brief on appeal, the Appellees acknowledge they brought this action to recover amounts withheld by the Clinic under a portion of a contract that they allege is void. The true purpose of this action is to secure a judgment for money. The partnership agreements were entered into by relatively sophisticated, well-educated, well-informed physicians who dealt with each other on an equal footing. In this case, we have similarly situated parties disputing whether a contract provision is void. In applying equitable considerations to the facts of this case, the Court concludes that the equities do not support an award of attorney fees. Because this threshold requirement is not met, we do not reach an analysis of the tangible parameters test. Upon remand, no party may recover attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b647 The summary judgment in favor of Doctors Mungas, Mortenson, Dube, Harrer and Spencer is reversed and upon remand the District Court is directed to dismiss those claims. The summary judgment in favor of Doctors English and Key is reversed and their claims are remanded for trial. Upon trial, no party shall be entitled to attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\"> MontanaCare is a subsidiary partnership of the Clinic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> A limited liability partnership is included in the term \u201cpartnership.\u201d Section 35-10-102(5)(b), MCA.
