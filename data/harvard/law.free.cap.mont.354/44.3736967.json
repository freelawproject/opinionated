David, Jr., to pay child support for their minor child; and divided the marital estate. Willis appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b62 The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by applying the time rule formula to divide Willis\u2019s pension?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by not directing Jacqueline M. David (Jackie) to reimburse Willis for the cost of the survivor benefit plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by its distribution of the marital estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">\u00b66 The parties were married in Wisconsin in 1983 and moved to Montana soon thereafter. Two children were born to the marriage, one of whom had attained the age of 18 when the marriage was dissolved in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">\u00b67 At the time of the dissolution hearings, Jackie, a 44-year-old high school graduate, was self-employed as a contract rural mail carrier. Her contract paid her $41,318 per year, of which she netted $24,797 in 2005. She had been the primary caregiver for the children. At the time of the hearings, 46-year-old Willis had been employed by the Montana National Guard for 20 years. He was both on active duty and a member of the Guard\u2019s reserve component, with a base salary of $52,549 per year. In addition, he received $1,012 each month as a basic housing allowance and $187.49 as a basic subsistence allowance, both of which are non-taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">\u00b68 The District Court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage, adopted a parenting plan for their younger child, and ordered Willis to pay Jackie $569 per month as child support, plus $5,358 in arrearages, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>to continue to maintain health and dental insurance for the younger child. The court also divided the parties\u2019 personal property. It ordered the proceeds of the sale of the family home split between the parties after payment of credit card debt, and ordered Willis to pay Jackie $3,045 for her share of a half-acre of property that he retained. The court also awarded Jackie a portion of Willis\u2019s anticipated retirement benefits. Willis appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. If the court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, we will affirm the distribution of property unless the court abused its discretion. The test for an abuse of discretion in a marriage dissolution proceeding is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Pospisil, </em>2000 MT 132, \u00b6 19, 299 Mont. 527, 1 P.3d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b610 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by applying the time rule formula to divide Willis\u2019s pension?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\u00b6 11 It is well-established that retirement benefits are part of a marital estate. <em>Rolfe v. Rolfe, </em>234 Mont. 294, 296, 766 P.2d 223, 225 (1988). In <em>Rolfe, </em>we adopted what is known as the time rule formula for dividing retirement benefit payments between parties to a dissolution of marriage. This formula is used in situations in which the spouse entitled to a retirement benefit has not yet ended employment, so that the retirement benefit is not yet being received. Under the formula, the non-employee spouse\u2019s share of the retirement benefit is computed by dividing the employee spouse\u2019s years of service during the marriage by the employee spouse\u2019s total years of service, and then multiplying the result by one half of the employee spouse\u2019s monthly after-tax retirement benefits. <em>Rolfe, </em>234 Mont at 298, 766 P.2d at 226. In the present case, the District Court\u2019s decree of dissolution provides that the time rule formula will be used to determine Jackie\u2019s share of Willis\u2019s retirement benefits when he retires from the National Guard. \u00b612 Willis contends the court instead should have used a format recommended by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the federal agency charged with paying out military pensions to retirees and, in the case of divorce, their ex-spouses. Under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>format, an award to an ex-spouse of a person who is still on active duty at the time of the divorce will not provide the ex-spouse the benefit of any of the military member\u2019s post-divorce promotions or pay increases after the divorce; an award to Jackie of a share of Willis\u2019s retirement income would be calculated using a hypothetical retirement date of the date the marriage was dissolved. Willis presented, as an exhibit at trial, a publication setting forth the DFAS recommendations. He maintains the District Court abused its discretion in failing to use the DFAS-recommended method to calculate Jackie\u2019s share of his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b613 Willis points out that many states have adopted the principle, reflected in the DFAS recommendations but not in the time rule formula, that an ex-spouse should not benefit from a service member\u2019s post-divorce promotions or pay increases. <em>See e.g. Grier v. Grier, </em>731 S.W.2d 931 (Tex. 1987). However, Jackie points out that other states have considered but not adopted the DFAS recommendations, having ultimately determined it more fair to use the time rule formula. <em>See In re Marriage of Hunt, </em>909 P.2d 525 (Colo. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b614  The time rule formula employed by the District Court in dividing Willis\u2019s future retirement benefits has been approved by this Court and used in Montana since 1988. Willis has failed to convince us \u2018that the District Court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice when it used that formula to determine the manner in which Willis\u2019s retirement benefits will be divided. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by applying the \u2022time rule formula to divide Willis\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by not directing Jackie to reimburse Willis for the cost of the survivor benefit plan?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b616 Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) coverage allows a non-service member former spouse of a service member to receive a portion of the service member\u2019s retirement after the death of the service member. <em>See </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448(b). The District Court\u2019s decree of dissolution states Willis has elected SBP coverage for Jackie through his employer, and orders that he shall not change that election and shall continue to participate in SBP and to designate Jackie as his beneficiary. Willis contends the parties agreed, at the dissolution hearing, that Jackie would reimburse Willis for SBP premiums. That provision does not appear in the dissolution decree, and Willis argues its omission represents an abuse of discretion. Nothing in the record indicates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>amount of those monthly premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b617 The transcript of the second hearing in this matter shows that Jackie\u2019s counsel pointed out to the District Court that, under her proposed findings of fact, she would reimburse Willis for SBP premiums. However, the District Court was not required to adopt that proposed finding, or any other proposed finding submitted by the parties. We note that the court did not adopt all of the proposed findings presented by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b618  We hold Willis has failed to establish that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to direct Jackie to reimburse Willis for the cost of the survivor benefit plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b619 <em>Issue 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by its distribution of the marital estate ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b620 Under this issue, Willis claims the parties made a pre-hearing agreement on various property division issues which the District Court did not honor. Specifically, Willis claims the parties agreed that the date first set for the dissolution hearing-in December of 2005-would be the cutoff date used in computing Jackie\u2019s interest in his retirement benefits. The District Court instead used the May 2006 hearing date. Willis also points out that the court gave Jackie property valued at approximately $9,000 more than the property it ordered distributed to him, which he contends violates the agreement of the parties that the marital estate would be divided equally between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b621  Jackie responds that there was no executed agreement between the parties on these matters. The record supports her position. Moreover, as a general rule, the value of marital assets should be determined at or near the time of dissolution. <em>See In re Marriage of Hochhalter, </em>2001 MT 268, \u00b6 17, 307 Mont. 261, 37 P.3d 665. The end date selected by the District Court for computation of the value of Jackie\u2019s interest in Willis\u2019s future retirement benefits meets that description. Also, the court was not required to award the parties property of precisely equal value. <em>See In re Marriage of Payer, </em>2005 MT 89, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 459, 110 P.3d 460. We hold Willis has not established that the District Court abused its discretion by its distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b72-11\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AGa\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">\u00b623 I concur with the Court\u2019s Opinion. However, in my view, the Opinion cannot be read to require that a district court must in every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>instance utilize the formula affirmed in this case when it distributes a retirement plan. Nor is it required that a district court always divide that portion of a plan which is being distributed equally between the parties. An even distribution is not mandated by \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, which is flexible and vests a good deal of discretion in the district court. As this Court has consistently stated, each case must be looked at individually, with an eye to its unique circumstances. <em>Marriage of Harris, </em>2006 MT 63, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 368, 132 P.3d 502; <em>Marriage of Laster, </em>197 Mont. 470, 476, 643 P.2d 597, 601 (1982).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
