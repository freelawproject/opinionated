We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\u00b62 MRL contracted with Powder River to provide employee transportation for MRL\u2019s workers. MRL and Powder River entered into a contract for services. The contract contained an indemnity provision, which required Powder River to \u201c[ijndemnify and hold MRL harmless from and against any and all loss, liability, damages, claims, demands, costs and expenses of whatsoever nature arising out [of] contractors [sic] actions in performing this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">\u00b63 Thomas Salazar (Salazar) was a locomotive engineer for MRL. On March 3, 2004, Salazar was injured when a van operated by Powder River was involved in a rollover accident en route to Helena, Montana. As an employee of MRL, Salazar was covered under MRL\u2019s \u201cWellness Program.\u201d The Wellness Program is an ERISA-compliant plan created as a result of a collective bargaining agreement entered into between MRL and Salazar\u2019s labor union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. The Wellness Program provides certain medical and wage continuation benefits for covered injuries. The Wellness Program confers substantial discretion upon the administrator of the Wellness Program regarding eligibility determinations to receive benefits. For instance, Section 2.2 of the Wellness Plan, entitled \u201cRequirements for Benefits for a Covered Injury,\u201d reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">(a) A Qualified Employee who incurs a Covered Injury must notify his or her immediate supervisor; and make and submit to the Company a report (in the manner and at the time required by Plan Rules) of the circumstances giving rise to the Injury. A Qualified Employee who is a member of a collective bargaining unit must comply with any reporting requirements imposed by the collective bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>(c) The Plan Administrator has the right to have a Physician of its choice examine the Qualified Employee as needed to determine the extent of the Injury and the limitations restricting work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">(d) The Plan Administrator has the right to obtain information to administer the Plan, including information to determine eligibility, validity of claims, and the benefits payable under the Plan. A Qualified Employee must provide the information requested for Plan administration purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">(f) The Plan Administrator is entitled, in its sole discretion, to rely upon the opinion of an independent medical expert\u2019s evaluation as to whether medical treatment and/or a work restriction is the direct and proximate result of a Covered Injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b64 Four days after the accident, Salazar filed a personal injury report with MRL. Jacquie Duhame (Duhame) was the program administrator at that time. Salazar described his injuries as pertaining to his ribs and neck muscles. Salazar was seen by Dr. Kevin McCrea, M.D., an emergency room physician, on March 8, 2004. Duhame had preapproved the visit. Dr. McCrea noted that Salazar had right-sided musculoskeletal pain, and gave him medication to treat these symptoms. On March 10,2004, Dr. Lawrence Splitter, D.O., performed a return-to-work physical on Salazar. Salazar reported that he had sore ribs on his right side, soreness from his right hip to the right shoulder blade, and soreness on the right side of his neck. Dr. Splitter diagnosed Salazar as having \u201cright chest wall contusion, cervical strain, and right hip pain.\u201d Dr. Splitter discharged Salazar and cleared him to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b65 On March 24, 2004, Salazar was seen by Dr. Patrick Clancy, a chiropractor. Although Salazar was allowed to return to work, he received treatment from Dr. Clancy on March 24 and July 13,2004, for pain in his neck, shoulders, and back. These visits were preapproved by Duhame. Salazar continued to experience symptoms from the accident. Duhame subsequently approved Salazar to see Dr. Steven Rizzolo, M.D. on October 4, 2004. Salazar\u2019s main complaint was low back pain. Salazar also indicated a \u201clittle bit of neck and right arm pain\u201d but stated that these were \u201cminor\u201d complaints, and had been occurring prior to the accident. Dr. Rizzolo conducted x-rays of Salazar. Dr. Rizzolo diagnosed Salazar with \u201cprobable cervical and lumbar soft tissue sprains, numbness and tingling in his hands.\u201d Dr. Rizzolo recommended an MRI to rule out compression of the spinal cord given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the hand numbness and tingling, and stiffness in Salazar\u2019s neck. Dr. Rizzolo also recommended EMG and nerve conduction velocities of the upper extremities to rule out carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Rizzolo suspected that Salazar had soft tissue injuries and simply needed more time to heal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b66 Salazar saw Dr. Rizzolo for a follow-up on November 22, 2004. Prior to the visit, Salazar had further diagnostic tests conducted, including x-rays and a bone scan. Based on the results of the tests, Dr. Rizzolo concluded Salazar suffered from soft tissue injuries and sprains. Dr. Rizzolo cleared Salazar for work activities. Dr. Rizzolo also noted that Salazar had numbness and tingling in his hands and recommended EMG studies consistent with the recommendation in the previous exam. EMG tests were conducted by Dr. Arturo Echeverri on April 19, 2005. Dr. Echeverri concluded that the results of the tests demonstrated neurophysiological evidence of a mild bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Rizzolo subsequently reviewed the test results and diagnosed Salazar with \u201cpossible carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d Dr. Rizzolo recommended that Salazar be seen by Dr. Ralph Costanzo, M.D., for further examination of the nature and cause of the carpal tunnel symptoms. In his note, Dr. Rizzolo stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">At this point, my only recommendation is for evaluation with Dr. Costanzo. Initially, I think this should be covered by work comp. If he think[s] it is carpal tunnel and not related to the motor vehicle accident, that would be his decision. With regards to his neck and back, he will follow-up with me after he sees Dr. Costanzo. No change in work restrictions. He is at maximum medical improvement for his neck and back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b67 On August 31, 2005, Dr. Costanzo examined Salazar. Salazar reported developing numbness and tingling in his hands radiating proximally into his forearms roughly four weeks after the accident. Dr. Costanzo examined Salazar, and performed several tests. Dr. Costanzo concluded that Salazar had mild carpal tunnel syndrome and recommended a conservative management of his symptoms, including the use of corticosteroid injections and splinting. Dr. Costanzo did not place any activity or work restrictions on Salazar. With respect to the causation of his carpal tunnel syndrome, Dr. Costanzo concluded \u201cI am doubtful that his current hand symptoms are likely a result of the motor vehicle accident.\u201d Duhame subsequently approved Salazar\u2019s treatment of corticosteroid injections with Dr. Costanzo. Salazar had a follow-up visit with Dr. Costanzo on October 10, 2005, where they further discussed Salazar\u2019s symptoms, as well as further treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>options including carpal tunnel release surgery. At the time, Salazar indicated that he did not wish to undergo surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b68 On November 7,2005, Salazar was referred to Dr. Jeffrey Hansen, M.D. Salazar reported numbness in both hands and pain in his right shoulder. Dr. Hansen suggested that Salazar was suffering from cuff tendonitis bursitis as well as carpal tunnel. Dr. Hansen ordered an MRI and opined that Salazar would likely improve from carpal tunnel surgery. On January 1, 2006, Dr. Hansen saw Salazar again and reviewed his MRI. The results confirmed that Salazar was suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. Dr. Hansen opined that Salazar had a good chance of improving from carpal tunnel release surgery, and recommended that he have the surgery as well as arthroscopic subacromial decompression of the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b69 On January 18, 2006, Dr. Hansen wrote a letter confirming Salazar\u2019s diagnosis of rotator cuff tendonitis and impingement and carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Hansen opined that Salazar was in need of carpal tunnel surgery and rotator cuff decompression with arthroscopy. Duhame approved the surgery. Dr. Hansen performed right carpal tunnel release and right shoulder surgery on March 14, 2006, and performed left carpal tunnel release surgery on April 11, 2006. Dr. Hansen released Salazar to return to work on September 18, 2006. After his release, Salazar had follow-up visits with Dr. Hansen. On October 24, 2006, Salazar reported pain in his left hand and right shoulder, especially when engaging the right shoulder in overhead functions. Salazar did not complain of carpal tunnel symptoms. At that time, Dr. Hansen opined that Salazar was permanently totally disabled and recommended that Salazar be pulled from work and placed on long-term disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b610 On December 7, 2006, Salazar filed a negligence suit against Powder River and MRL. On March 30, 2007, MRL answered and filed a cross claim against Powder River seeking to be indemnified for Salazar\u2019s damages, including medical expenses and wage loss claims, as well as attorney fees incurred in its defense of Salazar\u2019s claims. On July 3, 2007, Powder River answered Salazar\u2019s complaint, but did not at that time respond to MRL\u2019s cross-claim for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b611 On December 10, 2007, Salazar returned to Dr. Rizzolo, complaining of approximately 8 to 10 weeks of progressive back pain and pain in the muscles on both sides of his back. Dr. Rizzolo ordered a bone scan which came back normal. Dr. Rizzolo did find some evidence of irritation of the nerves on the left side of his leg and restricted range of motion on his back. Dr. Rizzolo later testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the leg symptoms were new, and that he had no explanation for increased back symptoms roughly two and a half years after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b612 On April 4, 2008, Dr. John C. Schumpert, M.D., performed an independent medical examination (IME) on Salazar at Powder River\u2019s request. Dr. Schumpert examined Salazar and reviewed his medical records. Based on his examination, Dr. Schumpert concluded that the van accident did not play even the slightest role in Salazar\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and surgery, his right shoulder condition and surgery, or his low back pain. Dr. Schumpert concluded that the injuries Salazar sustained to his right paracervical muscles, right trapezius muscles, left lateral chest wall, and right lateral hip, all resolved by the time Salazar was evaluated by Dr. Rizzolo on October 4, 2004. Dr. Schumpert concluded that Salazar\u2019s inability to work was due to his right shoulder condition, which was totally unrelated to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b613 On July 11, 2008, MRL, Salazar, and Powder River entered into a settlement. Salazar agreed to drop his claims against Powder River and MRL for $355,667.54. $260,000 of this amount represented new money to be paid to Salazar. The remaining $95,667.54 represented money previously paid by MRL for medical, wage continuation and disability benefits under the terms of MRL\u2019s Wellness Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b614 On December 5, 2008, Powder River responded for the first time to MRL\u2019s March 2007 cross-claim for indemnification. Powder River claimed that it was not required to indemnify MRL for costs and fees incurred in its defense of Salazar\u2019s claims, nor was it required to indemnify MRL for benefits already paid to Salazar by MRL. Additionally, Powder River claimed that MRL had acted unreasonably in adjusting Salazar\u2019s claim, thus barring it from seeking indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b615 A bench trial on MRL\u2019s indemnification claims was held on February 13, 2009. The District Court received numerous exhibits regarding Salazar\u2019s treatment, including deposition testimony from the physicians who treated Salazar. Additionally, the District Court received direct testimony from Duhame concerning her adjustment of Salazar\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u00b616 On March 31,2009, the District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. The District Court ordered Powder River to indemnify MRL for the $95,667.54 expended on Salazar as a result of the March 3, 2004 accident. The District Court also ordered Powder River to indemnify MRL for attorney fees and costs MRL incurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>its defense of Salazar\u2019s claims arising out of the van accident. The District Court denied MRL\u2019s claims for attorney fees and costs expended in establishing its right to indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b617 In its findings, the District Court reviewed Salazar\u2019s medical history and treatment resulting from the van accident. The District Court also considered deposition testimony given by Drs. Rizzolo, Costanzo, and Hansen. Dr. Rizzolo testified that the van accident caused Salazar\u2019s cervical and lumbar strain. Dr. Rizzolo also testified that he deferred to Dr. Costanzo on any opinions concerning Salazar\u2019s carpal tunnel diagnosis. Dr. Costanzo testified that it was \u201cdoubtful\u201d that the van accident had caused Salazar\u2019s carpal tunnel symptoms. Dr. Costanzo admitted it was possible that carpal tunnel could arise several weeks after an accident, but in his practice such symptoms arose much closer in time to the injury event. Dr. Hansen testified that Salazar\u2019s carpal tunnel and shoulder problems were typically associated with \u201coveruse\u201d and \u201cyears of doing overhead related activities,\u201d and that carpal tunnel syndrome was generally a \u201cprogressive, overuse-related kind of chronic condition.\u201d The District Court determined that Dr. Hansen opined Salazar\u2019s shoulder and carpal tunnel syndromes were caused by a combination of overuse and injury, and that the accident contributed to Salazar\u2019s carpal tunnel symptoms and was a direct cause of his shoulder injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b618 The District Court also reviewed the indemnification provision in the contract for services between MRL and Powder River, as well as the terms of MRL\u2019s Wellness Program. The District Court noted that the program administrator has discretion to pay medical expenses and rely on medical evidence, if the employee complies with the Wellness Program\u2019s provisions, and reports a \u201ccovered injury\u201d pursuant to Section 2.2. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6 3. The District Court also noted that the program administrator has a fiduciary duty to properly administer claims for the injured employee, and must have a reasonable basis to believe a claim is a covered injury. The District Court determined that Duhame had paid Salazar\u2019s claims in accordance with the terms of the Wellness Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b619 The District Court further noted that MRL had incurred defense costs of $62,291.89 in defense of Salazar\u2019s claim, and determined that MRL had a contractual right to offset for amounts already paid to Salazar when it entered into settlement negotiations. Further, the District Court noted that Duhame testified that Powder River did not dispute the amount or nature of MRL\u2019s payments to Salazar prior to the settlement conference. With regard to the final settlement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>District Court determined that Powder River affirmatively relied upon MRL\u2019s prepaid $95,667.54 to negotiate a lower settlement of Salazar\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b620 In its conclusions of law, the District Court, citing to <em>Amazi v. Atlantic Richfield </em>Co., 249 Mont. 355, 816 P.2d 431 (1991), noted that contracts for indemnification are to be construed liberally in favor of the indemnitee. Citing to <em>American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Idaho First Nat. Bank, </em>328 F.2d 138 (9th Cir. 1964), the District Court further observed that any act on the part of an indemnitee which materially increases the risk to, or prejudices the rights of, an indemnitor will discharge the indemnitor under a contract of indemnity. The District Court also noted that because MRL was a railroad subject to the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act (FELA), the obligation to indemnify MRL was broader than that in a traditional negligence action because MRL\u2019s duty towards its employees was greater. <em>See Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. v. Ayers, </em>538 U.S. 135, 145, 123 S. Ct. 1210, 1216-17 (2003) (\u201cFELA renders common carrier railroads liable in damages to any person suffering injury while ... employed by [the] carrier if the injury or death result[ed] in whole or in part from the [carrier\u2019s] negligence.\u201d) (quotation omitted, alterations in original); <em>Rogers v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 500, 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 448 (1957) (Liability is established under FELA if the employer\u2019s \u201cnegligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b621 With these principles as well as the provisions of the indemnity agreement and Wellness Program in mind, the District Court concluded Duhame properly determined that Salazar had suffered a covered injury entitling him to the payment of benefits. The District Court concluded that Duhame properly exercised her discretion to obtain and review medical evidence, and that she had a reasonable basis to believe Salazar\u2019s claims were covered under the Wellness Program. Specifically, the District Court noted that none of the health care providers in this case expressly ruled out the van accident as the cause of Salazar\u2019s injuries. Additionally, Salazar\u2019s own statements indicated that his symptoms got progressively worse after the accident, and that he had not complained of any symptoms prior to the accident. Accordingly, the District Court concluded that Duhame carried out her duties as program administrator in good faith, in accordance with ERISA and the terms of the plan, and in no way materially increased the risk to, or prejudiced the rights of, Powder River. Furthermore, the District Court noted that Powder River acknowledged Salazar\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>injuries and their cause when it utilized monies already paid by MRL to reach a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b622 Finally, the District Court concluded that MRL was entitled to be indemnified and held harmless for all amounts paid as costs of defense, including attorney fees, as a result of the claim asserted against it by Salazar.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b623 Powder River now appeals from the District Court\u2019s decision. We state the issues presented by this appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b624 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court err in ordering Powder River to indemnify MRL for medical bills and wage loss benefits it paid to Salazar prior to settlement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b625 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court err in ordering Powder River to indemnify MRL for attorney fees and costs incurred in its defense against Salazar\u2019s claim </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b626 We review findings of fact in a bench trial in a civil action to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence to support those findings. <em>DeNiro v. Gasvoda, </em>1999 MT 129, \u00b6 9, 294 Mont. 478, 982 P.2d 1002. We view this evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>DeNiro, </em>\u00b6 9. Conclusions of law are reviewed for correctness. <em>DeNiro, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">\u00b627 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court err in ordering Powder River to indemnify MRL for medical bills and wage loss benefits it paid to Salazar prior to settlement ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">\u00b628 Powder River claims the District Court erred in ordering it to indemnify MRL for Salazar\u2019s medical and wage loss benefits. First, Powder River asserts that the indemnity provision pertains only to claims \u201carising out of\u2019 its negligence. Here, Powder River asserts that Salazar\u2019s shoulder, carpal tunnel, and lumbar conditions did not arise out of the March 3, 2004 accident, but were due to his work as a locomotive engineer for MRL. Powder River claims the District Court erred in concluding otherwise based on the evidence before it, and asserts that the medical evidence shows these conditions were not related to the accident. Powder River claims the District Court concluded that Salazar\u2019s conditions were related to the accident simply because none of the treating physicians conclusively ruled out a relationship between these injuries and the accident. Powder River argues this reasoning is illogical and insufficient to prove causation of these conditions, especially in the face of substantial credible evidence showing that the carpal tunnel, shoulder, and lumbar conditions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>not related to, or caused by, the van accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b629 Second, Powder River asserts that the District Court erred in concluding that Duhame properly adjusted Salazar\u2019s claim under the Wellness Program. Powder River notes that an indemnitee (i.e., MRL) has a good faith obligation not to materially increase the risk to, or prejudice the rights of, an indemnitor (here, Powder River). Powder River claims that Duhame failed to adjust Salazar\u2019s claim in good faith because she paid every bill, without inquiry, and exposed Powder River to risk for injuries which were not related to the van accident. Powder River argues that the medical evidence available to an adjuster should demonstrate some causal link between the work-related accident and the claimed injury, and that the medical evidence here established no such link.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b630 In fact, Powder River asserts that the medical evidence casts doubt on whether these conditions were actually related to the accident, and indicates that the carpal tunnel, shoulder, and lumbar conditions were caused by Salazar\u2019s work for MRL as a locomotive engineer, and not by the van accident. Powder River notes that Dr. Schumpert conducted an IME and specifically concluded that these conditions were work-related, and not caused in the slightest degree by the van accident. As a result, Powder River claims that it was prejudiced by Duhame\u2019s actions in adjusting the claim, and that it should be discharged from the obligation to indemnify MRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b631 In response, MRL asserts that Duhame made a reasonable determination to pay benefits to Salazar under the Wellness Program. Citing to <em>Boyd v. Bert Bell / Pete Rozelle NFL Players Retirement Plan, </em>410 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir. 2005), MRL claims that so long as Duhame\u2019s decision was made in good faith upon a reasonable interpretation of the plans terms, it should be upheld. MRL argues that because Salazar\u2019s injury occurred during the scope and course of his employment, and none of the treating physicians specifically ruled out the van accident as the cause of his conditions, Duhame\u2019s decision was reasonable. MRL asserts that Duhame did not need to be absolutely certain of causation to pay benefits under the Wellness Program so long as her decision was reasonable, and that requiring Salazar to conclusively prove causation would defeat the purpose of the ERISA-based Wellness Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b632 Further, MRL claims that the broad language of the indemnity provision covers Salazar\u2019s claims because they arose out of the accident, and that Powder River must indemnify it for payment of Salazar\u2019s medical and wage loss benefits. Additionally, MRL suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that Powder River is estopped from denying indemnification based on the position it took during settlement negotiations, and the fact that it relied upon monies MRL had already paid to Salazar in negotiating a reduced final settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b633 As an initial matter, we agree with the District Court that Duhame was acting within her discretion when she paid medical and wage loss benefits to Salazar under the Wellness Plan. Because MRL is covered by FELA, if its negligence plays any part in injuries to Salazar, however slight, it bears responsibility for damages. <em>See Rogers, </em>352 U.S. at 506, 77 S. Ct. at 448. Furthermore, the ERISAbased Wellness Program confers both significant discretion and fiduciary responsibilities upon the program administrator with regard to Salazar\u2019s claims. <em>See Boyd, </em>410 F.3d at 1178. The decision of a program administrator in this context is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion and will not be reversed unless \u201cit (1) renders a decision without explanation, (2) construes provisions of the plan in a way that conflicts with the plain language of the plan, or (3) relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>410 F.3d at 1178. Duhame\u2019s decision to pay benefits to Salazar did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b634 Separate and apart from Duhames\u2019 obligations to Salazar, however, stand MRL\u2019s duties to Powder River due to the indemnitorindemnitee relationship between these two parties. In <em>First Jersey Nat. Bank v. Dome Petroleum Ltd., </em>723 F.2d 335 (3rd Cir. 1983), the Third Circuit discussed the nature of this fiduciary relationship, and stated that if an indemnitee is responsible for putting an indemnitor in a \u201cprecarious position\u201d whereby it is increases the indemnitor\u2019s risk of loss, then the duty to indemnify may be discharged. <em>First Jersey, </em>723 F.2d at 342. In this case, Powder River argues that Duhame unquestioningly paid claims which had nothing to do with the van accident, and in doing so increased the risk it would end up paying for claims which were related to Salazar\u2019s work with MRL, and not the van accident. Because Powder River should bear no risk of loss for Salazar\u2019s work-related conditions, it argues that Duhame\u2019s adjusting methods prejudiced it and warrants its discharge from the indemnity obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b635 Powder River\u2019s argument in this regard has arguable merit. Salazar was referred to Dr. Costanzo for the specific purpose of evaluating his carpal tunnel symptoms. Dr. Costanzo\u2019s opinion cast doubt on whether this condition was actually a result of the accident. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6 7. While Duhame certainly had an obligation to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Salazar under the Wellness Plan, she also owed a duty to Powder River, as an indemnitor, to make sure it would not be exposed to risk of loss for injuries which did not result from Powder River\u2019s alleged negligence. Once Dr. Costanzo indicated \u201cdoubt\u201d as to whether Salazar\u2019s carpal tunnel symptoms were caused by the van accident, Duhame should have ordered an IME in order to protect Powder River from overexposure. Thus, to the extent Duhame failed to take sufficient steps to protect Powder River\u2019s interest as the law of indemnity requires, Powder River would be entitled to discharge of its obligation to the extent that MRL\u2019s actions materially increased its risk of loss and caused Powder River damage. <em>See Gen. Ins. Co. of Am. v. </em>Fleeger, 389 F.2d 159, 161 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b636 As Powder River correctly notes, the Ninth Circuit has expressly stated that the principle for discharging an indemnitor\u2019s obligation on this basis is derived by analogy from the law of surety. <em>See Am. Cas. Co., </em>328 F.2d at 143. In other words, the relief requested by Powder River in this case derives not from statute or the common law, but instead solely from principles of <em>equity. See Am. Cas. Co., </em>328 F.2d at 143-45. As we have previously stated, parties must not expect relief in equity unless they come into court with \u201cclean hands.\u201d <em>Cowan v. Cowan, </em>2004 MT 97, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 13, 89 P.3d 6. In order to secure relief in equity, a party \u201cis required to come into court with clean hands, and with a cause whose ethical qualities [are] such as to commend it to the conscience of the court.\u201d <em>Seifert v. Seifert, </em>173 Mont. 501, 506, 568 P.2d 155, 158 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b637 Prior to settlement negotiations, Dr. Schumpert performed an IME at Powder River\u2019s request and concluded that the van accident did not cause any of the conditions for which MRL had already paid Salazar. Yet, Powder River never provided notice to MRL that it would challenge its right to seek indemnification until over 4 months after the settlement, after it had relied upon these prepaid monies to leverage a lower settlement with Salazar. Indeed, it did not respond to or contest MRL\u2019s cross-claim for indemnification for over a year and a half. The District Court specifically found that \u201cPowder River relied upon MRL\u2019s prepaid $95,667.54 to negotiate a lower settlement of Salazar\u2019s claims. Powder River now refuses to reimburse MRL.\u201d Powder River claims it is excused from indemnifying MRL on the basis that the previously-paid medical and wage loss benefits were not related to Salazar\u2019s accident-related injuries. If that were so, then it should not have taken advantage of MRL\u2019s prepaid monies to negotiate a lower settlement figure. It would be inequitable to allow Powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>River to refuse to indemnify MRL, while at the same time receiving the benefit of paying a smaller portion of the settlement to which it already agreed. Based on Powder River\u2019s failure to notify MRL prior to settlement that it would challenge MRL\u2019s right to indemnification, we conclude that Powder River does not come into court with clean hands and may not avail itself of the equitable relief it now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"Aif\">\u00b638  Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Powder River is required to indemnify MRL for the wage loss and medical benefits it has paid to Salazar. We agree with the District Court that Duhame had a reasonable basis to pay Salazar under the terms of the ERISA-based Wellness Program. However, we do not conclude that Duhame adequately discharged the duties she owed to Powder River as an indemnitor. Duhame\u2019s failure to request an IME in order to separate Salazar\u2019s work-related claims from those related to the van accident arguably increased Powder River\u2019s exposure to a risk of loss beyond that which it agreed to indemnify. However, Powder River may not be discharged from its obligation to indemnify MRL because it does not come into court with clean hands. Thus, although we do not entirely agree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning, we affirm because the District Court ultimately reached the right result. <em>See State v. Hendershot, </em>2009 MT 292, \u00b6 33, 352 Mont. 271, 216 P.3d 754.</p>\n<p id=\"AOv\">\u00b639 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court err in ordering Powder River to indemnify MRL for attorney fees and costs incurred in its defense against Salazar\u2019s claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b640 In awarding MRL attorney fees and costs incurred in defending against Salazar\u2019s claim, the District Court relied upon \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">An indemnity against claims, demands, or liability, expressly or in other equivalent terms, embraces the costs of defense against such claims, demands, or liability incurred in good faith and in the exercise of a reasonable discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b641 The District Court determined that MRL\u2019s defense costs against Salazar\u2019s claims were incurred in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable discretion, and thus \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA, applied to support an award of attorney fees and costs. The District Court also noted the broad language of the indemnity provision between MRL and Powder River. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b642 Powder River asserts the District Court erred. Citing to <em>Transaction Network, Inc. v. Wellington Technologies, Inc., </em>2000 MT 223, 301 Mont. 212, 7 P.3d 509, and <em>United Nat. Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Powder River argues that attorney fees are not available pursuant to the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d unless specifically provided by contract or statute. Powder River claims the indemnity provision itself does not specifically provide for an award of attorney fees. Further, Powder River maintains that the District Court erred in relying upon \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA, as a statutory basis for an award of attorney fees. Powder River notes that \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA, allows an award for the \u201ccosts of defense,\u201d but not for an award of attorney fees. Powder River cites to <em>Trustees oflnd. University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 30, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 633, and <em>Martin v. Randono, </em>191 Mont. 266, 270, 623 P.2d 959, 962 (1981), for the proposition that \u201ccosts of defense\u201d do not include attorney fees. Because there is no express contractual basis for an award of attorney fees, and because \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA, provides only for an award of \u201ccosts,\u201d but not attorney fees, Powder River argues the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b643 MRL claims that \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA, does support the award of attorney fees in this case, and that the term \u201ccosts of defense\u201d should be construed to include attorney fees. MRL argues that California courts and the Ninth Circuit have interpreted identical language in California statutes to conclude that the \u201ccosts of defense\u201d in the indemnity context includes attorney fees. <em>See Davis v. Air Technical Indus., </em>Inc., 582 P.2d 1010 (Ca. 1978); <em>DeWitt v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., </em>719 F.2d 1448, 1453 (9th Cir. 1983). MRL also notes that the Fifth Circuit has upheld an award of attorney fees based on an indemnity agreement which was no more specific than the one present in this case, and did not specifically reference attorney fees. <em>See Signal Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Barge W-701, </em>654 F.2d 1164, 1177-78 (5th Cir. 1981). Finally, MRL notes that the Alaska Supreme Court has recognized the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that in \u201cactions of indemnity, brought where the duty to indemnify is either implied by law or arises under contract, <em>and no personal fault of the indemnitee has joined in causing the injury, </em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in resisting the claim indemnified against may be recovered as part of the damages and expenses.\u201d <em>D.G. Shelter Products Co. v. Moduline Indus., </em>Inc., 684 P.2d 839, 841 n. 5 (Alaska 1984) (quotation omitted, emphasis in original). MRL argues that it is also entitled to attorney fees under this general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b644 Because our disposition of this matter is governed by Montana law, citations to other jurisdictions are not persuasive in this case. First, this Court\u2019s precedent establishes that attorney fees are not available in the absence of a specific contractual provision or statutory basis providing for attorney fees. <em>St. Paul Fire, </em>\u00b6 37; <em>Transaction </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>Network, </em>\u00b6 22. Although the indemnity provision in this case is broadly worded, it does not specifically provide for an award of attorney fees. Thus, the indemnity provision itself does not provide a basis for an award of attorney fees. We agree with Powder River that the parties could have included a provision for an award of attorney fees in the indemnity agreement but did not do so. While some jurisdictions such as Alaska allow attorney fees in the indemnity context irrespective of whether attorney fees are specifically mentioned, we have not adopted this general rule in Montana, and MRL has not presented a persuasive argument as to why this Court should adopt a new exception to the American Rule in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b645  Furthermore, we agree with Powder River that the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees on a statutory basis pursuant to \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA. \u201cWe interpret a statute first by looking to its plain language. Language that is clear and unambiguous requires no further interpretation.\u201d <em>Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. State of Mont., Dept. of Revenue, </em>2009 MT 5, \u00b6 20, 348 Mont. 333, 201 P.3d 132. The distinction between \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cattorney fees\u201d is well-established in Montana; \u201ccosts\u201d do not generally include \u201cattorney fees.\u201d <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 30 (quoting <em>Martin, </em>191 Mont, at 270, 623 P.2d at 962). Section 28-11-315, MCA, therefore does not provide a statutory basis for an award of attorney fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b646 We affirm in part and reverse in part. The District Court correctly concluded that Powder River was required to indemnify MRL for medical and wage loss benefits paid to Salazar. However, the District Court erred in concluding that Powder River must indemnify MRL for attorney fees in this case, as nothing in the indemnity agreement or \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA, provides a basis for this award. MRL is entitled, however, to an award of any \u201ccosts\u201d incurred in its defense against Salazar\u2019s claims pursuant to \u00a7 28-11-315, MCA. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
