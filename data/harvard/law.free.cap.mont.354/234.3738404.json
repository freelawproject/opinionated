Paul Loehnen, M.D., Lar Autio, M.D., George Risi, Jr., M.D., and Compassion &amp; Choices; and from the District Court\u2019s decision that a competent, terminally ill patient has a right to die with dignity under Article II, Sections 4 and 10 of the Montana Constitution, which includes protection of the patient\u2019s physician from prosecution under the homicide statutes. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b62 We rephrase the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b63 I. Whether the District Court erred in its decision that competent, terminally ill patients have a constitutional right to die with dignity, which protects physicians who provide aid in dying from prosecution under the homicide statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b64 II. Whether Mr. Baxter is entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u00b65 This appeal originated with Robert Baxter, a retired truck driver from Billings who was terminally ill with lymphocytic leukemia with diffuse lymphadenopathy. At the time of the District Court\u2019s decision, Mr. Baxter was being treated with multiple rounds of chemotherapy, which typically become less effective over time. As a result of the disease and treatment, Mr. Baxter suffered from a variety of debilitating symptoms, including infections, chronic fatigue and weakness, anemia, night sweats, nausea, massively swollen glands, significant ongoing digestive problems and generalized pain and discomfort. The symptoms were expected to increase in frequency and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>intensity as the chemotherapy lost its effectiveness. There was no cure for Mr. Baxter\u2019s disease and no prospect of recovery. Mr. Baxter wanted the option of ingesting a lethal dose of medication prescribed by his physician and self-administered at the time of Mr. Baxter\u2019s own choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b66 Mr. Baxter, four physicians, and Compassion &amp; Choices, brought an action in District Court challenging the constitutionality of the application of Montana homicide statutes to physicians who provide aid in dying to mentally competent, terminally ill patients. The complaint alleged that patients have a right to die with dignity under the Montana Constitution Article II, Sections 4 and 10, which address individual dignity and privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b67 In December 2008, the District Court issued its Order and Decision, holding that the Montana constitutional rights of individual privacy and human dignity, together, encompass the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to die with dignity. The District Court held that a patient may use the assistance of his physician to obtain a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. The patient would then decide whether to self-administer the dose and cause his own death. The District Court further held that the patient\u2019s right to die with dignity includes protection of the patient\u2019s physician from prosecution under the State\u2019s homicide statutes. Lastly, the District Court awarded Mr. Baxter attorney fees. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b68 We review an order granting summary judgment de novo using the same standards applied by the District Court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Bud-Kal v. City of Kalispell, </em>2009 MT 93, \u00b6 15, 350 Mont. 25, 30, 204 P.3d 738, 743. Where there is a cross-motion for summary judgment, we review a district court\u2019s decision to determine whether its conclusions were correct. <em>Bud-Kal, </em>\u00b6 15. We review an award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Trs. of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 15, 315 Mont. 210, 216, 69 P.3d 663, 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u00b69 The parties in this appeal focus their arguments on the question of whether a right to die with dignity-including physician aid in dying-exists under the privacy and dignity provisions of the Montana Constitution. The District Court held that a competent, terminally ill patient has a right to die with dignity under Article II, Sections 4 and 10 of the Montana Constitution. Sections 4 and 10 address individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>dignity and the right to privacy, respectively. The District Court further held that the right to die with dignity includes protecting the patient\u2019s physician from prosecution under Montana homicide statutes. The District Court concluded that Montana homicide laws are unconstitutional as applied to a physician who aids a competent, terminally ill patient in dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b610 While we recognize the extensive briefing by the parties and amici on the constitutional issues, this Court is guided by the judicial principle that we should decline to rule on the constitutionality of a legislative act if we are able to decide the case without reaching constitutional questions. <em>State v. Adkins, </em>2009 MT 71, \u00b6 12, 349 Mont. 444, 447, 204 P.3d 1, 5; <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 62, 338 Mont. 259, 279, 165 P.3d 1079, 1093. Since both parties have recognized the possibility of a consent defense to a homicide charge under \u00a7 45-2-211(1), MCA, we focus our analysis on whether the issues presented can be resolved at the statutory, rather than the constitutional, level.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b611 We start with the proposition that suicide is not a crime under Montana law. In the aid in' dying situation, the only person who might conceivably be prosecuted for criminal behavior is the physician who prescribes a lethal dose of medication. In that the claims of the plaintiff physicians are premised in significant part upon concerns that they could be prosecuted for extending aid in dying, we deem it appropriate to analyze their possible culpability for homicide by examining whether the consent of the patient to his physician\u2019s aid in dying could constitute a statutory defense to a homicide charge against the physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b612 The consent statute would shield physicians from homicide liability if, with the patients\u2019 consent, the physicians provide aid in dying to terminally ill, mentally competent adult patients. We first determine whether a statutory consent defense applies to physicians who provide aid in dying and, second, whether patient consent is rendered ineffective by \u00a7 45-2-2 ll(2)(d), MCA, because permitting the conduct or resulting harm \u201cis against public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b613 Section 45-5-102(1), MCA, states that a person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if \u201cthe person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being ....\u201d Section 45-2-211(1), MCA, establishes consent as a defense, stating that the \u201cconsent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense or to the result thereof is a defense.\u201d Thus, if the State prosecutes a physician for providing aid in dying to a mentally competent, terminally ill adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>patient who consented to such aid, the physician may be shielded from liability pursuant to the consent statute. This consent defense, however, is only effective if none of the statutory exceptions to consent applies. Section 45-2-211(2), MCA, codifies the four exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">Consent is ineffective if: (a) it is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense; (b) it is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect, or intoxication is unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense; (c) it is induced by force, duress, or deception; or (d) it is against public policy to permit the conduct or the resulting harm, even though consented to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The first three statutory circumstances rendering consent ineffective require case-by-case factual determinations. We therefore confine our analysis to the last exception and determine whether, under Montana law, consent to physician aid in dying is against public policy. For the reasons stated below, we find no indication in Montana law that physician aid in dying provided to terminally ill, mentally competent adult patients is against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b614 Section 45-2-2 11(2)(d), MCA, renders consent ineffective if \u201cit is against public policy to permit the conduct or the resulting harm, even though consented to.\u201d We addressed the applicability of this provision in <em>State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, 345 Mont. 469, 191 P.3d 451. This Court held that the consent of a victim is not a defense to the charge of aggravated assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA. <em>Mackrill, </em>\u00b6 33. The <em>Mackrill </em>decision, while not limiting the exception\u2019s reach, applied the \u201cagainst public policy\u201d exception to situations in which violent, public altercations breach public peace and endanger others in the vicinity. Physician aid in dying, as analyzed below, does not fall within the scope of what this Court has thus far identified as \u201cagainst public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b615 The <em>Mackrill </em>case arose from a particularly violent altercation between Jason Mackrill and Robert Gluesing outside a Livingston bar. Mackrill, who had been drinking heavily, spent the better part of the evening disrupting other bar-goers, including Gluesing. When a bartender refused to serve Mackrill, Gluesing offered Mackrill a few dollars and encouraged him to go elsewhere. Mackrill became obstinate and refused to leave. When the bartender picked up the phone to call the police, Gluesing escorted Mackrill out of the bar. Once outside, Mackrill began punching Gluesing, including a \u201cvery solid shot\u201d that caused Gluesing\u2019s feet to come off the ground and the back of his head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>to hit the pavement. A witness called 9-1-1 and paramedics arrived on the scene. They found Gluesing unconscious and bleeding in the street. He was transported to the hospital and treated for head injuries, including a skull fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b616 The State charged Mackrill with one count of aggravated assault, a felony under \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA. He pleaded not guilty and filed a Notice of Affirmative Defenses, in which he stated he would argue consent as a defense at trial. The jury found Mackrill guilty. He then filed a post-trial motion claiming the State failed to introduce evidence upon which the jury could conclude Gluesing did not consent to the fight. After a hearing on the matter, the district court denied the motion. Mackrill appealed. This Court concluded that consent is not an effective defense against an assault charge under \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA. <em>Mackrill, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b617 The <em>Mackrill </em>decision is the only Montana case addressing the public policy exception to consent. It demonstrates one set of circumstances in which consent as a defense is rendered ineffective because permitting the conduct or resulting harm is \u201cagainst public policy.\u201d This \u201cagainst public policy\u201d exception to consent applies to conduct that disrupts public peace and physically endangers others. Clearly, under <em>Mackrill, </em>unruly, physical and public aggression between individuals falls within the parameters of the \u201cagainst public policy\u201d exception. The men were intoxicated, brawling in a public space, and endangering others in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b618 A survey of courts that have considered this issue yields unanimous understanding that consent is rendered ineffective as \u201cagainst public policy\u201d in assault cases characterized by aggressive and combative acts that breach public peace and physically endanger others.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b619 The State of Washington is home to an unusual volume of these \u201cpublic policy\u201d exception cases. Washington courts have consistently held that the \u201cpublic policy\u201d exception applies only to brutish, irrational violence that endangers others. In <em>State v. Dejarlais, </em>the Supreme Court of Washington held that consent is not a defense to violations of a domestic-violence protection order. 136 Wn. 2d 939, 942, 969 P.2d 90, 91 (Wash. 1998). In <em>State v. Hiott, </em>the court determined that consent is not a defense to a game in which two people agreed to shoot BB guns at each other because it was a breach of the public peace. 97 Wn. App. 825, 828, 987 P.2d 135, 137 (Wash. App. Div. 2 1999). In <em>State v. Weber, </em>the court held consent is not a defense to the charge of second degree assault between two incarcerated persons. 137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Wn. App. 852, 860, 155 P.3d 947, 951 (Wash. App. Div. 3 2007). The court noted there \u201cis nothing redeeming or valuable in permitting fighting and every reason to dissuade it.\u201d <em>Weber, </em>155 P.3d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b620 In <em>State v. Fransua, </em>the Court of Appeals of New Mexico held that one person\u2019s taunting invitation to \u201cgo ahead\u201d and shoot him did not establish a valid consent defense for another person who took him up on the offer. 85 N.M. 173, 174, 510 P.2d 106, 107 (N.M. App. 1973). In the Superior Court of New Jersey, a defendant claimed he was not guilty of assault and battery because he and his wife agreed that if she consumed alcohol he would physically assault her as punishment. <em>State v. Brown, </em>143 N.J. Super. 571, 580, 364 A.2d 27, 32 (N.J. Super. L. Div. 1976). He argued consent as a defense after the state charged him with assault and battery. <em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 28. The court held that failing to punish Brown \u201cwould seriously threaten the dignity, peace, health and security of our society.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b621 The above acts-including the <em>Mackrill </em>brawl-illustrate that sheer physical aggression that breaches public peace and endangers others is against public policy. In contrast, the act of a physician handing medicine to a terminally ill patient, and the patient\u2019s subsequent peaceful and private act of taking the medicine, are not comparable to the violent, peace-breaching conduct that this Court and others have found to violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b622 The above cases address assaults in which the defendant alone performs a direct and violent act that causes harm. The bar brawler, prison fighter, BB gun-shooter, and domestic violence aggressor all committed violent acts that directly caused harm and breached the public peace. It is clear from these cases that courts deem consent ineffective when defendants directly commit blatantly aggressive, peace-breaching acts against another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b623 In contrast, a physician who aids a terminally ill patient in dying is not directly involved in the final decision <em>or </em>the final act. He or she only provides a means by which a terminally ill patient <em>himself </em>can give effect to his life-ending decision, or not, as the case may be. Each stage of the physician-patient interaction is private, civil, and compassionate. The physician and terminally ill patient work together to create a means by which the patient can be in control of his own mortality. The patient\u2019s subsequent private decision whether to take the medicine does not breach public peace or endanger others.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b624 Although the \u201cagainst public policy\u201d exception of \u00a7 45-2-211(2)(d), MCA, is not limited to violent breaches of the peace as discussed in the above cases, we see nothing in the case law facts or analysis suggesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>that a patient\u2019s private interaction with his physician, and subsequent decision regarding whether to take medication provided by a physician, violate public policy. We thus turn to a review of Montana statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b625 We similarly find no indication in Montana statutes that physician aid in dying is against public policy. The Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act (Terminally 111 Act) and the homicide statute\u2019s narrow applicability to \u201canother\u201d human being, do not indicate that physician aid in dying is against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b626 Under \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, a \u201cperson commits the offense of deliberate homicide if: (a) the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being ....\u201d In physician aid in dying, the physician makes medication available for a terminally ill patient who requests it, and the patient would then choose whether to cause his own death by self-administering the medicine. The terminally ill patient\u2019s act of ingesting the medicine is not criminal. There is no language in the homicide statute indicating that killing \u201coneself,\u201d as opposed to \u201canother,\u201d is a punishable offense, and there is no separate statute in Montana criminalizing suicide. There is thus no indication in the homicide statutes that physician aid in dying-in which a terminally ill patient elects and consents to taking possession of a quantity of medicine from a physician that, if he chooses to take it, will cause his own death-is against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b627 There is similarly no indication in the Terminally 111 Act that physician aid in dying is against public policy. The Terminally 111 Act, by its very subject matter, is an apt statutory starting point for understanding the legislature\u2019s intent to give terminally ill patients-like Mr. Baxter-end-of-life autonomy, respect and assurance that their life-ending wishes will be followed. The Terminally 111 Act expressly immunizes physicians from criminal and civil liability for following a patient\u2019s directions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Section 50-9-204, MCA. Indeed, the legislature has criminalized the <em>failure </em>to act according to the patient\u2019s wishes. Section 50-9-206, MCA. Other parts of the Terminally 111 Act also resonate with this respect for the patient\u2019s end-of-life preferences. Section 50-9-205, MCA, explicitly prohibits, \u201cfor any purpose,\u201d calling the patient\u2019s death a \u201csuicide or homicide,\u201d and \u00a7 50-9-501, MCA, charges the Montana Attorney General with creating a \u201cdeclaration registry\u201d and waging a statewide campaign to educate Montanans about end-of-life decisionmaking. The statute even establishes a specialized state fund account specifically for the registry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>education program. Section 50-9-502(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b628 The Rights of the Terminally 111 Act very clearly provides that terminally ill patients are entitled to autonomous, end-of-life decisions, even if enforcement of those decisions involves direct acts by a physician. Furthermore, there is no indication in the Rights of the Terminally 111 Act that an additional means of giving effect to a patient\u2019s decision-in which the patient, without any direct assistance, chooses the time of his own death-is against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b629 The Montana Legislature codified several means by which a patient\u2019s life-ending request can be fulfilled. The Terminally 111 Act authorizes an individual \u201cof sound mind and 18 years of age or older to execute at any time a declaration governing the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment.\u201d Section 50-9-103, MCA. The Terminally 111 Act defines \u201clife-sustaining treatment\u201d as any medical procedure or intervention that \u201cserves only to prolong the dying process.\u201d Section 50-9-102(9), MCA. The declaration is operative when it is communicated to the physician or registered nurse and the declarant is determined to be in a terminal condition and no longer able to vocalize his end-of-life wishes. Section 50-9-105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b630  The Terminally 111 Act, in short, confers on terminally ill patients a right to have their end-of-life wishes followed, even if it requires <em>direct </em>participation by a physician through withdrawing or withholding treatment. Section 50-9-103, MCA. Nothing in the statute indicates it is against public policy to honor those same wishes when the patient is conscious and able to vocalize and carry out the decision himself with self-administered medicine and no immediate or direct physician assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b631 The Terminally 111 Act contains declaration forms a patient may use to legally ensure his end-of-life instructions will be followed. The forms shed critical light on the end-of-life roles of terminally ill Montanans and their physicians, as envisioned and codified by the legislature. The first declaration states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">If I should have an incurable or irreversible condition that, without the administration of life-sustaining treatment, will, in the opinion of my attending physician or attending advanced practice registered nurse, cause my death within a relatively short time and I am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, I direct my attending physician or attending advanced practice registered nurse, pursuant to the Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act, to withhold or withdraw treatment that only prolongs the process of dying and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>necessary to my comfort or to alleviate pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Section 50-9-103(2), MCA. The declaration language of \u00a7 50-9-103, MCA, not only highlights the legislature\u2019s intent to provide terminally ill patients with various means to express (and have followed) their autonomous end-of-life preferences, but also authorizes physician involvement in both the terminal diagnosis and the act of withdrawing or withholding treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b632 The legislature, in creating this legally-enforceable declaration, also immunized physicians and medical professionals who act in accordance with the patient\u2019s wishes. The statute shields physicians from liability for following a patient\u2019s instructions to stop life-sustaining treatment, or refrain from treating him altogether. Section 50-9-204, MCA. The Dissent states that the Terminally 111 Act only allows the \u201ctaking away of, or refraining from giving\u201d life-sustaining medical treatment. The Dissent\u2019s definition of \u201cwithdraw\u201d confirms that this \u201ctaking away\u201d is, itself, a direct act by the physician. \u201cWithdrawal\u201d is <em>\u201cthe act of </em>taking back or away\u201d something that was granted. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>2627 (Philip Babcock Gove ed., G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1971) (emphasis added). The \u201cgiving\u201d is an act, as is the \u201ctaking away.\u201d The Terminally 111 Act authorizes physicians to commit a direct <em>act </em>of withdrawing medical care, which hastens death. In contrast, the physician\u2019s involvement in aid in dying consists solely of making the instrument of the \u201cact\u201d available to the terminally ill patient. The patient himself then chooses whether to commit the act that will bring about his own death. The legislature codified public policy by expressly immunizing physicians who commit a direct act that gives effect to the life-ending wishes of a terminally ill patient. Section 50-9-204, MCA. There is no suggestion in the Act that a lesser physician involvement (making available a lethal does of medicine)-which is then vetted by a terminally ill patient\u2019s intervening choice and subsequent self-administered ingestion-is against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b633  The Terminally 111 Act explicitly shields physicians from criminal, civil or professional liability for the act of withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment from a terminally ill patient who requests it. Section 50-9-204, MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The legislature devoted an entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>section to codifying this immunity, ensuring that physicians and nurses will not be held liable for acting consistent with a terminally ill patient\u2019s decision to die. Section 50-9-204, MCA, provides an extensive list of medical professionals and others exempt from prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">(a) a physician or advanced practice registered nurse who <em>causes </em>the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a qualified patient; (b) a person who participates in the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment under the direction or with the authorization of the physician or advanced practice registered nurse; (c) emergency medical services personnel who <em>cause or participate </em>in the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment under the direction of or with the authorization of a physician or advanced practice registered nurse or who on receipt of reliable documentation follow a living will protocol....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Section 50-9-204, MCA (emphasis added). The section also immunizes health care facilities, health care providers, and the patient\u2019s designee. Section 50-9-204(e), MCA. The Terminally 111 Act\u2019s second enactment expands this immunity to include emergency medical service personnel. Section 50-9-204(c), MCA. The statute explicitly states that the above individuals are \u201cnot subject to civil or criminal liability or guilty of unprofessional conduct.\u201d Section 50-9-204(1), MCA. This encompassing immunity for medical professionals reinforces the terminally ill patient\u2019s right to enforce his decision without fear that those who give effect to his wishes will be prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b634 Further, the legislature criminalized the failure to follow a patient\u2019s end-of-life instructions. A physician \u201cwho willfully fails to record the determination of terminal condition or the terms of a declaration\u201d is punishable by a maximum $500 fine, a maximum one year in jail, or both. Section 50-9-206(2), MCA. A person who \u201cpurposely conceals, cancels, defaces, or obliterates the declaration of another without the declarant\u2019s consent\u201d is punishable by the same. Section 50-9-206(3), MCA. The statute\u2019s message is clear: failure to give effect to a terminally ill patient\u2019s life-ending declaration is a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b635 Other parts of the Terminally 111 Act similarly reflect legislative respect for the patient\u2019s end-of-life autonomy and the physician\u2019s legal obligation to comply with the patient\u2019s declaration. Section 50-9-205, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>MCA, prohibits, <em>for any purpose, </em>treating the death as either \u201csuicide or homicide.\u201d The legislature, by prohibiting anyone from deeming the act a homicide or suicide, ensured that insurance companies cannot punish a terminally ill patient and his family for the patient\u2019s choice to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b636 The provision also lists behaviors not supported by the statute. Notably, physician aid in dying is not listed. Section 50-9-205(7), MCA, reads: \u201cThis chapter does not condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia.\u201d Physician aid in dying is, by definition, neither of these. Euthanasia is the \u201cintentional putting to death of a person with an incurable or painful disease intended as an act of mercy.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>678 (28th ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins 2006). The phrase \u201cmercy killing\u201d is the active term for euthanasia defined as \u201ca mode of ending life in which the intent is to cause the patient\u2019s death in a single act.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>at 678. Neither of these definitions is consent-based, and neither involves a patient\u2019s autonomous decision to self-administer drugs that will cause his own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b637 The final part of the Terminally 111 Act orders the Montana Attorney General to \u201cestablish and maintain a health care declaration registry\u201d in which declarations are stored and updated. Section 50-9-501, MCA. The provision also creates a health care declaration account in the state special revenue fund, which the Attorney General must use to \u201ccreate and maintain the health care declaration registry\u201d and to create an education and outreach program. Section 50-9-502(b), MCA. The program must pertain to \u201cadvance health care planning and end-of-life health care decisionmaking.\u201d Section 50-9-505( 1), MCA. The program must also \u201cexplain the need for readily available legal documents that express an individual\u2019s health care wishes.\u201d Section 50-9-505(c), MCA. The registry requirement, outreach and education provisions, and state funding for both, indicate legislative intent to honor and promulgate the rights of terminally ill patients to autonomously choose the direction of their end-of-life medical care. There is no indication in the statutes that another choice-physician aid in dying-is against this legislative ethos of honoring the end-of-life decisions of the terminally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b638 There is no indication in the Rights of the Terminally 111 Act that physician aid in dying is against public policy. Indeed, the Act reflects legislative respect for the wishes of a patient facing incurable illness. The Act also indicates legislative regard and protection for a physician who honors his legal obligation to the patient. The Act immunizes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>physician for following the patient\u2019s declaration even if it requires the physician to directly unplug the patient\u2019s ventilator or withhold medicine or medical treatment that is keeping the patient alive. Physician aid in dying, on the other hand, does not require such <em>direct </em>involvement by a physician. Rather, in physician aid in dying, the final death-causing act lies in the patient\u2019s hands. In light of the longstanding, evolving and unequivocal recognition of the terminally ill patient\u2019s right to self-determination at the end of life in Title 50, chapter 9, MCA, it would be incongruous to conclude that a physician\u2019s indirect aid in dying is contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b639 There are three central problems with the Dissent\u2019s response. First, the Dissent applies \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA-a statute that factually does not apply to Mr. Baxter\u2019s appeal. This statute only applies if the suicide does not occur. Second, the Dissent massages the statute\u2019s legislative history into makeshift legislation, which it then proffers as public policy. Such analysis directly violates this Court\u2019s precedent regarding statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b640 The Dissent first cites \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA, stating that a person may be prosecuted for aiding or soliciting suicide only if the individual <em>does not die. </em>Dissent, \u00b6 101. The statute\u2019s plain meaning is clear. It is also inapplicable. The narrow scenario we have been asked to consider on appeal involves the situation in which a terminally ill patient affirmatively seeks a lethal dose of medicine and subsequently self-administers it, causing his own death. Section 45-5-105, MCA, unambiguously applies <em>only </em>when the suicide <em>does not </em>occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b641 Under this Court\u2019s precedent, the inquiry stops there. We have repeatedly held that we will not interpret a statute beyond its plain language if the language is clear and unambiguous. <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. </em>State, 2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 4, 185 P.3d 1003, 1006; <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 178, 181, 152 P.3d 1288, 1290 (\u201cWe interpret a statute first by looking to the statute\u2019s plain language, and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.\u201d). Here, the legislature could not have provided clearer, more unambiguous language. If the person does not die, the statute is triggered. If they do die, the statute is not triggered. The statute provides only <em>one </em>clear set of circumstances where a person may be prosecuted. There is simply nothing ambiguous about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b642 While conceding on the one hand that \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA, applies only when the suicide <em>does not </em>occur, the Dissent nonetheless unilaterally revises the statute, stating that \u201cunder Montana law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>physicians who assist in a suicide are subject to criminal prosecution irrespective of whether the patient <em>survives </em>or <em>dies.\u201d </em>Dissent, \u00b6 102. This is incorrect under the law. Not only does the language of the statute clearly and <em>only </em>address the scenario in which the \u201csuicide <em>does not </em>occur\u201d but the Commission comments themselves do not even provide enlightenment on the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the language of the aid or soliciting suicide statute itself. Instead, the Commission comments speak of a different statute (and crime) altogether: Homicide. In fact, the comments analyze language, such as \u201cagent of death,\u201d that does not even appear in the aid or soliciting statute or anywhere else in the Montana code. The Dissent not only disregards this Court\u2019s precedent regarding statutory interpretation, but it also grants the uncodified comments of eleven unelected individuals the weight of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b643 The Dissent argues that consent to physician aid in dying is against public policy simply because the conduct is defined as an offense under the criminal statutes. That reasoning is circular. The Dissent cannot obviate a separate consent statute by simply saying that all statutory crimes are by definition against public policy, therefore consent to that conduct is <em>also </em>against public policy. If that were the case, the legislature would not have felt compelled to enact a separate consent statute. By enacting this separate consent statute, the legislature obviously envisioned situations in which it is not against public policy for a victim to consent to conduct that would otherwise constitute an offense under the criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b644 Even if this Court were to extend consideration to \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA, as a generalized reflection of the legislature\u2019s views on third party involvement in suicides, there remains no indication that the statute was ever intended to apply to the very narrow set of circumstances in which a terminally ill patient <em>himself </em>seeks out a physician and asks the physician to provide him the means to end his own life. As the Dissent states, the original enactment addressed situations of a third party \u201cencouraging\u201d a suicide. Dissent, \u00b6 99. The present version reflects the same focus in the \u201csoliciting\u201d language. The statute\u2019s plain language addresses the situation in which a third party unilaterally solicits or aids another person. In physician aid in dying, the solicitation comes from the patient himself, <em>not </em>a third party physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b645 There is no indication that the 1973 Montana legislators contemplated the statute would apply to this specific situation in which a terminally ill patient seeks a means by which he can end his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>own incurable suffering. In fact, it was not until twelve years later in 1985, that the legislature enacted the Rights of the Terminally 111 Act, which squarely addresses the modern complexities of physician- and technology-dependent end-of-life care provided to terminally ill Montanans. Since then, the legislature-as illustrated in the Terminally 111 Act analysis above-has carefully cultivated a statutory scheme that gives terminally ill Montanans the right to autonomously choose what happens to them at the end of painful terminal illness. \u00b646 Finally, we determine whether the District Court erred in awarding Mr. Baxter attorney fees. Following entry of the District Court\u2019s judgment on the constitutional claims, Mr. Baxter moved to amend under M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) to include an award of attorney fees as supplemental relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, and the private attorney general doctrine. The District Court awarded attorney fees to Mr. Baxter under the private attorney general doctrine. We review a grant or denial of attorney fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Trs. of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 15, 315 Mont. 210, 216, 69 P.3d 663, 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b647  The private attorney general doctrine applies when the government fails to properly enforce interests which are significant to its citizens. <em>Montanans for the Responsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Commissioners, </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 64, 296 Mont. 402, 421, 989 P.2d 800, 811. The private attorney general doctrine, however, applies only when constitutional interests are vindicated. <em>Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y v. State, </em>2004 MT 376, \u00b6 21, 325 Mont. 70, 78, 103 P.3d 1085, 1091. Our holding today is statute-based. Therefore, without the vindication of constitutional interests, an award of fees under the private attorney general doctrine is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b648 Although attorney fees may be appropriate \u201cfurther relief\u2019 under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, \u201csuch fees are only appropriate if equitable considerations support the award.\u201d <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 38, 352 Mont. 105, 118, 214 P.3d 1260, 1271. As in <em>United National, </em>the equitable considerations here do not support an award of attorney fees. Mr. Baxter is accompanied by other plaintiffs, including four physicians and Compassion &amp; Choices, a national nonprofit organization. The relief herein granted to the Plaintiffs is not incomplete or inequitable without the Montana taxpayers having to pay the attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b649  In conclusion, we find nothing in Montana Supreme Court precedent or Montana statutes indicating that physician aid in dying is against public policy. The \u201cagainst public policy\u201d exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>consent has been interpreted by this Court as applicable to violent breaches of the public peace. Physician aid in dying does not satisfy that definition. We also find nothing in the plain language of Montana statutes indicating that physician aid in dying is against public policy. In physician aid in dying, the patient-not the physician-commits the final death-causing act by self-administering a lethal dose of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">\u00b650  Furthermore, the Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act indicates legislative respect for a patient\u2019s autonomous right to decide if and how he will receive medical treatment at the end of his life. The Terminally 111 Act explicitly shields physicians from liability for acting in accordance with a patient\u2019s end-of-life wishes, even if the physician must actively pull the plug on a patient\u2019s ventilator or withhold treatment that will keep him alive. There is no statutory indication that lesser end-of-life physician involvement, in which the patient himself commits the final act, is against public policy. We therefore hold that under \u00a7 45-2-211, MCA, a terminally ill patient\u2019s consent to physician aid in dying constitutes a statutory defense to a charge of homicide against the aiding physician when no other consent exceptions apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b651 The District Court\u2019s ruling on the constitutional issues is vacated, although the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Plaintiffs/Appellees is affirmed on the alternate statutory grounds set forth above. The award of attorney fees is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> The Dissent has erred in its statement that the operative words in the Terminally 111 Act are those \u201cpermitting a patient\u201d to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment. Dissent, \u00b6 107. The Rights of the Terminally 111 Act was created to address the situation in which patients <em>cannot </em>act on their own behalf and therefore must authorize others to act for them. The only individuals who <em>act </em>in this statute are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>non-patients-particularly, medical professionals-who follow the directions of a terminally ill patient and affirmatively withdraw or withhold treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b275-6\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"A5j\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b652 I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u00b653 The Court\u2019s opinion today answers the statutory question: is it, as a matter of law, against the public policy of Montana for a physician to assist a mentally competent, terminally ill person to end their life? The answer provided is: \u201cNo, it is not, as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\u00b654 This Court correctly avoided the constitutional issue Baxter desires to present. No question brought before this Court is of greater delicacy than one that involves the power of the legislature to act. If it becomes indispensably necessary to the case to answer such a question, this Court must meet and decide it; but it is not the habit of the courts to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case. <em>See e.g. Ex parte Randolph, </em>20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (C.C.Va. 1833) (Marshall, Circuit Justice); <em>Burton v. United States, </em>196 U.S. 283, 295, 25 S. Ct. 243, 245 (1905); <em>State v.

I join the opinion, and not the thoughtful and thought provoking dissent, because the Legislature has not plainly stated that assisting a suicide is against public policy. This Court must not add such a provision by judicial fiat. Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b656 The logic of the Court\u2019s opinion is not necessarily limited to physicians. In my view, the citizens of Montana have the right to have their legislature step up to the plate and squarely face the question presented by this case, do their job, and decide just what is the policy of Montana on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b657 As for the constitutional analysis requested by Baxter, I have found many times in my judicial career that Viscount Falkland is correct: when it is not necessary to make a decision, it is necessary to not make a decision.

For the reasons which follow, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis under the consent statute (\u00a7 45-2-211, MCA), and I further conclude that physician aid in dying is protected by the Montana Constitution as a matter of privacy (Article II, Section 10) and as a matter of individual dignity (Article II, Section 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">I. STATUTORY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b660 The Court and the Dissent offer two conflicting analyses of \u201cpublic policy\u201d under the consent statute. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14-45; Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 99-110. In my view, the Court has the better argument. As the Court points out, the consent statute plainly contemplates that it is not against public policy in certain situations for a victim to consent to conduct that otherwise would constitute an offense under the criminal statutes. Opinion, \u00b6 43. I agree with the Court that there is no indication in Montana caselaw or statutory law that physician aid in dying is against public policy. In this regard, the Dissent is incorrect in stating that <em>the Legislature </em>eliminated the consent defense for aiding suicide under \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA. Dissent, \u00b6 105. The Dissent points to nothing in the plain language of the consent statute standing for this proposition. Rather, the Dissent relies on the uncodified 1973 Criminal Law Commission Comments to \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA. <em>See </em>Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 101-103,105. Of course, these Commission Comments do not carry the weight of law. Opinion, \u00b6 42. Moreover, I do not find the presumed statements of public policy reflected in these 1973 Commission Comments to be of any persuasive value here. The Legislature has since codified a different public policy in the 1985 Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act-specifically, that a mentally competent, incurably ill individual should have autonomy with regard to end-of-life decisions and should be afforded respect and assurance that her life-ending wishes will be honored, even if enforcement of the patient\u2019s instructions involves a direct act by the physician (such as withdrawing life-sustaining medical treatment) which in turn causes the patient\u2019s death. <em>See generally </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 27-38; Title 50, chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>9, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b661 Our decision today, therefore, provides a mentally competent, incurably ill individual with at least one avenue to end her mental and physical suffering with a physician\u2019s assistance. Under the consent statute, it is not against public policy for the physician to provide the individual with the prescription for a life-ending substance to be self-administered by the individual at her choice of time and place. As an obvious corollary to this, the individual retains the right to change her mind as her condition progresses for better or worse-i.e., the patient retains the absolute right to make the ultimate decision of whether to take the life-ending substance. As such, in physician aid in dying the physician simply makes medication available to the patient who requests it and the patient ultimately chooses whether to cause her own death by self-administering the medicine-an act which itself is not criminal. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b662 I accordingly agree with the Court\u2019s analysis and conclusion that the patient\u2019s consent to physician aid in dying constitutes a statutory defense to a charge of deliberate homicide against the aiding physician under \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, where the patient takes the life-ending substance and ends her life. Opinion, \u00b6 50. This same conclusion, of course, applies to a charge of aiding suicide under \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA, where the patient does not take the substance. In either event, the physician is not culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b663 For these reasons, I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion-except, as noted, the decision to vacate the District Court\u2019s ruling on the constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">II. CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b664 Although the Court has chosen to decide this case on the narrow statutory ground suggested by the State of Montana (as an alternative approach) in its briefs on appeal, Opinion, \u00b6 10, and although physician aid in dying is protected statutorily (as the Court holds under this alternative approach), physician aid in dying is also firmly protected by Montana\u2019s Constitution. In this regard, I compliment District Court Judge Dorothy McCarter for her well-written, compassionate, and courageous-indeed, visionary-interpretation of our Constitution. The parties have extensively briefed the constitutional issues, <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 10, and the Dissent touches on them as well, <em>see </em>Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 112-116. For these reasons, and because I so passionately believe that individual dignity is, in all likelihood, the most important-and yet, in our times, the most fragile-of all human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>rights protected by Montana\u2019s Constitution, I proceed to explain what I believe the right of dignity means within the context of this case-one of the most important cases the courts of this state have ever considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b665 The District Court\u2019s decision is grounded in both the right of individual dignity guaranteed by Article II, Section 4 and the right of individual privacy guaranteed by Article II, Section 10. Likewise, the Plaintiff-Appellee patients (Patients) and their amici present arguments under both provisions. With regard to Article II, Section 10, they persuasively demonstrate that under <em>Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997), and <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>1999 MT 261, 296 Mont. 361, 989 P.2d 364, physician aid in dying is protected by the right of individual privacy. Indeed, this Court held in <em>Armstrong </em>that \u201cthe personal autonomy component of this right broadly guarantees each individual the right to make medical judgments affecting her or his bodily integrity and health in partnership with a chosen health care provider free from the interference of the government ....\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 75. As noted, however, I believe that this case-aid in dying so as to die with dignity-is most fundamentally and quintessentially a matter of human dignity. Accordingly, it is to that right that I direct my comments below. But before doing so, it is necessary to define and explain my choice of terms and language.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">A. Terminology and Language</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b666 First, let me be clear about one thing: This case is not about the \u201cright to die.\u201d Indeed, the notion that there is such a \u201cright\u201d is patently absurd, if not downright silly. No constitution, no statute, no legislature, and no court can grant an individual the \u201cright to die.\u201d Nor can they take such a right away. \u201cDeath is the destiny of everything that lives. Nothing ever escapes it.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Within the context of this case, the only control that a person has over death is that if he expects its coming within a relatively short period of time due to an incurable disease, he can simply accept his fate and seek drug-induced comfort; or he can seek further treatment and fight to prolong death\u2019s advance; or, at some point in his illness, and with his physician\u2019s assistance, he can embrace his destiny at a time and place of his choosing. The only \u201cright\u201d guaranteed to him in any of these decisions is the right to preserve his personal autonomy and his individual dignity, as he sees fit, in the face of an ultimate destiny that no power on earth can prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u00b667 Thus noted, the Patients and the class of individuals they represent are persons who suffer from an illness or disease, who cannot be cured of their illness or disease by any reasonably available medical treatment, who therefore expect death within a relatively short period of time, and who demand the right to preserve their personal autonomy and their individual dignity in facing this destiny.</p>\n<p id=\"AJC\">\u00b668 In choosing this language, I purposely eschew bright-line tests or rigid timeframes. What is \u201crelatively short\u201d varies from person to person. I take this approach<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the following nonexclusive reasons. First, the amount of physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental suffering that one is willing or able to endure is uniquely and solely a matter of individual constitution, conscience, and personal autonomy. Second, \u201csuffering\u201d in this more expansive sense may implicate a person\u2019s uniquely personal perception of his \u201cquality of life.\u201d This perception may be informed by, among other things, one\u2019s level of suffering, one\u2019s loss of personal autonomy, one\u2019s ability to make choices about his situation, one\u2019s ability to communicate, one\u2019s perceived loss of value to self or to others, one\u2019s ability to care for his personal needs and hygiene, one\u2019s loss of dignity, one\u2019s financial situation and concern over the economic burdens of prolonged illness, and one\u2019s level of tolerance for the invasion of personal privacy and individual dignity that palliative treatment necessarily involves. Suffering may diminish the quality of life; on the other hand, the lack of suffering does not guarantee a life of quality. There is a difference between living and suffering; and the sufferer is uniquely positioned and, therefore, uniquely entitled to define the tipping point that makes suffering unbearable. Third, while most incurable illnesses and diseases follow a fairly predictable symptomatology and course, every illness and disease is a unique and very personal experience for the afflicted person. Thus, the afflicted individual\u2019s illness or disease informs his end-of-life choices and decisions in ways unique and personal to that individual\u2019s life, values, and circumstances. Fourth, advancements in medical treatment may become available during the period between the time when he is diagnosed as being incurably ill and the predicted (estimated) time of death. With those advancements, a person initially given three months to live may well expect to live two more months or two more years with a new medicine or treatment. Fifth, individual access to medical care may vary. A person living in proximity to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>medical research facility may have access to medicines and treatments as part of a clinical trial, while another person living in a sparsely populated rural area may not have that opportunity. One individual may have access to hospice care; another may not. Sadly, an insured individual may have access to medicine and treatment that an uninsured individual does not. Sixth, each individual\u2019s family situation is different. One individual may not have close family relationships; another may have a strongly involved and supportive family. One person\u2019s family may live within a short distance, while another person\u2019s family may be spread across the country or around the globe. The ability to say final goodbyes and the ability to die, at a predetermined time and place, perhaps in the company of one\u2019s partner or friends and loved ones, is important to many individuals and to their families. Seventh, and lastly, to many who are incurably ill and dying, the prospect of putting their partner or family through their prolonged and agonizing death is a source of deep emotional and spiritual distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b669 Additionally, in my choice of language, I have intentionally chosen not to use emotionally charged and value-laden terms such as \u201cterminal\u201d and \u201csuicide.\u201d \u201cTerminal\u201d conjures up the notion that the individual is on some sort of inevitable slide or countdown to death. This term trivializes the fact that many individuals, with what appear to be medically incurable diseases, nevertheless retain steadfast hope and faith that their condition will be reversed, along with a personal resolve to fight for life until the very end. Labeling an individual as \u201cterminal\u201d may not only discourage the individual from seeking treatment but may also discourage further treatment efforts by healthcare providers. A \u201cterminal\u201d diagnosis fails to acknowledge that medicine usually cannot predict the time of death with the sort of exactitude that the use of the term connotes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b670 Similarly, the term \u201csuicide\u201d suggests an act of self-destruction that historically has been condemned as sinful, immoral, or damning by many religions. Moreover, in modern parlance, \u201csuicide\u201d may be linked with terrorist conduct. Importantly, and as reflected in the briefing in this case, society judges and typically, but selectively, deprecates individuals who commit \u201csuicide.\u201d On one hand, the individual who throws his body over a hand grenade to save his fellow soldiers is judged a hero, not a person who committed \u201csuicide.\u201d Yet, on the other hand, the individual who shoots herself because she faces a protracted illness and agonizing death commits \u201csuicide\u201d and, as such, is judged a coward in the face of her illness and selfish in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>lack of consideration for the pain and loss her act causes to loved ones and friends. Assisting this person to end her life is likewise denounced as typifying \u201c \u2018a very low regard for human life.\u2019 \u201d Dissent, \u00b6 118 (quoting the Commission Comments to \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA). To the contrary, however, the Patients and their amici argue that a physician who provides aid in dying demonstrates compassionate regard for the patient\u2019s suffering, recognition of the patient\u2019s autonomy and dignity, and acknowledgement of death\u2019s inevitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b671 \u201cSuicide\u201d is a pejorative term in our society. Unfortunately, it is also a term used liberally by the State and its amici (as well as the Dissent) in this case. The term denigrates the complex individual circumstances that drive persons generally-and, in particular, those who are incurably ill and face prolonged illness and agonizing death-to take their own lives. The term is used to generate antipathy, and it does. The Patients and the class of people they represent do not seek to commit \u201csuicide.\u201d Rather, they acknowledge that death within a relatively short time is inescapable because of their illness or disease. And with that fact in mind, they seek the ability to self-administer, at a time and place of their choosing, a physician-prescribed medication that will assist them in preserving their own human dignity during the inevitable process of dying. Having come to grips with the inexorability of their death, they simply ask the government not to force them to suffer and die in an agonizing, degrading, humiliating, and undignified manner. They seek nothing more nor less; that is all this case is about.</p>\n<p id=\"AuY\">\u00b672 Finally, I neither use the terms nor address \u201ceuthanasia\u201d or \u201cmercy killing.\u201d Aside from the negative implications of these terms and the criminality of such conduct, the Patients clearly do not argue that incompetent, nonconsenting individuals or \u201cvulnerable\u201d people may be, under any circumstances, \u201ceuthanized\u201d or \u201cmurdered.\u201d To read their arguments as suggesting either is, in my view, grossly unfair and intellectually dishonest. The only reason that \u201chomicide\u201d is implicated at all in this case is because (a) the State contends that a licensed physician who provides a mentally competent, incurably ill patient with the prescription for a life-ending substance, to be self-administered by the patient if she so chooses, is guilty of deliberate homicide and (b) our decision holds that it is not against public policy under the consent statute to permit the physician to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b673 With that prefatory explanation, I now turn to Article II, Section 4 and the right of individual dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">B. Construction of Article II, Section 4</p>\n<p id=\"ABQ\">\u00b674 Article II, Section 4 of Montana\u2019s 1972 Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Individual dignity. The dignity of the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. Neither the state nor any person, firm, corporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on account of race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">While there are differing interpretations of this language, which I note below, it is my view that the first clause of Article II, Section 4 (the Dignity Clause) is a stand-alone, fundamental constitutional right. <em>See Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, \u00b6\u00b6 74, 82, 316 Mont. 103, 68 P.3d 872 (explaining that the rights found in Article II are \u201cfundamental\u201d and that the plain meaning of the Dignity Clause \u201ccommands that the intrinsic worth and the basic humanity of persons may not be violated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b675 First, I categorically reject the notion that the Dignity Clause is merely some \u201caspirational introduction\u201d to the equal protection and nondiscrimination rights which follow it-a proposition for which there is no authority. Our Constitution is \u201ca limitation upon the powers of government,\u201d <em>Cruse v. Fischl, </em>55 Mont. 258, 263, 175 P. 878, 880 (1918), and in construing a constitutional provision, we are required \u201cto give meaning to every word, phrase, clause and sentence therein, if it is possible so to do,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Diederichs v. State Highway Commn., </em>89 Mont. 205, 211, 296 P. 1033, 1035 (1931). Accordingly, the command that \u201c[t]he dignity of the human being is inviolable\u201d must be acknowledged as the freestanding limitation it is on the power of the government-much in the same way we recognize that trial by jury, which is similarly \u201cinviolate\u201d (Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 26), is not merely \u201caspirational\u201d but is in fact a concrete right guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b676 Second, I likewise reject the notion that the right of dignity is fully implemented by the Equal Protection and Nondiscrimination Clauses or that these clauses are the sole \u201coperative vehicles\u201d for achieving dignity. In other words, I cannot agree that the inviolable dignity of a human being is infringed only when the person is denied equal protection of the laws or suffers discrimination for exercising his or her civil or political rights. Indeed, such an interpretation of Article II, Section 4 attributes an implausibly narrow meaning to the term \u201cdignity.\u201d As the Dissent notes, the Dignity Clause can be traced to West Germany\u2019s 1949 Constitution, which was developed in response to the Nazi regime\u2019s treatment of the Jewish people (as well as homosexuals, Gypsies, persons with disabilities, and political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>opponents). Dissent, \u00b6 116 n. 4. These \u201cinferior\u201d people (so-called \u201cuseless eaters\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) were not merely denied equal protection of the laws. The government placed them in concentration camps and used them for slave labor. Medical experiments were performed on them. They were persecuted and killed. They were viewed and treated as subhuman, without any dignity. The West German Constitution and its command that \u201c[t]he dignity of man shall be inviolable\u201d must be understood in this context. Doing so, it simply cannot be maintained that Article II, Section 4 prohibits only discrimination and the denial of equal protection. The Dignity Clause broadly prohibits any law or act that infringes upon our inviolable dignity as human beings. This is not some \u201cvague, lurking\u201d right as the Dissent suggests. Dissent, \u00b6 116. Rather, it is an imperative; an affirmative and unambiguous constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b677 This interpretation is supported by the structure of Article II, Section 4. In this connection, I agree with the construction proffered by Matthew O. Clifford and Thomas P. Huff in their article <em>Some Thoughts on the Meaning and Scope of the Montana Constitution\u2019s \u2018Dignity\u201d Clause with Possible Applications </em>, 61 Mont. L. Rev. 301, 305-07 (2000). They point out that the language of Article II, Section 4 (which is titled \u201cIndividual Dignity\u201d) moves in a logical progression from the general to the specific. The first sentence (the Dignity Clause) declares that human dignity is inviolable. The second sentence (the Equal Protection Clause) goes on to declare one way in which human dignity can be violated: by denying someone the equal protection of the laws based on some sort of arbitrary classification. They observe that our legal tradition has long recognized such classifications as affronts to the dignity of persons (citing as an example of this <em>Brown v. Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954)). Finally, the third sentence (the Nondiscrimination Clause) fleshes out the meaning of the equal protection right by enumerating certain types of classifications which the framers of Article II, Section 4 believed to be arbitrary: race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, and political or religious ideas.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b678 Clifford and Huff note that the classifications identified in the Nondiscrimination Clause cannot be read as an exhaustive list of all possible arbitrary classifications. Otherwise, if the list were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>exhaustive, the Equal Protection Clause would be surplusage. The more reasonable interpretation, they conclude, is that by including the separate and more general Equal Protection Clause, the framers intended to leave open the possibility that there are other prohibited classifications beyond those which were recognized at that point in history (i.e., in 1972). And by the same logic, the inclusion of a more general prohibition against the violation of human dignity leaves open the possibility that human dignity can be violated in ways that do not involve some sort of arbitrary classification. Indeed, they argue, and I agree, that in order to give distinct and independent meaning to the Dignity Clause, avoiding redundancy, \u201cthis clause should be applied separately when there is a violation of the dignity of persons that does not reflect the forms of unequal treatment or invidious discrimination prohibited by the two subsequent clauses. Presumably anyone could experience such a violation of dignity, not just persons who are members of protected classes.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clifford and Huff, 61 Mont. L. Rev. at 306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b679 This interpretation is consistent with the debate on Article II, Section 4 at the 1971-1972 Constitutional Convention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the debate, Delegate Jerome T. Loendorf inquired whether the express prohibition against discrimination was necessary, given that the right of equal protection already prohibits discrimination. Delegate Wade J. Dahood (chair of the Bill of Rights Committee) acknowledged that the Nondiscrimination Clause was \u201csubsumed in\u201d the Equal Protection Clause, but he explained that \u201cwhen we\u2019re dealing with this type of right, Delegate Loendorf, and we are dealing with something that is this basic, to an orderly and progressive society perhaps sometimes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>sermon that can be given by constitution, as well as the right, becomes necessary.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Mar. 7, 1972, pp. 1643-44. Thus, the delegates decided that it was preferable to include the additional language making certain facets of the equal protection right explicit. This same principle supports the notion that denying someone the equal protection of the laws is but <em>one </em>way in which human dignity can be violated, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b680 In arguing against this interpretation of Article II, Section 4, the Dissent points to Delegate Dahood\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]here is no intent within this particular section to do anything other than to remove the apparent type of discrimination that all of us object to with respect to employment, to rental practices, to actual associationship in matters that are public or matters that tend to be somewhat quasi-public.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Mar. 7,1972, p. 1643. This statement, however, must be understood in context. Dahood was not purporting to limit the scope of Article II, Section 4. In fact, he was trying to keep the provision broad. Delegate Otto T. Habedank had voiced a concern that the language \u201cany person, firm, corporation, or institution\u201d in the Nondiscrimination Clause would prohibit private organizations from limiting their membership and would force individuals to associate with people they otherwise would choose not to associate with. <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Mar. 7, 1972, p. 1643. Habedank therefore had moved to delete the \u201cany person, firm, corporation, or institution\u201d language from the Nondiscrimination Clause, thereby rendering the clause applicable to only the state. <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Mar. 7,1972, p. 1642. Dahood, in turn, argued against this amendment (which ultimately was defeated 76 to 13) and in favor of applying the nondiscrimination prohibition to entities other than the state, such as employers, landlords, and public or quasi-public associations. Dahood made no remarks about the Dignity Clause itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b681 In contrast, Delegate Proposal No. 33 specifically recognized an independent right of individual dignity. It stated: \u201cThe rights of individual dignity, privacy, and free expression being essential to the well-being of a free society, the state shall not infringe upon these rights without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Delegate Proposals, Jan. 26, 1972, p. 127. This proposal was referred to the Bill of Rights Committee, which adopted the proposal <em>in its entirety. See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, Feb. 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>1972, p. 647. The right of individual dignity, the right of privacy, and the right of free expression were then incorporated, respectively, into Sections 4, 10, and 7 of Article II.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b682 In sum, given the plain language of Article II, Section 4 and the structure of this provision, I conclude that the Dignity Clause-stating that the dignity of the human being is inviolable-is a stand-alone, fundamental constitutional right. This conclusion is supported by the record from the Constitutional Convention. I now turn to the substance of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">C. The Right of Human Dignity</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b683 Human dignity is, perhaps, the most fundamental right in the Declaration of Rights. This right is \u201cinviolable,\u201d meaning that it is \u201c[s]afe from violation; <em>incapable </em>of being violated.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>904 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009) (emphasis added). Significantly, the right of human dignity is the only right in Montana\u2019s Constitution that is \u201cinviolable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is the only right in Article II carrying the <em>absolute prohibition </em>of \u201cinviolability.\u201d No individual may be stripped of her human dignity under the plain language of the Dignity Clause. No private or governmental entity has the right or the power to do so. Human dignity simply cannot be violated-no exceptions. <em>Snetsinger v. Montana University System, </em>2004 MT 390, \u00b6 77, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445 (Nelson, J., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b684 But what exactly is \u201cdignity\u201d? It would be impractical here to attempt to provide an exhaustive definition. Rather, the meaning of this term must be fleshed out on a case-by-case basis (in the same way that the parameters of substantive due process have been determined on a case-by-case basis). I note, however, a couple of interpretations that are useful for purposes of the present discussion. Law professor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Raphael Cohen-Almagor states that the concept of dignity \u201crefers to a worth or value that flows from an inner source. It is not bestowed from the outside but rather is intrinsic to the person.\u201d Raphael Cohen Almagor, <em>The Right to Die with Dignity, </em>17 (Rutgers University Press 2001). He argues that \u201c[t]o have dignity, means to look at oneself with self-respect, with some sort of satisfaction. We feel human, not degraded.\u201d Cohen-Almagor, <em>The Right to Die with Dignity </em>at 17. Similarly, Clifford and Huff explain that in our Western ethical tradition, especially after the Religious Reformation of the 16th and 17th centuries, dignity has typically been associated with the normative ideal of individual persons as intrinsically valuable, as having inherent worth as individuals, at least in part because of their capacity for independent, autonomous, rational, and responsible action. Clifford and Huff, 61 Mont. L. Rev. at 307. Under this conception, dignity is <em>directly </em>violated by degrading or demeaning a person. Clifford and Huff, 61 Mont. L. Rev. at 307; <em>see also e.g. Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, \u00b6\u00b6 81-84, 316 Mont. 103, 68 P.3d 872 (recognizing this principle and holding that the correctional practices and living conditions to which Walker was subjected at the Montana State Prison violated his right of human dignity). Or dignity is <em>indirectly </em>violated by denying a person the opportunity to direct or control his own life in such a way that his worth is questioned or dishonored. For example, dignity could be indirectly undermined \u201cby treatment which is paternalistic-treating adults like children incapable of making autonomous choices for themselves, or by trivializing what choices they do make about how to live their lives.\u201d Clifford and Huff, 61 Mont. L. Rev. at 307-08; <em>cf. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 289, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 2857 (1990) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (requiring a competent adult to endure the procedures of being fed artificially by means of a tube against her will \u201cburdens the patient\u2019s liberty, dignity, and freedom to determine the course of her own treatment\u201d). Significantly, this Court has held that \u201c[rjespect for the dignity of each individual... demands that people have for themselves the moral right and moral responsibility to confront the most fundamental questions about the meaning and value of their own lives and the intrinsic value of life in general, answering to their own consciences and convictions.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>1999 MT 261, \u00b6 72, 296 Mont. 361, 989 P.2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"AxR\">\u00b685 Clifford and Huff also point out that if the Dignity Clause is to maintain its force as a shared public ethical norm,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">the substantive meaning of the clause must not be identified with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>or justified by, any specific controversial religious or philosophical doctrines. The only reasonable political compromise we can reach in modern times (after the Reformation), when we must accept as fact that different segments of society will have deeply conflicting personal, religious, and philosophical views about how one ought to live one\u2019s life, is to agree to treat each other, and our respective values, with mutual respect and tolerance. This compromise makes possible the modern constitutional democracy, focused on securing the liberty and protecting the dignity of each person. Thus, the only conception of dignity that we can <em>all </em>share as citizens, despite our other differences, in a post-Reformation state (the conception of dignity that, for example, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention could share), must focus on honoring the worth of autonomous individuals. To remain consistent with this shared, public ideal of dignity, the right to treatment with dignity must not be defined according to some parochial, sectarian religious or some controversial, philosophical notion of human dignity-those richer conceptions of dignity about which we have agreed to disagree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Clifford and Huff, 61 Mont. L. Rev. at 326-27 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b686 Given its intrinsic nature, it is entirely proper, in my view, that the right of dignity under Article II, Section 4 is absolute. Indeed, human dignity transcends the Constitution and the law. Dignity is a fundamental component of humanness. It is inherent in human self-consciousness. Dignity belongs, intrinsically, to our species-to each of us-as a natural right from birth to death. It permeates each person regardless of who that person is or what he does. It cannot be abrogated because of one\u2019s status or condition. While the government may impinge on privacy rights, liberty interests, and other Article II rights in proper circumstances (e.g., when one becomes a prisoner), the individual always retains his right of human dignity. So too with persons suffering from mental illness or disability and involuntary commitment: Each retains the right to demand of the State that his dignity as a human being be respected despite the government\u2019s sometimes necessary interference in his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b687 I am convinced that each of us recognizes this intrinsic, elemental nature of human dignity. Indeed, that recognition explains why we collectively recoil from the pyramid of naked enemy soldiers prodded by troops with guns and dogs at Abu Ghraib; why disgust fills most of us at the descriptions and depictions of water boarding and torture; and why we revolt from ethnic cleansing and genocide. It is why we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>should collectively rebel, as well, when we see our fellow human beings in need from lack of food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b688 Experience teaches, and we understand innately, that once we strip an individual of dignity, the human being no longer exists. A subhuman is easy to abuse, torture, and kill, because the object of the abuse is simply that-an object without worth or value and devoid of the essential element of humanness: dignity. Six million Jewish people, along with homosexuals, Gypsies, and persons with disabilities stand as mute testament to what happens when human beings are stripped of their dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b689 I believe this is why we also collectively recoil from accounts of our fellow human beings forced to endure the humiliation and degradation of an agonizing death from an incurable illness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pain may, in theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>be alleviated to the point of rendering the person unconscious. But in those circumstances, we still cannot deny that the individual\u2019s human dignity has been dealt a grievous blow long before death claims her body. Indeed, in response to the State\u2019s argument that palliative care is a reasonable alternative to physician aid in dying, Mr. Baxter explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">I am appalled by this suggestion and the loss of personal autonomy it involves. I understand that terminal or palliative sedation would involve administering intravenous medication to me for the purpose of rendering me unconscious, and then withholding fluids and nutrition until I die, a process that may take weeks. During this final period of my life I would remain unconscious, unaware of my situation or surroundings, unresponsive from a cognitive or volitional standpoint, and uninvolved in my own death. My ability to maintain personal hygiene would be lost and I would be dependent on others to clean my body. My family would be forced to stand a horrible vigil while my unconscious body was maintained in this condition, wasting away from starvation and dehydration, while they waited for me to die. I would want to do whatever I could to avoid subjecting my family to such a painful and pointless ordeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">While the option of terminal sedation might be acceptable to some individuals-and I respect the right of others to choose this course if they wish to do so-it is abhorrent to me. The notion that terminal sedation should be the only option available to me if my suffering becomes intolerable is an affront to my personal values, beliefs and integrity. I have always been an independent and proud individual, and consider this form of medical treatment to be dehumanizing and humiliating. I feel strongly that my privacy, dignity and sense of self-autonomy will be forfeit if my life has to end in a state of terminal sedation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Supp. Aff. Robert Baxter \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (Aug. 25, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b690 New of us would wish upon ourselves or upon others the prolonged dying that comes from an incurable illness. And it is for this reason that some of our fellow human beings demand-rightfully, in my view-that we respect their individual right to preserve their own human dignity at a time when they are mentally competent, incurably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ill, and faced with death from their illness within a relatively short period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b691 The State asserts that it has compelling interests in preserving life and protecting vulnerable groups from potential abuses. This broad assertion, however, is entirely inadequate to sustain the State\u2019s position in opposition to physician aid in dying. We are dealing here with persons who are mentally competent, who are incurably ill, and who expect death within a relatively short period of time. The State has failed to explain what interest the government has in forcing a competent, incurably ill person who is going through prolonged suffering and slow, excruciating physical deterioration to hang on to the last possible moment. Moreover, the State has not come close to showing that it has any interest, much less a \u201ccompelling\u201d one, in usurping a competent, incurably ill individual\u2019s autonomous decision to obtain a licensed physician\u2019s assistance in dying so that she might die with the same human dignity with which she was born. In point of fact, the State\u2019s position in this appeal is diametrically in opposition to the public policy reflected in the Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act: that a mentally competent, incurably ill individual should have autonomy with regard to end-of-life decisions and should be afforded respect and assurance that her life-ending wishes will be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"AaV\">\u00b692 Furthermore, it must be remembered that an individual\u2019s right of human dignity is inviolable; it is incapable of being violated. Thus, there is absolutely no merit to the State\u2019s suggestion that it may strip a human being of his dignity in order to satisfy an interest that the government believes is \u201ccompelling.\u201d The right of dignity is absolute, and it remains absolute even at the time of death. It may not be stripped from the individual by a well-meaning yet paternalistic government. Nor may it be stripped by third parties or institutions driven by political ideology or religious beliefs. <em>Cf. </em>Clifford and Huff, 61 Mont. L. Rev. at 330 (\u201cTo be forced into degrading or dehumanizing pain or suffering because of someone else\u2019s conception of a good or proper death exacerbates the loss of dignity....\u201d). Dignity defines what it means to be human. It defines the depth of individual autonomy throughout life and, most certainly, at death. Usurping a mentally competent, incurably ill individual\u2019s ability to make end-of-life decisions and forcing that person against his will to suffer a prolonged and excruciating deterioration is, at its core, a blatant and untenable violation of the person\u2019s fundamental right of human dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b693 In conclusion, while I join the Court\u2019s decision, I also would affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling on the constitutional issues. I agree with the Court\u2019s statutory analysis, but I also agree with Judge McCarter that physician aid is dying is firmly protected by Article II, Sections 4 and 10 of the Montana Constitution. Under these sections, individuals who are mentally competent and incurably ill and face death within a relatively short period of time have the right to self-administer, at a time and place of their choosing, a life-ending substance prescribed by their physician. The physician simply makes the medication available to the patient who requests it and the patient ultimately chooses whether to cause her own death by self-administering the medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiv\">\u00b694 This right to physician aid in dying quintessentially involves the inviolable right to human dignity-our most fragile fundamental right. Montana\u2019s Dignity Clause does not permit a person or entity to force an agonizing, dehumanizing, demeaning, and often protracted death upon a mentally competent, incurably ill individual for the sake of political ideology, religious belief, or a paternalistic sense of ethics. Society does not have the right to strip a mentally competent, incurably ill individual of her inviolable human dignity when she seeks aid in dying from her physician. Dignity is a fundamental component of humanness; it is intrinsic to our species; it must be respected throughout life; and it must be honored when one\u2019s inevitable destiny is death from an incurable illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b695 I specially concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"> Aff.

Moreover, the reasons behind the committee\u2019s decision on Proposal No. 103 are not stated in the Constitutional Convention record, and this Court has already rejected a similar attempt to read more than is warranted into the disposition of this proposal (see <em>Armstrong v.

Based upon this foundation, Anglo-American law, encompassing the law of Montana, has prohibited the enabling of suicide for over 700 years. <em>Wash. v. Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 711, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 2263 (1997) (citations omitted). However, in contradiction to these fundamental principles, the Court concludes that physician-assisted suicide does not violate Montana\u2019s public policy. In doing so, the Court has badly misinterpreted our public policy: assisting suicide has been explicitly and expressly prohibited by Montana law for the past 114 years. More than merely setting aside the District Court\u2019s order herein, I would reverse the judgment entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b697 A flaw that underlies the Court\u2019s analysis is its failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>distinguish between the physician\u2019s basic intention in the assisted-suicide case from the physician\u2019s intention while rendering treatment in other cases. As developed further herein, the intentions in these two cases are diametrically opposed, and create the very difference between a criminal and noncriminal act. Physician-assisted suicide occurs when a physician provides a lethal drug with the <em>intent </em>to cause, when the drug is taken by the patient, the patient\u2019s death. With palliative care, the physician does not <em>intend </em>his or her actions to cause the patient\u2019s death, but rather intends to relieve the patient\u2019s pain and suffering. For this reason a physician providing palliative care, even in cases where the treatment arguably contributes to the patient\u2019s death, lacks the requisite mental state to be charged under homicide statutes. <em>Kan. v. Naramore, </em>965 P.2d 211, 214 (Kan. App. 1998) (quoting Gordon &amp; Singer, <em>Decisions and Care at the End of Life, </em>346 Lancet 163, 165 (July 15,1995)); <em>see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102, -103, -104, MCA (2007). A similar distinction arises in the withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment that merely prolongs the dying process, pursuant to the Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act. Under the Act, a patient may refuse treatment and allow death to occur naturally, and physicians incur no liability, having not administered any death-causing treatment. Sections 50-9-103, -204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b698 Criminal acts may be defended on the basis of a victim\u2019s consent to the act in certain circumstances. Section 45-2-211(1), MCA. However, this statute makes consent \u201cineffective\u201d if \u201cit is against public policy to permit the conduct or the resulting harm.\u201d Section 45-2-211(2), MCA. The Court concludes from its review of Montana law that \u201cit would be incongruous to conclude that a physician\u2019s indirect aid in dying is contrary to public policy.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. Because, generally, \u201cthe public policy of the State of Montana is set by the Montana Legislature through its enactment of statutes\u201d <em>Duck Inn, Inc. v. Mont. State University-Northern, </em>285 Mont. 519, 523-24, 949 P.2d 1179, 1182 (1997) (citations omitted), I turn to the very statutes which address the assisting of suicide.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">The Statutory Prohibition on the Aiding or Soliciting of Suicide</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>\u2018If the conduct of the offender made him the agent of the death, the offense is criminal homicide notwithstanding the consent or even the solicitations of the victim.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">~ Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">\u00b699 Montana originally enacted a prohibition on the aiding or soliciting of suicide statute in 1895, providing that \u201c[e]very person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>deliberately aids, or advises or encourages another to commit suicide is guilty of a felony.\u201d Section 698, Mont. Penal Code (1895). The prohibition on aiding suicide has been the formally enacted public policy of our state for the succeeding 114 years. Under the 1895 enactment, the death or survival of the victim was irrelevant, as the crime only required that a defendant deliberately aid, advise, or encourage another to commit suicide. The Legislature left the statute untouched for over seventy years.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b6100 In 1973, the Legislature revised the statute to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">(1) A person who purposely aids or solicits another to commit suicide, but such suicide does not occur commits the offense of aiding or soliciting suicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">(2) A person convicted of the offense of aiding or soliciting a suicide shall be imprisoned in the state prison for any term not to exceed ten (10) years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Section 94-5-106, RCM (1973). The Legislature codified this provision within the homicide statutes. The current version of the statute is the same as the 1973 version, except that the Legislature has increased the potential punishment for the crime by authorizing a $50,000 penalty. Section 45-5-105(2), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b6101 Under the wording of the current version of the statute, a person may be prosecuted for aiding or soliciting another to commit suicide only if the victim <em>survives. </em>The purpose of this change of the statutory language from the pre-1973 version was explained by the Criminal Code Commission that proposed it. When the victim <em>dies, </em>the act is to be prosecuted as a homicide. \u201cIf the conduct of the offender made him the agent of the death, the offense is <em>criminal homicide ...\u201d </em>Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA (emphasis added). The Commission Comments then direct attention to the other crimes codified within the same homicide section-deliberate homicide, mitigated deliberate homicide, and negligent homicide. Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA (citing \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102, -103, -104, MCA). Like the other homicide statutes, the statute prohibiting the aiding or soliciting of suicide makes the offense a felony. Sections 45-5-102(2), -103(4), -104(3), -105(2), MCA. The justification for the felony designation of the offense, despite the fact the victim has survived, was provided by the Commission: \u201cThe rationale behind the felony sentence for the substantive offense of aiding or soliciting suicide is that <em>the act typifies a very low regard for human life.\u201d </em>Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA (emphasis added). This clear statement of the State\u2019s policy to protect human life is steadfastly avoided by the Court in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b6102 Thus, under Montana law, physicians who assist in a suicide are subject to criminal prosecution irrespective of whether the patient <em>survives </em>or <em>dies. </em>If the patient survives, the physician may be prosecuted under aiding or soliciting suicide. Section 45-5-105, MCA. If the patient <em>dies, </em>the physician may be prosecuted under the homicide statutes. Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA (citing \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102, -103, -104, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b6103 Importantly, it is also very clear that a patient\u2019s consent to the physician\u2019s efforts is of no consequence whatsoever under these statutes. The Commission Comments explain that a physician acting as the agency of death may not raise <em>\u201cconsent or even the solicitations of the </em>victim\u201d as a defense to criminal culpability. Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA (emphasis added). This principle has likewise been stated and restated by courts around the country: <em>Mich, v. Kevorkian, </em>639 N.W.2d 291, 331 (Mich. App. 2001) (\u201cconsent and euthanasia are not recognized defenses to murder\u201d); <em>Gentry v. Ind., </em>625 N.E.2d 1268, 1273 (Ind. App. 1st Dist. 1993) (\u201cconsent is not a defense to conduct causing another human being\u2019s death\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Pa. v. Root, </em>156 A.2d 895, 900 (Pa. Super. 1959) (\u201cThe Commonwealth is interested in protecting its citizens against acts which endanger their lives. <em>The policy of the law is to protect human life, even the life of a person who wishes to destroy his own. To prove that the victim wanted to die would be no defense to </em>murder.\u201d (Emphasis added.)), <em>overruled on other grounds, Pa. v. Root, </em>170 A.2d 310 (Pa. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"ABQO\">\u00b6104 The Court offers curious reasons for rejecting these clear and express statements of the State\u2019s public policy. Opinion, \u00b6 39-42. It criticizes the citation to the Criminal Law Commission\u2019s Comments about the intent and the structure of the homicide statutes, despite the fact the Court has repeatedly used the Commission Comments in the application of our statutes. <em>See e.g. State v. Wooster, </em>1999 MT 22, \u00b6 34 n. 1, 293 Mont. 195, 974 P.2d 640; <em>State v. Hawk, </em>285 Mont. 183,187, 948 P.2d 209, 211 (1997); <em>State v. Shively, </em>2009 MT 252, \u00b6 17, 351 Mont. 513, 216 P.3d 732; <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 229, \u00b6 18, 311 Mont. 439, 57 P.3d 42; <em>State v. Meeks, </em>2008 MT 40, \u00b6 9, 341 Mont. 341, 176 P.3d 1073. The Comments are critical here because they provide the intent behind and the interrelation among the homicide statutes-how they are designed to work together and the inapplicability of the defense of consent-and thus answer the specific question before the Court, an answer not made clear from the wording of the statutes themselves. The reader should find it astonishing that, in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>only, involving an issue of life and death, the Court refuses to consider the Comments which stand in direct contradiction to its decision. Dispensing with the Comments allows the Court to construct an artificial artifice between the aiding suicide statute and the other statutes in the homicide section of the Criminal Code, when the clear intent was just the opposite-that there was to be no artifice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHG\">\u00b6105 The Court then criticizes this Dissent as offering circular reasoning. Opinion, \u00b6 43. The Court believes the Dissent is arguing that the consent statute is inapplicable merely because the conduct of physician-assisted suicide is defined as an offense and that such reasoning would obviate the consent statute for all offenses. However, the Court has misstated the Dissent. The consent statute is inapplicable, not simply because physician-assisted suicide is defined as illegal conduct, but because the intent of the Legislature was that the consent defense would not apply to this particular crime. Again, \u201c[i]f the conduct of the offender made him the agent of the death, the offense is criminal homicide notwithstanding the consent or even the solicitations of the victim.\u201d Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA. Application of the consent statute to other crimes is not affected by the Legislature\u2019s elimination of the consent defense for this particular crime. If this is circular or illogical, then the blame rests with the Legislature, because the only reasoning here offered by the Dissent is to point out the plain explanation of the working of the statutes. The Dissent has added nothing more. It is the Court who offers many words in an effort to reason away from this plain language and clear intent, when it is not our duty to agree or disagree with the Legislature\u2019s determination. \u201c[T]his Court may not concern itself with the wisdom of such statutes\u201d by arguing the Montana Legislature\u2019s logic is somehow circular or otherwise inappropriate. <em>Duck Inn, </em>Inc., 285 Mont. at 523-24, 949 P.2d at 1182. The Court\u2019s role is simply to <em>find </em>the public policy. The homicide statutory framework and the prohibition against consent, by itself, is more than enough to foreclose any suggestion that Montana even remotely favors or supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>physician-assisted suicide.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, there is further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act</p>\n<p id=\"A6U\">\u00b6106 In 1991, the Legislature enacted the Montana Rights of the Terminally III Act (Montana Act) by substantially adopting the Uniform Rights of the Terminally 111 Act (Uniform Act). Secs. 1-16, Ch. 391, L. 1991 (codified at \u00a7\u00a7 50-9-101 to -206, MCA). The Prefatory Note in the Uniform Act explains that \u201c[t]he scope of the Act is <em>narrow. </em>Its impact is limited to treatment that is merely <em>life-prolonging </em>,...\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Uniform Rights of Terminally 111 Act (1989), 9C U.L.A. 311, 312 (2001) (emphasis added). The form Declaration provided by the Montana Act for patients, by its plain language, further supports the scope of the purposes articulated in the Uniform Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">If I should have an incurable or irreversible condition that, without the administration of life-sustaining treatment, will, in the opinion of my attending physician or attending advanced practice registered nurse, cause my death within a relatively short time and I am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, I direct my attending physician or attending advance practice registered nurse, pursuant to the Montana Rights of the Terminally 111 Act, <em>to withhold or withdraw treatment that only prolongs the process of dying and is not necessary to my comfort or to alleviate pain.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Section 50-9-103(2), MCA (emphasis added). And, as the Court acknowledges, the Montana Act is careful to explain that it \u201cdoes not condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia.\u201d Section 50-9-205(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u00b6107 The operative words in the Montana Act are those permitting a patient to \u201cwithhold\u201d and \u201cwithdraw\u201d life-sustaining treatment. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 50-9-103(2), -106, -204, -205, MCA. Largely self-evident, to \u201cwithhold\u201d means \u201cto desist or refrain from granting, giving, or allowing.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>2627 (Philip Babcock Gove ed., G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1971). Similarly, \u201cwithdraw\u201d is defined as \u201cto take back or away (something bestowed or possessed).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>at 2626. Neither word incorporates the concept of affirmatively issuing a life-ending drug to a patient. Rather, the plain language permits only the taking away of, or refraining from giving, certain medical treatment-that which merely prolongs the dying process. Sections 50-9-102(9), -103(2), -106, -204, -205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Auh\">\u00b6108 Although the Court reasons that because the Montana Act permits the withholding or withdrawal of treatment prolonging the dying process, \u201cit would be incongruous to conclude that a physician\u2019s indirect aid in dying is contrary to public policy,\u201d the opposite is true: it is incongruous to conclude there is no legal distinction between the withdrawal of life-prolonging medical treatment and the provision of life-ending treatment. This distinction is clearly recognized by the wording of our statutes, discussed above, and by the courts. <em>See e.g. Vacco v. Quill, </em>521 U.S. 793, 800, 808, 117 S. Ct. 2293, 2297-98, 2302 (1997) (distinguishing between physician-assisted suicide and refusal of medical treatment does not violate equal protection); and <em>compare Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 705-06, 117 S. Ct. at 2261 (holding there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide) <em>with Cruzan v. Mo. Dept. of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 277-79, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 2851-52 (1990) (assuming a constitutional right for competent person to refuse unwanted medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b6109 To further illustrate the Legislature\u2019s policy preference in respecting a person\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment, Montana allows a person to forego cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Sections 50-10-101 to -107, MCA. To the extent a patient refuses the receipt of CPR, physicians must either refrain from conducting CPR or transfer the patient into the care of a physician who will follow the do not resuscitate protocol. Section 50-10-103(2), MCA. As with the Rights of the Terminally 111 Act, a person may refuse treatment, but the tenor of the statute provides no support for physicians shifting from idle onlookers of natural death to active participants in their patients\u2019 suicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b6110 Thus, the law accommodating a patient\u2019s desire to die of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>natural </em>causes by withholding treatment does not, as the Court posits, support a public policy in favor of the deliberate action by a physician to cause a patient\u2019s <em>pre-natural, </em>or premature, death.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>The 1972 Montana Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AU9\">fill Montana\u2019s longstanding public policy against the assistance of suicide was continued by adoption of the 1972 Constitution. It supports neither the Court\u2019s public policy determination, nor the District Court\u2019s constitutionally based decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b6 112 No statement concerning a \u201cright to die\u201d is included within the Constitution\u2019s Declaration of Rights. This absence is neither accidental nor the product of ignorance. In this regard, it is important to note that \u201c[n]o proposal was adopted or rejected without considered deliberation.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, February 22, 1972, p. 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b6113 One of the proposals receiving such careful deliberation was Proposal No. 103. Montana Constitutional Convention, Minutes of the Bill of Rights Committee, February 9,1972, p. 2. Submitted to the Bill of Rights Committee by Delegate Robert L. Kelleher, Proposal No. 103 would have included a right to die within the Constitution\u2019s Declaration of Rights. Montana Constitutional Convention, Delegate Proposals, February 2, 1972, p. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u00b6 114 Delegate Kelleher\u2019s proposal provided, in pertinent part, \u201cThe incurably ill have the right not to be kept alive by extraordinary means.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Delegate Proposals, February 2,1972, p. 223. Delegate Kelleher testified before the Bill of Rights Committee, \u201cthat the person with an incurable disease should have the right to choose his own death.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Minutes of the Bill of Rights Committee, February 12, 1972, p. 5. Alternatives offered to Kelleher\u2019s proposal covered the broad spectrum of \u201cright to die\u201d scenarios. Joe Roberts testified on the same day as Delegate Kelleher, advocating for broader language: \u201cThere shall be a right to die. The legislature shall make appropriate provisions therefore.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Minutes of the Bill of Rights Committee, February 12, 1972, p. 6; Montana Constitutional Convention, Testimony of Joe Roberts Before the Bill of Rights Committee Concerning the Right to Die, February 12,1972, p. 4. Mr. Roberts referenced the \u201cvery poignant testimony\u201d of witness Joyce Franks and her \u201cpersonal encounter with the agonizing death of her father.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Testimony of Joe Roberts Before the Bill of Rights Committee Concerning the Right to Die, February 12,1972, p. 1. Ms. Franks\u2019 testimony had described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>death of her 86-year-old father and his wish that a doctor \u201cgive him something to put him to sleep right then.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Testimony of Joyce M. Franks Before the Bill of Rights Committee, February 3, 1972, p. 5A. Ms. Franks stated to the Bill of Rights Committee, \u201cWhat I am working for is that every person shall have the right to determine, barring accident, the manner of his dying. And then, I am advocating the twin right to make it legal, if he desires this type of death, for a person to receive a quick and easy medicated death somehow.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Testimony of Joyce M. Franks Before the Bill of Rights Committee, February 3, 1972, p. 1. Ms. Franks therefore urged adoption of an amendment stating: \u201cEvery citizen shall be allowed to choose the manner in which he dies.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Testimony of Joyce M. Franks Before the Bill of Rights Committee, February 3,1972, p. 2; <em>see also </em>Charles S. Johnson, <em>Right to Die Resurfaces in Montana, </em>Independent Record FI (Aug. 23, 2009) (describing Constitutional Convention\u2019s consideration and rejection of a right to die).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b6115 However, the Bill of Rights Committee rejected Kelleher\u2019s proposal in its entirety and also rejected all of the alternatives which had been offered in conjunction with Kelleher\u2019s proposal to incorporate a \u201cright to die\u201d of any kind within the new Constitution. <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Minutes of the Bill of Rights Committee, February 9, 1972, p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b6116 Nor were other provisions of the Constitution, such as the Individual Dignity and the Right of Privacy provisions, drafted to include a right to die. The Constitutional Convention adopted the Individual Dignity Section for the express purpose of providing equal protection and prohibiting discrimination. The Bill of Rights Committee proposed the Individual Dignity Section \u201cwith the <em>intent </em>of providing a Constitutional impetus for the eradication of public and private discriminations based on race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, February 22,1972, p. 628 (emphasis added). During the floor debate on the provision, Delegate Otto Habedank expressed concern that he would be required \u201cto associate with people that I choose not to associate with.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1643. Delegate Wade J. Dahood, Chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee, responded to Delegate Habedank\u2019s concern by stating, \u201cThere is no intent within this particular section to do anything other than to remove the apparent type of discrimination that all of us object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to with respect to employment, to rental practices, to actual association in matters that are public or matters that tend to be somewhat quasi-public.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1643. Delegate Dahood\u2019s statement was consistent with the expressed intent of the Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, which was, in consideration of the entirety of Article II, Section 4, to provide <em>\u201ca </em>Constitutional impetus for the eradication of public and private discriminations ....\u201d <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, February 22,1972, p. 628; Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1643. Nothing within these discussions or explanations suggests even a thought that the dignity clause contained vague, lurking rights that might someday manifest themselves beyond what the delegates or the citizens of Montana who approved the Constitution believed, and overturn long-established law, here, the policy against assisted suicide. The reference to dignity therefore provides an aspirational introduction to the already well-established substantive legal principles providing the operative vehicles to achieve dignity: equal protection and the prohibition upon discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Likewise, the right to privacy did not alter the State\u2019s policy against assisted suicide. There is nothing within either the language of the provision or the convention proceedings which would reflect any such intention. <em>See e.g. </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1680-82; Montana Constitutional Convention, Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, February 22, 1972, pp. 632-33. For such reasons, not one court of last resort has interpreted a constitutional right of privacy to include physician-assisted suicide. <em>Kirscher v. McIver, </em>697 So. 2d 97, 100, 104 (Fla. 1997); <em>Sampson v. Alaska, </em>31 P.3d 88, 98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>(Alaska 2001); <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 705-06, 117 S. Ct. at 2261. No evidence exists that the delegates intended the right of privacy to change the state\u2019s longstanding public policy. Since adoption of the 1972 Constitution, the Legislature has continued to enact legislation prohibiting assisted suicide. Indeed, the Legislature directed the Department of Public Health and Human Services to \u201cimplement a suicide prevention program by January 1,2008,\u201d including a plan that must delineate \u201cspecific activities to reduce suicide.\u201d Sections 53-21-1101(1), -1102(2)(b), MCA. This is further indication of a state public policy against assisted suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b6117 Because we live in a democracy, this policy may someday change. Controlling their own destiny, Montanans may decide to change the State\u2019s public policy after what would be, no doubt, a spirited public debate. In fact, efforts in that regard have already started. <em>See e.g. </em>Bill Draft LC1818, 61st Leg., Reg. Sess. (Jan. 9, 2008) (The proposed \u201cMontana Death with Dignity Act\u201d had the stated purpose of \u201callowing a terminally ill patient to request medication to end the patient\u2019s life.\u201d). This Court should allow the public debate to continue, and allow the citizens of this State to control their own destiny on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b6118 Until the public policy is changed by the democratic process, it should be recognized and enforced by the courts. It is a public policy which regards the aiding of suicide as typifying \u201ca very low regard for human life,\u201d Commission Comments, \u00a7 45-5-105, MCA, and which expressly prohibits it. Instead, the Court rejects the State\u2019s longstanding policy. It ignores expressed intent, parses statutes, and churns reasons to avoid the clear policy of the State and reach an untenable conclusion: that it is <em>against </em>public policy for a physician to assist in a suicide if the patient happens to <em>live </em>after taking the medication; but that the very same act, with the very same intent, is <em>not </em>against public policy if the patient <em>dies. </em>In my view, the Court\u2019s conclusion is without support, without clear reason, and without moral force.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b6119 I would reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-7\">HON. HEGEL, District Court Judge, sitting in place of CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-4\"> If further demonstration of the propriety of consulting the Commission Comments is desired, the District Court\u2019s observations about the statute may be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">The Court: I thought \u201cHow strange,\u201d but then I realized, thought later <em>maybe it\u2019s because </em>if the person does die, they aren\u2019t charged with assisted suicide, they\u2019d be charged with a homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">Mr. Johnstone: That\u2019s what my criminal Counsel, Ms. Anders, has told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">The Court: But it was really strange when I first ran across that.

Physician assistants, nurse-practitioners, nurses, friends, and family do not qualify as physicians, but they will all undoubtedly be involved to varying degrees in the process of physician-assisted suicide. Yet, the Court\u2019s public policy reasoning is based upon the role of a physician. The net result of the decision, whether intended or not, is to leave \u201cnon-physicians\u201d with the question of whether the decision premised upon a physician-based policy will apply to them as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> The quoted passage, in its entirety, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The scope of the Act is narrow. Its impact is limited to treatment that is merely life-prolonging, and to patients whose terminal condition is incurable and irreversible, whose death will soon occur, and who are unable to participate in treatment decisions. Beyond its narrow scope, the Act is not intended to affect any existing rights and responsibilities of persons to make medical treatment decisions. The Act merely provides alternative ways in which a terminally-ill patient\u2019s desires regarding the use of life-sustaining procedures can be legally implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Uniform Rights of Terminally 111 Act (1989), 9C U.L.A. at 312.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b302-4\"> The historical origins of the dignity clause are enlightening. At the Constitutional Convention, delegates reviewed two foreign constitutions, the 1949 West Germany Constitution and the 1951 Puerto Rico Constitution. Montana Constitutional Convention Commission, <em>Constitutional Convention Studies No. 10: Bill of Rights </em>242 (1972); Montana Constitutional Convention, Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, February 22, 1972, p. 628. The West German Constitution, the eldest of the two, provided, \u201cThe dignity of man shall be inviolable.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention Commission, <em>Constitutional Convention Studies No. 10: Bill of Rights </em>at 242 (citing West German Const, art.

The Montana Constitution contains the identical provision, adopted word-for-word except for the use of the gender-neutral \u201chuman being\u201d instead of \u201cman.\u201d The West German Constitution was developed in response to the Nazi regime\u2019s unequal treatment, persecution, and ultimate killing of the Jewish people. <em>See e.g. </em>Gregory H.
