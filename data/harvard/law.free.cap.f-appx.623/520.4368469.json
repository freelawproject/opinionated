(collectively \u201cthe coin companies\u201d) appeal the summary judgment in favor of Americas Value Channel, Inc. John G. Binns Jr. marketed valuable coins on Americas Value Channel in February 2009, but he failed to pay the coin companies for the coins. The coin companies then sued him and Americas Value Channel. The coin companies obtained a default judgment against Binns for breach of contract and conversion and sought to hold Americas Value Channel derivatively liable on the ground that Binns acted with apparent authority as its agent. The district court ruled that Binns was not an agent of Americas Value Channel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-20\">The coin companies argue that the district court failed to consider whether Binns had implied authority to act on behalf of Americas Value Channel, but we will not consider an argument not presented to the district court. We have \u201crepeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d Access <em>Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385 F.3d </em>1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The coin companies contend that their \u201cBrief in Opposition to [the] Motion for Summary Judgment preserves the arguments ... regarding implied agency,\u201d but their brief cited decisions about apparent authority and argued that \u201cthere is a question of fact whether Binns had apparent authority to bind AVC to the contract at issue in this matter.\u201d Their brief did not mention implied authority, which \u201cdiffers from apparent authority in that it is authority which the principal intended that the agent should have.\u201d <em>McLemore v. Hyundai Motor Mfg. Ala., LLC, </em>7 So.3d 318, 328 (Ala.2008) (quoting <em>Patterson v. Page Aircraft Maint, Inc., </em>51 Ala.App. 122, 283 So.2d 433, 436 (1973)). And the coin companies failed to object to the description of their argument as \u201cassert[ing] ... [that] AVC clothed Binns with apparent authority\u201d in a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that the district court adopted. We will not fault the district court for failing to consider an argument not presented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-21\">The district court did not err when it ruled that Binns did not act with the apparent authority of Americas Value Chan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>nel. Under Alabama law, which the parties agree applies, \u201cbefore there can be apparent authority that implies an agency relationship, the \u2018authority5 must be apparent to the complaining party and that party must have relied on the appearance of authority.\u201d <em>Brown v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp., </em>899 So.2d 227, 238 (Ala.2004) (quoting <em>Watson v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>599 So.2d 1133, 1136 (Ala.1992)). The coin companies shared a business relationship with Binns that predated his appearance on Americas Value Channel. He contacted the coin companies; his business card contained his and his brother\u2019s contact information; he stated that he would sell the coins on television programs; and he paid the coin companies with a personal check. Binns operated in the same manner during several transactions with the coin companies in the fall of 2008 and during a transaction in December 2009 in which Doug\u2019s Coin delivered coins to the office of Americans Value Channel. In February 2009, Binns also acted consistent with his past business practices when he arranged for Doug\u2019s Coin to deliver the products of both coin companies to Americas Value Channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The owner of Doug\u2019s Coin was not \u201cmisled by ... appearances\u201d or given \u201creasonable cause to believe,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 241 (quoting <em>Union Oil of Cal. v. Crane, </em>288 Ala. 173, 258 So.2d 882, 887 (1972)), by Americas Value Channel that Binns was its agent. The owner\u2019s testimony and affidavit established that he relinquished the coins to Binns at the television studio and that he watched a broadcast and observed transactions in the call center without speaking to an employee of Americas Value Channel. The owners of both coin companies averred that they thought Americas Value Channel \u201cwould be standing behind\u201d the transactions in February 2009 because it aired Binns\u2019s programs; displayed its logo, its toll-free number, and information when displaying Binns\u2019s merchandise; and processed orders and payments for Binns. But their \u201cmere belief without cause ... [was] not enough,\u201d to establish an agency by apparent authority. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Union Oil, </em>258 So.2d at 887).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Americas Value Channel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
