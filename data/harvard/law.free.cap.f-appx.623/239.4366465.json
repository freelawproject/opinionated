By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Moore is challenging the district court\u2019s certification, that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u2022 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-21\">Moore contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Because his original sentence was imposed at the low end of the guidelines range, he maintains, the district court should have resentenced him at the bottom of the amended guidelines range. Moore contends that the district court erred in considering the severity of his criminal history and the quantity of drugs involved in this offense. He asserts that the facts of this case are unexceptional, that the Sentencing Commission weighed the statutory sentencing factors, and that the district court abused its discretion in substituting its own judgment by re-weighing those factors.'</p>\n<p id=\"b271-22\">The district court recognized that Moore was eligible for a sentence reduction, and it found correctly that Moore\u2019s original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sentence was within his new guidelines range. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court denied Moore\u2019s motion as a matter of discretion, referring specifically to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors of the nature and circumstances of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to provide adequate deterrence. Moore has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying him a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Moore\u2019s appeal does not present a non-frivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
