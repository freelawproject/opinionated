He asserts the magistrate judge erred in declining to hold an eviden-tiary hearing on, or grant, his <em>pro se </em>motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201cGenerally, this court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to review the district court[\u2019s] final orders, qualified interlocutory orders, and collateral orders.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Harris Cty., </em>443 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.2006); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Moreover, \u201cit is well established that a magistrate judge\u2019s order is not \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1291 and may not be appealed to this court directly\u201d. <em>Sealed Appellee v. Sealed Appellant, </em>765 F.3d 394, 395 (5th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Donaldson v. Ducote, </em>373 F.3d 622, 624 (5th Cir.2004)). Because Bustos did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s order, or otherwise renew his motion, to the district court, we lack jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
