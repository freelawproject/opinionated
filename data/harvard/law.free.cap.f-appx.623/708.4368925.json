No objection is made to the No. 2012-8-16 ordinance itself. It limits to eight children the number cared for by the Plaintiffs. They were not entitled to care for 12 children because they had no permit. The City Council denied further action because \u201cmore than eight is simply too many.\u201d The judgment of the district judge, based upon the explanations of the magistrate judge, is correct. Any pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AdE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A0z\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under \u2022 the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
