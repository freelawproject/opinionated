Herrera-Mata challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals ofl8U.'S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Because the record reveals no objection to the sentence other than a request for a sentence below the guidelines based on cultural assimilation, the plain error standard of review applies to all of his other arguments. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">As he concedes, Herrera-Mata\u2019s argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks empirical support has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009). His argument that his guidelines range was greater than necessary as a result of \u201cdouble counting\u201d his criminal history is unavailing. The Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6). We have rejected the argument that such double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We have also previously rejected Herrera-Mata\u2019s argument that the offense of illegal reentry is treated too harshly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Herrera-Mata\u2019s argument concerning his cultural assimilation and his benign motive for reentry fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The district court considered Herrera-Mata\u2019s personal history and characteristics and the other statutory sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), in particular Herrera-Mata\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated kidnapping and his other criminal convictions, prior to imposing a sentence within the Guidelines. Herrera-Mata\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Herrera-Mata has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion or plainly erred by sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentence of 60 months. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
