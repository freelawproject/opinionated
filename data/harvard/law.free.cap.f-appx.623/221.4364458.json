Although he contends that the district court erred in excluding expert testimony concerning his diminished mental capacity, he does not brief the standards that apply in determining whether the testimony was admissible. Nor does he identify any error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>district court\u2019s reasons for excluding the <em>testimony </em>\u2014 -ie., that expert opinion concerning ability to form criminal intent is inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, that the requirements of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), were not met, and that the expert failed to produce an adequate expert report. Accordingly,' Bardales has waived the issue. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); <em>United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439-40 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Brinkmann v. Dall. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Bardales claims that the district court should have taken into account his diminished mental capacity in determining that he did not qualify for the safety valve under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. He asserts that his mental condition was part of his history and characteristics that the district court was required to consider.-</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>597 F.3d 242, 250 (5th Cir.2010). The same standard of review is applied to challenges regarding the statutory safety valve. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.1996). A district court\u2019s decision that-a defendant is ineligible for a safety valve reduction because he did not fully and truthfully debrief is a factual finding that we l-eview for plain error. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 345 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible, considering the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>773 F.3d 48, 52 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1865, 191 L.Ed.2d 741 (2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">Bardales presents no authority for conflating the requirements that the district court first calculate the correct guidelines range, then consider that range and the other factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2014 including the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics \u2014 in determining the sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). While calculating the guideline range, the court must find the existence of a number of factors before applying the safety valve, including that \u201cthe defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); \u00a7 501.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">The district court considered Bardales\u2019s claim that his mental condition prevented him from fully debriefing, but the court found that he failed truthfully to inform the government about his offenses in that he denied knowledge of the heroin. Bar-dales has not shown that the court\u2019s finding of a less-than-truthful debriefing was implausible in light of the record as a whole. Indeed, the finding is supported by the jury\u2019s determination that Bardales knowingly committed the offenses. There: fore, he has not shown that the court clearly erred in finding that he failed truthfully to debrief, <em>see United States v. Moreno-Gonzalez, </em>662 F.3d 369, 375 (5th Cir.2011), and thus he fails to show that the court erred in denying the safety valve, <em>see </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Bardales similarly claims that the court erred by failing to take into account his diminished mental capacity in deciding that he was not entitled to the downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Because he did not raise that argument in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Flores-Ochoa, </em>139 F.3d 1022, 1023 (5th Cir.1998). To show plain error, Bardales must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we' have the discretion to correct the error but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Even assuming \u2014 purely for the sake of argument \u2014 that the district court erred by failing to consider Bardales\u2019s mental condition in determining whether to grant the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the error did not affect his substantial rights, because he received the statutory minimum 120-month sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(i); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(A). The district court was unable to sentence him below the statutory minimum in the absence of a motion by the government for substantial assistance or the application of the safety valve. <em>See United States v. Krumnow, </em>476 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Likewise, to the extent Bardales suggests that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it does not account for his mental illness, he cannot show that any error affected his substantial rights, because he received the statutory minimum. <em>See id. </em>He thus fails to establish plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
