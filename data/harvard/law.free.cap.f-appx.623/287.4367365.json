R. APP. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant\u2019s sentence may be modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Anderson has not shown that the district court erred in concluding that his sentencing range was not lowered by Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Anderson\u2019s appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue and has not been brought in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
