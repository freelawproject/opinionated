Seven months after the entry of the criminal judgment, she filed a motion, purportedly pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, in which she asserted that she should have received a minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court denied relief, concluding that \u00a7 2243 provided only the procedure for federal review of habeas cases and ruling that Garcia Cepeda\u2019s motion arose under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 but her Sentencing Guidelines challenge was not cognizable. The district court also denied her a certificate of appealability (COA) and denied in forma pauperis (IFP) status because the appeal was not taken in good faith. Garcia Cepeda now moves this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal. She asserts that the district court erred in summarily denying her writ; she contends that \u00a7 2243 and Rule 4 of the Rules Governing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 Proceedings requires a reviewing court to either grant relief, order the respondent to show cause why relief should not be granted, or schedule an evidentiary hearing. In addition, Garcia Cepeda maintains that she was entitled to sentencing relief because she qualified for the minor role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-21\">The Government has filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that because a COA is required to appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, and because Garcia Cepeda has not moved for a COA, this court lacks jurisdiction over the proceedings. Alternatively, the Government moves for summary. affirmance, contending that Garcia Cepeda\u2019s sentencing issue is not cognizable under \u00a7 2255 and that she waived her right to challenge her conviction and sentence in postconviction proceedings. The Government requests an extension of time to file a responsive brief, if such is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-22\">To the extent that Garci\u00e1 Cepeda is appealing the denial of her \u00a7 2243 writ, a COA is not necessary to do so. However, in order to proceed IFP, she must show that she is a pauper and that her appeal is taken in good faith, involving nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Garcia Cepeda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>has failed to show that \u00a7 2243 provides an independent basis for challenging her federal sentence. Additionally, her assertion that a summary dismissal is inappropriate under that statute is incorrect. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2243; <em>Harris v. </em>Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 298-99, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969). Because Garcia Cepeda\u2019s postjudgment motion was unauthorized, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Garcia Cepeda\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir, R. 42.2. Accordingly, her request for IFP status is DENIED, and her APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">As noted above, the district court construed Garcia Cepeda\u2019s motion as arising under \u00a7 2255. Garcia Cepeda has not refuted this construction. To the extent that Garcia Cepeda is seeking review of the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, she is required to obtain a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Although Garcia Cepeda has not moved for a COA, her IFP brief contains sufficient argument for this court to consider whether a COA is warranted, to the extent that it is necessary. Therefore, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">To obtain a COA, Garcia Cepeda must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). In order to satisfy this standard, she must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of [her] constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>see also Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (stating that an individual seeking a COA \u201cmust demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong\u201d). Garcia Cepeda has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Consequently, a COA is DENIED. Because we are not affirming the opinion of the district court, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is likewise DENIED. The Government\u2019s alternative request for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
