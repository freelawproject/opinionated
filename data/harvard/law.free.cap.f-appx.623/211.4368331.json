Garza argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He maintains that he was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>lines. According to Garza, the district court should have granted him a reduction because he has turned his life around in prison, earning his GED and becoming a teacher of other inmates. He asserts that the district court incorrectly determined that he was a danger to the community because he was not involved in a violent offense and has rehabilitated himself 'in prison. The Government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion and that Garza\u2019s motion was premature because Amendment 782 does not become retroactive until November 1,2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Amendment 782 becomes retroactively applicable on November 1, 2015, to inmates, such as Garza, who were sentenced prior to the effective date of the amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 788. Nevertheless, inmates who are eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 may seek such a sentence reduction that would become effective on November 1, 2015, prior to November 1, 2015. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The district court had before it Garza\u2019s arguments in favor of a sentence reduction; the original and reduced guidelines ranges; a synopsis of Garza\u2019s behavior while incarcerated, both good and bad; and the information from Garza\u2019s original sentencing, including his criminal history and his obstruction of justice. The district court, implicitly finding that Garza was eligible for a reduction, denied Garza\u2019s motion as a matter of discretion, specifically citing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factor of protection of the public. While the district court did not discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors further, the arguments were presented to the district court, and \u201calthough it did not discuss them, we can assume that it considered them.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court was not required to give a detailed explanation of its decision to deny Garza\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>at 674. Garza was not entitled to a sentence reduction just because he was eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 673. Given Garza\u2019s criminal history, his obstruction of justice, and his prison disciplinary record, Garza has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying the motion. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
