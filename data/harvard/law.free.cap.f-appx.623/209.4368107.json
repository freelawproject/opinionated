He did not timely notice his appeal from his judgment of conviction. Rather, he filed an untimely pro se notice of appeal and averred that counsel had ignored his request to timely file a notice of appeal. The district court construed this filing as a request to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal and denied it. The district court also noted that his notice of appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-22\">Now, Sanchez-Vasquez argues that the district court should have construed his untimely pro se notice of appeal as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion seeking an out-of-time appeal grounded in a claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not timely noticing his appeal. He requests that we vacate the district court\u2019s IFP order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-23\">We should always be aware of our jurisdiction and raise this issue on our own when necessary. <em>United States v. Villanueva-Diaz, </em>634 F.3d 844, 848 (5th Cir. 2011). \u201cAn appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district court within the time allowed by Rule 4.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(1). Thus, a notice of appeal is a mandatory precondition to the exercise of this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>Because Sanchez-Vasquez filed no notice of appeal from the order he is now challenging, we do not have jurisdiction over this appeal, and it is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
