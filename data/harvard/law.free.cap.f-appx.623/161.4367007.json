The appeal is utterly meritless and could be rejected on numerous grounds. For the sake of brevity, we note only the most obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Dr. Allen\u2019s briefs do not include a single citation to record evidence, and he has therefore \u201cwaived [his] contention on appeal that an issue of material fact precludes the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Timberlake v. Teamsters Local Union No. 891, </em>428 Fed.Appx. 299, 302 (5th Cir.2011); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(6), (8)(A). Rather than record evidence, Dr. Allen repeatedly cites to the pleadings to support his version of the facts. Thus, his failure to cite record evidence also demonstrates that summary judgment was proper. <em>See Abarca v. Metro. Transit Auth., </em>404 F.3d 938, 940 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and come forward with specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial to avoid summary judgment.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Viewed individually, Dr. Allen\u2019s arguments fare no better. Dr. Allen appears to argue that claims brought under 42 U.S.C. sections 1983,1985, and 1986 should have survived summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Dr. Allen\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is based on alleged false imprisonment and requires a showing he was arrested absent probable cause. <em>Haggerty v. Texas S. Univ., </em>391 F.3d 653, 655 (5th Cir.2004). Because, a judge issued an arrest warrant, a grand jury returned an indictment, and after a <em>habeas corpus </em>hearing, a second judge found \u201csufficient probable cause\u201d supporting his arrest, Dr. Allen rightly concedes he must show that the deliberations of these intermediaries \u201c Vere in some way tainted by the actions of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cuadra v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>626 F.3d 808, 813 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Hand v. Gary, </em>838 F.2d 1420, 1428 (5th Cir. 1988)). \u201c[M]ere allegations of \u2018taint,\u2019 without more, are insufficient to overcome summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taylor v. Gregg, </em>36 F.3d 453, 457 (5th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 949 (5th Cir. 2003)) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Even assuming no probable cause existed when Dr. Allen was arrested, his claim fails. Under the circumstances of this case, Dr. Allen needed to present admissible evidence that the defendants \u201cknowingly withheld\u201d material facts from the three intermediaries involved in his case. <em>See id. </em>at 813-14. There is no evidence, however, regarding the defendant\u2019s role in these proceedings and therefore no evidence of knowing nondisclosure. More fundamentally, the purportedly withheld material facts \u2014 alleged coercion of witnesses and an alleged police plot to \u201cget\u201d Dr. Allen \u2014 are themselves wholly unsupported by evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment on this issue was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Dr. Allen cannot complain regarding the dismissal of his \u00a7 1985 claim because, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>opposing the motion for summary judgment, he asserted that \u201cthere remains but two simple and straight forward causes of action,\u201d claims under sections 1983 and 1986, and confirmed \u201c[n]o other state or federal law claims remain.\u201d The \u00a7 1985 claim was abandoned and cannot be revived.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Because Dr. Allen previously abandoned his \u00a7 1985 claim, his \u00a7 1986 claim necessarily fails. <em>See Webb v. Owens, </em>308 Fed. Appx. 775, 776 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cIn his reply brief, Webb abandoned his \u00a7 1985(2) conspiracy claim. Because a \u00a7 1986 claim is dependent upon the existence of a \u00a7 1985 claim, the district \u25a0 court\u2019s dismissal of Webb\u2019s \u00a7 1986 claim is affirmed.\u201d); <em>see also Hamilton v. Chaffin, </em>506 F.2d 904, 914 (5th Cir.1975). In addition to noting the interdependency of Dr. Allen\u2019s \u00a7 1985 and \u00a7 1986 claims, the district court also ruled Dr. Allen could not \u201csatisfy the \u2018two or more person's\u2019 element of a <em>prima facie </em>case under \u00a7 1985.\u201d Dr, Allen rightly concedes that a conspiracy must involve two or more persons. <em>See Hilliard v. Ferguson, </em>30 F.3d 649, 653 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, and for the first time, he argues that his sister and brother-in-law conspired with the county sheriff to fabricate criminal charges against him. \u201cA party cannot raise a new theory on appeal that was not presented to the court below.\u201d <em>Capps v. Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co., </em>536 F.2d 80, 82 (5th Cir.1976). Dr. Allen\u2019s reliance on this new theory is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">. For example, Dr. Allen alleges that the Jackson County \"Sheriff summoned his Deputies, ... and told them to \u2018get him,' (i.e. Dr. Allen).\" The ostensible evidentiary support for this allegation is <em>Dr. Allen\u2019s </em>\"answers to Interrogatories\" which were apparently not even made part of the record on appeal. Dr. Allen\u2019s reference to his \"answer to Interrogatories\u201d is accompanied by an enigmatic citation: \"attached to ROA. 698.\u201d Dr. Allen's opposition to the motion for summary judgment begins on page 698 of the record and no \u201canswers to Interrogatories\u201d appear attached. We will not scour the record in search of them. In any event, Dr. Allen\u2019s speculation (or fantasy) about what took place behind closed doors has no evidentiary value. Likewise, Dr. Allen\u2019s promise that one of the deputies \"would attest to\u201d the plot to \"get him\u201d is no evidence at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
