It began when Dr. Joseph DiDuro and his affiliated entity, Concerto Laboratories, L.L.C. (jointly, \u201cAppellants\u201d), created a short video outlining a diagnostic procedure and a blank form to be filled in while conducting that procedure. Dr. DiDuro registered both the video and the form with the United States Copyright Office. Soon after that, Dr. Erich Breitenmoser and his own entity, Practice Wealth Ltd. (jointly, \u201cAppellees\u201d), created their own videos about such a procedure and a form to be used while conducting it. Alleging that the latter videos and form infringed on the registered copyrights for the former ones, Appellants filed suit in the district court alleging federal- and state-law claims against Appellees. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court dismissed Appellants\u2019 federal-law claims with prejudice, and Appellants timely filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>under the same standard applied by the district court,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which requires that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We consider those facts \u201cin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Appellants cannot prevail on appeal of the district court\u2019s order and judgment rejecting their claims. \u201cTo establish a pri-ma facie case of copyright infringement, a copyright owner must prove \u2018(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying [by another] of constituent elements of the work that are original.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">First, for a copyright to be \u201cowned\u201d it must exist. And, for a copyright to exist in a work, such work must be subject to copyright protection, <em>ie., </em>it must be \u201ccopyrightable.\u201d Specifically, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 provides copyright protection to \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression ...,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but not to \u201cany idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such a work.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Stated differently, \u201ccopyright law protects tangible, original expressions of [such things], not [those things] themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe copyright is limited to those aspects of the work \u2014 termed \u2018expression\u2019 \u2014 that display the stamp of the author\u2019s originality.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, a copyright in a form or a video outlining a particular procedure does not extend to the procedure itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Here, the undisputed facts make clear that Appellees\u2019 videos and form merely describe, explain, illustrate, or embody a procedure that is identical or similar to that described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in the Appellants\u2019. Because the Appellants cannot own a copyright in a procedure, it does not matter if the procedure presented in one work is the same as or identical to that presented in another.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, only the work itself is relevant. Neither the Appellants\u2019 videos nor any aspect of them was dubbed, and neither the form nor any part of it was transposed. In sum, it is obvious to us that the Appellants have chiefly alleged infringement of the procedure itself, for which there is no copyright protection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Appellants\u2019 form were subject to copyright protection, it is further excluded from such protection because it constitutes a \u201cblank form,\u201d which is merely \u201cdesigned for recording information and do[es] not in [itself] convey information.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Other judicial, statutory, or contractual law might have provided (or might still provide) the protection that Appellants\u2019 seek, but 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 does not, at least not in this instance. Having considered the pertinent facts and the applicable law, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order and the resulting judgment for the forgoing reasons and those articulated by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
