He maintains that his constitutional rights were infringed when the defendant injured his arm while drawing his blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-23\">We conduct a de novo review of the dismissal. <em>See Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009). A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 31, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). A complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \u201cwhen it does not contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Boatright, </em>709 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Ballard has shown no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that he had failed to raise a claim upon which relief could be granted because his allegations showed no more than negligence, which is insufficient to show that a defendant has acted with deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>See Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir.1999). Because this appeal presents no legal points arguable on their merits, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Ballard\u2019s complaint and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Ballard has at least one previous strike. <em>Ballard v. Simien, </em>No. 4:07-cv-00791, 2008 WL 906531 (S.D.Tex. Apr. 3, 2008); <em>Ballard v. Simien, </em>No. 08-20253 (5th Cir. April 23, 2009); <em>Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 385-87. Because Ballard has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
