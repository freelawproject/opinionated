California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Aguilar-Torres has filed a response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Aguilar-Torres\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). Aguilar-Torres\u2019s appellate waiver is enforceable because it was knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">Aguilar-Torres\u2019s claim about the sufficiency of the factual basis of his plea survives the appellate waiver. <em>See United States v. Hildenbrand, </em>527 F.3d 466, 474 (5th Cir.2008). Nonetheless, because he signed the plea agreement, which contained the factual basis, and stated at rearraignment that he had no objection to it, he cannot present a nonfrivolous appellate claim. <em>See Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977) (\u201cSolemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity. The subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible.\u201d); <em>United States v. Abreo, </em>30 F.3d 29, 32 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that executed, unambiguous plea agreements are afforded substantial evidentiary weight). To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>extent Aguilar-Torres asks to appeal pro se, his request is DENIED as untimely because it was lodged after the <em>Anders </em>brief was filed. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and-the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Aguilar-Torres\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS, DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
