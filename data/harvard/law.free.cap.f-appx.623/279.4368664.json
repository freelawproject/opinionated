Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). If the appeal is frivolous, this court may dismiss it sua sponte. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-20\">The record establishes that Sanni-Shittu conspired or acted to prevent his removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(C). The Government presented evidence showing that the Nigerian Consulate was in the process of preparing travel documents, but a few weeks before his scheduled removal, Sanni-Shittu notified the consulate that he would be filing a \u00a7 2241 petition. Because the Nigerian Consulate will not issue travel documents if an alien has pending litigation, and because he has failed to request the issuance of travel documents directly, Sanni-Shittu has acted to prevent his removal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1231(a)(1)(C). Sanni-Shittu also has failed to show that, under the circumstances, his continued detention violates his constitutional rights or that \u201cthere is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-21\">Accordingly, Sanni-Shittu\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for leave to file a supplemental appellate brief also is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
