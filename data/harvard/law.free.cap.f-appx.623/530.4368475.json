Graham seeks a reduction under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court held that Graham is ineligible for relief under Amendment 782 because he is a career offender. On appeal, Graham argues that his career offender status does not bar him from relief. Alternatively, he asserts the sentencing court erred in concluding he is a career offender and, therefore, he is entitled to a sentence reduction. Both of these arguments fail. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">First, Graham cannot obtain relief under Amendment 782 because his career offender status forestalls the amendment from lowering his guideline range. Section 3582(c)(2) only authorizes a sentence reduction if the relevant guideline amendment has \u201cthe effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 782 reduced the base offense levels for most drug sentences calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782. But, as a career offender, Graham is subject to the offense level and guideline range found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. As a result, applying Amendment 782 to Graham does not lower his guideline range. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s denial of Graham\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was proper. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201ca court cannot use an amendment to reduce a sentence in a particular case unless that amendment actually lowers the guidelines range in that case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Second, under the present procedural posture, Graham cannot challenge the sentencing court\u2019s determination that he is a career offender. Section 3582(c)(2) only \u201cpermits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by\u201d the guideline amendments at issue. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). \u201cIn making [a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and <em>shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (emphasis added). Amendment 782 does not affect U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) or any related career offender provisions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782. Accordingly, the sentencing court\u2019s career offender decision is \u201coutside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 831, 130 S.Ct. at 2694.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
