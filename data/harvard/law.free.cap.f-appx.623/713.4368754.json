Vicks, who is HIV-positive and diabetic, asserted: his medical conditions necessitated more vigorous exercise than the restraints permit; therefore, defendants\u2019 refusal to exempt him from the restraints policy constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The district court granted summary judgment against Vicks\u2019 claims. Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he contests the court\u2019s: granting summary judgment; refusing to conduct a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); and denying his motion to appoint counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>\u201cusing the same standard as that employed by the district court\u201d. <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment must be granted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). To establish an Eighth Amendment violation based on the conditions of his confinement, Vicks must show: the deprivation alleged was \u201csufficiently serious[,] ... resulting] in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities\u201d; and, defendants acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference to [his] health or safety\u201d. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). To show a \u201csufficiently serious\u201d deprivation, Vicks must prove \u201che is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">\u201cAlthough deprivation of exercise is not per se cruel and unusual punishment, in particular circumstances \u2018a deprivation may constitute an impairment of health forbidden under the eighth amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruiz v. Estelle, </em>679 F.2d 1115, 1152 (5th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Miller v. Carson, </em>563 F.2d 741, 751 n. 12 (5th Cir.1977)), <em>amended in part, vacated in part on other grounds, </em>688 F.2d 266 (5th Cir.1982). Vicks contends his inability to exercise unrestrained unconstitutionally impairs his health, which he asserts has rapidly declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Vicks presents no evidence, however, of a nexus between any deterioration of his health and defendants\u2019 enforcement of the out-of-cell restraints policy. A plaintiff\u2019s \u201cunsubstantiated assertions\u201d do not suffice to demonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact. <em>See, e.g., Carna-by v. City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). Moreover, in district court, defendants presented uncontested evidence that Vicks\u2019 range of permitted exercise is limited to walking because his required medication regimen makes him especially susceptible to heat-related illnesses caused by overexertion. Vicks did not dispute defendants\u2019 assertion that he is able to walk in full restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">Vicks fails to show defendants\u2019 refusal to exempt him from the out-of-cell restraints policy during exercise periods poses a substantial risk of serious harm or unconstitutionally impairs his health, <em>See Farmer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970; <em>Ruiz, </em>679 F.2d at 1152. Accordingly, no genuine dispute of material fact exists in relation to his Eighth Amendment claim; summary judgment in favor of defendants was proper. <em>See McFaul, </em>684 F.3d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The court\u2019s refusal to conduct a <em>Spears </em>hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Payne v. Parnell, </em>246 Fed.Appx. 884, 890-91 (5th Cir.2007). A <em>Spears </em>hearing is designed to \u201cflesh out the allegations of a prisoner\u2019s complaint to determine whether ... the complaint, lacking an arguable basis in law or fact, should be dismissed summarily as malicious or frivolous\u201d. <em>Eason v. Holt, </em>73 F.3d 600, 602 (5th Cir.1996) (footnote omitted). Vicks\u2019 complaint presented more than \u201cconclusional allegations\u201d, set out \u201cexactly what scenario [he] claims occurred\u201d, and identified clearly \u201cthe legal basis for the claim\u201d. <em>Spears, </em>766 F.2d at 180. Therefore, his complaint demonstrated his constitutional claim, although lacking merit, was not frivolous. <em>See Eason, </em>73 F.3d at 602. Consequently, the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct a <em>Spears </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Similarly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denying Vicks\u2019 motion to appoint counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir. 1982). Vicks\u2019 complaint advanced a single, straightforward constitutional claim that was properly dismissed by summary judgment, thereby precluding a trial. Accordingly, appointment of. counsel would not have advanced the administration of jus-tic\u00e9. <em>See id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
