He contends that the district court committed procedural error in imposing sentence and also that it imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence after declining to grant him a downward departure or a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">We find no merit to Macias\u2019s contentions that the district court erred procedurally because it failed to explain why it denied a sentence below the guidelines range,' was unwilling to address the sentencing guideline provision concerning supervised release of a deportable alien, and inadequately explained its reason for imposing a term of supervised release. .If a district court \u201cdecides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United </em>States, 551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court made clear that Macias\u2019s extensive criminal history drove the choice of prison term and the decision to require supervised release. Because this case is \u201cconceptually simple ... and the record makes clear that the [court] considered the evidence and the arguments,\u201d no greater explanation was necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 359,127 S.Ct. 2456.' Also, a district court is not precluded from imposing a term of supervised release on a removable alien if the court determines, as occurred in Macias\u2019s case, that supervision is necessary as an added measure of protection and deterrence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1, comment. (n.5). The district court\u2019s determination is amply supported by Macias\u2019s criminal history. Because Macias shows no \u201cerror at all,\u201d he fails to establish that we should reverse for plain procedural error. <em>See United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, <em>400 (5th </em>Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">Additionally, we reject the contention that Macias was entitled to a downward departure or a variance. In our caselaw, a departure is a sentence that falls outside the initially calculated guidelines range but is authorized by one or more provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines, while a vari-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>anee is a sentence that is not so authorized. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Nothing indicates that the district court was of the mistaken belief that it was not free to depart. Therefore, to the extent that a departure basis existed and the district court believed it could depart below the guidelines range but declined to do so, we are without jurisdiction to review the decision-. <em>See United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 350 (5th Cir.2008). However, reviewing the question whether the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable, we find no relief warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Because Macias\u2019s sentence is \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range,\u201d an inference arises that the district court considered \u201call the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). In this circuit, a within-guidelines sentence \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Nothing in the record counsels in favor of not applying the presumption of reasonableness, particularly in\u2019 light of Macias\u2019s extensive criminal history. Moreover, even if we were to agree with Macias that a below-guidelines sentence would be reasonable, that is insufficient basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s sentencing decisions. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
