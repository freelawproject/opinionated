He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment as barred by the five-year statute of limitations because he was \u201cfound in\u201d the United States when he began filing federal income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Barring circumstances that suggest that immigration authorities should have known of his presence earlier, the five-year statute of limitations commences when the alien is \u201cfound in\u201d the United States. <em>United States v. Santana-Castellano, 74 </em>F.3d 593, 597 (5th Cir.1996). For an alien to be \u201cfound in\u201d the United States for purposes of \u00a7 1326, \u201c(1) immigration authorities must have specifically discovered and noted the alien\u2019s presence, and (2) knowledge of the illegality of the alien\u2019s presence must be reasonably attributable to immigration authorities.\u201d <em>United States v. Compian-Torres, </em>712 F.3d 203, 207 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellate brief. Relying primarily on <em>Compi-an-Torres, </em>the Government asserts that Ramirez was not \u201cfound\u201d for \u00a7 1326 purposes until he was detained by Texas authorities and referred to immigration authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Ramirez does not argue on appeal that the facts of his case do not fall within the holding of <em>Compian-Torres. </em>Rather, he acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed under <em>Compian-Toms, </em>and he raises his argument \u201csolely to preserve the matter for potential appeal to the Supreme Court.\u201d In light of the foregoing, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted. <em>See Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir. 1969). The Government\u2019s alternative motion to extend the time to file a brief is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
