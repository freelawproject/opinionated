Sarabia-Lopez contends that the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the victim violated his statutory and due process right to present evidence, thereby depriving him of a full and fair hearing on his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief. He also contends that the BIA\u2019s failure to consider and evaluate his arguments regarding the IJ\u2019s refusal to subpoena the victim violated his due process right to a full and meaningful review of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We must examine our own jurisdiction, whether or not raised by the parties. <em>Ca-dle Co. v. Pratt, </em>524 F.3d 580, 584 (5th Cir.2008). Judicial review of a final removal order is available only where the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies of right. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). An alien\u2019s failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar to this court\u2019s consideration of the issue. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir. 2001). \u201cAn alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the BIA \u2014 either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452-53. \u201cThis exhaustion requirement applies to all issues for which an administrative remedy is available to a petitioner as of right.\u201d <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA remedy is available as of right if (1) the petitioner could have argued the claim before the BIA, and (2) the BIA has adequate mechanisms to address and remedy such a claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318-19. An exception to the exhaustion requirement exists for claims of due process violations, except for procedural errors that are correctable by the BIA. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Although Sarabia-Lopez complained to the BIA that the IJ should have issued the subpoena in question, he did not contend that the IJ\u2019s failure to do so violated his due process rights. This alleged error falls within the type of procedural errors that would have been correctable by the BIA. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 136-37; <em>Matter of Vergara, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 388 (BIA 1975) (reviewing and rejecting alien\u2019s claim that the IJ\u2019s refusal to issue a subpoena violated her due process rights). Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review this issue. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 318-21; <em>Wang, </em>260 F.3d at 452-53. Similarly, he failed to raise his due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s order in a motion to reconsider or reopen; accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider the only other issue raised. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Accordingly, Sarabia-Lopez\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
