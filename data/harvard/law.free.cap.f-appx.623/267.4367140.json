Shirey contends his sentence, which exceeds the range provided in the policy statement of the Sentencing Guidelines, is procedurally unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>because the court did not adequately explain the reasons for the upward variance. He also challenges the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness, asserting the court failed to take into account his need for drug rehabilitation and acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). <em>Booker, </em>however, concerned a Guidelines sentence imposed pursuant to a conviction, not a violation of supervised release. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 842-43 (5th Cir.2011). Therefore, even <em>post-Booker, </em>revocation sentences are reviewed under the plainly-unreasonable standard of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4). <em>Id. </em>at 843. As Shirey concedes, he did not object to the sentence in district court; accordingly, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 332 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Under this standard, he must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, our court has discretion to correct the reversible plain error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>For each of the two issues, Shirey has not shown the requisite clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In imposing the sentence, the court cited the nature and circumstances of Shirey\u2019s supervised-release violations, and the need for deterrence and protection of the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(C). Additionally, the court implicitly considered Shirey\u2019s history and characteristics in imposing the revocation sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65 (recognizing implicit consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors is sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 3553(c)\u2019s requirement the court provide reasons for an above-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">As for Shirey\u2019s substantive-unreasonableness challenge, although the 36-month sentence is above the maximum policy statement sentence of 11 months, it is below the statutory maximum of 60. \u201cWe have routinely affirmed revocation sentences exceeding the advisory range, even where the sentence equals the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 332 (citation omitted). This matter does not warrant a different result. <em>See id. </em>at 333. Shirey does not show that the court: failed to account for a factor that should have received significant weight; gave significant weight to any irrelevant or improper factors; or committed a \u201cclear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
