Bogomol admitted in the factual basis for his guilty plea that he knew or had reason to know that the images would be transmitted via the Internet and stipulated that the Internet is a \u201cmeans and facility of interstate and foreign commerce.\u201d Bogomol did not admit that the images would move across state lines and now argues that the absence of such an admission fatally undermines the factual basis for his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Under 18. U.S.C. \u00a7 2251, it is unlawful for a person to use a minor to produce a sexually explicit image \u201cif such person knows or has reason to know\u201d that the image \u201cwill be ... transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d Bogomol contends that the term \u201cmeans or facility\u201d of interstate commerce should be limited to only those media that move an image across state lines. According to Bogomol, construing \u00a7 2251 to include \u201cintrastate transmission through interstate channels\u201d impermissibly intrudes upon \u201cthe traditional state responsibility for crime control\u201d and is therefore contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014). Bo-gomol asserts that the factual basis for his plea was inadequate under Rule 11 because he neither admitted that the images he produced would be transmitted across state lines nor stipulated that the Internet constituted a means or facility of interstate commerce \u201cin [his] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">\u201cRule 11(b)(3) requires a district court taking a guilty plea to make certain that the factual conduct admitted by the defendant is sufficient as a matter of law to establish a violation of the statute to which he entered his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 313 (5th Cir.2010) (footnote omitted). As Bogomol concedes, plain error review applies to his forfeited objection to the factual sufficiency of his plea. <em>See id. </em>To establish plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-16\">We have held that transmitting child pornography via the Internet is \u201ctantamount to moving photographs across state lines\u201d and satisfies the interstate nexus requirement of \u00a7 2251. <em>United States v. Runyan, </em>290 F.3d 223, 239 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court has also rejected arguments that the criminalization of intrastate transportation and transmission of child pornography violates the Commerce Clause. <em>See United States v. Dickson, </em>632 F.3d 186, 192 (5th Cir.2011) (rejecting a Commerce Clause challenge to the ban on production of child pornography in \u00a7 2251 as foreclosed under <em>United States v. Kal-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>lestad, </em>236 F.3d 225, 231-33 (5th Cir. 2000)). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bond </em>did not abrogate the holdings of these cases. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding of an adequate factual basis for Bogomol\u2019s guilty plea was not a clear or obvious error, as Bogomol acknowledges. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Alternatively, Bogomol asserts that this Court\u2019s conclusion that intrastate transmission of child pornography through interstate channels suffices to establish an interstate nexus is erroneous in light of <em>Bond </em>and that criminalization of such transmissions under \u00a7 2251 constitutes the prohibited exercise of a federal police power. He also argues, in the alternative, that plain error review should not apply to his forfeited objection to the factual basis for his plea. One panel -of this court may not overrule the decision of another absent a superseding <em>en banc </em>or Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 &amp; n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, Bogomol is correct that these issues are foreclosed. <em>See Dickson, </em>632 F.3d at 192; <em>Trejo, </em>610 F.3d at 313; <em>Run-yan, </em>290 F.3d at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance and, alternatively, for an extension of time to file an appellate brief, are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in-5th Cir.
