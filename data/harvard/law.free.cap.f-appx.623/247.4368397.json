She contends that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision to require corroborative evidence. Zhan also challenges the BIA\u2019s reliance on the IJ\u2019s determination that Zhan did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Finally, Zhan argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of her claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief based solely on the denial of her asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-22\">Because the BIA relied upon the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility decision, this court reviews both the IJ\u2019s decision and the order of the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir.2007). This court reviews findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 536. This court may not reverse factual findings unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. Among the findings of fact that this court reviews for substantial evidence is the \u201cfactual conclusion\u201d that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). Under this standard, reversal is improper unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">We conclude that Zhan\u2019s various claims of error are meritless. First, this court has rejected Zhan\u2019s contention that the BIA is not permitted to require corroboration. <em>See Rui Yang v. Holder, </em>664 F.3d 580, 585 (5th Cir.2011) (noting that even if an asylum applicant has testified credibly, the BIA may require an applicant to provide corroborating evidence of her claim for asylum). Here, the BIA determined that corroborative evidence was reasonably available but nevertheless not presented by Zhan. We will not disturb that determination. <em>See id. </em>at 587. As to Zhan\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT protection claims, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusions that the absence of corroborating evidence was fatal to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>claims as well. Finally, Zharis contention that the BIA erred in relying on the IJ\u2019s analysis of Zhan\u2019s well-founded fear of future persecution is simply not supported by the record. Rather, the record reflects that the BIA explicitly disclaimed any reliance on that aspect of the IJ\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Zharis petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
