Johnson claims the two-step drop was retaliation for a discrimination claim he settled in 2009. ' Both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">In 2009, Johnson filed the first of two complaints with the EEOC. The complaint alleged that Johnson\u2019s supervisor, Dr. Kimberly Summers reassigned duties from two white female employees to Johnson who is an African-American male. Accordingly, Johnson claimed that the reassignments constituted race and gender discrimination. On December 16, 2009, Johnson and his employer, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d), settled the complaint. Under the agreement, the Agency agreed to relieve Johnson of the added responsibilities in exchange for Johnson dropping his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">On November 16, 2011, almost two years after the settlement, Johnson received his yearly performance evaluation. The evaluation criticized Johnson for shirking responsibilities that were the center of the 2009 complaint and settlement. As a result, Johnson\u2019s immediate supervisor gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>him a \u201cfully successful\u201d rating, two steps below the \u201coutstanding\u201d rating he received in 2010. After Johnson pointed out that the evaluation faulted him for abandoning responsibilities that in fact were not his, Johnson\u2019s immediate supervisor recommended rating him \u201coutstanding.\u201d His supervisor\u2019s supervisor, Dr. Summers, allegedly refused to approve the better rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">This resulted in Johnson\u2019s second EEOC complaint. This time, in addition to alleging race and gender discrimination, Johnson asserted that Dr. Summers refused to approve a higher rating as retaliation for the 2009 complaint. Johnson alleges that the lower rating cost him a bonus and jeopardized prospective promotions. The complaint was later amended to add another retaliation claim after Johnson was again rated \u201cfully successful\u201d in 2012. Like the 2011 rating, Johnson asserted the 2012 rating was \u201cdue to the influence of Dr. Summers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">An administrative judge dismissed all of Johnson\u2019s claims. Because at least two years passed between the 2009 settlement and the \u201clow\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rating, the administrative judge held that no retaliatory motive could be inferred. Johnson then filed this lawsuit in federal district court. The government immediately moved to dismiss all Johnson\u2019s claims under Rule 12(b)(6). A magistrate judge recommended granting the motion for Johnson\u2019s discrimination claims and denying it for the retaliation claims. The district court dismissed all Johnson\u2019s claims. The court held that Johnson\u2019s \u201clow\u201d ratings were not an adverse employment action and, therefore, Johnson had not stated a retaliation claim. Johnson now appeals only the dismissal of his retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting as true all well-pleaded facts and viewing those facts most favorably to the plaintiff. <em>Warren v. Chesapeake Exploration, LLC, </em>759 F.3d 413, 415 (5th Cir. 2014). \u201cTo survive a [ ] motion to dismiss, plaintiff[ ] must plead enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Title VII imposes liability for retaliation against individuals who invoke its protections. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Retaliation claims have three elements: (1) the employee must engage in activity protected by Title VII, (2) the employer must take an adverse employment action against the employee, and (3) there must be a causal connection between that protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Douglas v. DynMcDermott Petroleum, Operations Co., </em>144 F.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir.1998). Johnson has not sufficiently pleaded facts that support the second and third elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">Johnson\u2019s brief asserts that as a result of being rated \u201cfully successful\u201d he was denied bonuses and promotions, which amounts to an adverse employment action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Johnson recognizes that this court has held a low performance evaluation alone is not an adverse employment action, <em>Douglas, </em>144 F.3d at 373 n. 11, but invites us to resolve a question we have previously left unanswered \u2014 whether a low evaluation coupled with other tangible effects (like denial of a bonus) is an adverse employment action. <em>Murray v. La-Div. of Admin. Office of Planning &amp; Budget, </em>439 Fed.Appx. 349, 351 (5th Cir.2011) (unpublished). We decline Johnson\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Even assuming that a low evaluation coupled with other tangible effects is an adverse employment action, Johnson\u2019s complaint is unspecific on what \u2014 if any\u2014 effect the \u201clow\u201d ratings had. It baldly asserts that the \u201clow\u201d rating resulted in loss of \u201cperformance awards\u201d and had a \u201cnegative impact on [his] ability to be promoted.\u201d The only <em>fact </em>supporting these allegations is that in 2010, when Johnson was rated \u201coutstanding,\u201d he received a bonus. But that says nothing about Johnson\u2019s entitlement to an award in 2011 or 2012. There is no indication that performance pay is automatic upon achieving a specified rating. Nor does Johnson allege that individuals who were rated \u201coutstanding\u201d in those years received bonuses. Consequently, Johnson\u2019s allegation that he was denied performance pay is speculative at best. Likewise, Johnson does not allege <em>any </em>facts suggesting that he was or will be denied promotions based on these ratings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Johnson also has not shown there' is a causal connection between the 2009 settlement and the \u201clow\u201d ratings. Johnson would have us infer a causal connection from the fact that Dr. Summers originally suggested the reassignment that formed the basis of the 2009 complaint and subsequently refused to approve an increased rating. Yet according to Johnson\u2019s own EEOC testimony,- the 2009 activity \u201cdid not involve Dr. Summers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 2009 complaint was actually lodged against a different doctor -who had supervisory responsibility, Dr. Melby. And it was Dr. Melby, not Dr. Summers, who signed the 2009 settlement. These facts suggest that Dr. Summers was likely oblivious to Johnson\u2019s 2009 complaint and negates any retaliatory motive on her part. <em>See Manning v. Chevron Chem. Co., LLC, </em>332 F.3d 874, 883 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cWe have determined that, in order to establish the causation prong of a retaliation claim, the employee should demonstrate that the employer knew about the employee\u2019s protected activity.\u201d) Even if Dr. Summers knew about the 2009 complaint, the nearly two year gap between the settlement and alleged retaliation also refutes any causal link between the two events. <em>See Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273-274, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (holding that a 20-month gap between protected activity and adverse employment action is insufficient evidence of causality).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">' Because \u2018Johnson\u2019s complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support his retaliation claim, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">. We have previously remarked that it is \"difficult to ascribe as low a \u2018fully satisfactory' rating.\u201d <em>Douglas v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., </em>144 F.3d 364, 373 n. 11 (5th Cir. 1998). The VA's rating system is essentially the same as the one at issue in <em>Douglas </em>and, accordingly, we do not consider Johnson\u2019s \u201cfully successful\u201d rating low. It is only \"low\u201d relative to Johnson\u2019s 2010 rating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">. This statement comes from the administrative judge\u2019s opinion, which the government attached to its motion to dismiss. \" \u2018Documents that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to her claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, </em>224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Venture Assocs. Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp., </em>987 F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir.1993)). Both requirements are met here. Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s EEOC complaint is part of his pleadings and may be considered in resolving this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
