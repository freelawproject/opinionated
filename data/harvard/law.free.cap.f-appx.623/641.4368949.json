He argues that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately explain its reasons for imposing the sentence and did not consider all of the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. He further argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). Chaires-Aguilar also appeals the concurrent 8-month sentences imposed upon revocation of his supervised release for his prior convictions for illegal reentry and transportation of an unlawful alien. He specifically argues that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Chaires-Aguilar did not object to the reasonableness of his illegal reentry sentence in district court; accordingly, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d 603, 620 (5th Cir.2013). Moreover, because ChairesAguilar did not specifically object to the procedural unreasonableness of his revocation sentence in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Kirklin, </em>701 F.3d 177, 178-79 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Regarding Chaires-Aguilar\u2019s challenge to the sentence imposed upon his conviction for illegal reentry, the record makes clear that the court considered all of \u201cthe evidence and arguments,\u201d and that it provided a \u201clegally sufficient\u201d explanation of the sentence when it noted that the sentence adequately addressed all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that the court had considered the guidelines in addition to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Chaires-Aguilar has not demonstrated that the district court committed any error, much less a clear or obvious error, in either explaining the sentence imposed or considering all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d at 620; <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 264 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Chaires-Aguilar has not demonstrated that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">We have previously rejected Chaires-Aguilar\u2019s argument that using prior convictions both to assess criminal history points and to support specific offense level enhancements renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Additionally, we have rejected his arguments that his sentence is unreasonable because (1) the sentence does not account for the relatively nonviolent nature of his illegal reentry offenses, (2) the sentence fails to reflect the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and (3) the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, lacks an empirical basis. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Moreover, the record also reflects that the district court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Chaires-Agui-lar\u2019s arguments in mitigation of his sentence, but rejected some of the arguments, concluded that the lower guidelines range was appropriate, and ultimately imposed a below-guidelines sentence based on Chaires-Aguilar\u2019s request to receive credit for time spent in the custody of immigration officials. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we decline Chaires-Aguilar\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>invitation to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Chaires-Aguilar\u2019s general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his below-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Pacheco-Alvarado, </em>782 F.3d 213, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2015), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 29, 2015) (15-5037); <em>United States v. Murray, </em>648 F.3d 251, 258 (5th Cir.2011). ChairesAguilar has not demonstrated that the district court committed error, plain or otherwise, by sentencing him to a below-guidelines, 56-month prison term and, thus, has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Regarding Chaires-Aguilar\u2019s challenge to his revocation sentence, the record reflects that the district court considered the appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors as well as the policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Culbertson, </em>712 F.3d 235, 239-40 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65 (recognizing that implicit consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors is sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 3553(c)\u2019s requirement that the district court provide reasons for an above guidelines sentence). Also, because Chaires-Aguilar\u2019s revocation sentence fell at the bottom of the advisory range for each count of conviction, it is entitled to an appellate presumption of reasonableness, which he has not rebutted. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008) (holding that consecutive revocation sentence that fell squarely within the guidelines range was presumptively reasonable). Chaires-Aguilar has not shown clear or obvious error. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>Kirklin, </em>701 F.3d at 178-79. Nor has he demonstrated that any error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
