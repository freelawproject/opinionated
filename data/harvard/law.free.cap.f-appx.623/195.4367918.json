In addition, his supervised release term for a previous illegal-reentry conviction was revoked, and he received a within-guidelines sentence of 12 months of imprisonment to be served consecutively. Uribes-Guardiola has timely appealed each case, and the cases have been consolidated on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Uribes-Guardiola contends that his combined sentence is longer than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and. is therefore substantively unreasonable. He argues that his sentence is too long for an offense that he contends amounts to an international trespass because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the illegal-reentry Guideline, lacks an empirical basis and gives too much weight to prior convictions rather than the offense conduct. He asserts that permitting the court to rely on a remote conviction that did receive criminal history points to \u201cimpose a dramatically higher sentence\u201d for illegal reentry \u201cundermines respect for the law and results in greater punishment than is just.\u201d He also argues that his sentence fails to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for returning to the United States, which he contends \u201cmitigates the seriousness of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">This court assesses the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must make an individualized assessment based on the facts of the case in light of \u00a7 3553(a) and impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the goals of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">As Uribes-Guardiola recognizes, his argument that we should not apply the reasonableness presumption because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, <em>see United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009), but he raises the issue to preserve it for further appeal. We have also previously rejected arguments that the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is simply a nonviolent international trespass that is treated too harshly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 682-83 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Furthermore, as to his contention challenging \u201cwhether the measure of the seriousness of the offense itself should be driven by a prior conviction that is excluded from the measure of the seriousness of his criminal history,\u201d the Guidelines expressly contemplate such a scenario. Section 2L1.2 instructs that, when the defendant previously was deported after certain types of convictions, the court should \u201cincrease by 16 levels if the conviction receives criminal history points ... or by 12 levels if the conviction does not receive criminal history points.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Insofar as he is arguing that the 12-level increase has resulted in a sentence that is unjust, Uribes-Guardiola has not identified any authority to overturn the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>in-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The district court in this case considered Uribes-Guardiola\u2019s arguments, concluded that the applicable guidelines ranges were reasonable, and imposed sentences within those ranges. Uribes-Guardiola\u2019s contention that his total sentence does not reflect his personal history and characteristics does not establish that his combined sentence fails to account for a \u00a7 3553(a) factor, \u201cgives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or [ ] represents a clear error of judgment in balancing [the] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). The district court was in <em>a </em>superior position to find facts and assess their import under \u00a7 3553(a), and this court will not, as Uribes-Guardiola seems to urge, reweigh the district court\u2019s assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Ur-ibes-Guardiola\u2019s assertions are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See-Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-30; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Accordingly, the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
