He argues that the district court erred by providing an incorrect jury instruction regarding the elements of excessive force. Williams contends that the district court\u2019s inclusion of the provision that prison officials are given deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that they believe are necessary to address issues of internal order and security was improper because the applicable standard is whether the use of force was done in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or to cause harm maliciously and sadistically. Because Williams did not raise this issue in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See Tex. Beef Group v. Winfrey, </em>201 F.3d 680, 689 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The jury instruction issued by the district court was appropriate. The instruction parallels the pattern jury instruction for a claim of excessive force and is a correct statement of law. <em>See </em>Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction (Civil) \u00a7 10.7 (2014); <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d 325, 354 (5th Cir.2009). The provision at issue comports with Supreme Court authority and our precedent. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992); <em>Baldwin v. Stalder, </em>137 F.3d 836, 840 (5th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s use of the pattern jury instruction does not rise to the level of clear or obvious error. <em>See Jimenez v. Wood County, Tex., </em>660 F.3d 841, 847 (5th Cir.2011). Thus, Williams has not shown that the district court plainly erred in giving the jury instruction on excessive force. <em>See Tex. Beef Group, </em>201 F.3d at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
