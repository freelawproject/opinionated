Sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment, he did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Proceeding pro se, Briseno challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motions in 2014 to dismiss the indictment, conviction, and sentence, for lack of exclusive legislative and subject-matter jurisdiction. He asserts the indictment did not confer jurisdiction, and the Government failed to establish federal jurisdiction. In support, Briseno contends the Government did not prove he was in a territory or possession of the United States at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">We conclude Briseno\u2019s challenge is \u201cfrom the denial of [ ] meaningless, unauthorized motion[s]\u201d the district court was without jurisdiction to consider. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). The primary means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence is a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>E.g., Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). The district court could not construe Briseno\u2019s motions as arising under \u00a7 2255 without: giving him notice of its intent to characterize the motions as \u00a7 2255 motions; warning that such a characterization would restrict his ability to file future \u00a7 2255 motions; and allowing him the opportunity to withdraw or amend. <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Additionally, as the court noted, the motions could not be construed as arising under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), as Briseno asserted, because that rule does not govern criminal proceedings. Moreover, although his motions claimed the court lacked jurisdiction over the criminal proceedings, Briseno\u2019s criminal matters were no longer pending when he filed the motions; therefore, they were not authorized under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
