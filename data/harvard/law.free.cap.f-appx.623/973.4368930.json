In 2009 James was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery, five counts of robbery, and five counts of brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, and sentenced to 1,017 months in prison. James argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing regarding his claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the plea-bargaining stage. In particular, he argues that counsel failed to relay the government\u2019s plea offers and failed to properly advise him about the plea offers or that he faced the possibility of a much longer sentence if convicted at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding for an abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United </em>States, 291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2002). \u201cIn a section 2255 proceeding, the district court must accord the movant an evidentiary hearing unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>no relief.\u201d <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>948 F.2d 704, 706 (11th Cir.1991) (alteration adopted) (quotation omitted). Thus, if a movant \u201calleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, then the district court should order an evidentiary hearing and rule on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 714-15 (quotation omitted). On the other hand, \u201cthe district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing [if] the petitioner\u2019s allegations are affirmatively contradicted by the record, or the claims are patently frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">To demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s assistance was constitutionally defective, a movant must allege facts showing that: (1) his counsel \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Once a court has determined that the movant fails to establish either the performance or prejudice prong, it need not address the other prong. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. Applying the prejudice prong in the context of a rejected plea agreement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-6\">a defendant must show that but for the ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the court <em>(i.e., </em>that the defendant would have accepted the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening circumstances), that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer\u2019s terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\"><em>Lafler v. Cooper, </em>566 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1385, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Here, even assuming deficient performance, there is no reasonable probability that James would have accepted a plea offer. In his habeas petition, James alleged that his attorney \u201cfailed to relay, explain, and/or advise [him] as to the risk(s) and/or benefits to accepting or rejecting [the] plea offers.\u201d As the Magistrate Judge noted, however, \u201cthe thrust of the Movant\u2019s argument is not that he was left uninformed of the plea offers,\u201d but that his counsel\u2019s advice was insufficient. In fact, James does not challenge the government\u2019s response that \u201cMovant acknowledges that he was aware of the Government\u2019s plea offers.\u201d Thus, we focus on whether James was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient advice regarding the government\u2019s offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">The only particular fact that James says he did not know and that would have changed his pleading decision was \u201cthe potential maximum sentence [he] faced upon conviction, including the 960 months of consecutive [sentences] mandated by statute for the firearms convictions.\u201d However, at the arraignment for his superseding indictment, the government specifically stated that James faced \u201ca maximum of 20 years in prison\u201d on Counts 1, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21, \u201ca consecutive seven years up to life in prison\u201d on Count 14, and \u201ca consecutive 25 years up to life in prison\u201d on each of Counts 16, 18, 20, and 22. When asked whether he \u201cunderst[oo]d the charges against [him] and the penalties [he was] facing,\u201d he answered \u201cyes, sir.\u201d In short, despite any of the alleged failures by his counsel, James was aware of the plea offers from the government, and the record clearly shows that he was aware of the potential maximum consecutive sentences he faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">Beyond that, we have held that \u201c[g]iven [a defendant\u2019s] awareness of the plea offer, his after the fact testimony concerning his desire to plead, without more, is insufficient to establish that but for counsel\u2019s alleged advice or inaction, he would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>accepted the plea offer.\u201d <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 835 (11th Cir.1991). Here, James cites no evidence that he expressed a desire to plead guilty prior to his conviction at trial. In fact, James maintained his innocence throughout his case, and even stated under oath during his sentencing hearing that he was innocent of the charges and that the government\u2019s primary -witness had lied to secure his conviction. Although not dispositive, a defendant\u2019s \u201cclaim that he would have ple[aded] guilty had he been properly informed is ... undermined by his repeated claims of innocence.\u201d <em>Osley v. United States, </em>751 F.3d 1214,1224 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The district court did not err when it found that the record contradicted James\u2019s assertion that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s deficient performance at the plea-bargaining stage. The court therefore did not err in denying James\u2019s petition and did not abuse its discretion when it refused his request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">. James raised other claims in his \u00a7 2255 motion and the district court ultimately granted a certificate of appealability for all of his claims. On appeal, however, James only argues his plea-offer claim. He has therefore abandoned his other claims. <em>See Pope v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>680 F.3d 1271, 1295 n. 17 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that a habeas petitioner abandoned issues contained in the COA but not mentioned on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
