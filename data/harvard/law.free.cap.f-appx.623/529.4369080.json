He further argues that this appeal should be vacated and the case remanded with the instruction that the District Court determine whether he qualifies as a career offender in light of the Supreme Court decisions of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), and <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-24\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). The grounds upon which the court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are narrow. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). For a defendant to be eligible for such a reduction, the Sentencing Commission must have amended the guideline at issue, that amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and the amendment must also be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-25\">\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>ed States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (noting that a defendant is not eligible for reduction, even if the amendment is listed in subsection (d), if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Amendment 782 may serve, when applicable, as the basis for a sentence reduction. See'U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). Effective November 1, 2014, Amendment 782 provides a two-level reduction in base offense levels for most drug quantities listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Section 3582(c)(2) does not grant the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentenc-ing issues, including collateral attacks on a sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The District Court did not err in denying Allen\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion for a reduction of his sentence. Allen was not eligible for a.reduction in sentence because Amendment 782 did not have the effect of reducing his sentence range under the Guidelines due to his status as a career offender and the operation of \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) &amp; comment. (n.l(A)). Although Allen contends that the court never explicitly concluded that he qualified as a career offender, the presentence report, which framed the issues to be resolved at sentencing, expressly stated that Allen qualified as a career offender, and the court adopted the report\u2019s factual findings and Guidelines applications without objection. Moreover, his argument is precluded by our appellate decision that he qualified as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>333 Fed.Appx. 448, 449 (11th Cir. 2009); <em>see also Anderson, </em>772 F.3d at 668-69. Finally, his argument based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Descamps </em>is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
