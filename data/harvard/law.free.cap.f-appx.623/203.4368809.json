By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Bush is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-21\">Bush argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. He raises multiple challenges to his original sentencing, arguing that the district court committed procedural error by making an upward variance without calculating his guidelines sentence range and committed substantive error by not properly considering his criminal history and erroneously calculating the drug quantity for which he was responsible. He maintains that he did not commit any crime because the indictment did not specify a drug quantity and the Government never proved any quantity of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-22\">Bush\u2019s challenges to his conviction and original sentence are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. \u25a0 <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s implicit ruling that Bush was eligible for a sentence reduction and its finding that his original sentence was within his new guidelines range were correct. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7); U.S.S.G., Ch. 5, Pt. A. The district court denied Bush\u2019s motion as a matter of discretion, specifically citing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors of the nature and circumstances of the offense and protection of the public. Bush has not shown that this decision was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-24\">Bush\u2019s appeal does not present a non-frivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
