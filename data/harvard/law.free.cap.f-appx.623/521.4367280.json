Trejo challenges the eight-level enhancement of his sentence for threatening to inflict injury on a person to obstruct justice. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(l)(B) (Nov. 2014). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The district court enhanced Trejo\u2019s sentence based on his factual proffer that he twice posted on Instagram personal information about and \u201cthreats\u201d to an informant scheduled to testify against Trejo\u2019s friend, Oscar Diaz. Trejo, who had been Diaz\u2019s friend since childhood and lent him a vehicle that he used to transport illegal drugs, knew Diaz was facing a trial at which the informant would be a witness. Trejo posted on his Instagram account, \u201cMIAMIHEATJBULLIES,\u201d a photograph and the home address of the informant, a description and license number of his vehicle, and comments that identified him as a \u201csnitch\u201d and that warned of \u201cconsequences.\u201d The information was directed to the informant\u2019s Instagram account and to followers of Trejo\u2019s account. Trejo also posted \u201csimilar threats to the [informant]\u201d on a second Instagram account named \u201csnitch_killa305.\u201d Two days later, federal agents interviewed Trejo, instructed him to cease any involvement in the Diaz investigation, and warned him that he would be questioned if any witness in the investigation was threatened or harmed. The next day, Trejo reposted on his Instagram account the same material about the informant and a \u201c[shout out] to agent Adam and Agent Mila, I don\u2019t do anything illegal so f* *. * you and your investigation.\u201d Agents arrested Trejo, who admitted that he posted personal information about the informant and that he intended to smash the window of the informant\u2019s vehicle. Trejo agreed to contact an associate, and during a telephone call recorded by federal agents, Trejo and the associate discussed a prior effort to assault the informant. Later, Trejo\u2019s employer notified agents that he had found a 5.7 caliber pistol in Trejo\u2019s lunch bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Trejo threatened the informant to dissuade him from assisting in Diaz\u2019s prosecution. A defendant is subject to an eight-level increase of his base offense level if his \u201coffense involved causing or threatening to cause physical injury to a person, or property damage, in order to obstruct the administration of justice.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(l)(B). In the light of Trejo\u2019s admissions, the district court reasonably interpreted two comments Trejo posted that, \u201cIf you see this guy you already know what time it is,\u201d and \u201cPeople think they can snitch on people and the[re] won\u2019t be any consequences,\u201d as threatening that the informant was \u201cgoing to get beaten up or something [would] happen to [him].\u201d The district court also reasonably perceived as \u201cthreatening\u201d the names of Trejo\u2019s Instagram account, \u201cMIAMI-HEATJBULLIES,\u201d and the second account that he used, \u201csnitchJdlla305.\u201d And the district court was entitled to find that Trejo intended to coerce the informant to cease cooperating with authorities because Trejo posted the comments while aware that the informant was scheduled to testify at Diaz\u2019s trial; Trejo flaunted a willingness to defy the law by making an audacious comment to investigating agents; and Tre-jo admitted at sentencing that \u201chis actions were intended to intimidate the informant.\u201d The evidence supports the decision to apply the eight-level increase to Trejo\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">We AFFIRM Trejo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
