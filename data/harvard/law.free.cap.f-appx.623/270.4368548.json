By moving to proceed IFP, Aonzo is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-23\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a sentence may be modified if it is based on a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The district court did not err in concluding that Aon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>zo\u2019s range was not lowered by amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Alonzo has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
