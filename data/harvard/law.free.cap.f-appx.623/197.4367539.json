On appeal, he argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As Aguilar-Osorto raised this objection below, our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>A sentence imposed within a properly-calculated guidelines range is accorded a presumption of reasonableness and is rebutted only if the district court fails to consider a significant factor, gives weight to an irrelevant factor, or clearly errs in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Aguilar-Osorto\u2019s empirical basis challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We have rejected the argument that a sentence imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is greater than necessary to meet the \u00a7 3553(a) goals as a result of any double counting inherent in that Guideline, <em>see Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31, as well as the argument that illegal reentry is merely an international trespass offense, <em>see United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Aguilar-Osorto\u2019s remaining arguments are nothing more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which is insufficient to show the court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
