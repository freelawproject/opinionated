The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>court denied Duran-Arias\u2019s request for a downward departure or variance and sentenced him within the advisory guidelines range to 24 months in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of nonreport-ing supervised release. Duran-Arias argues on appeal that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue at sentencing the points that were raised in the defense sentencing memorandum, failing to request specific relief, and failing to object on the record at sentencing to preserve Duran-Arias\u2019s appellate arguments. In addition, Duran-Arias complains that his trial counsel\u2019s reference to his client\u2019s alcohol addiction in the request for a below-guidelines sentence constituted ineffective assistance because it was an improper basis for a downward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">This court generally does not review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). We have \u201cundertaken to resolve claims of inadequate representation on direct appeal only in rare cases where the record allowed us to evaluate fairly the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987). In most instances, we qualify a claim as a \u201crare case\u201d warranting review only when it was raised and developed in a post-trial motion to the district court. <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 245 (5th Cir.2007). Duran-Arias did not raise these ineffective assistance claims in the district court at any time. Because the record is not sufficiently developed to allow for a fair consideration of these claims, we decline to consider them on direct appeal without prejudice to Duran-Arias\u2019s right to raise them on collateral review. <em>See Isgar, </em>739 F.3d at 841. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
