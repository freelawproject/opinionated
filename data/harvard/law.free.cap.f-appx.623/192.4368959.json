HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Vincent \u00c9. Beasley pled guilty to sexual assault and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Beasley filed a habeas petition and a motion for release pending review of his habeas petition in district court. The district court denied his motion for release, denied a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), and administratively closed his habeas case pending this appeal. Beasley now (1) moves for a COA on his motion for release, (2) appeals the denial of his motion for release, and (3) moves for his release pending appeal. An order denying a motion for release is not a final order for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1), so Beasley does not need a COA to appeal. <em>See Harbison v. Bell, </em>556 U.S. 180, 183, 129 S.Ct. 1481, 173 L.Ed.2d 347 (2009). His motion for a COA is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">Release should be granted to a prisoner pending postconviction habeas review \u201conly when the [applicant] has raised substantial constitutional claims upon which he has a high probability of success, and also when extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.\u201d <em>Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974). Examples of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d include the \u201cserious deterioration of the [applicant\u2019s] health while incarcerated, ... short sentences for relatively minor crimes so near completion that extraordinary action is essential to make collateral review truly effective, ... or possibly extraordinary delay in processing a habeas corpus petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702 n. 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-20\">We need not address the merits of Beasley\u2019s claim \u2014 an issue still before the district court \u2014 because he has not shown the existence of any \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d requiring his release. The district court did not err by denying his motion for release. <em>See id. </em>at 703. We AFFIRM. To the extent Beasley moved this court for his release pending appeal, we DENY his motion for the same reason.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
