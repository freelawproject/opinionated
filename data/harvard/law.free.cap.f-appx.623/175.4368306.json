He did not present these claims in his brief to the BIA, however; and it noted he failed to address these findings. Because these claims are unexhausted, we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 318 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 321 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-22\">Additionally, Oli challenges the IJ and BIA\u2019s credibility determinations in denying the relief requested here. Because the BIA relied upon the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations, we may review the findings of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). An IJ\u2019s credibility determination is reviewed for substantial evidence, and must be upheld unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. Accordingly, \u201cif the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations are supported by the record, they will be affirmed\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The IJ \u201cmay rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (emphasis in original); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-23\">Oli contends the IJ and BIA failed to consider the totality of the circumstances which, he asserts, support: a credible allegation of past persecution based on a protected basis; and, a reasonable fear of future persecution, including in violation of the CAT. He maintains, <em>inter alia, </em>his justifications for obtaining a passport and his description of his wife\u2019s beating at the hands of Maoists were not inconsistent. Furthermore, Oli asserts that, even if his testimony and documentary evidence con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tained inconsistencies, any such discrepancies were not apparent, and the IJ was required to give him an opportunity to explain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The IJ and BIA applied the proper standard in determining whether Oli\u2019s allegations were credible. Although Oli relies upon alternative explanations for his testimony and documentary evidence to clarify the inconsistencies and discrepancies, and maintains some problems may have resulted from translation issues, these assertions do not compel the conclusion that no reasonable trier of fact could have found him incredible. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
