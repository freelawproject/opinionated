Martinez-Haro contends that his sentences are greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and thus are substantively unreasonable. Specifically, he argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the sentencing guideline pertaining to illegal reentry offenses, lacks an empirical basis and thus overstates the seriousness of his offense. As he concedes, however, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir. 2009). Martinez-Haro additionally asserts that his sentences are greater than necessary to provide adequate deterrence or protect the public and that they fail to properly reflect his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-22\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A \u201csentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). The presumption of reasonableness is only rebutted by \u201ca showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing [the \u00a7 3553(a) ] sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-23\">The record reflects that the district court listened to and rejected Martinez-Haro\u2019s arguments in favor of a downward variance and imposed sentences at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range. Therefore, Martinez-Haro\u2019s sentences are presumptively reasonable. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338. In imposing sentence, the district court adopted the findings of the presentence report (PSR), which contained a recitation of Martinez-Haro\u2019s criminal history, including his prior felony conviction for indecent liberties with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>a child, as well as a lengthy discussion of his personal history and characteristics. Although Martinez-Haro disputed the factual basis of his indecent liberties conviction, he offered no evidence that the information contained in the PSR lacked an evidentiary basis or was otherwise unreliable. <em>See United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 173-74 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Martinez-Haro does not show that the district court abused its discretion in either its consideration or balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. Rather, he merely complains that the district court should have weighed those factors in his favor. We will not second-guess the reasonable determinations of the district court, which \u201cis in a superior position to find facts and judge them import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Heard, </em>709 F.3d 413, 435 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. As Martinez-Haro fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness, he cannot demonstrate that his sentences are substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
