We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Sarat-Agustin received proper notice of the removal hearing; he personally received the Notice to Appear, which was written in English and contained notice of the removal healing, and was orally advised of the hearing in a language that he understood. Accordingly, he had to file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the date of entry of his order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(4)(h). He failed to do so and failed to establish changed country conditions in Guatemala that would permit him to file an untimely motion to reopen. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i). He has therefore failed to demonstrate any abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion to reopen. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Sarat-Agustin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
