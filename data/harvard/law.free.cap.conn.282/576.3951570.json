The defendant, the Greater New York Mutual Insurance Company, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court ordering the defendant to pay attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the plaintiff, the ACMAT Corporation, in successfully prosecuting this declaratory judgment action to establish the existence of a certain insurance policy. We decline to adopt this new exception to the American rule, and we, therefore, conclude that the trial court improperly awarded the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of a statutory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>contractual provision authorizing such an award, or a finding of bad faith conduct by the defendant. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history, much of which is set forth in the Appellate Court opinion with respect to the merits of this case. \u201cIn 1950, Waldvogel Brothers, Inc., a New York corporation, loaned money to Henry Nozko, Sr., to form Acoustical Materials Corporation, a business engaged in the installation of acoustical ceilings in commercial buildings. Located in East Hartford, Acoustical Materials Corporation was a subsidiary corporation of Waldvogel Brothers, Inc., until 1969, when Waldvogel Brothers, Inc., was dissolved. Nozko purchased the stock of Acoustical Materials Coiporation and, in 1972, changed its name to ACMAT Corporation. Since 1988, the plaintiff has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits by individuals alleging bodily injuries, dating back to the 1950s, that resulted from exposure to asbestos in the plaintiffs workplaces. Facing potentially serious liability, the plaintiff undertook an exhaustive search of its records to ascertain whether [the defendant] provided insurance coverage applicable to the injuries that formed the basis of the lawsuits. Although the plaintiff was unable to locate any insurance policies issued by [the defendant], it did discover, among other documents, a certificate of insurance, signed by an authorized representative of [the defendant], that listed Acoustical Materials Corporation as the named insured. The certificate indicated that Acoustical Materials Corporation had in effect with [the defendant], through January 1,1966, a products liability and comprehensive general liability policy (number 17-C3-C00627) with bodily injury limits of $500,000 per person and $1 million per accident. Confronted with the certificate and a request that it participate in the plaintiffs defense in the asbestos lawsuits, [the defendant] conducted its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>own search for evidence of the policy, following which it denied that the policy ever existed and refused to tender a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u201cIn light of [the defendant\u2019s] refusal, the plaintiff filed this action seeking, inter alia, declarations that [the defendant] had issued to Acoustical Materials Corporation an insurance policy that provided comprehensive general liability and products liability coverage with liability limits of $500,000 per person and $1 million per accident, and that the policy was in full force and effect during the period from January 1, 1964, to January 1, 1968.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its answer, [the defendant] denied the policy\u2019s existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u201cFollowing a two day trial to the court, at which the plaintiff called five witnesses and introduced several exhibits, the court issued a memorandum of decision, declaring in relevant part: \u2018The court declares, by way of this judgment, that the defendant . . . issued to the plaintiff ... an insurance policy numbered 17-C3-C00627 which provided comprehensive general liability and product liability coverage to [the plaintiff], with the policy in effect beginning January 1,1965, to January 1, 1966, and it also provided limits to its liability of $500,000 per person and $1 million per accident. This policy and/or its similar predecessors and successors were validly issued by the defendant ... to the plaintiff . . . and were in full force and effect from January 1, 1964, through January 1, 1968.\u2019 \u201d <em>ACMAT Corp. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>88 Conn. App. 471, 473-75, 869 A.2d 1254, cert, denied, 274 Conn. 903, 876 A.2d 11 (2005). The defendant appealed, and the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>late Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion with the trial court seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant objected to the motion, claiming, inter alia, that: (1) attorney\u2019s fees are not available under the declaratory judgment statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-29;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) the request was untimely under Practice Book \u00a7 11-21. The trial court granted the plaintiffs motion, and awarded it $126,153.50 for attorney\u2019s fees expended in prosecuting the action in federal court; see footnote 2 of this opinion; as well as in the state trial and appellate courts. Subsequent rulings by the trial court indicated that it reasoned that the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the plaintiff in prosecuting the declaratory judgment action amounted to damages caused by the defendant\u2019s breach of its duty under the policy to defend the plaintiff. This appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">On appeal, the defendant, supported by the amicus curiae, the Complex Insurance Claims Litigation Association, claims that the trial court\u2019s award violates the well established American rule, namely, \u201cthat attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception . . . [or] bad faith conduct of the other party or the other party\u2019s attorney.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Broadnax </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>270 Conn. 133, 178, 851 A.2d 1113 (2004). The defendant contends that the award is improper because \u00a7 52-29 does not authorize attorney\u2019s fees in declaratory judgment actions, and there was no finding of \u201cbad faith\u201d to justify the award. In response, the plaintiff emphasizes the \u201cspecial relationship between insured and insurer arising from the uniquely unequal bargaining positions of the parties,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and contends that we should follow the lead of those states that have adopted an exception to the American rule, requiring an insurer that has refused to defend its insured to pay the insured\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant responds by relying on our decisions in <em>Bodner </em>v. <em>United Services Automobile Assn., </em>222 Conn. 480, 610 A.2d 1212 (1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>and Burr </em>v. <em>Lichtenheim, </em>190 Conn. 351, 460 A.2d 1290 (1983), in support of its argument that nothing in the present case justifies the creation of a new exception to the American rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u201cIt is well established that we review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. . . . This standard applies to the amount of fees awarded . . . and also to the trial court\u2019s determination of the factual predicate justifying the award. . . . Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, [w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker v. Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 252-53, 828 A.2d 64 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u201cThe general rule of law known as the American rule is that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception. . . . This rule is generally followed throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. . . Connecticut adheres to the American rule. . . . There are few exceptions. For example, a specific contractual term may provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and costs ... or a statute may confer such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. . . This court also has recognized a bad faith exception to the American rule, which permits a court to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party on the basis of bad faith conduct of the other party or the other party\u2019s attorney.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Broadnax </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, supra, 270 Conn. 178; id., 178-79 (trial court properly denied motion for attorney\u2019s fees in declaratory judgment action challenging practice of \u201cunderfilling\u201d positions in city\u2019s fire department); see also <em>Maris </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>269 Conn. 834, 844, 850 A.2d 133 (2004) (\u201c[i]t is generally accepted that the court has the inherent authority to assess attorney\u2019s fees when the losing party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 77, 80, 203 A.2d 294 (1964) (trial court properly denied plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees in declaratory judgment action against city\u2019s public utility commission because \u201c[n]either the statutes nor the rules provide for an allowance for counsel fees in declaratory judgment actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Neither party has identified a statutory or contractual basis for the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees in this declaratory judgment action, and the trial court failed to find bad faith with respect to the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The propriety of the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees turns, therefore, on whether we should follow the lead of those of our sister states that recognize a common-law exception to the American rule allowing for the award of attorney\u2019s fees when the insured party prevails in a declaratory judgment action against its insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The parties\u2019 comprehensive briefs, and our independent research, indicate that our sister states take a variety of common-law and statutory approaches to this issue. Presently, seven states, specifically, Alabama, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico and Tennessee, follow the American rule strictly, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>have not yet adopted any common-law exceptions allowing for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees to policyholders that are successful in coverage actions against their insurance companies.

Similarly, Massachusetts has limited the exception to declaratory judgment actions intended to establish the insurer\u2019s duty to defend, and not its duty to indemnify. See <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Citation Ins.

Failure of the person or insurer to defend any such action shall be deemed prima facie evidence that its failure to make payment was vexatious and without reasonable cause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Finally, we find instructive this court\u2019s decision in <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Lichtenheim, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 363-64, which concluded that the trial court improperly awarded an insured party attorney\u2019s fees that he had incurred in an action brought to enforce an indemnity agreement. Emphasizing that the issue therein was not the recover-ability of fees incurred in the defense of the underlying litigation, the court noted that, in the context of indemnification, in the absence of a contractual provision to the contrary, \u201c[t]he general rule is that . . . allowance of fees is limited to the defense of the claim which was indemnified and does not extend to services rendered in establishing the right to indemnification.\u201d Id., 363. Because the contract language at issue in that case \u201callow[ed] no reasonable interpretation other than that attorney\u2019s fees would be limited to defense of the original action\u201d; id., 364; this court concluded that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>court had improperly awarded the policyholder attorney\u2019s fees. Id.; accord <em>Bodner </em>v. <em>United Services Automobile Assn., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 499 (\u201cthere is no discernible reason of public policy why uninsured motorist coverage should impliedly encompass a claimant\u2019s right to recover attorney\u2019s fees for pursuit of a claim against his own insurer that is premised on the egregious misconduct of the third party tortfeasor\u201d). It would be inconsistent with our conclusion in <em>Burr, </em>which involved an indemnification claim, to establish a broad new exception to the American rule in declaratory judgment actions with respect to the duty to defend. See <em>Mountain West Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, 315 Mont. 244 (decrying \u201cthe arbitrary legal fiction that a substantive distinction exists between a breach of the duty to defend and the breach of the duty to indemnify\u201d). Thus, because the trial court in the present case found that the plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant had acted in bad faith, and there is no claim of a statutory or contractual basis for the attorney\u2019s fee award, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we granted the plaintiffs motion to transfer the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> The plaintiff initially brought this declaratory judgment action in federal District Court.
