The plaintiff, Debra Hummel, sought survivor\u2019s benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 following the death of her husband, Henry Hummel, an employee of the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>defendant, Marten Transport, Ltd. (Marten). The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fifth district (commissioner) found that the plaintiff was entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits but did not determine the amount of benefits to which she was entitled. Marten and its insurer, the defendant Crawford and Company,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding of compensability. The defendants appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court, which dismissed the appeal on the ground that the decision of the board was not a final judgment because the board had not determined the amount of benefits to be paid. <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>90 Conn. App. 9, 14, 15, 875 A.2d 575 (2005). We granted the parties\u2019 petitions for certification to appeal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court properly had dismissed the defendants\u2019 appeal. <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>275 Conn. 913, 882 A.2d 671 (2005). On appeal to this court, the parties claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the decision of the board is not an appealable final judgment for purposes of \u00a7 31-301b. The parties also claim that, if the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the decision of the board is not a final judgment, the legislature effectively has overruled our precedent incorporating a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b by virtue of its enactment of \u00a7 1-2z because the plain language of \u00a7 31-30 lb does not contain such a requirement. The parties further contend that, even if the legislature has not overruled our precedent importing a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b, we should do so because there is no indication that the legislature intended to impose that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>jurisdictional requirement on workers\u2019 compensation appeals. We reject the parties\u2019 claims and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The following facts and procedural history are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThe commissioner found the following facts [in connection with the plaintiffs claim for survivor\u2019s benefits]. The plaintiffs husband, Henry Hummel, was a cross-country driver of an eighteen wheel tractor trailer for Marten. He was found dead in the sleeper cab of his truck on November 25,1997. He had returned home from a cross-country trip early in the afternoon of November 24, 1997, looking dirty, tired and agitated. He had a heated dispute with a Marten official over the telephone about whether he was entitled to be paid following an apparent problem with the paperwork that he had submitted earlier. [According to the plaintiff] she had known her late husband for more than thirty years and had never seen him in such an agitated state. She feared he would have a heart attack. Following a shower and some rest, he left home between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. He parked near his drop off point in Waterbury so that he could sleep and then drop off his load early the next morning. He died in the sleeper cab before morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u201cThe commissioner also found that Marten had urged Henry Hummel to drive as much as possible. [Henry Hummel] falsified his log books to hide from the transportation authorities the number of hours he drove. On the three week trip completed shortly before his death, he had driven an average of 569 miles per day, and it was not unusual for him to drive 5000 miles in a week. He slept only two or three hours a day and never exercised. He did not eat a proper diet, nor did he eat on a regular schedule. He was a lifelong smoker and sometimes used cigars to wake himself up by burning his fingers when he fell asleep while driving. He was sixty-four years old at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cThe commissioner concluded that \u2018[t]he stress of [Henry Hummel\u2019s] job and its limitations on his time for other activities [were] . . . substantial factorfs] in the chain of events which led to [his] fatal ischemic heart disease.\u2019 The commissioner accordingly ordered the payment of benefits pursuant to ... \u00a7 31-306, which provides for the manner in which benefits are paid to dependents following death resulting from an accident or occupational disease. The commissioner did not determine the amount of benefits to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u201cThe defendants appealed to the board, claiming that the plaintiff [had] failed to prove within a reasonable degree of medical probability that [Henry Hummel\u2019s] employment was a substantial factor in the cause of his death. The board reviewed all of the testimony, including that of two medical experts, and concluded that an adequate evidentiary basis existed for the commissioner\u2019s finding of compensability. The board did not issue a remand order from its decision despite the [commissioner\u2019s] failure to determine the amount of the award. Thereafter, the defendants appealed to [the Appellate Court], raising the same sufficiency of the evidence claim.\u201d <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Following the defendants\u2019 appeal to the Appellate Court, it came to the attention of that court that, after the board upheld the commissioner\u2019s finding of compensability and did not issue a remand order to determine the specific amount of benefits, \u201cthe plaintiff . . . brought [a] separate proceeding [before the commissioner] to determine, among other things, the amount of benefits to be paid. In addition to the calculation of [survivor\u2019s] benefits, the plaintiff sought an order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (f)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>dants pay her benefits [during the pendency of] this appeal and sought the imposition of penalties under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 31-303. The commissioner entered the \u00a7 31-301 (f) order and held open the issue of penalties. The defendants responded by raising the issue of whether, under General Statutes [Rev. to 1997] \u00a7 31-307 (e),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> any benefits to which the plaintiff was entitled would be offset by social security old age insurance benefits that the defendants claim the plaintiff receives. After the commissioner issued his decision, the board heard another appeal on the issues related to the award, penalties and offsets, and issued a remand order for a final calculation of benefits.\u201d Id., 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In light of the separate benefits proceeding, which was ongoing, the Appellate Court, sua sponte, raised the issue of whether the defendants had appealed from a final judgment. Thereafter, both the plaintiff and the defendants appeared before the Appellate Court for oral argument on the defendants\u2019 appeal and argued that the board\u2019s decision from which the defendants were appealing was an appealable final judgment under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>273 Conn. 97, 868 A.2d 54 (2005).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Appellate Court disagreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>and, accordingly, dismissed the defendants\u2019 appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 14, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We granted the parties\u2019 petitions for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss this appeal for lack of a final judgment?\u201d <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 913. The case originally was argued before a panel of five justices. At that time, both the plaintiff and the defendants maintained that the Appellate Court incorrectly had concluded that the decision of the board does not constitute a final judgment. Thereafter, this court, sua sponte, ordered that the case be considered en banc. In addition, we ordered the parties, and invited the amici curiae,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to file supplemental briefs on the issue of whether we should overrule our holding in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 297-98, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997), in which we reaffirmed our prior case law importing a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b. In particular, we sought the views of the parties and amici as to whether the plain meaning rule embodied in \u00a7 1-2z requires us to overrule our case law interpreting \u00a7 31-30 lb as containing a final judgment requirement. We now reject the parties\u2019 claim that the board\u2019s decision is an appealable final judgment. We also reject the parties\u2019 contention that \u00a7 1-2z overrules our prior precedent construing \u00a7 31-301b to require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>final judgment. Finally, we decline the parties\u2019 invitation to reconsider and abandon our construction of \u00a731-301b as containing a final judgment requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We first consider the parties\u2019 claim that the decision of the board is an appealable final judgment. Before addressing the merits of this claim, however, we set forth the governing legal principles, which we recently summarized in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 97. \u201c[U]nder General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b, [a]ny party aggrieved by the decision of the [board] upon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings may appeal the decision of the [board] to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u201cWe have stated, however, that the Appellate Court\u2019s review of disputed claims of law and fact ordinarily must await the rendering of a final judgment by the [board]. <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 556, 573 A.2d 1 (1990). When the board remands a case to the commissioner for further proceedings in connection with the challenged award, the finality of the board\u2019s decision is called into question .... Id. In such circumstances, [t]he test that determines whether such a decision is a final judgment turns on the scope of the proceedings on remand: if such further proceedings are merely ministerial, the decision is an appealable final judgment, but if further proceedings will require the exercise of independent judgment or discretion and the taking of additional evidence, the appeal is premature and must be dismissed. Id. Finally, because the existence of a final judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal, the reviewing court may dismiss a case on that ground even if the issue was not raised by the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 104-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>We conclude that the Appellate Court properly applied these principles in concluding that the decision of the board in the present case is not an appealable final judgment. As the Appellate Court aptly explained: \u201cAlthough two separate proceedings were brought, the first to determine compensability and the second to determine the award, the board\u2019s ruling on compensability merely was a step along the road to a final judgment. Essentially, the two proceedings the plaintiff has brought will result in one final judgment. Following the appeal on the issue of compensability, the board impliedly remanded the matter for proceedings to determine the amount of the award. Following the award proceeding, the board explicitly remanded the matter to the commissioner with directions. Because the matter currently is on remand to the commissioner, [the court applies] the <em>Szudora </em>test to determine whether this appeal may proceed despite the remand order. It cannot. The proceedings on remand will require the commissioner to exercise independent judgment to determine the question of law of whether the social security offset of [General Statutes (Rev. to 1997)] \u00a7 31-307 (e) applies to the plaintiff in this case. Furthermore, in order to determine whether and to what extent the plaintiff receives social security old age insurance benefits, further evidence will be required.\u201d <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The parties claim, as they did in the Appellate Court, that <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 97, supports their contention that the defendants have appealed from a final judgment of the board. In <em>Hunt, </em>the plaintiff, Ronald Hunt, was employed as a police officer by the defendant, the borough of Naugatuck (Naugatuck). Id., 98. Hunt filed a notice of claim for heart and hypertension benefits after discovering that he had hypertension but before he had suffered any compensable loss. See id., 99-101, 105. The commissioner determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Hunt was entitled to benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c, and the board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. Id., 100-102. Naugatuck appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court, which, sua sponte, ordered counsel \u201cto appear and give reasons, if any, why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of a final judgment because the decision of the . . . board appears to contemplate that further proceedings before the trial commissioner involving the calculation of benefits for [Hunt] will occur that may require the taking of additional evidence and the exercise of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 102. Following the hearing, the Appellate Court dismissed Naugatuck\u2019s appeal for lack of a final judgment. Id. Thereafter, Naugatuck filed a petition for certification to appeal to this court, which we granted limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court properly had dismissed Naugatuck\u2019s appeal. See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>269 Conn. 916, 852 A.2d 742 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We answered the certified question in the negative, stating: \u201cIt is clear that the board\u2019s decision affirming the commissioner\u2019s award was a final judgment. In reaching our conclusion, we note that [Hunt] was not seeking an award of specific monetary benefits when he filed his [notice] . . . because his hypertension had not ripened into a partial or total disability. Rather, [Hunt\u2019s] motivation for filing the [notice] when he did was to bring his claim within the statute of limitations period and to alert his employer that he had developed a condition . . . that could spawn a claim for monetary benefits in the future. The commissioner\u2019s finding and award, therefore, merely involved a determination that [Hunt] was entitled to receive benefits . . . should he later sustain a compensable loss. The board\u2019s decision affirming the commissioner\u2019s award resolved that issue conclusively in favor of [Hunt], and, therefore, it was not necessary to remand the case to the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>for further proceedings. Thus, under the principles announced in <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 556, the board\u2019s decision was a final judgment that was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court.\u201d <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We agree with the Appellate Court that the factual and procedural scenario presented in <em>Hunt </em>is materially different from that presented in this case. In particular, Hunt did not seek an award of benefits; rather, he merely sought a determination that he was entitled to such an award <em>at some unspecified time in the future </em>if and when he actually realized a compensable loss due to his hypertension. In other words, the only issue before the commissioner in <em>Hunt </em>was whether Hunt would be entitled to benefits \u201cshould he <em>later </em>sustain a compensable loss.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 105. In the present case, by contrast, the plaintiff is seeking a determination that she is entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits <em>and </em>a determination regarding the amount of those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The parties also claim that when, as in the present case, the board affirms a finding of compensability without expressly remanding the case for a determination of benefits, the decision should be deemed a final judgment for purposes of appeal because, unlike an award of benefits, a decision on compensability is not subject to later reevaluation. Although we agree with the plaintiff that a decision regarding compensability is final in ways that an award of benefits is not; see, e.g., id., 106 (\u201ca claimant\u2019s benefits are always subject to modification as his or her condition changes\u201d); we see no reason to retreat from the functional, case-by-case test that we adopted in <em>Szudora </em>for evaluating the finality of a decision of the board. See id., 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The parties further contend that it is unreasonable to require a party to determine whether a decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the board is final for purposes of appeal when the decision itself contains no remand order. Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that it is unfair to expect a party to be able to ascertain whether a case has been remanded impliedly, and that a party confronted with the difficulty inherent in determining whether a case has been remanded by implication is likely to feel compelled to appeal virtually any decision that does not contain express remand language solely to safeguard his or her appeal rights. We acknowledge that it is preferable for the board to use explicit remand language when, in light of the decision of the board, further proceedings before the commissioner are necessary. Nevertheless, we are confident that parties ordinarily will have little difficulty in ascertaining when such proceedings are contemplated even if the board decision is silent in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Finally, the parties assert that, although compensability was the sole issue addressed by the commissioner and the board, the defendants must be permitted to take an immediate appeal from the decision of the board because, under General Statutes \u00a7 31-30 la,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> any such \u201cdecision\u201d becomes final after the expiration of twenty days from the issuance of notice of the decision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-301a and 31-301b govern the finality of workers\u2019 compensation awards, which become final when and if the parties fail to appeal within the statutory time period. \u201d <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>244 Conn. 1, 13, 707 A.2d 725 (1998). General Statutes \u00a7 31-301a provides that, in the absence of an appeal, \u201c[a]ny decision\u201d of the board shall become final after the expiration of twenty days from the issuance of notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the decision. As we have explained, however, under \u00a7 31-301b, an appeal may be taken only from a final judgment of the board. E.g., <em>Conetta </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>246 Conn. 281, 290, 715 A.2d 756 (1998). Whether a final judgment exists, in turn, is determined by application of the test set forth in <em>Szudora. </em>When \u00a7 31-301a is read together with \u00a7 31-301b, therefore, it is clear that only a board decision that qualifies as a final judgment is subject to the twenty day limitation period of \u00a7 31-301a. In other words, for purposes of <em>both </em>\u00a7 31-301a <em>and </em>\u00a7 31-301b, \u201c[a]ny decision\u201d of the board includes only those decisions that constitute a final judgment as we have defined that term in <em>Szudora. </em>So construed, the two statutory provisions are fully consistent with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We turn next to the parties\u2019 claim that the legislature, by virtue of its enactment of \u00a7 1-2z, effectively has overruled our precedent importing a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-30 lb. Specifically, the parties contend that, because \u00a7 31-30 lb contains no language to suggest that only a board decision that constitutes a final judgment may be appealed to the Appellate Court, the plain meaning rule of \u00a7 1-2z bars us from construing \u00a7 31-301b in such a manner. Thus, under the view advanced by the parties, our interpretation of \u00a7 31-301b is governed by its plain and unambiguous language, which permits an appeal from a decision of the board \u201cupon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We reject the parties\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">To place the parties\u2019 contention in proper context, we commence our consideration of their claim with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>brief overview of the case law interpreting \u00a7 31-30 lb as requiring an appeal from a final judgment of the board. The first case to impose a final judgment requirement under \u00a7 31-301b was <em>Timothy </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>3 Conn. App. 162, 485 A.2d 1389 (1985). In that case, the Appellate Court held that, because the decision of the compensation review division, now the compensation review board, was not a final judgment, the court had no subject matter jurisdiction to hear an appeal from that decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 164. Several years later, in <em>Repasi </em>v. <em>Jenkins Bros., </em>16 Conn. App. 121, 123-24, 546 A.2d 965, cert, denied, 209 Conn. 817, 550 A.2d 1085 (1988), the Appellate Court, following its holding in <em>Timothy, </em>dismissed an appeal from the compensation review division for lack of a final judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">This court first imported a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b in <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>210 Conn. 626, 556 A.2d 599 (1989). In <em>Matey, </em>the second injury and compensation assurance fund (fund) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>appealed from a decision of the compensation review division, which affirmed the finding of the commissioner as to the fund\u2019s liability to the claimant but remanded the case for further proceedings before the commissioner with respect to the amount of the award. Id., 627. Although the claimant had not challenged the appealability of the board\u2019s decision, we followed the holding of <em>Repasi </em>in concluding, first, that only a final judgment is appealable under \u00a7 31-30 lb,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, second, that the fund\u2019s appeal was premature in light of the board\u2019s remand order directing the commissioner to conduct a further evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining the correct amount of the award. Id., 629-31. We therefore dismissed the fund\u2019s appeal for lack of a final judgment.

Co., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 295, we again were asked to \u201coverrule our previous [cases] interpreting \u00a7 31-301b to require a final decision by the board before such a decision may be appealed.\u201d The claim that we should overrule those prior cases, which was raised by the second injury fund, was predicated on the fact that the text of \u00a7 31-301b, unlike that of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 52-263,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> does not contain such a prerequisite. Id., 294-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We declined the fund\u2019s invitation to overrule our prior case law interpreting \u00a7 31-30 lb as requiring a final judgment. In doing so, we acknowledged that \u201cthe text of \u00a7 31-301b does not contain language requiring a final judgment in order for a party to appeal to the Appellate Court.\u201d Id., 295. We observed, however, that the legislative history of \u00a7 31-30 lb contained evidence indicating an intent by the legislature to allow appeals under \u00a7 31-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>301b only from final judgments of the board. Id., 295-96. In resolving the issue of legislative intent posed by the second injury fund\u2019s claim, we relied primarily on two separate but related principles, namely, the doctrine of stare decisis and the tenet of statutory interpretation that counsels against overruling case law involving our construction of a statute if the legislature reasonably may be deemed to have acquiesced in that construction. See id., 296-97. Specifically, we explained: \u201cThe doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. . . . Stare decisis is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency. ... It is the most important application of a theory of decisionmaking consistency in our legal culture and it is an. obvious manifestation of the notion that decisionmaking consistency itself has normative value. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u201cIn evaluating the force of stare decisis, our case law dictates that we should be especially wary of overturning a decision that involves the construction of a statute. . . . When we construe a statute, we act not as plenary lawgivers but as surrogates for another policy maker, [that is] the legislature. In our role as surrogates, our only responsibility is to determine what the legislature, within constitutional limits, intended to do. Sometimes, when we have made such a determination, the legislature instructs us that we have misconstrued its intentions. We are bound by the instructions so provided. . . . More often, however, the legislature takes no further action to clarify its intentions. Time and again, we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature\u2019s acquiescence in our construction of a statute. . . . Once an appropriate interval to permit legislative reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tion has passed without corrective legislative action, the inference of legislative acquiescence places a significant jurisprudential limitation on our own authority to reconsider the merits of our earlier decision. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u201cThe first of our decisions construing \u00a7 31-301b to require that a party appealing from a decision of the board must appeal from a final decision; [see] <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 631; was rendered in 1989. In 1991, two years after <em>Matey </em>and one year after <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 214 Conn. [552], the legislature enacted a comprehensive reform of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, yet only [effected a non-substantive change to \u00a7 31-301b. See Public Acts 1991, No. 91-339, \u00a7 22 (P.A. 91-339) (substituting [term] review board for [term] review division). The legislature\u2019s failure to amend \u00a7 31-301b following our interpretation of it in <em>Matey </em>and <em>Szudora, </em>which both predated legislative consideration of P.A. 91-339, provides adequate support for our disinclination to overrule controlling precedent and thereby effect an amendment by the process of judicial interpretation. . . . The legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation [that] the courts have placed [on] one of its legislative enactments and of the effect that its own nonaction, thereafter, may have. ... In short, the fund has not presented cogent reasons and inescapable logic that compel us to overrule our prior decisions interpreting \u00a7 31-301b.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 296-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Almost ten years have elapsed since our refusal in <em>Hall </em>to overrule our prior precedent importing a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b, and the legislature has taken no action to amend that statutory section. Indeed, the legislature has not amended \u00a7 31-30 lb in the eighteen years that have passed since this court first construed \u00a7 31-30 lb to require a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>In 2003, however, the legislature enacted \u00a7 1-2z; see footnote 2 of this opinion; which prohibits the use of extratextual evidence of the meaning of a statute if the statutory text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results. The parties contend that \u00a7 1-2z requires us to construe \u00a7 31-30 lb in accordance with its plain and unambiguous language. The parties further contend that, because \u00a7 31-30 lb does not expressly refer to a final judgment requirement, \u00a7 1-2z prohibits us from continuing to construe \u00a7 31-30 lb as containing such a requirement. In other words, under the view advanced by the parties, \u00a7 1-2z overrules our prior precedent importing a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We acknowledge that, if we were writing on a clean slate, \u00a7 1-2z might foreclose us from reading a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-30 lb because the text of \u00a7 31-30 lb contains no such requirement. For the reasons that follow, however, we conclude that \u00a7 1-2z does not dictate the result that the parties urge.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">As this court previously has observed, \u00a7 1-2z was enacted in response to our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003), in which we \u201cexplained that, as part of the judicial task of statutory interpretation, we would not follow the so-called plain meaning rule, which operates to preclude the court, in certain cases, from considering sources in addition to the statutory text in order to determine its meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 686-87 n.20, 855 A.2d 212 (2005). Specifically, \u00a7 1-2z \u201chas legislatively overruled that part of <em>Courchesne </em>in which we stated that we would not require a threshold showing of linguistic ambiguity as a precondition to consideration of [extra-textual] sources of the meaning of legislative language . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kinsey </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>277 Conn. 398, 405 n.7, 891 A.2d 959 (2006). The issue raised by this appeal is whether, by its enactment of \u00a7 1-2z, the legislature also overruled our case law interpreting \u00a7 31-30 lb \u2014 or, for that matter, any other statutory provision\u2014if we determine that our prior interpretation of \u00a7 31-301b differs from our interpretation of that provision under the plain meaning rule of \u00a7 1-2z.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In essence, therefore, we must decide whether, in applying \u00a7 1-2z to \u00a7 31-30 lb, we are barred from considering our prior construction of \u00a7 31-301b.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Our resolution of this issue depends on the meaning of \u00a7 1-2z itself. Of course, in ascertaining the meaning of \u00a7 1-2z as it applies to the present case, we must follow the dictates of \u00a7 1-2z just as we would if we were construing any other statute. We therefore turn to the language of \u00a7 1-2z, which, for purposes of ascertaining the meaning of \u00a7 1-2z itself, directs us first to consider its \u201ctext\u201d and \u201cits relationship to other statutes.\u201d We may look no further for evidence of the meaning of \u00a7 1-2z if, after examining its text and considering its relationship to other statutes, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results. General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">With respect to the meaning of the term \u201ctext\u201d in \u00a7 1-2z,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the essential question is whether \u201ctext\u201d means the words of the statute without regard to our prior construction of those words, or whether \u201ctext\u201d includes that prior judicial interpretation of the statutory lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>guage. Of course, if, for purposes of \u00a7 1-2z, the term \u201ctext\u201d refers only to the words of the statute to be construed \u2014 in the present case, \u00a7 31-301b \u2014 without regard to our prior construction of the statutory provision, then we are prohibited from considering any such prior construction of the provision in ascertaining its meaning. As we have explained, in that case, the plain language of \u00a7 31-30 lb may dictate a result that is contrary to our prior interpretation of that provision that \u00a7 31-301b requires a final judgment as a precondition to an appeal from the board\u2019s decision. If, however, the term \u201ctext\u201d refers to the words of the statute as we previously have construed them, then \u00a7 1-2z does not purport to overrule our case law construing \u00a7 31-30lb.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Because the word \u201ctext\u201d is not defined statutorily, we turn to General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d To ascertain that commonly approved usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term. E.g., <em>Stone-Krete Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eder, </em>280 Conn. 672, 678, 911 A.2d 300 (2006). The word \u201ctext\u201d is defined generally as \u201cthe main body of printed or written matter on a page . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. The definition of the term \u201ctext\u201d does not answer the question of whether, for purposes of \u00a7 1-2z, that term means the words of the statute as previously construed or whether it means the statutory wording without reliance on any prior judicial construction of that language. In other words, the term \u201ctext\u201d is not plain and unambiguous with respect to the issue of statutory construction raised by this appeal. Consequently, we may consult extratextual sources to ascertain the meaning of \u00a7 1-2z, including its legislative history. It is evident from that history that the legislature, by virtue of its enactment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u00a7 1-2z, did not intend to overrule our prior interpretation of any other statutory provision, including \u00a7 31-301b.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">As we have indicated, \u00a7 1-2z was passed in response to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Courchesne, </em>in which a majority of this court rejected the plain meaning rule in favor of an interpretive framework that directs courts, \u201cin <em>all </em>cases, to consider <em>all </em>of the relevant evidence bearing on the meaning of the language [of a statute],\u201d without first having to cross the threshold of linguistic ambiguity. (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 575. Shortly after the release of our decision in <em>Courchesne, </em>however, the House of Representatives unanimously passed House Bill No. 5033, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Statutory Interpretation,\u201d which subsequently was enacted and codified at \u00a7 1-2z. Representative John E. Stone, Jr., who introduced the bill on the floor of the House, described it as \u201ca relatively simple proposal ... in response to a Supreme Court decision ... in which the . . . [c]ourt rejected [the] common law principle of the plain meaning rule . . . .\u201d 46 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 2003 Sess., p. 3325. Representative Robert Farr, one of the chief proponents of the bill, spoke in favor of the bill and explained that its purpose was \u201cto restore the law in Connecticut to what it was before the recent Supreme Court [decision in Courchesne].\u201d Id., p. 3326. Representative Robert M. Ward, another proponent of the bill, added: \u201c[T]his bill that is before us, which I hope becomes a law, would say that [the] courtfs] must, in the first instance, read the language that we wrote and apply it with its regular normal meaning. If there are words of art, apply . . . the usual meaning to those words of art, but in the first instance, [the words mean] what ... we have said as long as it isn\u2019t contradicted by other language or ambiguous. When it is ambiguous, it is clearly the responsibility of the court to interpret that ambiguity and often the court . . . resort[s] to a review of what was said as legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>history, what was said on the floor of this House of Representatives, what\u2019s said on the floor of the Senate and at times, even . . . what was said in committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u201cThat won\u2019t change under this bill, but it will put us back to the standard that [existed] before . . . .\u201d Id., pp. 3332 \u2014 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Senator Andrew J. McDonald introduced the bill on the floor of the Senate and explained its purpose as follows: \u201cHistorically, the courts of the [s]tate of Connecticut have interpreted our statutes [pursuant to] several rules of statutory construction. . . . [O]ne of the prime rules [among them] is something called the [p]lain [m]eaning [r]ule.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u201cAnd without going into great detail about the [p]lain [m]eaning [r]ule, it essentially says that if a statute is on its face, clear and unambiguous, and interpreting it in light of that clear and unambiguous language [it] would not yield absurd or unworkable results, the courts are not permitted to look beyond the language in the statute itself for purposes of determining what our legislative intent was in adopting that legislation. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">\u201cIn the <em>Courchesne </em>. . . decision, the Supreme Court in a five to two ruling retrenched from that traditional rule of statutory construction and in doing so, the court essentially indicated that in every instance, it was the obligation ... of a court ... to look to the broader context surrounding the adoption of any particular legislation.\u201d 46 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 2003 Sess., pp. 3190-91. Senator McDonald further stated: \u201c[I]n case this bill does actually pass ... let me be very clear for the purposes of legislative intent, that if this bill passes, it is the intent [of the legislature] to overrule the portion of [Courchesne] which recanted or retrenched from the [p]lain [m]eaning [r]ule under the rules of statutory construction.\u201d Id., p. 3193. Senator John McKinney observed that, by adopting House Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>No. 5033, the legislature is \u201csaying bring back the plain meaning rule . . . .\u201d Id., p. 3222.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">It is perfectly clear from this legislative history that the sole purpose of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 1-2z was to <em>restore </em>the plain meaning rule that had existed prior to <em>Courchesne. </em>There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the legislature also intended to overrule every other case in which our courts, prior to the passage of \u00a7 1-2z, had interpreted a statute in a manner inconsistent with the plain meaning rule, as that rule is articulated in \u00a7 1-2z. We are unwilling to impute to the legislature such a sweeping purpose in the absence of convincing evidence of that purpose. Because neither the language nor the legislative history of \u00a7 1-2z provides any such evidence, we conclude that \u00a7 1-2z does not overrule our prior case law importing a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The parties finally claim that, even if \u00a7 1-2z does not overrule our precedent importing a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b, we nevertheless should do so. The parties contend that the final judgment requirement finds no support in the language of \u00a7 31-301b, that it frequently is a difficult requirement to apply and that sound policy reasons militate in favor of its abandonment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We decline the parties\u2019 invitation to revisit our case law incorporating a final judgment requirement into \u00a7 31-301b.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">As we have explained, this court consistently has declined to overrule our cases, which date back to 1989, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that have construed \u00a7 31-301b to require a final judgment. Moreover, in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 297-98, we expressly relied on the fact that, despite ample opportunity to do so, the legislature had taken no action to correct our interpretation of \u00a7 31-301b. To be sure, \u201cwe have, on occasion, questioned the use of the legislative acquiescence rule as a tool by which to divine legislative intent ... in cases in which, following our decision on a particular issue, the legislature has had insufficient time to respond before we are again called [on] to consider the same or a sufficiently related issue.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Desena </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>249 Conn. 63, 83 n.22, 731 A.2d 733 (1999). This case, however, is not such a case. We find it highly significant that the legislature has failed to act in the eighteen years since this court first concluded that \u00a7 31-30 lb contains a final judgment requirement. The fact that, in <em>Hall, </em>we expressly relied on the legislative acquiescence rule in rejecting a claim identical to the claim in the present case also is highly significant. Indeed, in view of our reliance on the legislative acquiescence rule in <em>Hall </em>and the fact that approximately ten more years have passed since our decision in <em>Hall </em>without any corrective action by the legislature, we do not see how we reasonably could decline to follow that rule today, if it is to retain any force at all. In sum, it is the legislature, and not this court, that is best suited to entertain the argument of the parties and amici that appeals under \u00a7 31-301b should not be limited to final judgments of the board.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.

In fact, we did not expressly apply the rule in any of our prior cases construing \u00a7 31-301b. It is not surprising, therefore, that this court\u2019s interpretation of a particular statutory provision might yield one result prior to <em>Courchesne </em>and a different result under \u00a7 1-2z.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> We are not aware of any statutory provisions to which \u00a7 1-2z is related that shed light on the meaning of \u00a7 1-2z for purposes of the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\"> For example, the parties contend that permitting an immediate appeal on the issue of compensability, which often is the key issue in dispute, is most consistent with the goal of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cto facilitate [the] speedy, efficient and inexpensive disposition of matters covered by the act (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Del Toro </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>270 Conn. 532, 541, 853 A.2d 95 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\"> We acknowledge that, for the reasons set forth in part II of this opinion, the finality requirement that has been imposed under \u00a7 31-301b, first by the Appellate Court and then by this court, fairly may be described as resting on dubious interpretative underpinnings. Nonetheless, this court\u2019s consistent and long-standing application of the requirement, even in the face of specific requests to abandon it, has been followed by legislative silence. This history compellingly counsels in favor of an inference of legislative acquiescence. We cannot, however, say with any confidence that the legislature also has been aware of how we came to impose the final judgment requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>under \u00a7 31-301b, in contradiction of the plain statutory language and based originally on nonjurisdictional rules of appellate practice. Furthermore, all of the parties and amici in this case, who represent all facets of the workers\u2019 compensation spectnim, have urged us to reconsider and reject the final judgment requirement in favor of the plain language of \u00a7 31-301b. Under the circumstances, however, we are constrained to defer to the legislature as the proper forum for the arguments advanced by the parties and amici.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b527-6\">BORDEN, J., with whom KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arp\">joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"AJI\">I agree with and join the well reasoned majority opinion. I write separately and briefly to underscore two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">First, as the majority opinion aptly notes, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z was enacted by the legislature to overrule that part of this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 567-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003), in which we stated that, as part of the judicial task of statutory interpretation, we would not follow the plain meaning rule, which required a threshold showing of linguistic ambiguity as a precondition to consideration of extratextual sources of the meaning of legislative language. In enacting \u00a7 1-2z, the legislature barred this court from consulting extratextual sources, such as legislative history, unless and until we determine that the statute is ambiguous based on its language and related statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">It is ironic that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 1-2z, felt it necessary to put into the legislative history of that section that it intended to overrule our decision in <em>Courchesne. </em>As the majority notes, Senator Andrew J. McDonald stated: \u201c[L]et me be very clear for the purposes of legislative intent, that ... it is the intent [of the legislature] to overrule the portion of <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne </em>[supra, 262 Conn. 567-78] which recanted or retrenched from the [p]lain [m]eaning [r]ule under rules of statutory construction\u201d; 46 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Sess., p. 3193; and Senator John McKinney stated that the legislature \u201c[is] saying bring back the plain meaning rule . . . .\u201d Id., p. 3222; see also 46 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 2003 Sess., p. 3325, remarks of Representative John E. Stone, Jr. (introducing House Bill No. 5033, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Statutory Interpretation,\u201d by describing it as \u201ca relatively simple proposal ... in response to a Supreme Court decision ... in which the . . . [c]ourt rejected [the] common law principle of the plain meaning rule\u201d); 46 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 3326, remarks of Representative Robert Farr (explaining that purpose of bill was \u201cto restore the law in Connecticut to what it was before the recent Supreme Court [decision in <em>Courchesne]\u201d). </em>An additional irony is that we have been forced to conclude that \u00a7 1-2z itself is ambiguous in order to consult its legislative history so as to determine its meaning as applied to the present case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The second point that I wish to underscore is that, as the majority also aptly notes, all the parties and the amici curiae in the present case, who represent all parts of the workers\u2019 compensation spectrum, have urged us to return to the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 SI-SO lb. Furthermore, the majority opinion makes clear how jurisprudentially fragile the underpinning of the final judgment rule is in the workers\u2019 compensation context. I respectfully urge, therefore, that now is the time for the interested groups and the legislature to revisit the question of whether a final judgment should be a subject matter jurisdictional requisite for an appeal from the workers\u2019 compensation review board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> Indeed, the only way that we definitively know that \u00a7 1-2z was intended to overrule <em>Courchesne </em>is by consulting its legislative history.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
