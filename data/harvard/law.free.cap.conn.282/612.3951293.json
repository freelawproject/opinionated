The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment for the defendants because there is a question of fact that could not be determined on summary judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-49. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The plaintiff, a plumbing contractor that repairs sewer and water lines, brought this action against the defendants, which operate repair programs through which consumers can, for a fixed annual fee, purchase in advance plans for the repair and replacement of water and sewer pipes, alleging violations of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The defendants moved for summary judgment. After submission of the papers and oral argument, the trial court issued a thorough and thoughtful memorandum of decision and granted the defendants\u2019 motions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The plaintiffs sole claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment because there is a question of fact regarding whether the defendants had engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of CUTPA. The fatal flaw in this claim, as the trial court determined and as the defendants contend in this court, is that the plaintiff never raised a claim of deceptive acts or practices as a basis for the alleged CUTPA violation in the trial court. The plaintiffs complaint does not allege deception and, as the plaintiff conceded at oral argument before this court, the plaintiff, in oral argument before the trial court on the summary judgment motion, explicitly disavowed any claim of deception. We therefore decline to address the plaintiffs claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-15\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
