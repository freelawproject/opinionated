Cerullo, a certified public accountant, and Cerullo and Company CPA, P.C. (Cerullo &amp; Company), the accounting firm with which Cerullo is associated, seeking damages for professional malpractice and breach of contract arising out of the defendants\u2019 allegedly improper preparation of the plaintiffs New York state personal income tax returns. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction, which the trial court granted. The trial court thereupon rendered judgment for the defendants, from which the plaintiff appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The plaintiff resides in Westport, Connecticut, and is employed as an investment banker in New York City. Cerullo is a resident of New York who, since 1992, has been associated with the accounting firm of Cerullo &amp; Company, a New York corporation with its principal office in Tarrytown, New York, and a satellite office in New York City. The plaintiff retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the defendants to assist him in the preparation of his 1998 and 1999 federal and state personal income tax returns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Cerullo prepared the plaintiffs Connecticut and New York personal income tax returns for calendar years 1998 and 1999. After those returns were filed, the department of taxation and finance of the state of New York (tax department) determined that the plaintiff, who had maintained an apartment in New York City during that same two year period, did not qualify as a nonresident for tax liability purposes and, therefore, was subject to additional taxation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result of the tax department\u2019s determination, the plaintiff ultimately was required to pay an additional $149,654.70 in taxes, penalties and interest to the state of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The plaintiff thereafter filed the present action, alleging that the defendants had committed professional malpractice by failing to advise him regarding his New York state income tax liability. The plaintiff also alleged breach of contract on the basis of the same essential facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (a) (2),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> claiming that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Specifically, Cerullo claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction over him under the long arm statute applicable to individuals, namely, General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Cerullo &amp; Company claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction over it under this state\u2019s corporate long-arm statute, namely, General Statutes \u00a7 33-929.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (a), the defendants submitted affidavits from Cerullo and Gaspare J. Cerullo, the principal and sole owner of Cerullo &amp; Company, in support of the motion to dismiss. In those affidavits, the affiants asserted, inter alia, that (1) the plaintiff had retained the defendants to advise him in connection with his federal and state personal income tax liabilities for 1998 and 1999, (2) all meetings between the plaintiff and the defendants took place in New York, (3) the professional services rendered by the defendants on behalf of the plaintiff included numerous written and oral communications with various personnel of the audit and collections divisions of the tax department, (4) the vast majority of the defendants\u2019 revenues are derived from persons or entities residing or doing business in New York, (5) the defendants do not solicit business in Connecticut, (6) the defendants have derived only minimal revenue from persons or entities located in Connecticut, and (7) the defendants have not regularly engaged in providing accounting services on an interstate basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The plaintiff objected to the motion to dismiss. In support of his objection, the plaintiff claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>court had jurisdiction over Cerullo &amp; Company under General Statutes \u00a7 33-929 (e), which provides that a foreign corporation transacting business in this state without first having obtained a certificate of authority from the secretary of the state in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 33-920<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cshall be subject to suit in this state upon any cause of action arising out of such business.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that the court had personal jurisdiction over Cerullo under two separate subdivisions of \u00a7 52-59b (a), namely, subdivision (1), which vests the court with jurisdiction over a nonresident individual as to a cause of action arising from any business transacted by that individual in this state, and subdivision (3), which vests the court with jurisdiction over a nonresident individual as to a cause of action arising from, inter alia, the commission of a tortious act outside the state causing injury to a person or property within the state if that individual expects or reasonably should expect the tortious act to have consequences in the state and he or she derives substantial revenue from interstate commerce. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1) and (3) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (b), the plaintiff filed an affidavit in support of his objection to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. In his affidavit, the plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that (1) he had retained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>defendants to provide accounting services, (2) the defendants negligently had prepared his New York and Connecticut income tax returns, (3) he had suffered damages as a result of the defendants\u2019 negligent preparation of his income tax returns, (4) the defendants had derived revenue from their preparation of his Connecticut income tax returns, and (5) the defendants knew that the plaintiff resided in Connecticut and, therefore, should have anticipated that their actions on his behalf would have consequences in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In addition to the affidavits, the trial court held a hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Only Cerullo, however, appeared and testified at that hearing. Although Cerullo\u2019s testimony essentially mirrored the allegations contained in his affidavit, he did add that not more than 1 percent of Cerullo &amp; Company\u2019s annual income is derived from accounting services \u201chaving [some] connection with the state of Connecticut.\u201d Cerullo also testified that the vast majority of the plaintiffs income was derived from his employment in New York as an investment banker.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Following the hearing, the trial court concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants under the applicable long-arm statutes. In support of its conclusion, the court stated: \u201cReviewing the totality of circumstances in this case, it is apparent that the controversy involves preparation of New York state income tax returns by a New York firm for an individual who worked in New York. There is no evidence that the defendants solicited business in Connecticut. [Because] their contacts with this state have been minimal, this court cannot say that the defendants should have anticipated litigation in this forum. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u201cThis court has considered [the] quantity and quality of the contacts involved in this case. There is no evidence that any of the contacts at issue occurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Connecticut. There is no evidence that the defendants solicited business in Connecticut. There is no evidence that they derived anything but minimal income from Connecticut residents and businesses. The defendants maintain a New York state accounting practice. They met with the . . . plaintiff in New York. All correspondence has been directed to New York state officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u201cThis court has also considered the connection between the alleged contacts and the cause of action in this matter, [and] the interests of this forum in the underlying action. The core complaint involved professional malpractice in the preparation of New York state income tax returns. These allegations have no connection to this state. [In addition, the] trial witnesses will be the parties and officials from the . . . tax department.\u201d (Citations omitted.) The court thereupon rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs action.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the determination of the trial court that it does not have personal jurisdiction over both Cerullo &amp; Company and Cerullo under \u00a7\u00a7 33-929 and 52-59b, respectively. We reject the plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claim, we note, preliminarily, that \u201c[i]n ruling [on] whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter aha, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oliphant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>274 Conn. 563, 568, 877 A.2d 761 (2005). Furthermore, \u201c[i]f a challenge to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction is raised by a defendant, either by a foreign corporation or by a nonresident individual, the plaintiff must bear the burden of proving the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Knipple </em>v. <em>Viking Communications, Ltd., </em>236 Conn. 602, 607, 674 A.2d 426 (1996). Finally, a challenge to the jurisdiction of the court presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Oliphant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We begin with the plaintiffs contention that the trial court incorrectly concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Cerullo both under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1) and under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B). We address each of these statutory provisions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">As we have explained, under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1), a court possesses personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual with respect to a cause of action arising from any business transacted in this state by that individual. The crux of the plaintiffs claim is that Cerullo\u2019s preparation of his Connecticut income tax returns satisfies the statutory requirement of transacting business in this state. The plaintiff further claims that Cerullo\u2019s preparation of his Connecticut and New York income tax returns are so interrelated that the cause of action in the present case necessarily arises from the preparation of both sets of returns, including the Connecticut returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>With respect to the issue of whether the preparation of Connecticut income tax returns in New York by a New York accountant properly may be deemed to constitute transacting business in this state for purposes of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1), we note that, although the term \u201c [transacts any business\u201d is not defined by statute, we previously have construed the term \u201cto embrace a single purposeful business transaction.\u201d <em>Zartolas </em>v. Nisenfeld, 184 Conn. 471, 474, 440 A.2d 179 (1981) (looking to identical New York statute for guidance in interpreting \u00a7 52-59b);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> see also <em>Kreutter </em>v. <em>McFadden Oil Corp., </em>71 N.Y.2d 460, 467, 522 N.E.2d 40, 527 N.Y.S.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>195 (1988) (under New York long-arm statute, proof of one transaction in New York is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction, even though defendant never entered New York, as long as defendant\u2019s activities in New York were purposeful and there was substantial relationship between transaction and claim asserted). Moreover, a nonresident individual who has not entered this state physically nevertheless may be subject to jurisdiction in this state under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1) if that individual has \u201cinvoked the benefits and protection of Connecticut\u2019s laws\u201d by virtue of his or her \u201cpurposeful Connecticut related activity . . . .\u201d <em>Zartolas </em>v. <em>Nisenfeld, </em>supra, 475; see also <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283 (1958) (determination of whether exercise of personal jurisdiction satisfies due process \u201cwill vary with the quality and nature of the defendant\u2019s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum [sjtate, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In the present case, however, the defendants derived only minimal income from Connecticut residents, did not solicit business in Connecticut and did not promote themselves as a national accounting firm. With respect to the professional accounting services that the plaintiff retained the defendants to provide, the defendants performed those services exclusively in New York, met with the plaintiff exclusively in New York and corresponded exclusively with New York tax officials. Moreover, the plaintiff had retained the defendants to prepare federal and state tax returns on income earned in New York. Although it is true, of coruse, that the plaintiff resides in Connecticut and that Cerullo prepared the plaintiffs Connecticut income tax returns, we agree with the trial court that those facts alone are insufficient to warrant a determination that the profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>sional services rendered by Cerullo constituted the transacting of business in this state within the meaning of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1). <em>See Rosenblit v. Danaher, </em>206 Conn. 125, 138, 140-41, 537 A.2d 145 (1988) (Massachusetts attorney named as defendant in action alleging that he negligently had represented plaintiffs in connection with Massachusetts development project was not subject to jurisdiction in this state under \u00a7 52-59b [a] [1] even though Massachusetts attorney had business meeting with plaintiff in Connecticut). In other words, any relationship or nexus between Cerullo\u2019s activities and this state simply is too attenuated to support the conclusion that the accounting services Cerullo performed for the plaintiff constituted transacting business in this state for purposes of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Even if we were to reach a contrary conclusion with respect to whether Cerullo reasonably may be deemed to have transacted business in this state, the plaintiff cannot meet the second requirement of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>namely, that his cause of action against Cerullo arose from Cerullo\u2019s business activity in this state. \u201cIn determining whether the [plaintiffs] cause of action arose from the defendants\u2019 transaction of business within this state we do not resort to a rigid formula. Rather, we balance considerations of public policy, common sense, and the chronology and geography of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Zartolas </em>v. <em>Nisenfeld, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 477. As the trial court correctly observed, the plaintiffs complaint is predicated entirely on the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence in their handling of the plaintiffs New York income tax liability. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants improperly had (1) advised him regarding his New York income tax liability, (2) missed two deadlines to petition the tax department regarding his income tax liability in New York, (3) advised him regarding a settlement offer tendered by the tax department, (4) prepared his New York income tax returns, and (5) determined his taxable income and tax liability in New York. Indeed, it was the reclassification of the plaintiffs residency status in New York by the tax department and subsequent penalties and interest incurred as a result thereof that gave rise to the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The plaintiff nevertheless maintains that, because he ultimately received a larger credit toward his Connecticut tax liability as a result of the improper calculation of his New York income tax liability, the preparation of his Connecticut income tax returns is so closely and directly related to the preparation of his New York income tax returns that his claim against Cerullo reasonably may be characterized as arising out of the preparation of both sets of returns. It is inarguable that the change in the plaintiffs New York income tax liability necessarily affected his Connecticut income tax liability. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Indeed, Cerullo testified concerning the interrelationship between income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tax returns filed by one individual in multiple states. The interrelationship between the plaintiffs Connecticut income tax returns and his New York income tax returns, however, does not alter the fact that the claims that the plaintiff raises in the present action do not arise from Cerullo\u2019s preparation of the plaintiffs Connecticut income tax returns but, rather, from Cerullo\u2019s preparation of the plaintiffs New York income tax returns. In other words, although the magnitude of the plaintiffs Connecticut income tax liability is directly affected by the magnitude of his New York income tax liability, his claim against Cerullo relates solely to the allegedly negligent preparation of his New York income tax returns; his claim against Cerullo does not arise out of the preparation of his Connecticut income tax returns. Accordingly, the plaintiff cannot prevail on his claim that the court has personal jurisdiction over Cerullo under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The plaintiff also contends that the trial court has personal jurisdiction over Cerullo under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B) because (1) Cerullo allegedly committed a tortious act outside of Connecticut, (2) that act caused injury to the plaintiff within this state, (3) the plaintiffs cause of action arises from Cerullo\u2019s tortious act, (4) Cerullo expected or reasonably should have expected that the act would have consequences in Connecticut, and (5) Cerullo derives substantial revenue from interstate commerce. We disagree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B) vests the court with personal jurisdiction over Cerullo.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Even if we assume, arguendo, that the plaintiffs allegations of professional negligence against Cerullo satisfy the first four elements of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), the plaintiff has failed to meet the final statutory requirement, namely, that Cerullo derives substantial revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>from interstate commerce.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff alleged in his complaint that Cerullo \u201cderives substantial revenue from clients in Connecticut and through interstate commerce in general,\u201d the sole support for that allegation stems from the facts that the plaintiff paid Cerullo &amp; Company to prepare his income tax returns over a period of several years and that Cerullo &amp; Company earns up to 1 percent of its annual income from accounting services bearing some relationship to the state of Connecticut. According to the defendants, however, Cerullo &amp; Company derives only \u201cminimal fee revenues from persons or entities located in Connecticut,\u201d does not advertise or promote itself as a national accounting firm, and is \u201cnot regularly engaged in providing accounting services on an interstate basis . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Although this court never has been required to determine the meaning of \u201cderives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), New York courts have concluded, in interpreting their identically worded long arm statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>that the \u201csubstantial revenue\u201d requirement \u201cis designed to narrow the long-arm reach to preclude the exercise of jurisdiction over nondomiciliaries who might cause direct, foreseeable injury within the [s]tate but whose business operations are of a local character . . . (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaMarca </em>v. <em>Pak-Mor Mfg. Co., </em>95 N.Y.2d 210, 215, 735 N.E.2d 883, 713 N.Y.S.2d 304 (2000), quoting <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>90 N.Y.2d 592, 599, 687 N.E.2d 1293, 665 N.Y.S.2d 10 (1997). Put differently, \u201c \u2018substantial revenue\u2019 means enough revenue to indicate a commercial impact in the forum, such that a defendant fairly could have expected to be haled into court there.\u201d <em>Fogle </em>v. <em>Ramsey Winch Co., </em>774 F. Sup. 19, 23 (D.D.C. 1991). Because of the indefinite nature of the \u201csubstantial revenue\u201d requirement, the determination of whether that jurisdictional threshold has been met in any particular case necessarily will require a careful review of the relevant facts and frequently will entail an evaluation of both the total amount of revenue involved and the percentage of annual income that that revenue represents. Compare <em>Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. </em>v. <em>Verlag, </em>536 F.2d 429, 432-33 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (1 percent of magazine\u2019s gross revenue, or $26,000, constituted \u201csubstantial revenue\u201d on basis of low unit price of magazines) with <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Arenson International USA, Inc., </em>157 App. Div. 2d 110, 113-14, 554 N.Y.S.2d 887 (1990) (0.05 percent of corporate defendant\u2019s total sales, totaling $9000, did not satisfy \u201csubstantial revenue\u201d requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In the present case, the defendants acknowledge that up to 1 percent of their annual income is derived from accounting services \u201chaving [some] connection\u201d with this state. We do not know, however, how much that represents in actual revenue because the record is devoid of any indication of the amount of the defendants\u2019 annual income. Moreover, the plaintiff failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>offer any evidence, other than his assertion that he had paid the defendants for the preparation of his income tax returns for five years, to support his claim that Cerullo received \u201csubstantial revenue from interstate . . . commerce\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B). Indeed, the record is silent as to how much the plaintiff paid Cerullo or Cerullo &amp; Company for their accounting services. Furthermore, although up to 1 percent of the income of Cerullo &amp; Company is derived from Connecticut clients or otherwise bears some connection to Connecticut, there is nothing in the record to establish either the percentage or the amount of income that Cerullo himself derived from services performed for Connecticut residents. Finally, other than the small percentage of revenue that the defendants receive from their performance of Connecticut related accounting services, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the defendants derive any other income from interstate commerce. Because the burden of proving jurisdiction over the person is on the party asserting it; see <em>Standard Tallow Corp. </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 54, 459 A.2d 503 (1983); it was incumbent upon the plaintiff, in light of the sworn statements and testimony offered by Cerullo in support of his jurisdictional challenge, to present evidence satisfying the \u201csubstantial revenue\u201d requirement of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B). In the absence of such a showing, and because the plaintiff also has failed to demonstrate that Cerullo transacted business in this state within the meaning of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1), the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, with respect to Cerullo, for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We next turn to the plaintiffs contention that the trial court incorrectly concluded that it lacks jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tion over Cerullo &amp; Company under the corporate long-arm statute, namely, \u00a7 33-929 (e), which vests our courts with jurisdiction over any foreign corporation that transacts business in this state without first having obtained a certificate of authority from the secretary of the state in accordance with \u00a7 33-920 (a) when the cause of action arises out of such business. Our analysis under \u00a7 33-929 (e) is twofold. We first must determine whether Cerullo &amp; Company transacted business in this state without authorization to do so as required by \u00a7 33-920 (a),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, if so, we then must determine whether the plaintiffs claim against Cerullo &amp; Company arose out of such business. See <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Boats Unlimited, Inc., </em>236 Conn. 78, 86, 670 A.2d 1296 (1996). \u201cWhether ... a foreign corporation is transacting business in this state under [\u00a7 33-920] must be determined on the complete factual picture presented in each case. \u201d <em>Eljam Mason Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Donnelly Brick Co., </em>152 Conn. 483, 485, 208 A.2d 544 (1965); see also <em>Peters Production, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>182 Conn. 526, 529, 438 A.2d 747 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Relying on the same arguments that he advanced in support of his jurisdictional claim under \u00a7 52-59b, the plaintiff contends that the trial court has jurisdiction over Cerullo &amp; Company under \u00a7 33-929 (e) because Cerullo &amp; Company\u2019s preparation of the plaintiffs Connecticut income tax returns constitutes the transacting of business in this state and because his cause of action arises out of that business. We disagree with both prongs of the plaintiffs argument. With respect to his claim that Cerullo &amp; Company transacted business in this state, this court previously has observed that the phrase \u201c[transacts any business\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b has a broader meaning than the phrases \u201ctrans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>act business\u201d or \u201ctransacts business\u201d in the corporate long-arm statutes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Zartolas </em>v. <em>Nisenfeld, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 476 n.4. In the absence of any claim or showing by the plaintiff that Cerullo &amp; Company has a different, more substantial relationship to this state than Cerullo, and because we already have concluded that the trial court properly determined that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Cerullo under \u00a7 52-59b, it follows, a fortiori, that Cerullo &amp; Company did not transact business in this state within the meaning of \u00a7 33-929 (e).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Even if we assume, arguendo, that Cerullo &amp; Company did transact business in this state within the meaning of \u00a7 33-929 (e), the plaintiff cannot satisfy the second requirement of \u00a7 33-929 (e), namely, that his claim against Cerullo &amp; Company arose out of that business. See <em>Lombard, Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>190 Conn. 245, 253, 460 A.2d 481 (1983) (explaining that statutory precursor to \u00a7 33-929 [e] \u201caffords the plaintiff no jurisdictional basfis] in the absence of allegations that the plaintiffs causes of action arose out of the defendant\u2019s transaction of business in Connecticut\u201d); see also id., 252 (\u201cthe statutory language mandating \u2018any cause of action arising out of [the transaction of] such business\u2019 requires some showing that the present litigation bears some connection with the business conducted by the foreign corporation in this state\u201d). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>is abundantly clear that the plaintiffs cause of action arises out of the allegedly negligent preparation of his New York income tax returns, not from the preparation of his Connecticut income tax returns. Indeed, the plaintiffs cause of action has no connection with or relationship to the preparation of his Connecticut income tax returns. The plaintiff, therefore, has failed to demonstrate that his claim arises out of any business that Cerullo &amp; Company conducted in this state, as required by \u00a7 33-929 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\"> Stephanie Ryan, the named plaintiffs wife, also was a plaintiff but subsequently withdrew from the case.

The plaintiff paid income taxes on his taxable wages in the state in which he earned that income, namely, New York, and then received a credit in Connecticut for the income taxes that he had paid in New York. Thus, as a result of the determination of the tax department that the plaintiff was subject to additional New York state income taxes for 1998 and 1999, the plaintiff was entitled to an additional credit against his Connecticut income taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\"> Shortly after the plaintiff commenced the present action, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.

Eli Nisenfeld and Esther Nisenfeld, for the alleged breach of covenants in a warranty deed that had been executed in Iowa and which conveyed to Zartolas certain real property located in Connecticut. <em>Zartolas </em>v. <em>Nisenfeld, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 471-72. The Nisenfelds filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which the trial court granted. See id., 473. On appeal to this court, Zartolas claimed that, by executing a warranty deed for the sale of property located in Connecticut, the Nisenfelds had transacted business in Connecticut for purposes of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1). See id., 473-74. We agreed, concluding that \u201c[t]he execution of a warranty deed pursuant to a sale of real property is a legal act of a most serious nature. It uses terms and procedures commonly associated with business and involves a financial transaction. The execution of such a deed clearly falls within the appropriately broad meaning of the term \u2018business\u2019 in ... \u00a7 52-59b.\u201d Id., 475. We further explained that the Nisenfelds\u2019 \u201cexecution of the warranty deed in Iowa [did] not negate the transaction\u2019s connections with Connecticut. . . . The [Nisenfelds\u2019] purposeful Connecticut related activity suffice[d] to locate this transaction . . . within this state despite the absence of allegations that the sale or closing occurred here; or that they or anyone acting for them solicited [Zartolas\u2019] purchase or entered this state to deal with [Zartolas]. The deed described the land as located here and designated it by reference to records maintained here. By owning land in Connecticut the [Nisenfelds] invoked the benefits and protection of Connecticut\u2019s laws of real property, including as an incident of ownership the right to sell the property. If the [Nisenfelds] breached their warranties, the breach occurred because of acts committed here. The warranties in the deed clearly anticipate [d] litigation in Connecticut, which is the only forum that can determine title to Connecticut land. . . . Thus, the fundamental incidents of this warranty deed rendered] the [Nisenfelds\u2019] purposeful execution of it a \u2018transaction of any business within this state.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)

Sup. 2d 86 (D. Conn. 2001), supports his claim that the trial court improperly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Cerullo. In that case, the plaintiff, Gerber Trade Finance, Inc. (Gerber), a corporation based in New York and authorized to do business in Connecticut, brought an action based on diversity jurisdiction in federal court against the defendant, Davis, Sita and Company (Davis), a Maryland accounting firm, for malpractice stemming from its allegedly negligent audit of a third party, The Gourmet Source, Inc. (Gourmet), a Delaware corporation with its sole place of business in Connecticut. Id., 88-89. In its complaint, Gerber alleged that, as one of Gourmet\u2019s principal secured creditors, it had sustained significant economic loss as a result of its reasonable reliance on Davis\u2019 negligent audit of Gourmet. Id., 89. Davis filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which the District Court denied. Id., <em>89, 93. </em>The District Court concluded that it had jurisdiction over Davis under \u00a7 33-929 (e), Connecticut\u2019s corporate long arm statute, because Davis\u2019 vice president had visited Gourmet\u2019s office in Connecticut on two separate occasions to review Gourmet\u2019s files and to perform accounting and auditing services. Id., 91-92. Because Davis performed substantial accounting work in this state, <em>Gerber </em>is readily distinguishable from the present case, which involves no similar contact with this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> We note that, although we need not decide the issue, it is uncertain whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B) that Cerullo\u2019s alleged malpractice caused injury to him in this state. Indeed, the plaintiff received a tax <em>credit </em>in this state as a result of Cerullo\u2019s allegedly negligent preparation of his New York income tax returns. From all that appears, the situs of the plaintiffs injury is New York, where all of the critical events occurred. See <em>Bross Utilities Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Aboubshait, </em>489 F. Sup. 1366, 1374 (D. Conn.) (Construing \u00a7 52-59b [a] [3] and observing that, under nearly identical provisions of New York\u2019s long arm statute, \u201cit has repeatedly been held that the [fact] that a plaintiff who has lost profits or suffered other pecuniary injury is domiciled or incorporated in that state or that New York is the plaintiffs principal place of business [does] not necessarily make New York the situs of the plaintiffs injury. . . . Rather, in the context of commercial torts, the place of injury is generally the place where the critical events associated with the dispute took place.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), affd mem., 646 F.2d 559 (2d Cir. 1980). Because we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the \u201csubstantial revenue\u201d element of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), however, we do not address whether the plaintiff can establish that Cerullo\u2019s alleged negligence caused him harm in this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"> The plaintiff asserts that <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>v. <em>Redican, </em>309 F. Sup. 2d 309 (D. Conn. 2004), supports his jurisdictional claim. In that case, the plaintiff, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe (tribe), the owners of Foxwoods Resort and Casino (Foxwoods), brought a trademark action against the defendant, Raymond Redican, Jr., a citizen of Massachusetts, based on Redican\u2019s registration of two domain names, FOXWOOD.ORG and FOXWOOD.COM, the latter of which was operated by Redican as a website that offered advertisements and enabled website users to access online <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>casinos and marketers. Id., 310-12. Redican filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which the District Court denied on the ground that jurisdiction was proper under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B). Id., 311, 313-14. In reaching its conclusion, the District Court relied on the fact that the website\u2019s advertising alone had generated between $600 and $1000 annually, that the site had received three times as many hits as Foxwoods.com, the official website of the tribe, and that, as part of his efforts to sell his Foxwood domain name registrations, Redican had earned an additional $2600 in revenue from the sale of two other domain names. Id., 312, 315. In addition, the District Court noted that Redican had made at least two business related visits to the tribe in Connecticut and had made multiple attempts, by e-mail or telephone, to arrange with tribe officials to sell the domain names, \u201cand thus had . . . \u2018physical\u2019 contacts with the state of Connecticut that were not insubstantial.\u201d Id., 315. The District Court further observed that Redican, in establishing a website that targeted Foxwoods customers, \u201chad to recognize that it was likely that his site would ultimately appear on computer screens in Connecticut and across the country . . . [and] that, by borrowing the Foxwood(s) trademark, he could do significant damage to the image of Foxwoods and its marketing efforts in Connecticut.\u201d Id., 316. The District Court finally noted that \u201cFoxwoods, as a result of its location in Connecticut, presumably attracts a greater percentage per population of Connecticut residents than most other states . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The plaintiff in the present case maintains that <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>stands for the proposition that $600 to $1000 of Connecticut related income satisfies the \u201csubstantial revenue\u201d requirement of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B). We disagree. The District Court in <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>made no finding that that amount of income, standing alone, meets the statutory requirement. Rather, the District Court concluded that the exercise of jurisdiction over Redican was proper under Connecticut\u2019s long arm statute due to multiple factors, including the fact that Redican\u2019s website had generated up to $1000 in advertising revenue, that Redican had earned an additional $2600 as a result of his efforts to sell the Foxwood domain names, that Redican had visited the tribe in Connecticut at least twice, and that, in view of the nature of Redican\u2019s business activities, he must have known that his actions were likely to have a significant impact in Connecticut. See id., 315-16. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs contention that <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>purports to establish a minimum revenue threshold for purposes of \u00a7 52-59b. Moreover, even if <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>could be construed as adopting such a threshold, the plaintiff in the present case has not proffered any evidence to establish the actual amount of income that the defendants have derived from their performance of accounting services for Connecticut clients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\"> As we have indicated; see footnote 10 of this opinion; for purposes of this appeal, we assume that Cerullo &amp; Company has not received a certificate from the secretary of the state authorizing it to transact business in this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> We note that, under \u00a7 33-920 (b), certain enumerated business activities do not constitute the transacting of business for purposes of \u00a7 33-920 (a), and that, under \u00a7 33-920 (c) those activities that are expressly excluded are not exhaustive. See footnote 9 of this opinion. Because \u00a7 33-929 (e) applies only to foreign corporations that transact business in this state in violation of the provisions of \u00a7 33-920, it is apparent that the legislature has sought to limit the breadth of \u00a7 33-929 (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> The plaintiff relies on <em>Gerber Trade Finance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Davis, Sita &amp; Co., P.A., </em>128 F.
