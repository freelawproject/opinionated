The sculpture is constructed of concrete and steel rebar, is approximately eighty feet long, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>exceeds six tons in weight and lies on a specially prepared trench filled with more than twenty-one tons of gravel and stone. The defendants, Andrew J. Hall and his wife, Christine Hall, appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court, which granted the commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that the sculpture constitutes a \u201cstructure\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-147a (a). The defendants claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that the sculpture is a \u201cstructure\u201d because (1) the plain language of \u00a7 7-147a (a) indicates that the commission\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to structures that are physically connected to the land, unlike the sculpture in the present case, (2) the legislative history and the origins of the historic district statutes suggest that the commission\u2019s jurisdiction should be narrowly construed, and (3) the court improperly relied on facts not in evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The opinion of the trial court sets forth the following undisputed facts. \u201cThe commission was established in the town of Fairfield, and the Southport Historic District is one of three historic districts created in that town. The [defendants\u2019] residence and property . . . [he] within the Southport Historic District.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\u201cIn 2003, a sculpture by Anselm Kiefer, a German artist, entitled \u2018Etroits sont les vaisseaux\u2019 ([n] arrow are the vessels), was apparently purchased by a corporation controlled by [Andrew] Hall and shipped to and placed on the lawn of the [defendants\u2019] property. The sculpture is made of concrete and steel rebar. It is approximately eighty feet long and consists of seventeen variably sized wavy sections of concrete, some with protruding rebar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>which rest either on the ground, another section, or both. The maximum height is approximately four feet. The smallest \u2018wave\u2019 is approximately four square feet in area and weighs 1200 pounds. The largest is eighteen feet long and weighs approximately five and [one-half] tons. Atop one of the \u2018waves\u2019 is a relatively small replica of an open book made of lead. The sculpture is located entirely on the [defendants\u2019] property between the house and a picket fence and bushes that front [on] Harbor Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">During the installation process, the defendants \u201cleveled a portion of their sloping lawn by excavating a two foot deep trench approximately [eighty] feet long and four feet wide which was then filled with over [twenty-one] tons of gravel and stone to provide a base for the sculpture and for additional drainage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The sculpture was disassembled at its former location, a storage facility in New Jersey, and transported [on] five large flatbed trucks to the [defendants\u2019] residence and reassembled by means of a crane on the stone and gravel bed. This procedure of reassembly took two days and necessitated the partial closing of Harbor [Road] traffic and the removal of the fence fronting the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The defendants initially filed an application for a certificate of appropriateness, seeking permission to install the structure, but withdrew the application before it could be acted on by the commission. Approximately two months later, the defendants installed the sculpture on the front lawn of their property without the commission\u2019s permission. Thereafter, the commission commenced this action against the defendants, seeking a judgment declaring that it has jurisdiction over the matter and that the defendants were required to submit an application for a certificate of appropriateness pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>to General Statutes \u00a7 7-147d (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the commission\u2019s motion and denied the defendants\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also granted the commission\u2019s motion for injunctive relief and ordered the defendants to remove the sculpture or file an application for a certification of appropriateness within thirty days. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The defendants claim that the sculpture is not a \u201cstructure\u201d under \u00a7 7-147a (a) and thus is not subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction because it is neither \u201caffixed\u201d to the land by direct physical attachment nor embedded in the ground. The commission responds that the sculpture falls within its jurisdiction because it is \u201caffixed\u201d to the land by virtue of its own \u201cmultiton weight\u201d and the force of gravity. We agree with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">We begin with the standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>dered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . The test is whether the party moving for summary judgment would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Windswept </em>Farm, <em>LLC, </em>280 Conn. 153, 158, 905 A.2d 1156 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The issue before the court also \u201cinvolves a question of statutory interpretation that . . . requires our plenary review. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fedus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>278 Conn. 751, 756, 900 A.2d 1 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-147d (a) provides: \u201cNo building or structure shall be erected or altered within an historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to the historic district commission and approved by said commission.\u201d In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 7-147a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) As used in this part . . . \u2018erected\u2019 means constructed, built, installed or enlarged; \u2018exterior architectural features\u2019 means such portion of the exterior of a structure or building as is open to view from a public street, way or place . . . [and] \u2018structure\u2019 means any combination of materials, other than a building, which is affixed to the land, and shall include, but not be limited to, signs, fences and walls . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The parties do not dispute that the sculpture was \u201cerected\u201d or \u201cinstalled.\u201d Their principal disagreement concerns whether it constitutes a \u201cstructure.\u201d Section 7-147a (a) does not define the meaning of \u201caffixed to the land,\u201d except indirectly by referring to \u201csigns, fences and walls\u201d as examples of objects considered to be \u201cstructures.\u201d Significantly, the statute contains no limiting language regarding how an object must be \u201caffixed to the land\u201d and, therefore, does not eliminate gravity as a potential means of attachment. There are no other statutory provisions that address the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The legislative history of \u00a7 7-147a (a) likewise fails to shed any light on the matter. The statutory scheme was amended in 1980 to include the definition of \u201cstructure\u201d as part of a comprehensive revision of existing law on historic districts. See Public Acts 1980, No. 80-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>314, \u00a7 1. Prior to 1980, there was no separate section defining the terms used in \u00a7 7-147d (a), which sets forth the requirement for a certificate of appropriateness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Possibly because the 1980 legislation proposed so many technical and substantive changes in the law, there was no discussion regarding the meaning of the phrase, \u201caffixed to the land,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> during the committee hearing on the matter or in the course of the legislative debates. In addition, none of the appellate cases cited by the defendants, in which this court used the term \u201caffixed\u201d to describe \u201cdirect physical attachment or natural union to another object,\u201d involved an object \u201caffixed\u201d to land.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore seek guidance from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cIf a statute or regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 809, 640 A.2d 986 (1994). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary contains the following definition of \u201caffix\u201d: \u201cto attach physically (as by nails or glue): fasten ... to attach in any way: connect with . . . .\u201d The definition of the term \u201cfasten\u201d is \u201cto make stable or unwavering: place solidly ... to cause (parts which are separate) to hold together: make fast and secure ... to fix firmly or securely in position . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. \u201cAttach\u201d is similarly defined as \u201ca connection or union, a bond or link to prevent motion or keep one thing with another . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id. The terms \u201cfix,\u201d \u201cfasten,\u201d \u201cattach\u201d and \u201caffix\u201d are synonymous and share the common meaning of making an object stay firmly in place. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In light of these definitions, it defies common sense to conclude that a \u201cstructure\u201d may be \u201caffixed\u201d directly to the earth by nails, glue, screws, tacks or clamps. Because of the porosity and instability of the soil in its natural condition, structures simply cannot be nailed, glued, screwed, tacked or clamped to the ground in the same manner that two pieces of wood may be fastened together, unless the ground consists of rock. We therefore consider other methods of \u201caffixing\u201d an object to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used and we must assume that the legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>196 Conn. 596, 606, 494 A.2d 1206 (1985). Mindful of this principle, we conclude that, once the term \u201caffixed to the land\u201d is understood to mean the fixing of an object firmly and securely in position, it is self-evident that objects embedded in the earth, such as posts, stakes and foundations connected to objects rising above the surface, satisfy the statutory requirement because the earth keeps them firmly in place. There also can be no doubt that gravity may serve the similar puipose of \u201caffixing\u201d a very heavy object to land under the statutory provision. This conclusion is supported by the law of other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The trial court and the parties correctly note that cases that distinguish personal property from fixtures, which are deemed part of the realty, are not precisely on point. A determination as to whether an object is a \u201cfixture\u201d requires consideration of permanency and intent; see <em>Capen </em>v. <em>Peckham, </em>35 Conn. 88, 94 (1868) (\u201cit is essential to constitute a fixture that an article should not only be annexed to the freehold, but that it should clearly appear from an inspection of the property itself, taking into consideration the character of the annexation, the nature and the adaptation of the article annexed to the uses and purposes to which that part of the building was appropriated at the time the annexation was made, and the relation[ship] of the party making it to the property in question, that a <em>permanent </em>accession to the freehold was <em>intended </em>to be made by the annexation of the article\u201d [emphasis added]); neither of which is relevant in deciding whether an object may be \u201caffixed to the land\u201d under \u00a7 7-147a (a). In other words, although the term \u201caffix\u201d is derived from the law of fixtures, a determination that an object is \u201caffixed to the land\u201d under <em>this </em>statute does not require consideration of permanency and intent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ertheless, to the extent that the law of fixtures requires a <em>separate </em>inquiry into how, and whether, an object is physically attached to the land, it is germane to the present analysis.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Viewed in this way, we note that many jurisdictions have concluded, in the context of fixtures law, that an object may be \u201caffixed to the land\u201d solely by force of gravity. See, e.g., <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Goller, </em>48 Cal. 2d 276, 279, 309 P.2d 451 (1957) (\u201cIt is settled . . . that a building need not be physically anchored to the land to be considered realty. It may be found to be a fixture though it is secured to the realty by force of gravity alone.\u201d); <em>Seatrain Terminals of California, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alameda, </em>83 Cal. App. 3d 69, 75, 147 Cal. Rptr. 578 (1978) (objects not attached to land by bolts, screws or similar means may be considered \u201caffixed\u201d to realty when their weight is sufficient to hold them in place by gravity); <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Linden, </em>20 N.J. Tax 242, 324 (2002) (\u201c[a]n item of personal property not physically attached or fastened to a building or land will be deemed affixed [when] the item is sufficiently large and heavy that gravity alone holds it in place and the building or land has been specially modified or adapted to accommodate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>or enclose the item\u201d); <em>Snedeker v. Warring, </em>12 N.Y. 170, 175 (1854) (\u201c[a] thing may be as firmly affixed to the land by gravitation as by clamps or cement\u201d); <em>Seven-Up Bottling Co. of Salem, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue, </em>10 Or. Tax 400, 404 (1987) (\u201clarge items may be found constructively \u2018affixed\u2019 to the land or buildings merely by virtue of their weight and size\u201d); <em>John Wagner Associates </em>v. <em>Hercules, Inc., </em>797 P.2d 1123, 1128 (Utah App. 1990) (building may be \u201cattached\u201d to realty by force of gravity alone), cert, denied, 815 P.2d 241 (Utah 1991). We therefore conclude that construing the term \u201cstructure,\u201d as used in \u00a7 7-147a (a), to include extremely heavy objects that are \u201caffixed\u201d to the land by gravity and not easily moved because of their substantial weight is consistent with the law of fixtures in other jurisdictions as well as with the common understanding of the term \u201caffixed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Furthermore, this court has noted that objects need not be embedded in the ground to be deemed physically attached to the land. In <em>Capen </em>v. <em>Peckham, </em>supra, 35 Conn. 88, we stated in dictum that, although \u201cfences that are used to separate the lots of farmers are not let into the ground or [e]mbedded in the earth, so as to occasion injury to the soil by their removal ... no one could doubt that they are fixtures or appurtenant to the reality.\u201d Id., 94. Accordingly, if fences resting on the earth and held in place by their manner of construction and weight are regarded as attached to the land, then an eighty foot long, multiton sculpture that is secured in position by its enormous size and weight also must be considered attached to the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We do not agree with the defendants that construing the term \u201caffixed\u201d to include attachment by means of gravity would read the term \u201caffixed\u201d out of the statute entirely and \u201callow historic district commissions to regulate virtually any item placed outdoors including hammocks, birdbaths, swing sets, flower planters, patio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>furniture, benches, picnic tables, and even little lawn shrines and statuettes.\u201d \u201cLegislative intent is not to be found in an isolated sentence; the whole statute must be considered.\u201d <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 606. \u201cIn construing [an] act . . . this court makes every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>266 Conn. 150, 164, 832 A.2d 1 (2003). Although each situation must be evaluated on its own merits, the language of \u00a7 7-147a (a) suggests that the legislature did not intend to regulate isolated objects that rest lightly on the surface of the ground and that can be lifted relatively easily and removed for storage or use in another location. Rather, the statute is directed to objects that may be \u201cconstructed, built, installed or enlarged\u201d and that reasonably can be regarded as having \u201c \u2018exterior architectural features\u2019 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-147a (a). Indeed, there is simply no comparison between hammocks, flower planters and statuettes, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the sculpture in the present case, which is eighty feet long and more than four feet high, was delivered to the site by five large flatbed trucks, required the partial closing of Harbor Road, took two days and the assistance of a crane to reassemble and was placed on a trench filled with more than twenty-one tons of gravel and stone to ensure proper stability and drainage. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the multiton sculpture on the defendants\u2019 front lawn constituted a \u201cstructure\u201d and thus was subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction because it was \u201caffixed to the land\u201d by gravity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The defendants contend that the legislative history and origins of the historic district statutes suggest that the commission\u2019s jurisdiction should be narrowly construed. They argue that the legislature\u2019s original grant of jurisdiction to historic district commissions in 1961 to review buildings or structures and their appurtenant fixtures was broad, that commission jurisdiction was curtailed in 1963 in response to public opposition and that its former jurisdiction was only partially restored in 1980 when the legislature enacted a comprehensive revision of the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendants also maintain that a strict interpretation is required because the historic district statutory scheme is in derogation of an individual\u2019s common-law right to use his property as he sees fit. The defendants therefore argue that the meaning of the term \u201caffixed\u201d should not be expanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>from its common usage of physical attachment or natural connection to include objects affixed to the land by force of gravity.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We agree with the defendants that the relevant language was amended between 1961, when legislation first was enacted to establish historic districts and historic district commissions, and 1980, when the definitional section was added to the statutory scheme. It requires an intellectual leap of great proportion, however, to conclude from this history that the legislature did not intend the definition of \u201cstructure\u201d to include objects affixed to the land by gravity. A more accurate conclusion would be that the legislature, for unknown reasons, simply did not discuss or elaborate on the meaning of the phrase \u201caffixed to the land\u201d during committee hearings or debate on the floor of the House or Senate when it adopted the 1980 amendments. Furthermore, as we stated previously in this opinion, we do not agree that construing the term \u201caffixed to the land\u201d to include gravity as a means of attachment has expanded the meaning of \u201caffixed\u201d beyond its common usage. We therefore conclude that the defendants\u2019 claim is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-147a (a) defines the term \u201cstructure\u201d as \u201cany combination of materials, other than a building, which is affixed to the land, and shall include, but not be limited to, signs, fences and walls . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\"> Andrew Hall also testified that footings were excavated in connection with the installation of the sculpture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-147d (a) provides: \u201cNo building or structure shall be erected or altered within an historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to the historic district commission and approved by said commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> The defendants filed a motion to reargue the trial court\u2019s ruling on the ground that the court did not address the first amendment claim that they had raised in their motion for summary judgment.

The trial court granted the motion to reargue but denied the relief requested. The court explained that, because counsel for the defendants had stated repeatedly during oral argument on the summary judgment motions that those motions could and should be decided on nonconstitutional grounds and had chosen not to make a constitutional argument at that time, the defendants had waived the constitutional claim and had failed to establish the elements of the third special defense.

They further argue that there is no evidence that the legislature intended to adopt this expanded definition of \u201caffixation\u201d when it amended the historic district statutes in 1980. As we indicated in the preceding discussion, we agree. We examine the law of fixtures in other jurisdictions only with respect to their analysis of whether the objects in those cases were physically attached to the land, which involves a determination unrelated to permanence and intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> Because our conclusion does not require a comparison of the sculpture with a traditional stone wall, which qualifies as a \u201cstructure\u201d under \u00a7 7-147a (a), it is unnecessary to address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly relied on facts not in evidence in determining that the sculpture is a structure on the basis that the sculpture, like a traditional stone wall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>is \u201caffixed\u201d to the ground by gravity alone. The defendants also concede that, inasmuch as the issue raised on appeal presents a question of law, this court must make its own independent determination of the meaning and scope of \u00a7 7-147a (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> The defendants specifically note that Public Acts 1961, No. 430, \u00a7 4, codified as amended at General Statutes \u00a7 7-147d, provided in relevant part that \u201c[n]o building or structure <em>including stone walls, fences, signs, light fixtures, steps and paving or other appurtenant fixtures </em>shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished within an historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to the commission and approved by said commission. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendants also note that, although the original statute did not define structures, each of the examples in the statute was considered to be an appurtenant fixture. In 1963, the language was revised as follows to eliminate all previous references to appurtenant fixtures: \u201cNo building or structure shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished within an historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to the commission and approved by said commission.\u201d Public Acts 1963, No. 600, \u00a7 2, codified at General Statutes (1963 Cum.
