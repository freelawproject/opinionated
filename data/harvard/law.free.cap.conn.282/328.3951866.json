The jury rendered guilty verdicts on all of the charges and the defendant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 260 years imprisonment. On appeal, the defendant raises essentially three claims. First, the defendant claims that the admission of certain hearsay statements of an unavailable coconspirator under either the coconspirator or dual inculpatory statement exception to the hearsay rule violated his federal constitutional right to confrontation. In the event that we conclude that the admission of these statements did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the federal constitution, he urges us to decide that the Connecticut constitution affords him more expansive confrontation rights, and that these rights were violated by the admission of these statements. Finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury\u2019s emotions, mischaracterized evidence and attempted to shift the burden of proof in his closing argument, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 8:30 p.m., on September 25, 1996, a Southington police department emergency dispatcher received a 911 call from 932 Shuttle Meadow Road, the residence of Nick Votino. Responding to the call, the police discovered four persons dead from gunshot wounds in the master bedroom: Nick Votino, his daughter, Joanne Votino,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lynn Suszynski and Wayne Barrows.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Police found evidence of recent cocaine use at the crime scene, and Votino, Suszynski and Barrows all tested positive for cocaine in toxicology tests per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>formed in conjunction with their autopsies. Police also found crack cocaine, drug paraphernalia and a large quantity of a cutting agent used in the process of making crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Weeks before the murders, in the beginning of September, 1996, the defendant and Eric Henry, with whom the defendant sold drugs, were living in the Southington home of Henry\u2019s girlfriend, Raquel Martin. The three were close: Martin and Henry, who were in their late twenties, called the defendant \u201cSon,\u201d and the defendant, who was seventeen, referred to them as \u201cMa\u201d and \u201cPop.\u201d The defendant and Henry had been using Martin\u2019s residence as the base of operations to sell crack cocaine. Previously, the defendant had been supplying Henry with drugs to sell, and had moved into Martin\u2019s house in order to facilitate his drug dealing business. The defendant and Henry became partners, with the defendant supplying the drugs and Henry supplying protection as well as expanding the defendant\u2019s market with his own group of acquaintances. Additionally, Votino had been selling drugs for the defendant. As a result of his own drug habit, Votino had become indebted to the defendant in the amount of $400. The defendant had taken a necklace belonging to Votino as collateral on the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Around the same time, Frank Brown, another drug dealer who had been supplying the defendant and Votino with drugs before Brown fled the state to escape criminal charges, was robbed of $5000. In order to recoup his loss, Brown concocted a plan regarding a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which Brown had paid for but was registered to Votino, and in Votino\u2019s possession, so that it would not be traceable to Brown. According to Brown\u2019s plan, Votino would report the Jeep stolen and the defendant would bring it to a cousin in New York who could get the Jeep \u201cchopped\u201d and sold. The defendant told Brown he thought he could get $10,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>to $15,000 for the Jeep, and Brown responded that the defendant could keep anything over $5000 to use for his drug business. Votino, however, did not want to cooperate with the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Early in the afternoon of September 25, 1996, the day of the murders, Martin, Henry and Kathy Fusco, a neighbor with whom Henry and Martin smoked crack cocaine, went to Votino\u2019s house to tiy to get drugs from him. Votino gave them a small amount of drugs but explained that he could not give them any significant quantity for free because he had to sell the drugs that he had in order to pay off his debt to the defendant. Votino appeared frustrated and disappointed in being in debt to the defendant, who was significantly younger. Martin, Henry and Fusco left Votino\u2019s house around 3:30 p.m. and returned to Martin\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">At approximately 4:30 p.m., Martin drove the defendant and Henry to Votino\u2019s house because the defendant wanted to discuss the debt that Votino owed him. Martin, who waited in the living room while the defendant, Henry and Votino spoke in the kitchen, overheard Votino say that he had $200 worth of crack cocaine left to sell, but would need more to sell in order to pay off his debt to the defendant. The defendant asked Votino to let him borrow the Jeep so that the defendant could get more drugs from a supplier, but Votino did not want the defendant to take the Jeep that night and expressed concern about getting his necklace back from the defendant. The defendant and Votino went into Votino\u2019s bedroom, and when they came out, the defendant had the Jeep keys in hand. The defendant told Votino that he would come back later that night with more drugs for Votino to sell, and warned that Votino had better be home and have sold some of the drugs he already had before the defendant returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Thereafter, Martin drove the defendant and Henry to the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house in New Britain where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the defendant picked up some clothing in a black backpack. When they returned to Martin\u2019s house, the defendant paged his drug supplier, Pedro Ramirez, and he and Henry went to meet him. The defendant purchased crack cocaine from Ramirez and told Ramirez he was about to \u201cstick somebody up,\u201d which Ramirez took to mean that the defendant intended to rob someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">After the defendant and Henry had returned to Martin\u2019s house, the defendant entered Martin\u2019s bedroom with a gun in a small black pouch,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> gloves and bullets. The defendant then put the bullets in the gun, wiped down the gun and put it back into the pouch. Henry took the gun from the defendant and put it in the waistband of his pants. The defendant and Henry then left in Martin\u2019s car for Votino\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Approximately one-half hour after they had left Martin\u2019s house, Henry telephoned Martin from Votino\u2019s bedroom and told her that he and the defendant would be returning to her house shortly. Martin heard sounds of a party-like atmosphere and Votino\u2019s voice in the background. At the same time, unbeknownst to the defendant and Henry, Joanne Votino was in her bedroom speaking on the telephone to her boyfriend, Demond Johnson. Johnson heard four or five loud noises that he thought sounded like gunshots, followed by Joanne Votino yelling, \u201c[w]hat\u2019s going on,\u201d and banging on the door to the master bedroom. Johnson then heard Joanne Votino scream, \u201c[o]h my God,\u201d followed by a loud thump as she fell to the ground, as a result of being shot. Joanne Votino screamed Johnson\u2019s name and told him to call 911, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Approximately five minutes after Henry had telephoned Martin, the defendant telephoned her from what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>sounded like a car, asking that she bring his black backpack to the Shell service station near her house. Martin walked to the service station, and the defendant drove up shortly thereafter in Votino\u2019s Jeep. Martin got into the Jeep and asked the defendant where Henry and her car were. The defendant told her not to ask him or Henry any questions and drove to a house nearby where he met Ernesto Soto, an acquaintance. The defendant handed Martin his gloves and told her to hold or dispose of them, but Martin refused and handed them back to him. The defendant then tapped Martin on the right side of her back above her waist and said, \u201cI just shot a girl right here, do you think I killed her?\u201d Martin did not think that the defendant was serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The defendant asked Soto to keep the Jeep at his house and Soto used his own car to drive the defendant and Martin back to Martin\u2019s house. On the way back, the defendant and Soto discussed plans to \u201cchop\u201d Votino\u2019s Jeep in New York. When they arrived at Martin\u2019s house, Henry was sitting on the stairs outside her house looking \u201cvery nervous\u201d and \u201c[p]anick[ed].\u201d The defendant, who appeared less nervous, passed the gun to Henry, who said that he would \u201ctake care of the burner.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant asked Soto to wait to drive the defendant back to the Jeep parked at Soto\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">While Soto waited, the defendant entered Martin\u2019s bedroom holding empty bullet casings, which he put in a plastic baggie. The defendant then told Henry that he needed to dispose of the gloves and lifted his shirt up, asking Hemy to check him for evidence of the murders. The defendant then looked down, cursed and ran into the bathroom where he grabbed Martin\u2019s toothbrush and used it to scrub his pants and boots, on which Martin had noticed a dark red molasses-like substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The defendant continued to implore Henry to check him, and Henry obliged, walking around the defendant and lifting his shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Martin and Henry decided to go to a hotel to sell crack cocaine, and the defendant gave them drugs to sell. Henry embraced the defendant and said, \u201cI love you bro, I love you bro,\u201d and the two discussed a code they would use to communicate through paging each other. Martin and Henry then left in Martin\u2019s car, and the defendant left with Soto.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">After arriving at Soto\u2019s house, the defendant asked if he could come in to wash something off of his pants, and told Soto that he had gotten blood on them. Soto told the defendant he had to leave, and the defendant asked Soto to call his contact in New York about the Jeep. As the defendant left, Soto saw him take from his jacket pocket a pair of green and brown gloves. Before leaving, the defendant threw the gloves in the storm sewer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently took the Jeep and fled to his sister\u2019s house in the Bronx, New York, where he remained until September 27, 1996, and where the Jeep later was found by the New York state police.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In the meantime, after parting ways with the defendant, Henry and Martin went to New Britain to the house of an acquaintance named Chris,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> who had purchased drugs from Henry in the past. As they arrived, Martin realized that Henry had the gun in the waistband of his pants. When she asked Henry what he was doing with it, he told her that he was going to get rid of it. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>then checked into a motel room, where Henry told Martin that he had hidden the gun in the backyard of Chris\u2019 house behind a large metal plow covered in shrubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Martin then went outside to use a pay telephone to call her cousin, who asked if she had heard what had happened at Votino\u2019s house. When Martin told her cousin that she had not heard anything, he told her that Votino\u2019s house had gotten \u201cshot up.\u201d Martin then telephoned Henry\u2019s brother, who told her that people had been found dead at Votino\u2019s house. Martin became frightened, thinking about the previous events that had transpired that day, and went back into the motel room to look for the news on the television and to ask Henry what was going on. Henry appeared angry, and told her not to worry about anything. Shortly thereafter, Henry began washing his boots in the sink. Henry then made statements to Martin regarding the events at Votino\u2019s house that are contested in this appeal and will be discussed at length in part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The next day, September 26, 1996, Martin and Henry spent the day at the motel, where Martin began drinking alcohol. When Martin began changing the television channels and crying, Henry told her to stop because she was \u201c[giving] him a conscience.\u201d Henry also told her to stop drinking because he did not want her to \u201cget brave and say something to someone . . . .\u2019\u2019At approximately 11 p.m., after Martin and Henry had fallen asleep, the police raided the motel room and questioned them about the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">That night, unbeknownst to Henry, Martin led police to the gun, a Charter Arms .357 five shot revolver hidden in a pouch in the backyard of Henry\u2019s acquaintance Chris\u2019 house in New Britain, where she and Henry had gone to sell drugs after the murders. The .38 special bullets recovered from the victims and the crime scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>either were matched to or were consistent with the revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Although he had fled the state, the defendant stayed in contact with a number of people in Connecticut, trying to determine how much the police knew and how to cover his tracks. He telephoned Soto several times to question him about the progress of the police investigation and told him not to say anything more to the police. The defendant telephoned his girlfriend, Jackie Rivera, on September 26,1996, and told her that he had \u201cgot[ten] into a little trouble,\u201d stating that he had not committed the crimes, but that a \u201cblack guy\u201d did. The defendant telephoned Ramirez, his drug supplier, to ask if the police had found the murder weapon and if so, whether they had found any fingerprints on the weapon. He told Ramirez that he had had to get rid of the Jeep and wanted to know what people were saying about the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">On September 27, 1996, the defendant made numerous telephone calls to Henry at Martin\u2019s residence, where Martin and Henry had returned after they had been interrogated by the police. The defendant telephoned several times, and inquired whether Henry, Martin or Martin\u2019s cousin had been talking to the police. When the defendant telephoned again later that day, he and Henry discussed disposing of the gun in the reservoir in Southington. The defendant told Henry to \u201cstay ghost,\u201d meaning stay away, and told him to \u201cget rid of [the gun] in [the] water.\u201d Unaware that Martin already had led police to the gun, Henry told the defendant that he would get the gun and throw it in the reservoir. Henry demanded his portion of the proceeds from \u201cchopping\u201d the Jeep, which he insisted were owed to him as an accomplice, and the defendant agreed to wire money to Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Shortly after these conversations, Henry told Martin that he was not sure that he could trust her and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>he was \u201clooking at someone [who could] put him in the electric chair.\u201d Martin became frightened and later was taken by police into protective custody. On Tuesday, October 1, 1996, the defendant surrendered to police at his aunt\u2019s house in Beaufort, South Carolina, where he had fled to from New York. His fingerprints were found on the driver\u2019s side window of the Jeep and on the door to the gas tank.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Traces of lead and barium, as well as other trace materials consistent with gunshot residue were on the center console of the Jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. The defendant subsequently was charged with fifteen offenses, including four counts of murder.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At trial, over the defendant\u2019s objection, Martin and Fusco testified about statements that Henry had made to each of them regarding the murders. According to those statements, the defendant shot all four victims and Henry had instructed the defendant to shoot Suszynski and then Joanne Votino, after the defendant and Henry realized she was in the house, to eliminate all potential witnesses. After the trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of 260 years imprisonment. This direct appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly allowed Martin and Fusco to testily concerning Henry\u2019s statements regarding the murders because the statements were inadmissible hearsay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The state contends that the trial court properly concluded that Henry\u2019s statements to Martin were admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, and that his statements to both Martin and Fusco were admissible under the dual inculpatory statement exception to the hearsay rule. The state further claims that the admission of these statements did not violate the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights. We agree with the state that the trial court properly admitted Henry\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of these claims. Prior to the trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine requesting that the state bring to the court\u2019s attention, outside the presence of a jury, any hearsay statements made by Henry that the state intended to offer at trial. After a pretrial hearing, the trial court, <em>Hartmere, J., </em>ruled that the issue should be raised during trial. Henry, who was charged with similar crimes in a separate proceeding, thereafter was called as a witness at the defendant\u2019s trial and invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Pursuant to the state\u2019s request, the trial court, Espinosa, J., made a finding that Henry was unavailable as a witness. The state then called Martin to the stand and sought to introduce Henry\u2019s statements to her regarding the events surrounding the murders at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Initially, the state offered Martin\u2019s testimony of Henry\u2019s statements under the hearsay exceptions for state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ments of a coconspirator and dual inculpatory statements. The state argued that the statements were in furtherance of the broad conspiracy to commit a variety of crimes, including murder, possession of narcotics with intent to sell, robbery, burglary and larceny with respect to the Jeep, and tampering with evidence with respect to the murders. The state asserted that Henry had required Martin\u2019s cooperation to keep the conspiracy from being exposed and to help the defendant and Henry escape detection, and, therefore, that his statement to Martin was admissible under <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>209 Conn. 564, 552 A.2d 805 (1989). The state also claimed that Henry\u2019s statements satisfied the hearsay exception for dual inculpatory statements, as recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 728 A.2d 466, cert, denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 45 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999), because the statements were against the penal interests of both Henry and the defendant, thereby containing an inherent guarantee of trustworthiness, and because circumstantial evidence corroborated the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The trial court ruled that Henry\u2019s statements describing the murders of Votino and Barrows had not been made in furtherance of a conspiracy and did not inculpate Henry, and, therefore, were inadmissible hearsay. The court further ruled, however, that the statements in which Henry specifically inculpated himself in the crimes were admissible as dual inculpatory statements. The court noted that it would reconsider its ruling in light of any additional evidence introduced in the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Thereafter, Martin offered the following testimony as to what Henry had told her in accordance with the court\u2019s ruling. At some point while the shootings were taking place, one of the victims moaned and Henry told the defendant to shoot her again so that she could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>not identify them later.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant and Henry were surprised when someone approached from the hall, a female voice yelled, \u201c[w]hat\u2019s going on\u201d or \u201cwhat the hell is going on,\u201d and someone banged on the bedroom door. Henry told the defendant to \u201cgo get her\u201d because she was a witness, and Henry moved one of the victim\u2019s bodies to accommodate the defendant\u2019s exit. Later that evening, when Martin turned on the television in the motel room to look for news of the murders, Henry got angry and told her to \u201cleave it alone.\u201d While she and Henry were at the motel, Henry repeatedly warned her not to go to the police, chastised her for crying and making him feel guilty, and told her not to \u201cget brave and say something to someone . . . .\u201d A few days later, Henry told Martin that she could \u201cput him in the electric chair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">After Martin\u2019s initial testimony, the state called additional witnesses who corroborated various aspects of the state\u2019s theory of the case, connecting the defendant and Henry to the murders and other related conspiracies. The state offered Henry\u2019s statements to Fusco under the hearsay exception for dual inculpatory statements. The trial court admitted Fusco\u2019s testimony under the exception, finding that the timing of the statements, the relationship between Henry and Fusco and the corroborative evidence ensured the statements\u2019 reliability. The court further concluded that the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights would not be violated because the statements were being admitted under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule for declarations against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Fusco then testified about a confession Henry had made to her after dinner at her house approximately one week after the homicides. Henry was animated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>he began telling the story, but eventually became tearful. He had alcohol on his breath but he did not appear to be drunk when he made the statements. Henry said that he and the defendant had gone to Votino\u2019s house with the intention of either collecting a drug debt or taking the Jeep instead. When they arrived at Votino\u2019s house, they were surprised to find that Votino had company \u2014 Barrows and Suszynski \u2014 all of whom were in Votino\u2019s bedroom smoking crack cocaine. The defendant and Votino began discussing the drug debt but Barrows interrupted them, calling the defendant a punk, which prompted the defendant to shoot Barrows and then Votino. Suszynski began screaming and Henry told the defendant to shoot her because she could identify them. After the defendant shot her, Suszynski continued to moan and Henry told the defendant to shoot her again so that she could not identify them. As the defendant and Hemy were leaving, they were surprised by Joanne Votino\u2019s yelling from the hallway, as they did not know that anyone else was in the house. Henry told the defendant to shoot her because she was a witness to the crimes. The defendant complied. The defendant and Henry then telephoned Martin to bring the defendant\u2019s bag containing his clothes so that the defendant could flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">After Fusco had testified, the state recalled Martin to the witness stand seeking to introduce the previously excluded statements that Henry had made to her regarding the events that had occurred at Votino\u2019s house before Henry directed the defendant to shoot Suszynski. The state asserted that, given the abundance of additional evidence regarding the criminal conspiracies concerning the Jeep and covering up evidence of the murders that had been elicited since Martin first had testified, her testimony was admissible under the coconspirator statement exception to the hearsay rule. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>state to present further testimony from Martin under the coconspirator exception. The court found that the jury could infer from the evidence the existence of a conspiracy to steal the Jeep and convert it into cash as well as a conspiracy to conceal the murder weapon, and that Henry\u2019s statements to Martin furthered these conspiracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Thereafter, Martin offered the following testimony regarding Henry\u2019s statements to her. Henry confessed to her on the night of the murders while they were in the motel. Martin had been looking for news on the television and questioning Henry about what had happened earlier that night. Eventually Henry recounted the events in a boastful and proud manner, reenacting the crimes and gesturing with his hands to imitate the gun that the defendant had used while describing what had happened. Henry stated that someone had blown crack cocaine smoke in the defendant\u2019s face, and the defendant had told the person that it was okay. In Martin\u2019s experience, however, the defendant hated crack cocaine smoke and would leave the room when it was around. Henry told Martin that when the defendant reacted in this unusual way, he \u201cknew . . . something was going to go down . . . that [the defendant] was going to do [that person].\u201d The defendant then went into the bathroom, and Henry heard the shower running and the clicking of the gun. Henry knew at that point that something was going to happen and moved out of the way. Henry told Martin, \u201c[y]ou should have seen our son,\u201d and described the defendant coming out of the bathroom and shooting Votino in the face or head area.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Henry told her that someone then had lunged at the defendant, and he reenacted the defendant\u2019s shoot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ing that person somewhere around the torso. Henry said that a woman was screaming, and that the defendant then shot her. Henry and the defendant then heard someone yelling, \u201c[w]hat\u2019s going on\u201d from another room, surprising Henry and the defendant, and Henry told the defendant, \u201c[g]o get her, go get her, she\u2019s a witness.\u201d Henry told Martin that he \u201cactually had to touch a body [to] move it,\u201d and mimed stepping over an object. When one of the victims continued to moan, Henry instructed the defendant to shoot that person again to eliminate all potential witnesses against them. Henry did not tell Martin whether the defendant actually had shot that person a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We turn now to the law governing the admission of hearsay statements and the legal standard we must apply in our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to admit that evidence. The law regarding out-of-court statements admitted for their truth is well settled. \u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>261 Conn. 336, 355, 803 A.2d 267 (2002). As a general rule, such hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 633, 835 A.2d 895 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u201cBeyond these general evidentiary principles, the state\u2019s use of hearsay evidence against an accused in a criminal trial is limited by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. . . . [Although . . . hearsay rules and the [confrontation [c]lause . . . generally [are] designed to protect similar values, [the United States Supreme Court has] . . . been careful not to equate the [c]onfrontation [clause's prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. . . . The [c]onfrontation [c]lause, in other words, bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>say rule.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>268 Conn. 351, 361-62, 844 A.2d 191 (2004). \u201c[T]he primary interest secured by confrontation is the right of cross-examination. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swinton, </em>268 Conn. 781, 798, 847 A.2d 921 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The United States Supreme Court traditionally had defined the standard for admissibility of hearsay evidence under the confrontation clause as allowing admission of all statements in which (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify, and (2) the statement bears \u201cadequate indicia of reliability\u201d or falls within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). Recently, however, the court has refined this standard, overruling <em>Roberts </em>for cases in which the state seeks to admit \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay statements against a defendant. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 60-69, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). The <em>Crawford </em>court faulted the <em>Roberts </em>test for admitting ex parte testimonial statements \u201cupon a mere finding of reliability,\u201d and determined that the <em>Roberts </em>standard \u201coften fails to protect against paradigmatic confrontation violations.\u201d Id., 60. The court reasoned that, \u201c[a]dmitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right to confrontation. . . . [The confrontation clause] commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d Id., 61. The court concluded that the reliability standard was too amorphous to protect criminal defendants, and that its \u201cunpardonable vice . . . [was] its demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the [c]onfrontation [c]lause plainly meant to exclude.\u201d Id., 63. Thus, the court held that <em>testimonial </em>hearsay statements may be admitted only when (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>declarant is unavailable to testify, and (2) the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Id., 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The <em>Crawford </em>court, however, was careful to distinguish between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay statements. \u201cWhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the [f]ramers\u2019 design to afford the [s]tates flexibility in their development of hearsay law \u2014 as does <em>Roberts, </em>and as would an approach that exempted such statements from [c]onfrontation [c]lause scrutiny altogether.\u201d Id., 68. In other words, as we have recognized, \u201cnontestimonial hearsay statements may still be admitted as evidence against an accused in a criminal trial if [they] satisf[y] both prongs of the <em>Roberts </em>test, irrespective of whether the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Thus, when faced with the issue of the contested admission of hearsay statements against the accused in a criminal trial, courts first must determine whether the statement is testimonial. The <em>Crawford </em>court declined to define a \u201ccomprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 68. It did, however, identify three central \u201cformulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d; id., 51; as well as other types of statements that always fall into the testimonial category. Specifically, testimonial statements include: \u201c[1] ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially ... [2] extrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions . . . [and] [3] statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial .... These formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the [confrontation] [clause's coverage at various levels of abstraction around it. Regardless of the precise articulation, some statements qualify under any definition \u2014 for example, ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing. Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 51-52. Therefore, \u201c[w]hatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d Id., 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Turning to the present case, we first must decide whether the more stringent <em>Crawford </em>test applies to the evidence at issue or whether the <em>Roberts </em>test will control. It is evident that Henry\u2019s statements to Martin and Fusco do not implicate any of the core testimonial categories identified by the court in <em>Crawford. </em>The statements are not ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent; nor are they contained in formalized testimonial materials such as affidavits, depositions or prior testimony. The statements were not given during custodial examination. Despite the defendant\u2019s claims to the contrary, we do not agree that the circumstances under which the statements were made would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial because Herny anticipated that his statements to Fusco and Martin would be used later in the prosecution of the murders or that he used either of the women as a \u201cconduit to the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">With respect to Martin, Henry made the contested statements to her on the night of the murders, in the privacy of their motel room, before the police had con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tacted them. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that Henry must have considered Martin to be a dishonest person based on his relationship with her, and thus presumed that she would \u201cquickly tell police everything she knew about the homicides and the murder weapon to protect herself from charges and to protect her custody of her children.\u201d Moreover, the <em>Crawford </em>court expressly identified \u201cstatements in furtherance of a conspiracy,\u201d one of the specific exceptions relied on by the trial court in its admission of Henry\u2019s statements to Martin, as \u201cnot. testimonial.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">With respect to Fusco, Henry confessed to her in the kitchen of her home voluntarily, without any prompting. Although he already had been questioned by police by the time he made his statements to her, he had not been arrested and the record bears no indication that Henry intended for his statement to Fusco to be used in the state\u2019s prosecution of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In light of these circumstances, we conclude that Henry\u2019s statements to Martin and Fusco do not fall within the category of ex parte testimonial statements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <em>Roberts </em>test remains the proper standard for determining whether admission of these statements under the coconspirator and dual inculpatory hearsay exceptions violated the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>supra, 268 Conn. 365. With these principles in mind, we address each of the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claims, deciding first whether the trial court properly applied the two recognized hearsay exceptions. See, e.g., <em>Carrano </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>279 Conn. 622, 635 n.15, 904 A.2d 149 (2006) (noting that this \u201ccourt has a basic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if a nonconstitutional ground exists that will dispose of the case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s admission of Martin\u2019s testimony under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court found that the evidence supported the state\u2019s theory of various criminal conspiracies to: sell narcotics; steal and \u201cchop\u201d the Jeep and split the proceeds; kill Votino; and conceal evidence of the murders. On appeal, the defendant does not dispute seriously the trial court\u2019s finding of these various criminal conspiracies.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Instead, the defendant contends that Henry\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ments to Martin had not been made in furtherance of those conspiracies. The defendant claims that Henry\u2019s statements to Martin were in fact self-serving and designed to minimize his own involvement in the crimes. The defendant also claims that Henry anticipated that Martin likely would talk to the police and therefore wanted her to \u201cpresent a story favorable to him,\u201d and thus Henry \u201c[e]xculpat[ed] himself as much as he felt plausible at [the defendant\u2019s] expense . . . .\u201d The defendant therefore claims that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Henry\u2019s statements under the coconspirator exception and, accordingly, violated his right to confrontation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Statements made in furtherance of a conspiracy constitute a firmly rooted exception to the general rule barring admission of hearsay. Section 8-3 (1) (D) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides that \u201ca statement by a coconspirator of a party while the conspiracy is ongoing and in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule, regardless of the availability of the declarant coconspirator. \u201cIn order to invoke the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, [t]here must be evidence that there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the nonoffering party, and that the statement was made during the course<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>in furtherance of the conspiracy. . . . The court must make its preliminary determination[s] by a fair preponderance of the evidence .... Moreover, the evidence will be construed in a way most favorable to sustaining the preliminary determinations of the trial court; its conclusions will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>275 Conn. 785, 843, 882 A.2d 604 (2005), cert, denied, 547 U.S. 1025, 126 S. Ct. 1578, 164 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2006). As we have noted, the trial court in this case made unchallenged findings regarding the evidence in the record supporting the existence of various conspiracies alleged by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Accordingly, we now examine the \u201cin furtherance\u201d requirement. We have determined that, \u201c[t]he in furtherance term implies . . . [that] the statements must in some way have been designed to promote or facilitate achievement of the goals of the ongoing conspiracy, as by, for example, providing reassurance to a coconspirator, seeking to induce a coconspirator\u2019s assistance, serving to foster trust and cohesiveness, or informing coconspirators as to the progress or status of the conspiracy ... or by prompting the listener \u2014 who need not be a coconspirator \u2014 to respond in a way that promotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity ... . Statements made by a co-conspirator to a third party who is not then a member of the conspiracy are considered to be in furtherance of the conspiracy if they are designed to induce that party either to join the conspiracy or to act in a way that will assist it in accomphshing its objectives .... Of course, whether a particular statement is made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy depends upon the nature of the statement and all of the relevant facts and circumstances under which it was made.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>marks omitted.) Id., 844; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>267 Conn. 611, 628-29, 841 A.2d 181 (2004). Moreover, \u201c[although [a] statement that merely discloses the existence of a conspiracy to a non-conspirator, that merely spills the beans, with no intention of recruiting the [nonconspirator] into the conspiracy does not further the conspiracy . . . [t]he law does not require a conspirator to ask a third party expressly to do something to further the conspiracy in order for the statement to be admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule. . . . Instead, [t]he standard to be applied is whether some reasonable basis exists for concluding that the statement furthered the conspiracy.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 845. \u201c[A] liberal standard is applied in determining whether a statement is made in furtherance of a conspiracy.\u201d Id., 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We note also that, \u201c[a] conspiracy does not necessarily end with the commission of the target crime. Thus, a subsequent declaration of a conspirator may be admissible against any coconspirator ... if the conspirators were still concerned with the concealment of their criminal conduct or their identity . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 629; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth </em>250 Conn. 611, 635, 737 A.2d 404 (1999); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>761 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1985) (\u201cthe conspiracy continued so long as the conspirators were acting together to destroy incriminating evidence\u201d). \u201cThe actions to conceal and dispose of the murder weapon and to escape detection for the crime reasonably may be construed as part of the original conspiracy to murder the victim and escape detection.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>254 Conn. 739, 747, 760 A.2d 82 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 578, this court held that a coconspirator\u2019s statement to a third party, whose house was being used to hide stolen property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>and \u201cwhose further cooperation was obviously necessary . . . helped to maintain the cohesiveness of the conspiracy thereby furthering its purpose.\u201d In <em>Pelletier, </em>the declarant coconspirator had indicated that he wanted to tell the third party about the shootings committed in the course of the conspiracy before she heard it on the news. Id., 577. This court determined that the statement was thus made in part \u201cto lessen any emotional trauma the killings would cause [the third party],\u201d whose cooperation was needed to conceal the crime. Id., 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The situation in the present case is analogous to that in <em>Pelletier. </em>Martin, whose house was the base for the ongoing conspiracy to possess and sell narcotics, had observed the defendant and Henry: leaving for and returning from Votino\u2019s house with a gun that Henry later hid; upon their return, meticulously checking themselves and scrubbing their clothes; and acting oddly and reprimanding her when she asked them questions about what had happened at Votino\u2019s house. Moreover, the defendant told Martin that he had shot a woman and asked her to dispose of his gloves, and Henry told her that he had hidden the gun in a friend\u2019s backyard. By the time Henry confessed to her, Martin had heard about the shooting at Votino\u2019s house from her cousin and was searching the television channels for news of the crime. It takes no great stretch of the imagination to infer that Henry told Martin about the murders in an attempt to secure her continued cooperation in the concealment of the crimes. Additionally, Martin testified that Henry had warned her repeatedly not to talk to the police, in further attempts to protect the ongoing conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Additionally, these facts resemble those of <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 842-47, wherein we approved of the trial court\u2019s decision to allow a coconspirator\u2019s son to testify, under the coconspirator excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tion, that his father had told him that someone wanted the victim in that case dead and that another coconspirator had hired his father to kill the victim. Id., 842. We held that the father\u2019s statement to his son \u201cwas in furtherance of the conspiracy because it reasonably [could] be viewed as the first step in gaining his son\u2019s cooperation, moral support, future assistance and guaranteed silence in the aftermath of the murder.\u201d Id., 846. As in the present case, the father initially had taken steps to prevent his son from learning about the conspiracy and only later disclosed the details of the crime to him. We reasoned that the father \u201cprobably realized that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to conceal the conspiracy from his son while the two were living together. It thus made sense to tell [the son] about the plan for the purpose of enlisting his future cooperation and support and ensuring his silence following the murder.\u201d Id., 847; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 750 (reasonable to conclude that coconspirator confided in third party in order to induce continued support for and cooperation with ongoing criminal conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">We conclude that there was a reasonable basis for the trial court to conclude that Henry\u2019s statements to Martin had been made in furtherance of an ongoing criminal conspiracy. Thus, the trial court acted properly in admitting this testimony. Moreover, \u201cit is well established that a coconspirator\u2019s [hearsay] statement, made while the conspiracy is ongoing and in furtherance of the conspiracy, is an exception to the hearsay rule and as such, does not violate the confrontation clause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 843; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 577. Accordingly, the admission of Martin\u2019s testimony recounting Henry\u2019s statements to her did not violate his rights under the sixth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s admission of Fusco\u2019s testimony regarding Henry\u2019s statements to her about the crimes. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the statements satisfied the dual inculpatory hearsay exception, and that their admission violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Section 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence creates an exception to the hearsay rule for an out-of-court statement made by an unavailable declarant<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> if that statement was \u201ctrustworthy\u201d and, \u201cat the time of its making, so far tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true.\u201d Accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 148-49 (construing rule 804 [b] [3] of Federal Rules of Evidence, federal analog to \u00a7 8-6 [4] of Connecticut Code of Evidence). That section further instructs that, \u201c[i]n determining the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest, the court shall consider (A) the time the statement was made and the person to whom the statement was made, (B) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case, and (C) the extent to which the statement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 68, 890 A.2d 474, cert, denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 361. Additionally, this court has held that, \u201cit is not necessary that the trial court find that all of the factors support the trustworthiness of the statement. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>court should consider all of the factors and determine whether the totality of the circumstances supports the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>254 Conn. 309, 316, 757 A.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u201cA dual inculpatory statement is a statement that inculpates both the declarant and a third party, in this case the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 145 n.15. We evaluate dual inculpatory statements using the same criteria that we use for statements against penal interest. Id., 153. Whether a statement is against a declarant\u2019s penal interests is an objective inquiry of law, rather than a subjective analysis of the declarant\u2019s personal legal knowledge. Under \u00a7 8-6 (4), we must evaluate the statements according to a reasonable person standard, not according to an inquiry into the declarant\u2019s personal knowledge or state of mind.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 65 (a \u201cfair reading of the . . . statement, viewed through the lens of common sense, makes it abundantly clear that the statements attributed to [the coconspirator] subject both [the coconspirator] and the defendant to criminal liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As we have described, in his statements to Fusco, Henry admitted that he had instructed the defendant to kill two people. He told Fusco that he and the defendant had gone to Votino\u2019s house with the intent of taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the Jeep in the event Votino could not pay his drug debt. He also told her that he had helped the defendant flee after the murders. Moreover, Fusco characterized Henry\u2019s manner as he described the crimes and pantomimed the shootings as \u201canimated\u201d and \u201ccheerful,\u201d indicating his pride in the defendant\u2019s actions. In total, his statements revealed an organized and collaborative effort between himself and the defendant in the commission of various crimes. Henry\u2019s actions in commanding the defendant to shoot the victim who was still moaning and to shoot Joanne Votino because she would have been a witness were both crimes carrying serious sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Henry\u2019s statements to Fusco were not blame-shifting because they exposed him to potential liability for the same crimes with which the defendant is now charged,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> thereby impheating both himself and the defendant equally. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 368 (finding statement against declarant\u2019s penal interest because, even if statement was attempt to minimize his involvement in murders, it nonetheless \u201cfully and equally implicated both [the declarant] and the defendant\u201d in crimes with which defendant was charged); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hallum, </em>585 N.W.2d 249, 255 (Iowa 1998) (\u201c[although declarations such as \u2018we killed [him]\u2019 could be viewed as an attempt to share blame, they could not reasonably be seen as an attempt to <em>shift </em>blame away from [the declarant] because [such] assertions [implicate the declarant] fully and equally in the [crime]\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Finally, several facts demonstrate that Henry understood the legal implications of his statements. Henry told Martin that she could \u201cput him in the electric chair,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>repeatedly warned her not to talk to the police and questioned whether he could trust her, indicating that he reasonably understood that his statements were against his penal interest. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 368-69 (fact that declarant drove witness to remote location before making statement, told witness he and defendant had done something wrong and admonished witness not to repeat statement \u201cclearly establishes\u201d that declarant realized statement was against his penal interest). Although Henry made these statements to Martin, not Fusco, because he told both women essentially the same story, it is clear that he understood the legal ramifications of both statements. Thus, we conclude that Henry\u2019s statements to Fusco were indeed against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Under the trustworthiness component of our inquiry, the circumstances under which Henry made the statements strongly indicate the reliability of the statements. Henry confessed to Fusco approximately only one week after the murders. \u201cIn general, declarations made soon after the crime suggest more reliability than those made after a lapse of time where a declarant has a more ample opportunity for reflection and contrivance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 70; id., 70-72 (statements made within \u201ccouple of weeks\u201d of homicide trustworthy); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 370 (statements made within five months trustworthy). In addition, although Henry made his statement to Fusco after he had been questioned by the police, it was essentially the same as the one he had made to Martin immediately after the murders and before speaking to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Finally, we note that the declarant\u2019s making the contested statements of his own volition, to people with whom he had a trusting relationship; as occurred in this case, is further indication of the reliability of the statements. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 69-70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(implication of reliability when declarant \u201cmade the statements on his own initiative, to an individual who was a friend and someone he routinely socialized with, and not in the coercive atmosphere of official interrogation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 369-70 (statement made, upon witness\u2019 own initiative, \u201cto a close family member, and not in the coercive atmosphere of official interrogation,\u201d strongly indicative of statement\u2019s reliability [internal quotation marks omitted]). Fusco was not only Henry\u2019s neighbor, but also a friend with whom he shared meals and talked about families. The fact that Henry and Fusco used drugs together also supported finding a relationship of trust.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, Henry made these statements in a noncoercive atmosphere to a person with whom he had a close relationship. \u201cSuch statements are significantly more trustworthy than statements obtained by government agents for the purpose of creating evidence that would be useful at a future trial. . . . In short, neither facing arrest nor being under arrest when making his statements to [the witness], [the declarant] lacked the obvious incentive to shift blame or curry favor with the police. . . . Additionally, although [the witness] was not a relative of [the declarant] ... a factor that we have previously noted when evaluating whether a statement is trustworthy, the trial court specifically found that [the witness] was far from a stranger .... [T]he fact remains that they shared a friendship and a relationship of trust.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In light of the preceding factors, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted Henry\u2019s statements to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Fiasco under the dual inculpatory statement exception to the hearsay rule. We turn now to the determination of whether the admission of this statement nonetheless violated the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court recently has addressed the constitutional framework in which hearsay statements against penal interest may be admitted into evidence under the second prong of <em>Roberts. </em>In <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 127, 119 S. Ct. 1887, 144 L. Ed. 2d 117 (1999), the court recognized that, due to the sweeping scope of the label, the simple categorization of a statement as a declaration against penal interest .. . defines too large a class for meaningful [confrontation [c]lause analysis. . . . Flence, the court divided statements against penal interest, offered into evidence in criminal trials, into three principal categories: (1) as voluntary admissions against the declarant; (2) as exculpatory evidence offered by a defendant who claims that the declarant committed, or was involved in, the offense; and (3) as evidence offered by the prosecution to establish the guilt of an alleged accomplice of the declarant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Fiasco\u2019s testimony regarding Henry\u2019s dual inculpatory statements offered by the state in the present case falls into the third category. \u201cAs with any statement against penal interest, the trial court must carefully weigh all of the relevant factors in determining whether the statement bears sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant its admission. ... As we previously have stated, when viewing this issue through an evidentiary lens, we examine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 136-57, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed that dual inculpatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>statements may be admitted without violating defendants\u2019 confrontation rights under the second prong of <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66, provided that they possess \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>supra, 136; see also id., 145-49 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 367 (applying <em>Lilly </em>analysis). The <em>Lilly </em>plurality cautioned, however, that, \u201cwhen deciding whether the admission of a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statement violates the [confrontation [cjlause, [appellate] courts should independently review whether the government\u2019s proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy the demands of the [c]lause.\u201d <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 137. Thus, our review of whether Henry\u2019s statements were sufficiently trustworthy under the confrontation clause based solely on the circumstances surrounding the making of the statements is plenary.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Our independent evaluation of the facts on the record as to the circumstances discussed previously persuades us that the trial court properly admitted Henry\u2019s statements. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the evidence was trustworthy and, accordingly, that the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to confrontation was not violated by the admission of Fusco\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">We now address the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of Henry\u2019s statements through Martin and Fusco violated his confrontation rights under the Connecticut constitution. The defendant claims that we should conclude that the admission of \u201cblame-shifting or dual inculpatory statements made by a coconspirator, outside the defendant\u2019s presence, under circumstances where the coconspirator anticipated the witness would repeat the statements to law enforcement in an imminent investigation\u201d violates article first, \u00a7 8, of our constitution.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This claim fails, however, because it is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>on faulty factual premises, specifically that Henry\u2019s statements were blame-shifting and that he used Martin and Fusco as conduits to the police in anticipation of an imminent investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">As we previously have discussed in part I of this opinion, Henry\u2019s statements were not blame-shifting, but inculpatory, and exposed him to criminal liability. Moreover, there is evidence that Henry realized these statements were inculpatory because, in the statement he had given to the police on the day after the murders, he claimed to have been waiting in the car when the defendant shot the victims and to have fled when he heard gunshots. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Henry used Martin and Fusco as conduits to the police. Indeed, as we have noted, Henry repeatedly warned Martin <em>not </em>to talk to the police, eventually leading her to seek police protection in fear for her safety. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim under the state constitution must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">We now address the defendant\u2019s claim that his federal constitutional rights were violated as a result of prosecutorial impropriety. Specifically, the defendant claims that, in his closing argument, the prosecutor: (1) mischaracterized evidence; (2) shifted the burden of proof to the defendant; and (3) appealed to the emotions, passions, and prejudices of the jurors.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the cumulative effect of these improprieties deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cIn examining claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. ... To determine whether the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial, we must determine whether the sum total of [the prosecutor\u2019s] improprieties rendered the defendant\u2019s [trial] fundamentally unfair, in violation of his right to due process. . . . The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial [impropriety], therefore, depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>280 Conn. 551, 604, 910 A.2d 931 (2006), cert, denied, 549 U.S. 1326, 127 S. Ct. 1919, 167 L. Ed. 2d 573 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">This court previously has acknowledged: \u201c[PJrosecutorial [impropriety] of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments. ... In determining whether such [impropriety] has occurred, the reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Moreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case. . . . This heightened duty derives from . . . the special role played by the state\u2019s attorney in a criminal trial. He is not only an officer of the court . . . but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [is] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. . . . While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury ha[s] no right to consider.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 744-46, 888 A.2d 985, cert, denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>279 Conn. 139, 158-59, 900 A.2d 1276 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 236-37, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u201cIn examining the prosecutor\u2019s argument we must distinguish between those comments whose effects may be removed by appropriate instructions . . . and those which are flagrant and therefore deny the accused a fair trial. . . . Thus, prosecutorial [impropriety] occurring in final argument may be so egregious that no curative instruction could reasonably be expected to remove [its] prejudicial impact.\u201d (Citations omitted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 247-48, 833 A.2d 363 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Finally, we note that the defendant\u2019s failure to object at trial to each of the occurrences that he now raises as instances of prosecutorial impropriety, though relevant to our inquiry, is not fatal to review of his claims. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 571, 849 A.2d 626 (2004), we clarified our due process analysis for claims of prosecutorial impropriety in which no objection was raised at trial. We explained that, in such cases, the defendant need not seek to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), nor must the reviewing court apply the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 572-73. This is because appellate review of prosecutorial misconduct claims necessitates a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, which is evaluated through the application of the factors set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). Specifically, we consider: \u201cthe extent to which the [impropriety] was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the [impropriety] . . . the frequency of the [impropriety] . . . the centrality of the [impropriety] to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u201cThis does not mean . . . that the absence of an objection at trial does not play a significant role in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>application of the <em>Williams </em>factors. To the contrary, the determination of whether a new trial or proceeding is warranted depends, in part, on whether defense counsel has made a timely objection to any [incident] of the prosecutor\u2019s improper [conduct]. When defense counsel does not object, request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial, he presumably does not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 575. \u201c[T]he fact that defense counsel did not object to one or more incidents of [impropriety] must be considered in determining whether and to what extent the [impropriety] contributed to depriving the defendant of a fair trial and whether, therefore, reversal is warranted.\u201d Id., 576. With these principles in mind, we first examine the contested statements to determine if they were improper and then determine, in the context of the entire trial, whether any improprieties deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We consider first the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor mischaracterized certain evidence in his closing argument. Specifically, the defendant claims that the evidence does not support the prosecutor\u2019s statements that Suszynski tried to \u201cclimb over the bed to get away from the defendant,\u201d and that Joanne Votino saw her father\u2019s dead body. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The evidence showed that Suszynski was sitting on the bed when she was shot and landed facedown on the mattress. The bullet entered her back, emerged from her torso, penetrated her forearm and reemerged from her wrist before lodging in her mattress. The state\u2019s forensic expert testified that Suszynski may have been crawling when she was shot. From this evidence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>jury reasonably could have inferred that Suszynski had been making an attempt to hide behind the bed in order to escape her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Likewise, there was ample evidence introduced at trial that could have led the jury to infer that Joanne Votino saw her father\u2019s dead body. The police discovered Votino\u2019s body in front of the doorway to his bedroom. The state\u2019s forensic expert had opined that the blood evidence was consistent with Votino\u2019s head having been propped up against the door and then having been moved by the door being opened in order to allow entry into and exit from the room. There was evidence that Joanne Votino had banged on that door and that Henry had moved Votino\u2019s body, presumably so that the door could be opened to allow the defendant to shoot Joanne Votino. Joanne Votino screamed, \u201c[o]h my God\u201d and thereafter was shot. Finally, the state\u2019s forensic expert had testified that the blood evidence was consistent with Joanne Votino having stepped over her father\u2019s dead body to reach the telephone to make the 911 call after she was shot. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor mischaracterized this evidence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor attempted in his closing argument to shift the burden of proof to the defense. Specifically, the defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s statement in his initial closing that there were two ways in which the jury could view the evidence: either that Hemy and the defendant had planned to murder Votino and steal his Jeep to sell to a chop shop, or that the defendant was the \u201cvictim of an elaborate scheme, a plot, concocted by many people in order to frame him for four murders he did not commit\u201d and that the state\u2019s witnesses were the actual conspirators who had plotted against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>defendant. We disagree that, when viewed in context, these statements were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Immediately after making this statement, the prosecutor urged the jury to consider which characterization was supported by the evidence. In the course of trial the defendant had attacked the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses, suggesting that, inter alia: they were tailoring their testimony to receive favorable treatment on criminal charges; the state had influenced their testimony; they were drug addicts whose veracity could not be trusted; and they simply were lying. In the context of the trial and considering the factual theories proffered by the parties, we view the prosecutor\u2019s statement merely as an attempt to summarize the two theories offered at trial and to ask the jury to decide which one was best supported by the evidence. The prosecutor did <em>not </em>argue that these were the only two possible explanations for the evidence and that the jurors had to choose one or the other, that there could be no other explanation than those offered at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Nor do we view the prosecutor\u2019s comments as suggesting that, in order to acquit the defendant, the jury would have to find that the state\u2019s witnesses had lied, which we previously have concluded is improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 709-12, 793 A.2d 226 (2002). When viewed in the context of the trial, these statements did not amount to an improper attempt to shift the burden of proof in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the \u201cemotions, passions and prejudices\u201d of the jurors in his closing argument. On the basis of our review of these claims and in light of the entire record, we conclude that three of the contested statements were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The prosecutor commented, in his initial closing remarks: \u201c[T]his case is a case about choices, choice between good and evil, between right and wrong. ... [A murder victim does not get the chance to put his past behind him and redeem his past errors.] Instead, all that is left are grieving relatives, clutching to the memories of the past and the thoughts of what could have been, the thoughts of [Suszynski] and [Barrows] and a bed and breakfast in New Hampshire, of Joanne [Votino] raising a family or pursuing a career, of Nick [Votino], a successful machinist, facing retirement. . . . Now, I speak of the value of human life only to underscore the importance of your job as jurors in this case, because, you see, Nick [Votino], [Barrows], [Suszynski], and Joanne [Votino] cannot speak here in this courtroom. Only their photographs are present for you to see. Their voices have been forever silenced, and so it is our job to present their cry for justice here in this courtroom. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201cIt was clear to all of us that, despite the length of time of the case, you never lost your interest, and you never lost your commitment to this case, even though you had to devote that interest at a time of national crisis.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> And as I said at the beginning of this case, it is altogether fitting that you should be here, in this courtroom, at this time in our nation\u2019s history, because you are here to administer the justice that our nation so reveres. And it is fitting that, while our troops are defending American values abroad, you here, at home, are defending our American values.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">During a break in the prosecution\u2019s initial argument, defense counsel objected to the tenor of the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tion\u2019s argument, claiming it was a \u201cblatant attempt to . . . appeal to the emotions of the jury . . . [and talk about] why this is a case between right and wrong.\u201d The trial court told defense counsel that it would consider specific objections and curative instructions at the end of closing arguments. Before the prosecutor began his rebuttal of the defendant\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel renewed his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions and asked that the court caution the prosecutor not to engage in the same type of appeal again. The court ruled that it would charge the jurors on the law with respect to appeals to emotions, admonished the prosecutor that he \u201cdid make a statement that this is a choice between good and evil, and that is not correct,\u201d and said that it would charge the jury on the fact that it was not to make its decision based on moral judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In his rebuttal closing, the prosecutor played an audiotape recording of the 911 telephone call made by Joanne Votino after she had been shot, wherein she could be heard gasping for breath, unable to talk. Thereafter, the prosecutor made the following statements: \u201cOn September 25, 1996, that [eighteen] year old girl tried desperately to save her dad and couldn\u2019t. She tried to save herself and others but did not succeed. She tried to cry out for help, but her voice simply could not be heard. Well, her cry continues to this day, as does her dad\u2019s, [Barrows\u2019] and [Suszynski\u2019s]. They\u2019re not cries to be helped anymore, for that is too late. No, now they are cries for something else. They\u2019re cries for justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201cYou know, the Bible records God\u2019s questioning in the first murderer. His name was Cain. And when God asked Cain where his brother was, Cain denied his guilt and rather callously answered, \u2018Am I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u2019 But God wasn\u2019t fooled and told Cain that the blood of his brother was crying forth from the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201cWell, so too the voices of Nick [Votino], Joanne [Votino], [Barrows] and [Suszynski] \u2014 their blood is crying forth from the ground, seeking justice, not sympathy. This is not to be a verdict based on sympathy or emotion. It\u2019s a verdict to be based on justice. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, we must look to you to bring justice not only to the grieving families but to society at large and to this defendant. We, the people of the state of Connecticut, ask you to go do justice, in the words of your oath, without respect of persons, so help you God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Defense counsel objected vehemently to the state\u2019s argument as improperly playing on the jury\u2019s emotions and moved for a mistrial, specifically objecting to, inter alia: the replaying of the tape; the references to Cain and Abel, biblical sanctions, the voices of the dead calling out from the grave and bringing justice to the grieving; and the \u201cso help you God\u201d closing. The trial court ruled: \u201cViewing the state\u2019s remarks as a whole, the court does not feel that they rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct requiring a mistrial. However, some of the references are troublesome to the court, and the court will instruct on them . . . .\u201d The court then asked both parties to submit proposed curative instructions, which it incorporated into its jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We note at the outset of our analysis that, as this court previously has recognized, \u201c[a] prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . [S]uch appeals should be avoided because they have the effect of diverting the [jurors\u2019] attention from their duty to decide the case on the evidence. . . . When the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>are likely to skew that appraisal. ... No trial \u2014 civil or criminal \u2014 should be decided upon the basis of the jurors\u2019 emotions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Ancona, </em>270 Conn. 568, 602, 854 A.2d 718 (2004), cert, denied, 543 U.S. 1055, 125 S. Ct. 921, 160 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 255. As we have recognized, however, \u201c[t]he burden on the defendant is to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial in light of the entire proceeding. . . . The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 703, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006). With this framework in mind, we examine whether the prosecutor inappropriately appealed to the jurors\u2019 emotions. We distinguish four categories of conduct to which the defendant objects as improper: (1) replaying the 911 audiotape; (2) references to the victims\u2019 voices crying out for justice and to their relatives left with nothing but memories; (3) references to the soldiers abroad and their patriotic duty; and (4) religious references. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the prosecutor\u2019s replaying of the audiotape of the 911 telephone call made by Joanne Votino as she was dying. Although he does not contest that the audiotape properly was admitted into evidence as an exhibit at trial, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the audiotape to be used during closing argument and that the prosecutor improperly used it to inflame the jury\u2019s sympathies for the youngest victim. The defendant appears to assert both that the trial court committed an evidentiary error in permitting the audiotape to be replayed during closing arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>and that the prosecutor committed an impropriety in his use of the audiotape in closing argument. Regardless of how the claim is characterized, however, the defendant cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">As we have noted previously, this audiotape was admitted as a full exhibit and played during trial. The defendant did not challenge its admission as evidence, seek a limiting instruction on its use or argue that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing the state to play the audiotape. When the defendant moved for a mistrial at the end of the state\u2019s argument, he admitted, \u201c[t]he [audio]tape is relevant. The [audiojtape came in admissible. But it had nothing to do with anything I said [in] my closing argument . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">As a general matter, a prosecutor may use any evidence properly admitted at trial. Properly admitted evidence, however, may not be used for a purpose for which it was not admitted. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 1-4 (evidence admissible for one purpose but not for another is admissible for that purpose; court may restrict evidence to its proper scope); see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>280 Conn. 779, 794-95, 911 A.2d 1099 (2007) (evidence of defendant\u2019s prior crimes admissible to prove knowledge, intent, motive or common design but not to prove bad character or propensity for criminality). In this case, however, as we have noted, the audiotape was admitted as a full exhibit, and the defendant did not request a limiting instruction from the court. Accordingly, it fell within the rule as previously explained under our case law that, \u201c[a]n exhibit offered and received as a full exhibit is in the case for all purposes.\u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn. 518, 525, 457 A.2d 656 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Although this court has not addressed the use of audiotapes during closing arguments,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> it has addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the use of visual aids. In regard to such aids, we have held, \u201ccounsel is entitled to considerable leeway in deciding how best to highlight or to underscore the facts, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, for which there is adequate support in the record. We therefore never have categorically barred counsel\u2019s use of such rhetorical devices, be they linguistic or in the form of visual aids, as long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the particular device employed will confuse the jury or otherwise prejudice the opposing party. Indeed, to our knowledge, no court has erected a per se bar to the use of visual aids by counsel during closing arguments. On the contrary, the use of such aids is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 598; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 767 (upholding state\u2019s use, during closing argument, of audiovisual montage of evidence admitted at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We do not view the prosecutor\u2019s use of the audiotape in this case, reflecting Joanne Votino\u2019s attempt to get help, as rising to the level of flagrant misuse of evidence properly admitted at trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 257-58 (showing slides of victim\u2019s autopsy photographs and referring to them as victim\u2019s \u201cfamily album\u201d constituted improper appeal to emotions of jury and \u201c[could not] be defended as mere rhetorical flourish\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Nor has the defendant cited any legal precedent that would justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s failure to preclude, sua sponte, the prosecutor from using a full exhibit during his closing argument deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Undoubtedly, the audiotape had great dramatic effect, but it had been admitted as a full exhibit by the trial court, and the prosecutor\u2019s use of it during closing arguments for a proper purpose<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> was within his discretion in arguing his case. Thus, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor acted improperly in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We next address the prosecutor\u2019s references to the voices of the victims crying out for justice and to their grieving relatives clutching memories of the past. While we recognize that, \u201cnot every use of rhetorical language or device is improper . . . [and] [t]he occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 366, 897 A.2d 569 (2006); these statements exceed the bounds of forceful argument and cross the line into impropriety. These statements had nothing to do with the evidence in the case or the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. We can conceive of no use for these statements other than to appeal to the emotions of the jurors, which is undeniably improper. \u201cWhen the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>supra, 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Conn. 255. Thus, we agree with the defendant that the prosecutor\u2019s use of these references constituted an improper appeal to the emotions of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We next address the prosecutor\u2019s references to the \u201ctime of national crisis\u201d and its comparison of the troops \u201cdefending American values abroad\u201d to the jury\u2019s defending American values at the trial. In our view, these remarks were improper because they were unrelated to the facts of the case and could have encouraged the jurors to base their decisions on something other than the facts in evidence. See <em>Viereck </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 U.S. 236, 247-48, 63 S. Ct. 561, 87 L. Ed. 734 (1943) (concluding that prosecutor\u2019s discussion in closing of war and assertion that American people were relying on jury to protect them as much as troops fighting war was \u201cwholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose and effect of which could only have been to arouse passion and prejudice . . . [a]t a time when passion and prejudice are heightened by emotions stirred by our participation in a . . . war\u201d). In examining these comments in the context of the entire trial, it cannot be overlooked that they were made closely following events that cause a heightened sense of fear in the public and a concomitant desire to support governmental action perceived as protective of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The state argues that, given the fact that the trial had been scheduled to commence on September 11, 2001, \u201cthe comment was neither gratuitous, nor wholly unconnected to the case.\u201d We do not agree. The prosecutor easily could have thanked the jurors for their service without invoking the \u201c \u2018time of national crisis\u2019 \u201d or referring to \u201cthe troops defending American values abroad . . . .\u201d The fact that the jurors might have perceived a connection between their civil duty and the events following September 11, should have been incen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tive for the prosecutor to exercise care in his closing arguments, not an invitation to exploit the feelings engendered by that event. These references were unrelated to the facts introduced at trial and could have no other use than to inflame the patriotism of the jurors, which has no place in the deliberation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s use of religious references during its closing argument was improper. The defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s references to the biblical story of Cain and Abel and to the choice between good and evil were inflammatory. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 383, 832 A.2d 14 (2003), this court first addressed the use of religious references in prosecutors\u2019 arguments. After a thorough review of the law in other jurisdictions and academic commentary addressing this issue, we determined that, \u201ccourts overwhelmingly have taken a disapproving approach to the prosecutorial use of religious imagery and references during trials\u201d; id., 384; and adopted a similar stance, but declined to adopt a per se rule and elected to retain the well settled standard under which we evaluate all claims of prosecutorial impropriety whereby the \u201cthreshold inquiry ... to be performed . . . [is] whether the challenged statements pass the threshold of impropriety in that they are inflammatory, unduly evoke the passions or prejudices of the jurors, or improperly invade the province of the jury.\u201d Id., 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Turning to the comments at issue in the present case, we note that, as in <em>Ceballos, </em>the \u201cstatements made by the state\u2019s attorney during his summation not only directly invoke religious characters . . . but also impliedly reference notions of divine punishment for worldly transgressions.\u201d Id., 383. These remarks had no bearing on any of the facts adduced at trial, nor did they implicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the jury\u2019s determination of guilt or innocence. Rather, the context of the statements, the manner in which they were delivered, and their substance constituted an inappropriate appeal to the emotions and an invasion of the province of the jurors. We note, finally, that, although we recognized in <em>Ceballos </em>that there may be instances in which prosecutors would have to make religious references in the course of discussing evidence presented at trial, \u201c[w]e strongly caution[ed] counsel . . . against making unnecessary religious references during trial.\u201d Id., 389 n.36. We reiterate that warning today.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Having concluded that the prosecutor overstepped the bounds of proper argument with his references to religion, comparison of the jury\u2019s duty to that of the American troops fighting abroad, and references to the victims\u2019 voices crying out for justice and to the victims\u2019 grieving relatives, we must now ascertain \u201cwhether the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and . . . the [impropriety] so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 723. In order to make this determination, we consider the factors that we have stated previously, specifically: the extent to which the impropriety was invited by the defendant\u2019s conduct or argument, the severity of the impropriety, the frequency of the impropriety, the centrality of the impropriety to the critical issues in the case, the strength of the curative measures adopted and the strength of the state\u2019s case. Id. Upon consideration of these factors, we conclude that only one factor weighs in favor of the defendant, and on balance we do not believe that he was denied a fair trial by the improprieties we have discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">We do not discern any conduct by the defendant as having invited these improper appeals to the emotions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of the jurors. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of the defendant. These few instances of impropriety, occurring only in closing arguments, where we typically allow some latitude, represented a small portion of closing arguments. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 612 (no due process violation when improper comments made in state\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments were \u201cisolated and sporadic rather than frequent and pervasive\u201d). Although the prosecutor undeniably crossed the line with his religious pedagogy and evocation of the victims\u2019 blood ciying out for justice, we do not believe that these rhetorical devices so prejudiced the defendant as to render the entire trial unfair or the verdict untrustworthy. We do not view these statements as \u201cgrossly egregious . . . [and] severe enough to mandate reversal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 480, 832 A.2d 626 (2003). Thus, the second and third factors weigh in favor of the state. Additionally, these statements were unrelated to the critical issues in the case. Indeed, the absence of a connection to any evidentiary matter in the case led to our conclusion that they were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The decisive factors in this case are the final two. The state\u2019s case was strong. The defendant admitted that he had shot a woman; there was evidence connecting him to the murder weapon; witnesses testified that they had seen the defendant scrubbing his clothes and boots immediately after the murders; and he fled soon thereafter. There was evidence that he was at Votino\u2019s house during the murders, and motive evidence regarding the drug debt and the conspiracy to steal Votino\u2019s Jeep. Numerous statements by Henry, the defendant\u2019s coconspirator, detailed how the defendant had executed four people. The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on the Jeep, along with gunshot residue. The defendant also demonstrated consciousness of guilt when he fled the state on the night of the murders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Finally, the state called several witnesses to prove the existence of a conspiracy between the defendant and Henry to commit these crimes and to conceal them afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Finally, we note that the trial court gave a pointed and detailed curative instruction, which expressly addressed each of the improprieties we have discussed today.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In addition, in its final charge, the trial court instructed the jurors that the arguments of the attorneys were not evidence, that the attorneys were not witnesses, and that the jury should not consider as evidence the recollections of the attorneys or their personal beliefs about the facts of the case or credibility of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201c[W]e have previously recognized that a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks or questions can obviate any possible harm to the defendant. . . . Moreover, [i]n the absence of an indication to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have followed [the trial court\u2019s] curative instructions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 401. In addition, we note that the defendant, in listing his exceptions to the jury charge, did not express concern about the clarity or extent of the instructions regarding any of the improprieties raised in this appeal. We conclude, therefore, that the thoroughness of the trial court\u2019s instructions, in addition to the other <em>Williams </em>factors, were sufficient to cure any potential harm caused by the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing arguments. Accordingly, the defendant was not deprived of his due process right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...

The trial court ruled that the state could ask some preliminary questions to reestablish the context from Martin\u2019s prior testimony and that Martin could testify about the entire conversation, but warned the state that it did not want to go through all of Martin\u2019s testimony again. It is unclear from the record, however, whether the trial court had concluded that all of Martin\u2019s testimony fell within the coconspirator exception, and only limited the state\u2019s questioning to avoid repetition. In any event, however, as we discuss herein, all of her testimony properly could have been admitted under the coconspirator exception. Accordingly, we analyze its admission only under this exception. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>221 Conn. 549, 592, 606 A.2d 693 (1992) (noting that \u201c[t]his court is authorized to rely upon alternative grounds supported by the record to sustain a judgment\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> Although the defendant does not contest that there was a conspiracy between himself, Brown and Soto regarding the Jeep, he claims that the trial court\u2019s finding that a jury could infer the existence of a conspiracy between himself and Henry to steal and \u201cchop\u201d the Jeep was clearly errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ous because there was no testimony that Henry was a part of that plan or an intended beneficiary of its proceeds. The defendant, however, overlooks the testimony of Martin and her cousin, who testified that they had overheard Henry demanding his portion of the profit from the sale of the Jeep from the defendant after the murders, and that Martin had helped make arrangements for the defendant to wire that money to Henry. Thus, we disagree that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the existence of a conspiracy regarding the Jeep was clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> There was substantial evidence that the conspiracy was ongoing at the time Henry made the statements to Martin.

There was also testimony that Henry told the defendant to \u201cstay ghost\u201d and inquired about his share of the profits from the Jeep. Thus, there was an abundance of evidence in the record to suggest that the conspiracies to conceal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>murders and \u201cchop\u201d the Jeep were ongoing at the time Henry confessed to Martin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> We note that the defendant challenges the admission of Fusco\u2019s testimony regarding Henry\u2019s statements in its entirety.

We note in addition that these claims are disingenuous in light of the fact that, in his statement to the police, Henry claimed that he was waiting in the car outside Votino\u2019s house when the defendant shot the victims, that he fled when he heard gunshots, and that the defendant threatened to kill him if he did not dispose of the gun.

So there is a relationship of trust between [Fusco] and [Henry].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\"> In support of his argument that the admission of Henry\u2019s statements violated his right to confrontation, the defendant relies heavily on <em>Lilly, </em>specifically, the opinion of the plurality recognizing that, \u201caccomplices\u2019 confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule as that concept has been defined in our [confrontation [cjlause jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 134. <em>Lilly, </em>however, is factually distinguishable from the present case because it concerned a coconspirator\u2019s confession given in police custody in which the coconspirator shifted responsibility for the crimes to the defendant, rendering the confession unreliable. Id., 120-22. The court specifically noted that \u201cthe statements taken from the [codefendant] . . . [while in custody] were obviously obtained for the purpose of creating evidence that would be useful at a future trial. \u201dId.,125;see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 370 <em>(\u201cLilly\u2019s </em>main concern was with statements in which, as is common in police station confessions, the declarant admits only what the authorities are already capable of proving against him and seeks to shift the principal blame to another [against whom the prosecutor then offers the statement at trial] .... <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>211 F.3d 658, 669 [1st Cir. 2000], cert, denied, 531 U.S. 1154, 121 S.

In other words, evidence not directly related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>circumstances surrounding the making of the statement cannot be used to substantiate the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. . . . Independent corroborative evidence may be used, nonetheless, to explain the meaning or import of an <em>otherwise reliable </em>hearsay statement.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 367 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Although independent evidence may not be used to corroborate hearsay statements in analyzing <em>constitutional claims, </em>this court has used such evidence in evaluating reliability under the state evidentiary standard. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 71-72. Indeed, this court has noted that, \u201c[a] forceful argument may be made . . . that even though a hearsay statement may be sufficiently reliable to satisfy constitutional requirements, the state nevertheless should not be permitted to use the statement against an accused unless the statement\u2019s truthfulness is adequately corroborated by other independent evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 156 n.28. Accordingly, to the extent that the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in considering corroborating evidence in its evaluation of reliability necessary under our rules of evidence, we disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to be confronted by the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> In his factual summary of the case, the defendant asserts that there were various instances during the trial when the trial court rebuked the prosecutor for: (1) evoking a nickname of the defendant, \u201cKiller,\u201d which had been excluded by a prior order; (2) not exercising \u201cgood judgment\u201d when he told the jury that he was submitting a document with the nickname omitted; and (3) making \u201cimproper speaking objections.\u201d Because the defendant has not included any of these matters in his prosecutorial impropriety briefing, we limit our inquiry to those instances in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument that are the subjects of the defendant\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"><em> </em>The trial originally was scheduled to begin on September 11, 2001, but because of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, it was continued until the next day. On that day, the court gave the jury the option of proceeding with the trial or postponing it until the following week, and the jury elected to proceed immediately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> We note, however, that other courts have rejected claims that playing 911 audiotapes previously admitted as trial exhibits during closing arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>was improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>823 So. 2d 877, 903-904 (La. 2002) (playing 911 audiotape for third time during closing within proper scope of argument because audiotape was admitted as full exhibit), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1227, 123 S. Ct. 1266, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shuler, </em>353 S.C. 176, 186, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003) (playing portion of 911 audiotape and entire audiotape during closing not denial of due process). The defendant fails to explain or to cite any legal precedent that would justify the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s failure to preclude the prosecutor from using a full exhibit during his closing argument constituted a constitutional violation that deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> We note, however, that, had the prosecutor played the audiotape <em>merely </em>as a segue to his improper references to the voices of the dead crying out for justice, thereby appealing to emotions and encouraging the jurors to base their decisions on something other than the facts in evidence, we would condemn this use of the audiotape; see part III C 2 of this opinion; but we conclude for the reasons discussed in part III D of this opinion, that the audiotape, along with the other improprieties, did not so prejudice the defendant as to render the entire trial unfair or the verdict untrustworthy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\"> The court charged the jury in relevant part: \u201cYou should not be swayed or influenced by any sympathy or prejudice for or against anyone, the state, the accused, the victimjs], their families, or anyone else. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u201c[Y]ou must set aside any feelings that you might have about the nature of the case, the defendant, the victims\u2019 familjies], the judge, or anyone else and decide this case only on the evidence presented in this courtroom and nothing else. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u201c[Djuring closing arguments the prosecutor made some remarks, which I instruct you to disregard. The essence of these remarks with weeping relatives clutching to memories of the past or of what might have been in the victims\u2019 future; that the victims cannot speak in the courtroom because their words have been forever silenced, and that the prosecution must present their cries for justice; comparing your task to that of our service men abroad, who are responding to our national tragedy of September 11; that the voices of the dead are calling from the grave for justice; that the victims\u2019 voices are crying from the ground asking for justice; biblical references specifically to Cain and Abel; repeated use of the word slaughtered to refer to the murders; and references to choices between good and evil and right and wrong. You must not allow any of these references to play any part in your ultimate decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u201cI want to emphasize to you that you are not here to make moral judgments about the defendant, the victims or anyone else. This is not a case about good versus evil or about religious principles. You are not here to decide whether the defendant is a good person or a bad person. You are here only to decide whether or not the defendant is guilty or not guilty, based on the evidence presented ... by the state here, in this courtroom, and nothing else.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\"> We also decline the defendant\u2019s suggestion that we invoke our supervisory authority to reverse his conviction. As we previously have described, \u201cwe may invoke our inherent supervisory authority in cases in which prosecutorial [impropriety] is not so egregious as to implicate the defendant\u2019s . . . right to a fair trial . . . [but] when the prosecutor deliberately engages in conduct that he or she knows, or ought to know, is improper. ... We have cautioned, however, that [s]uch a sanction generally is appropriate . . . only when the [prosecutor\u2019s] conduct is so offensive to the sound administration of justice that only a new trial can effectively prevent such assaults on the integrity of the tribunal. . . . Accordingly, in cases in which prosecutorial misconduct does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation, we will exercise our supervisory authority to reverse an otherwise lawful conviction only when the drastic remedy of a new trial is clearly necessary to deter the alleged prosecutorial misconduct in the future.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 422-23, 844 A.2d 810 (2004). In the present case, we do not view the prosecutor\u2019s conduct as necessitating this draconian remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
