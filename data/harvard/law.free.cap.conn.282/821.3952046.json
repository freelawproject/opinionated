Hopkins, brought the present action against the defendant, Michael J. O\u2019Con-nor, a Madison police officer, in his individual capacity, alleging that the defendant, after causing the plaintiff to be transported to Yale-New Haven Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, falsely and maliciously had defamed him in a police incident report and unreasonably had published private information about that incident to the plaintiffs coworkers. The defendant moved for summary judgment, claiming that he is entitled to absolute immunity from suit because the statements at issue were in furtherance of a judicial proceeding, namely, a commitment proceeding. The trial court determined that, because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct in taking the plaintiff into custody or any subsequent proceeding that occurred as a result . . . constituted a hearing before a tribunal performing a judicial function,\u201d the defendant had not established that he was entitled to absolute immunity and that summary judgment, therefore, was not appropriate. The defendant now appeals from that decision. We conclude that, although certain statements by the defendant were made within the scope of a judicial proceeding, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the defendant was not entitled to absolute immunity in light of the specific allegations in the plaintiffs complaint. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The record discloses the following undisputed facts. On September 2, 2003, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-503 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant took the plaintiff into involuntary custody and caused him to be transported to Yale-New Haven Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation based on the defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that the plaintiff was suicidal. The genesis of the decision to transport the plaintiff had been a telephone call to the Madison police department from the plaintiffs friend, Steven Shaw, an emergency medical technician at a Madison ambulance service, who informed the police that the plaintiff had threatened to kill himself. The plaintiff, who owned several firearms, recently had been placed on leave from his position as a correction officer for the department of correction. The defendant was dispatched to Shaw\u2019s place of employment and, following his determination that the plaintiff was in need of help, executed the written form mandated under \u00a7 17a-503 (a) prior to transporting the plaintiff. Later that day, the defendant prepared an incident report, pursuant to police department requirements, in which he stated that Shaw had told him that the plaintiff stated that he \u201cwas going to kill his [former] coworkers . . . and [then] shoot himself.\u201d The defendant also contacted the department of correction as part of his investigation to verify that the plaintiff was an employee and to apprise the department of correction that the plaintiff had been committed to a psychiatric facility because he was suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>The plaintiff thereafter commenced the present action against the defendant in his individual capacity, alleging that the defendant had committed: (1) defamation per se by falsely and maliciously stating in the incident report that the plaintiff had threatened to kill his coworkers; and (2) an invasion of privacy by the unreasonable publication of details of his private life in disclosing to persons at the department of correction that the plaintiff had been committed to a psychiatric facility because he was suicidal. The defendant filed an answer admitting that he had transported the plaintiff to the hospital, prepared an incident report, provided that report to the department of correction and spoken to a department of correction representative. He denied that he had acted falsely, maliciously or unreasonably. He also asserted six special defenses, including that he is shielded from suit by the doctrine of absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that he is entitled to absolute immunity because his conduct occurred during his participation in a judicial proceeding. Specifically, he contended that his actions were merely the initial steps of a commitment proceeding and that the plaintiffs involuntary commitment to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation was, therefore, a \u201cjudicial proceeding where the plaintiff was being protected from hurting himself and possibly putting the lives of others at risk.\u201d Additionally, he contended that the statements to the plaintiffs employer were \u201can integral part of his investigation in furtherance of the commitment proceeding.\u201d In support of his motion, the defendant submitted a number of exhibits, none of which, according to the trial court, demonstrated that \u201cany subsequent proceeding that occurred as a result [of the defendant\u2019s actions] . . . constituted a hearing before a tribunal performing a judicial function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Before reaching that conclusion, however, the trial court began with a brief synopsis of the pertinent legal principles that guided its analysis of the issue. First, the court cited to the \u201clong-standing common law rule that communications uttered or published in the course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged so long as they are in some way pertinent to the subject of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>200 Conn. 243, 245-46, 510 A.2d 1337 (1986). Additionally, the court recognized that the absolute privilege that is granted to statements made in furtherance of a judicial proceeding extends to every step of the proceeding until final disposition. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>221 Conn. 549, 565-66, 606 A.2d 693 (1992). The court noted that the effect of an absolute privilege in a defamation action is that damages cannot be recovered for a defamatory statement even if it is published falsely and maliciously. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>271 Conn. 78, 84, 856 A.2d 372 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Turning to the case at hand, the court recognized that \u201c[t]he judicial proceeding to which [absolute] immunity attaches has not been defined very exactly\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; and opined that an absolute privilege likely would apply to a Probate Court proceeding held to determine whether a person should be committed to a psychiatric facility. It concluded, however, that the evidence did not provide any basis that would enable it to conclude that \u201cthe events giving rise to the plaintiffs claims occurred before, during or after any such proceeding. Essentially, the only facts that are established by the evidence are that the defendant, a police officer, took the plaintiff into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a), because he had reasonable cause to believe that the plaintiff had psychiatric disabilities or was gravely disabled and in need of immediate care. Without more, however, these facts do not establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct occurred in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>text of a judicial proceeding to which absolute immunity applies. Such a scenario does not fit even the broadest definition of \u2018judicial proceeding ....\u201d\u2019 In reaching its decision, the court turned to the language of \u00a7 17a-503, and reasoned that it \u201capplies to actions taken <em>prior </em>to a commitment proceeding and, therefore, <em>prior </em>to a judicial proceeding. . . . Pursuant to this language, therefore, proof that the defendant took the plaintiff into custody is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish the existence of a judicial proceeding.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Finally, the court remarked that the defendant\u2019s contention assumed that the issue of the plaintiffs involuntary commitment had been addressed by a court and that the safeguards of the commitment proceedings had attached, but concluded that the evidence did not demonstrate that any commitment proceeding had been held. Therefore, the trial court concluded that the defendant was not entitled to absolute immunity and, accordingly, denied his motion for summaiy judgment. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the trial court, albeit on different grounds as to one of the two counts. See <em>Kelley </em>v. Bonney, supra, 221 Conn. 592 (\u201c[w]here the trial court reaches a correct decision but on mistaken grounds, this court has repeatedly sustained the trial court\u2019s action if proper grounds exist to support it\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">We begin with a brief discussion of our jurisdiction to consider this appeal, noting that, as a general rule, an interlocutory ruling may not be appealed pending the final disposition of a case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983) (right of appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>purely statutory and \u201cis limited to appeals by aggrieved parties from final judgments\u201d). The denial of a motion for summary judgment ordinarily is an interlocutory ruling and, accordingly, is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal. \u201cWe previously have determined [however] that certain interlocutory orders have the attributes of a final judgment and consequently are appealable under [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-263.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Specyalski, </em>268 Conn. 336, 345-46 n.13, 844 A.2d 211 (2004). We have recognized that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is immediately appealable when the motion is predicated upon a colorable claim of absolute immunity based on sovereign immunity. See <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>253 Conn. 134, 164-67, 749 A.2d 1147 (2000), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 327, 828 A.2d 549 (2003). In so concluding, we observed \u201cthat the subjection of the state and federal governments to private litigation might constitute a serious interference with the performance of their functions and with their control over their respective instrumentalities, funds and property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 165-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">In <em>Chadha </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em>272 Conn. 776, 865 A.2d 1163 (2005), we found this rationale also to be applicable to the absolute immunity afforded participants in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. \u201cOur determination is dictated by the underlying purpose of the immunity afforded at common law to those who provide information in connection with judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings, namely, that in certain situations the public interest in having people speak freely outweighs the risk that individuals will occasionally abuse the privilege by making false and malicious statements. . . . Put simply, absolute immunity furthers the public policy of encouraging participation and candor in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>objective would be thwarted if those persons whom the common-law doctrine was intended to protect nevertheless faced the threat of suit. In this regard, the purpose of the absolute immunity afforded participants in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings is the same as the purpose of the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the state. Thus, for the same reason that the rejection of a colorable claim of sovereign immunity gives rise to an immediately appealable final judgment \u2014 that is, to protect against the threat of suit \u2014 so, too, does the rejection of a colorable claim of absolute immunity based upon participation in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 786-87. As in <em>Chadha, </em>the defendant\u2019s claim of absolute immunity in the present case is colorable because our case law consistently has recognized absolute immunity in connection with such proceedings. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, which had been filed on the basis of colorable claim of absolute immunity, constitutes an appealable final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">We next set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing . . . that the party is . . . entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cantonbury Heights Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>Land Development, LLC, </em>273 Conn. 724, 733, 873 A.2d 898 (2005). In addition, the determination of whether a commitment proceeding constitutes a judicial proceeding is a question of law over which our review is plenary. Whether particular conduct is by its nature part of or in furtherance of a judicial proceeding for the purposes of triggering absolute immunity, however, depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 83-84. With this standard of review in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The defendant contends that he is absolutely immune from suit because the statement contained in his incident report and the statement he made to the plaintiffs former employer, even if defamatory and invasive of the plaintiffs privacy, had been made in furtherance of a judicial proceeding, irrespective of whether such conduct preceded a formal adjudication. He points to the cases wherein we have held that a judicial proceeding includes \u201clunacy . . . proceedings\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 84; see <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 566; and contends that the trial court improperly focused on whether the plaintiff ultimately was brought before a court in deciding whether he should be afforded absolute immunity. The defendant also contends that he should be absolutely immune from suit on public policy grounds. We conclude that, because the statement contained in his incident report fell within the scope of a judicial proceeding, the defendant ultimately may be protected by qualified or absolute immunity for that statement, but we further conclude that he is not entitled to immunity for his statement to persons at the department of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">It is well settled that \u201ccommunications uttered or published in the course of judicial proceedings are abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>lutely privileged so long as they are in some way pertinent to the subject of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 245-46. It is generally held that so-called \u201clunacy proceedings\u201d are a judicial proceeding within the rule of absolute privilege. See <em>Jarman </em>v. <em>Offutt, </em>239 N.C. 468, 472, 80 S.E.2d 248 (1954); 50 Am. Jur. 2d, Libel and Slander \u00a7 281 (2006); annot., 66 A.L.R. 1257 (1930); annot., 2 A.L.R. 1582 (1919). Indeed, we often have stated as much. See <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 84-85 (\u201cThe judicial proceeding to which [absolute] immunity attaches . . . includes any hearing before a tribunal which performs a judicial function, ex parte or otherwise, and whether the hearing is public or not. It includes, for example, lunacy, bankruptcy, or naturalization proceedings, and an election contest.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 566 (same); <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 246 (same). Because of the significant procedural protections afforded in commitment proceedings,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in the absence of any reason to differentiate that proceeding from the so-called \u201clunacy\u201d proceedings, we conclude that commitment proceedings are judicial proceedings to which immunity attaches.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>The scope of privileged communication extends not merely to those made directly to a tribunal, but also to those preparatory communications that may be directed to the goal of the proceeding. As this court previously has recognized: \u201cThe right of private parties to combine and make presentations to an official meeting and, as a necessary incident thereto, to prepare materials to be presented is a fundamental adjunct to the right of access to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. To make such preparations and presentations effective, there must be an open channel of communication between the persons interested and the forum, unchilled by the thought of subsequent judicial action against such participants; provided always, of course, that such preliminary meetings, conduct and activities are directed toward the achievement of the objects of the litigation or other proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 574; see also <em>Alexandra </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>79 Conn. App. 434, 438, 830 A.2d 702 (\u201cIt is well settled that communications uttered or published in the course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged so long as they are in some way pertinent to the subject of the controversy. . . . The privilege applies also to statements made in pleadings or other documents prepared in connection with a court proceeding.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert, denied, 266 Conn. 925, 835 A.2d 471 (2003). Similarly, the fact that the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>of the plaintiffs commitment had not yet culminated in a Probate Court hearing at the time the communication was made is not dispositive. See <em>McManus </em>v. Sweeney, 78 Conn. App. 327, 335, 827 A.2d 702 (2003) (Recognizing that absolute privilege is available when the defamatory matter \u201chas some reference to the subject matter of the proposed or pending litigation, although it need not be strictly relevant to any issue involved in it. ... 3 Restatement [Second], [Torts] \u00a7 586, comment [c] [1977].\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); see also <em>Ramstead </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>219 Or. 383, 394, 347 P.2d 594 (1959) (Noting that \u201c[t]he fact that the complaint made by the defendant to the grievance committee did not eventuate in a formal hearing before a committee of the bar or before the Board of Governors does not preclude the application of the rule of absolute privilege. The privilege extends to pleadings and other papers made a part of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding even though such proceeding is in its preliminary stage and no formal judicial action has been taken.\u201d); 3 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 587 (defining scope of privilege generally as follows: \u201c[a] party to a private litigation or a private prosecutor or defendant in a criminal prosecution is absolutely privileged to publish false and defamatory matter of another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course and as a part of a judicial proceeding in which he participates, if the matter has some relation to the proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether the communications that form the subject of the plaintiffs complaint were made as part of steps attendant to a commitment proceeding. Because the defendant points to \u00a7 17a-503 (a), the statute under which he acted, as establishing the requisite connection to a judicial proceeding, we turn first to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Section 17a-503 (a) is located in part II of chapter 319i of the General Statutes. Part II, entitled \u201cCommitment. General Provisions,\u201d sets forth the procedures and certain protections attendant to commitment of persons with psychiatric disabilities to hospitals for persons with such conditions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 17a-503 (a) specifically provides: \u201cAny police officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a person has psychiatric disabilities and. is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, and in need of immediate care and treatment, may take such person into custody and take or cause such person to be taken to a general hospital for emergency examination under this section. The officer shall execute a written request for emergency examination detailing the circumstances under which the person was taken into custody, and such request shall be left with the facility. <em>The person shall be examined within twenty-four hours and shall not be held for more than seventy-two hours unless committed under section 17a-502.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 17a-502<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in turn provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person who a physician concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>or others or gravely disabled, and is in need of immediate care and treatment in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities, may be confined in such a hospital, either public or private, under an emergency certificate as hereinafter provided for not more than fifteen days without order of any court, unless a written application for commitment of such person has been filed in a probate court prior to the expiration of the fifteen days, in which event such commitment is continued under the emergency certificate for an additional fifteen days or until the completion of probate proceedings, whichever occurs first. . . . (d) If any person detained under this section . . . requests a hearing in writing, such hearing shall be held within seventy-two hours of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>receipt of such request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. At such hearing, the person shall have the right to be present, to cross-examine all witnesses testifying, and to be represented by counsel as provided in section 17a-498. The hearing may be requested at any time prior to the initiation of proceedings under section 17a-498. The hearing shall be held by the court of probate having jurisdiction for commitment as provided in section 17a-497 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-497 and 17a-498 in turn vest the Probate Court with jurisdiction over such commitment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In light of the fact that a police officer\u2019s actions under \u00a7 17a-503 result in a person being detained in a psychiatric hospital for evaluation to determine whether further detention and ultimately commitment are proper, it is clear that statements made in the course of such actions are the first step in the \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d of a judicial proceeding. <em>Wollam </em>v. <em>Brandt, </em>154 Or. App. 156, 164, 961 P.2d 219 (1998). It would, in our view, make no sense to make the police officer\u2019s immunity dependent on the outcome of that evaluation and whether the psychiatrist determines that commitment is appropriate. Indeed, we note that, under \u00a7 17a-502, to which \u00a7 17a-503 (a) expressly refers, a person detained under an emergency certificate <em>prior to commitment </em>may obtain a hearing before the Probate Court to which all of the same procedural protections that are available in a formal commitment proceeding also attach, except the right to appeal. Compare footnotes 3 and 5 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that a police officer\u2019s actions pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 are sufficiently connected to a commitment proceeding to warrant absolute immunity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the present case, however, the basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>plaintiffs action is not the statements made by the defendant in his written request for an emergency examination under \u00a7 17a-503. Rather, it is his statements in the incident report and to the department of correction. We therefore turn to each of those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">We begin with the allegedly defamatory statement in the incident report. \u201cA defamatory statement is defined as a communication that tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him .... To establish a prima facie case of defamation, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) the defendant published a defamatory statement; (2) the defamatory statement identified the plaintiff to a third person; (3) the defamatory statement was published to a third person; and (4) the plaintiffs reputation suffered injury as a result of the statement.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cweklinsky </em>v. <em>Mobil Chemical Co., </em>267 Conn. 210, 217, 837 A.2d 759 (2004). As this court has stated on several occasions, and as the trial court recognized, if, however, the communications are uttered or published in the course of judicial proceedings, even if they are published falsely and maliciously, they nevertheless are absolutely privileged provided they are pertinent to the subject of the controversy. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">\u201cThe policy underlying the privilege is that in certain situations the public interest in having people speak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>freely outweighs the risk that individuals will occasionally abuse the privilege by making false and malicious statements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 246. The rationale underlying the privilege is grounded upon the proper and efficient administration of justice. 50 Am. Jur. 2d, Libel and Slander \u00a7 299 (1995). Participants in a judicial process must be able to testify or otherwise take part without being hampered by fear of defamation suits. Id. Therefore, in determining whether a statement is made in the course of a judicial proceeding, \u201cit is important to consider whether there is a sound public policy reason for permitting the complete freedom of expression that a grant of absolute immunity provides.\u201d <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 567. In making that determination, the court must decide as a matter of law whether the allegedly defamatory statements are sufficiently relevant to the issues involved in a proposed or ongoing judicial proceeding, so as to qualify for the privilege. The test for relevancy is generous, and \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d has been defined liberally to encompass much more than civil litigation or criminal trials. Id., 566-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In the present case, the trial court reasoned that an absolute privilege likely would apply to a Probate Court proceeding to determine whether a person should be committed to a psychiatric facility under \u00a7 17a-502, but concluded that the evidence did not provide any basis that would enable it to conclude that the events that gave rise to the plaintiffs claims occurred before, during or after any such proceeding. Because he had provided an uncontradicted affidavit attesting that the incident report he prepared following his delivery of the plaintiff to the hospital was mandated by police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>department procedures,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> however, the defendant claims that the report was made pursuant to and in furtherance of a commitment proceeding; in other words, it was a mandatoiy step in the process of the plaintiffs commitment, should a court so order. Accordingly, he claims that the trial court improperly interpreted the conduct prescribed under \u00a7 17a-503 \u2014 transportation of a person involuntarily for a psychiatric examination \u2014 in isolation from \u00a7 17a-502 \u2014 commitment proceedings subsequent to psychiatric examination \u2014 thereby failing to appreciate that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s actions were part of a process.\u201d Citing to <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 78, the defendant reasons that whether he is afforded absolute immunity should not depend upon whether the plaintiff ultimately was brought before a court. As he points out, in <em>Craig, </em>we deemed the citizen complaint alleging police misconduct absolutely privileged independent of whether the police department later took disciplinary action against the officer. Id., 93. Therefore, regardless of whether the plaintiff ultimately was committed to a psychiatric hospital,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant contends that the trial court should have focused on the <em>process, </em>in this case, the mandatory report pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503, which was an essential step in the plaintiffs involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">We find the defendant\u2019s reasoning persuasive. As we explained in part I of this opinion, merely because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>mandatory police incident report was a preliminary step does not alter its fundamental nature. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 574; <em>Alexandru </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 438. Similarly, the fact that the issue of the plaintiffs commitment had not yet culminated in a Probate Court hearing was not dispositive. See <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>supra, 78 Conn. App. 335; <em>Rams tead </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 219 Or. 394. It is significant that, in order for the defendant to commence the commitment process, he was required under police department procedures to prepare this report. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Presumably, this report would duplicate the allegations set forth in the \u201cwritten request for emergency examination detailing the circumstances under which the person was taken into custody\u201d mandated under \u00a7 17a-503 (a), which we already have concluded would be covered by absolute immunity. Should the report meaningfully differ from that written request, it also would bear a connection to a potential commitment proceeding because it could be used during such a proceeding as evidence, or for purposes of examining or impeaching the defendant. Cf. <em>Carradine </em>v. <em>State, </em>511 N.W.2d 733, 736 (Minn. 1994) (Citing as part of the rationale for immunity for preparation of the police arrest report: \u201c[T]he report typically is useful not only to the [police] officer\u2019s departmental superiors but also to the prosecutor in determining whether to charge the arrestee and, if so, what offense(s) to charge .... [T]he police report often plays a significant role in the trial of a criminal defendant, with the prosecutor using the report to refresh the officer\u2019s recollection and with defense counsel using the report to cross-examine and attempt to impeach the officer . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Were our analysis to end here, we would conclude that the defendant\u2019s preparation of a mandatory report in connection with the statutory scheme governing the plaintiffs involuntary commitment is part of a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>proceeding falling within the rule of absolute privilege. Our analysis, however, does not end here. Our review of other pertinent provisions in the statutory scheme governing commitment proceedings has led us to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-504, which provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully and maliciously causes, or attempts to cause, or who conspires with any other person to cause, any person who does not have psychiatric disabilities to be committed to any hospital for psychiatric disabilities, and any person who wilfully certifies falsely to the psychiatric disabilities of any person in any certificate provided for in sections 17a-75to 17a-83, inclusive, 17a-450 to 17a-484, inclusive, 17a-495 to 17a-528, inclusive, 17a-540 to 17a-550, inclusive, 17a-560 to 17a-576, inclusive, and 17a-615 to 17a-618, inclusive, and any person who, under the provisions of said sections relating to persons with psychiatric disabilities, wilfully reports falsely to any court or judge that any person has psychiatric disabilities, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This provision, which imposes criminal liability, raises a question as to how it impacts our policy underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>ing the privilege that in certain situations the public interest in having people speak freely outweighs the risk that individuals will occasionally abuse the privilege by making false and malicious statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">To answer that question, we turn first to whether the legislature intended to abrogate the common law. Under well established rules of statutory construction, \u201c[w]hile the legislature\u2019s authority to abrogate the common law is undeniable, we will not lightly impute such an intent to the legislature. . . . Thus, [w]hen a statute is in derogation of common law ... it should receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of [statutory] construction. ... In determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope. . . . Although the legislature may eliminate a common law right by statute, the presumption that the legislature does not have such a purpose can be overcome only if the legislative intent is clearly and plainly expressed. . . . The rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed can be seen to serve the same policy of continuity and stability in the legal system as the doctrine of stare decisis in relation to case law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chadha </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 788-89; <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>249 Conn. 709, 715, 735 A.2d 306 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Although through \u00a7 17a-504 the legislature imposed criminal sanctions against anyone who wilfully and maliciously attempts, causes or conspires to have someone committed who does not have psychiatric disabilities, we cannot conclude that the language of the legislature plainly and unambiguously reflects <em>clear </em>legislative intent to abrogate the common-law absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>immunity applicable to statements made in connection with commitment proceedings. Indeed, were we to conclude otherwise, we not only would be construing a statute in derogation of the common law, but we also would be creating a liability where formerly none existed. <em>Vitanza </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>257 Conn. 365, 381, 778 A.2d 829 (2001). Therefore, construing \u00a7 17a-504 strictly as we must, we conclude that the statute is limited to matters clearly brought within its scope, and accordingly, bears no relation to civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Our interpretive journey, however, is not yet finished, because we recognize that it is illogical to punish someone criminally for engaging in certain conduct but protect them civilly <em>absolutely </em>and under all circumstances for the same behavior. In other words, we recognize that the policy reflected in \u00a7 17a-504 is inconsistent with the common-law absolute immunity otherwise applicable to statements made in connection with the commitment proceedings. We therefore conclude that we reasonably cannot give effect both to the imposition of criminal liability that this provision explicitly provides, on the one hand, and to the absolute immunity existing at common law, on the other. Accordingly, although we do not read \u00a7 17a-504 as an expression of the legislature\u2019s intent to abrogate absolute immunity for defamatory documents prepared in connection with a commitment proceeding, \u201cit is well established that \u2018statutes are a useful source of policy for common-law adjudication, particularly when there is a close relationship between the statutory and common-law subject matters.\u2019 <em>DeMaria </em>v. <em>DeMaria, </em>247 Conn. 715, 721, 724 A.2d 1088 (1999); see <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>227 Conn. 505, 514, 630 A.2d 1328 (1993); see also <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 580-86, 657 A.2d 212 (1995); <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>227 Conn. 270, 281-82, 630 A.2d 1010 (1993); <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 Conn. 756, 762, 463 A.2d 242 (1983); <em>Conference </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>Center Ltd. </em>v. <em>TRC, </em>189 Conn. 212, 225, 455 A.2d 857 (1983); <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>180 Conn. 491, 494-95, 429 A.2d 946 (1980). [Indeed, as we recently have noted] \u2018[statutes are now central to the law in the courts, and judicial lawmaking must take statutes into account virtually all of the time .... Hardly ever is a statute now regarded as a candidate for narrow construction because it may be in derogation of the common law. More often, the issue is rather to what extent a statute <em>is itself a source of policy for consistent common law development.\u2019\u2019 . . . </em>E. Peters, \u2018Common Law Judging in a Statutory World: An Address,\u2019 43 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 995, 998 (1982); see generally J. Landis, \u2018Statutes and the Sources of Law,\u2019 Harvard Legal Essays (R. Pound ed. 1934) p. 213; G. Calabresi, A Common Law for the Age of Statutes (1982).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>C &amp; J Builders &amp; Remodelers, LLC </em>v. <em>Geisenheimer, </em>249 Conn. 415, 419-20, 733 A.2d 193 (1999). We consider this adjudicative technique to be appropriate in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In light of the fact that \u00a7 17a-504 proscribes certain <em>malicious </em>conduct in connection with a commitment proceeding, we are mindful that a showing of such intent is consistent with a qualified immunity. We previously have held that the malice required to overcome a qualified privilege in defamation cases is malice in fact or actual malice. See, e.g., <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 1, 28, 662 A.2d 89 (1995) (\u201c[w]hether the privilege was abused . . . depends upon whether there was malice in fact\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Hassett </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>85 Conn. 23, 35-36, 81 A. 1013 (1911) (\u201c[o]ne publishing defamatory words under a qualified or conditional privilege is only liable upon proof of express malice\u201d). We can perceive no reason, and the parties have provided us with none, to apply a different definition of malice in the context of this case. Therefore, consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>the policy expressed in \u00a7 17a-504 and our jurisprudence on malice, we conclude that it is appropriate to afford only a qualified immunity to persons acting pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 if their conduct falls within the proscriptions against malicious conduct under \u00a7 17a-504. See <em>Chadha </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 790 (noting that distinction between qualified immunity and absolute immunity is that persons protected by latter immunity are not hable for malicious \u201cconduct and statements\u201d). Provision of only qualified immunity in some areas that have a connection to the judicial process is not a total anomaly. See <em>Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 340-45,106 S. Ct. 1092, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1986) (complaining witness who initiates prosecution and procures issuance of arrest warrant has only qualified immunity at common law and police officer who submits affidavit for arrest warrant has only qualified immunity for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983); <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 557, 87 S. Ct. 1213, 18 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1967) (police officer sued for false arrest under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 has only qualified immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Turning to the pleadings in the present case, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant \u201cfalsely and maliciously\u201d included a statement in his report that Shaw had reported that the plaintiff threatened to kill his coworkers. The defendant admitted including the statement in his report, but denied that he had acted falsely and maliciously. \u201cActual malice requires that the statement, when made, be made with actual knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false. ... A negligent misstatement of fact will not suffice; the evidence must demonstrate a purposeful avoidance of the truth.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Abdelsayed </em>v. <em>Narumanchi, </em>39 Conn. App. 778, 781, 668 A.2d 378 (1995), cert, denied, 237 Conn. 915, 676 A.2d 397, cert, denied, 519 U.S. 868, 117 S. Ct. 180, 136 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1996). \u201cMalice in fact is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>sufficiently shown by proof that the publications were made with improper and unjustifiable motives.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whiteside, </em>148 Conn. 208, 212, 169 A.2d 260, cert, denied, 368 U.S. 830, 82 S.

The pleadings in this case, though sparse, use the talismanic language of malice and, accordingly, state a cause of action. In so doing, the plaintiff has insulated himself, for the moment,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> from summary judgment because, generally speaking, \u201c[ajlthough the ultimate determination of whether qualified immunity applies is ordinarily a question of law for the court, when . . . there are unresolved factual issues material to the applicability of the defense . . . resolution of those factual issues is properly left to the jury. <em>Oliveira </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>23 F.3d 642, 649 (2d Cir. 1994) [cert, denied, 513 U.S. 1076, 115 S.

Ct. 326, 145 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1999). Accordingly, as to the first count, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">We turn next to the second count, wherein the plaintiff alleges that the defendant unreasonably published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>details of the plaintiffs private life by improperly disclosing to persons working for the department of correction that the plaintiff had been committed to a psychiatric facility because he was suicidal. The defendant contends that this conduct was also part of the judicial proceeding that gave rise to absolute immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Although \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d has been defined liberally, encompassing much more than civil litigation or criminal trials; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 566; the communication by the defendant to the plaintiffs supervisors or fellow workers cannot fall within even the most expansive definition of that term. The decision to inform others, unconnected with the process of the plaintiffs commitment, even if properly motivated out of concern for their safety, was in no way directed toward the achievement of the objects of litigation or any other proceedings. Because that communication was not made pursuant to or in furtherance of a commitment proceeding, the trial court properly concluded that the defendant was not entitled to immunity on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The defendant also claims, however, that he is entitled to absolute immunity on public policy grounds. Specifically, he claims that allowing a potential civil action would undermine the strong public policy of encouraging professionals to report concerns regarding the safety of others posed by the threat of violence against them. We decline to address the defendant\u2019s public policy argument because it is premature. Such questions require not only a legal determination of whether police officers have a duty to warn generally, but also require predicate factual findings to determine whether the specific facts would give rise to such a duty, should one exist. See <em>Fraser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>236 Conn. 625, 626, 674 A.2d 811 (1996) (concluding in light of extensive stipulation of facts that it was proper \u201cin the circumstances presented herein, [to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>whether] psychotherapists undertaking the treatment of a psychiatric outpatient assumed a duty to exercise control over the patient to prevent the patient from committing an act of violence against a third person\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the second count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-503 (a) provides: \u201cAny police officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a person has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, and in need of immediate care and treatment, may take such person into custody and take or cause such person to be taken to a general hospital for emergency examination under this section.

Houley. \u201cThis bill is designed to provide safeguards against the arbitrary commitment of individuals alleged to be mentally ill and seeks to [e]nsure treatment of all seriously mentally ill persons with requiring actual evidence of prior dangerous acts before commitment.\u201d 20 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1977 Sess., p. 5781, remarks of Representative Ernest Abate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\"> The defendant attested in his affidavit: \u201cIt is standard protocol in the Madison [p]olice [department for a case incident report to be drafted in situations involving threats of suicide by an individual and threats of harm to others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b864-8\"> As part of his motion for summary judgment, the defendant submitted a transcript of Shaw\u2019s deposition, wherein Shaw testified that the plaintiff had telephoned him and related that he had been committed and was being transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital in Hartford. The plaintiff did not dispute this history either in his opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment or at the hearing on that motion. Because the trial court made no findings as to this specific evidence and because we conclude that a formal commitment proceeding is not required before the protections of absolute immunity attach, we afford no significance to this evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b866-6\"> The penalties in \u00a7 17a-504 for conspiring to cause aperson to be committed who is not under a psychiatric disability and for falsely certifying or making a false statement to a judge or court that a person is under a psychiatric disability have existed in their essential form since 1889. Public Acts 1889, c. 162, \u00a7 23, provides: \u201cEvery person who wilfully conspires with any other person unlawfully to commit to an asylum any person who is not insane, and any person who shall wilfully and falsely certify to the insanity of any person in any certificate made and filed as provided for in this act, and any person who, under the provisions of sections 487 and 3683 and 3692 of the general statutes, shall wilfully and falsely report to any court or judge that any person is insane, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding five years, or both.\u201d In the 1889 act, any person could file a complaint in the Probate Court to commence commitment proceedings. See Public Acts 1889, c. 162, \u00a7 4. As we previously have noted in footnote 4 of this opinion, there is no legislative history to the 1889 Public Act, however, to determine specifically whether the legislature intended for this provision to abrogate applicable common-law immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b871-7\"> We note that, unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s statement was made with the malicious intent of achieving the proscribed result under \u00a7 17a-504, the defendant is entitled to absolute immunity. We further note that when allegations are conclusory, they do not, themselves, equate to a factual showing that the defendants\u2019 actions were taken with malice. \u201cMere statements of legal conclusions . . . and bald assertions, without more, [generally] are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact capable of defeating summary judgment.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>27 Conn. App. 162, 170, 604 A.2d 1339, aff'd, 224 Conn. 240, 618 A.2d 506 (1992). Instead, the plaintiff must plead specific facts, which, if true, would allow a fact finder to reach the conclusion that the defendant did indeed act with malice. In the present case, because the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment reasonably was predicated on the defense of absolute immunity traditionally afforded to judicial proceedings, and the issue of qualified immunity had not emerged in light of our well established common-law jurisprudence regarding judicial proceedings, the sufficiency of the plaintiffs pleadings regarding malice was not raised. Therefore, we do not decide the propriety of the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on that basis and we leave that opportunity for another day should the issue emerge later in the course of this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\"> It is important to note that, in the present case, the parties have not claimed that the question of whether the defendant is entitled to absolute immunity is informed by policy considerations separate and apart from those embedded in the judicial proceeding contemplated by the specific statutory scheme at issue and whether the defendant\u2019s statements were made in the course of that proceeding. For purposes of the present case, therefore, we do not consider any such separate policy considerations. Furthermore, as we have acknowledged, the judicial proceeding to which the immunity attaches has not been defined with precision. That decision in any given case will depend on many factors, including the nature of the function assigned to the police officer and the relationship of the statements to the performance of that function. In this case, the defendant was acting pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503, serving less in a law enforcement capacity than in a health and safety capacity, as evidenced by the fact that the statement at issue in this <em>case followed </em>the defendant\u2019s written request for an emergency examination under \u00a7 17a-503. Additionally, the presence of other safeguards against any abuse of power by the officer, which are provided by the unique statutory scheme at play in this case \u2014 such as immediate psychiatric evaluation \u2014 weighs heavily as a factor that informs the policy considerations relevant to the question of whether absolute immunity should attach. See <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 568, 663 A.2d 317 (1995) (\u201c[a] major consideration in allowing absolute immunity for prosecutors has been the recognition that disciplinary procedures exist to regulate prosecutorial misconduct\u201d). Accordingly, although we have concluded that the defendant in the present case otherwise would be afforded absolute immunity were it not for \u00a7 17a-504, we caution against any extension of the limited holding in this case to other contexts wherein the competing consideration may not yield the same result in the balance. See <em>Mozzochi </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>204 Conn. 490, 495, 529 A.2d 171 (1987) (providing attorneys, as officers of court, absolute immunity from liability for allegedly defamatory communications in course of judicial proceedings, but concluding that \u201c[f]or other causes of action, however, the exigencies of the adversary system have not been deemed to require absolute immunity for attorneys\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
