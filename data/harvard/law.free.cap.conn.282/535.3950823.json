We conclude that Farmers\u2019 coverage is primary, and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The following facts are undisputed. Mariano Nasser and Vijay Sharma each rented a vehicle from Hertz. Both men signed Hertz rental agreements in which they declined to purchase Hertz\u2019 liability insurance supplement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In so declining, they agreed, pursuant to the terms of the rental agreement, that their personal insurance would be primary. Sharma and Nasser then were involved in separate traffic accidents with third parties on May 20,2001, and on February 21,2002, respectively, while driving the vehicles they had rented. In both cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the third parties involved in the accidents filed actions against Hertz and Sharma and Nasser, respectively, to recover damages for the injuries the third parties had sustained. At the time of the accidents, Nasser was covered by a personal insurance policy issued by Farmers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Sharma was covered by a personal insurance policy issued by an affiliate of Farmers, Farmers Insurance Company.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Farmers filed a declaratory judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>action against Hertz in the case arising out of Nasser\u2019s accident, and Hertz filed a declaratory judgment action against Farmers in the case arising out of Sharma\u2019s accident. Because of the factual similarity of the cases, the trial court consolidated the actions. Subsequently, Hertz and Farmers each filed motions for summary judgment claiming that the other should be deemed primarily responsible for liability coverage for the accidents. The court denied the motions for summary judgment on the basis of its determination that material issues of fact remained, specifically, those pertaining to Hertz\u2019 self-insurance filing and the representations contained therein regarding minimum liability coverage on its rental vehicles. The court then concluded that a trial was necessary to determine the \u201clegal impact\u201d of the self-insurance filings and state statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">After a trial to the court, the court rendered judgments in the consolidated cases in favor of Hertz, finding that, under the terms of the Hertz rental agreement and Farmers\u2019 insurance policies, and in accordance with the decision of this court in <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 374, 713 A.2d 820 (1998), the liability coverage provided by Farmers was primary and the coverage provided by Hertz was secondary. The court determined that, by declining to purchase the liability insurance supplement from Hertz, the renters had agreed that their valid and collectible liability coverage from Farmers would be primary for any accident involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ing the vehicles they had rented from Hertz. The court further concluded that this interpretation conformed to the Farmers\u2019 policies because, according to then-terms, the coverage Farmers provided for vehicles not owned by the insured was excess only to other applicable liability insurance, which the renters in this case had declined to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Farmers appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There are two related issues on appeal. The first is whether, under our statutory and regulatory scheme, Hertz is required to provide <em>primary </em>liability coverage on its rented vehicles. If we answer this question in the negative, we then must determine whether the trial court properly considered the Hertz rental agreement in determining the priority of coverage as between Hertz and Farmers in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Farmers claims that the statutory scheme mandates that Hertz, as owner of the vehicle, is \u201cexpressly and exclusively\u201d responsible for providing liability coverage, and that the trial court improperly determined that Hertz was under no such obligation. Farmers further contends that the trial court improperly relied on Hertz\u2019 rental agreement to determine the order of coverage, rather than on Hertz\u2019 self-insurance filing with the state. Hertz responds that the trial court properly determined that it was not statutorily obligated to provide primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>liability coverage on its rented vehicles and that, pursuant to its rental agreement, Hertz\u2019 coverage was secondary to that provided by Nasser\u2019s insurance policy with Farmers. We agree with Hertz.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We turn first to Farmers\u2019 contention that Hertz is obligated by our statutory and regulatory scheme to provide primary liability coverage on its rented vehicles. We begin with the standard of review and the applicable legal principles guiding our analysis. \u201cBecause the interpretation of . . . [statutes and] regulations presents a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jewett City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>280 Conn. 274, 278, 907 A.2d 67 (2006). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kinsey </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>277 Conn. 398, 405, 891 A.2d 959 (2006). With these principles in mind, we review the applicable statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and regulations governing Connecticut\u2019s motor vehicle liability insurance scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Our statutory and regulatory scheme guarantees coverage for legal liability incurred in the use of motor vehicles and allocates the responsibility for that coverage to the owner of the vehicle. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 describes the mandatory security requirements for the vehicle owner under the state\u2019s no-fault motor vehicle insurance scheme. That section provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he owner of a private passenger motor vehicle required to be registered in this state shall provide and continuously maintain throughout the registration period security in accordance with sections 38a-334 to 38a-343, inclusive [setting forth, inter alia, minimum insurance policy coverage mandated in conformity with regulatory requirements].\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (a) (1). To ensure that a vehicle owner complies with security requirements, General Statutes \u00a7 14-12b<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prohibits the registration of a vehicle absent proof of the owner\u2019s requisite coverage, and \u00a7 38a-371 (e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ensures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>that, even if the owner allows insurance coverage to lapse on a vehicle, the owner will still be liable for damages in the event of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Other statutes dictate that an owner is not relieved of liability simply because the owner is not the operator of the vehicle. General Statutes \u00a7 14-213b<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> proscribes operation of an uninsured vehicle, and places responsibility for adherence to that rule on the owner, even when the owner is not the operator of the vehicle. In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a addresses owners who rent or lease their vehicles, providing in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person renting or leasing to another any motor vehicle owned by him shall be liable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of such motor vehicle while so rented or leased, to the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The legislature, therefore, has made clear, through its use of mandatory language and mutually reinforcing statutes, that, as a general matter, the owner of a vehicle registered in Connecticut is responsible for maintaining liability insurance on that vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-371 (c) and 14-129, Hertz elected to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>vide that security through self-insurance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This court has determined that \u201cthe funding mechanism by which an owner of vehicles decides to meet the requirements of Connecticut insurance law is irrelevant to the obligation of that funding entity to comply with such requirements, [and] that self-insurance is the functional equivalent of commercial insurance.\u201d <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 378 n.4. Thus, in choosing and being approved for self-insurance, Hertz has demonstrated that, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 38a-335,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it independently maintains funds suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>cient to insure the minimum liability coverage imposed by Connecticut law on its vehicles. Additionally, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-15, Hertz was required to procure a license to engage in the business of renting its vehicles and, as a part of the licensing process, to submit a sworn application to the commissioner of motor vehicles that included, inter aha, \u201cproof of financial responsibility satisfactory to the commissioner, as provided by section 14-112 or 14-129 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-15 (a). Thus, there is no doubt that Hertz complied with the applicable requirements and maintained liability coverage on the vehicle that Nasser had rented.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">We discern no provision in the statutes discussed previously, however, expressly mandating that Hertz, as the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident, has the <em>primary </em>obligation to provide liability coverage for any damages incurred in the use of its vehicle. We do not construe the legislature\u2019s requirement that vehicle owners maintain liability coverage as requiring that such owner coverage be primary if other coverage that satisfies the statutory minimum standards is available. It is well settled that \u201cwe decline to engraft additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>requirements onto clear statutory language. . . . [I]n the absence of any indication of the legislature\u2019s intent concerning this issue, we cannot engraft language onto the statute . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>279 Conn. 558, 577, 903 A.2d 201 (2006). Stated conversely, the legislature has not prohibited an owner who has complied with its obligations to maintain coverage from contracting to assume secondary liability if another party is available to assume primary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In fact, under \u00a7 38a-334-5 (g) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the insurance commissioner expressly has authorized insurers to prorate or reallocate loss. Accordingly, this court previously has recognized that insurers may allocate primary responsibility for coverage through the use of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses, such as that contained in the policy Farmers issued to Nasser. See footnote 3 of this opinion. In <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 779, 781, 606 A.2d 990 (1992), we confronted overlapping \u201c \u2018other insurance\u2019 \u201d provisions when the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident was covered both by the vehicle owner\u2019s policy and the policy of her sister and brother-in-law, with whom the driver was residing at the time. In that case, we concluded that \u201c \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses are valid for the purpose of establishing the order of coverage between insurers, as long as their enforcement does not compromise coverage for the insured.\u201d Id., 783. We noted, furthermore, that \u201c[p]ublic policy is not violated when \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses are used for the purpose of establishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>order of payment between insurers. When the insured is afforded full indemnification for a loss, there is no public policy issue controlling how insurers divide coverage among themselves.\u201d Id., 785; see also <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>235 Conn. 837, 841, 669 A.2d 1221 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The fact that Hertz is a self-insurer does not affect its ability to establish the order of payment among other insurers; self-insurers are treated as the equivalent of commercial insurers under our statutory scheme. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (b), \u201c \u2018[i]nsurer\u2019 or \u2018insurance company\u2019 includes a self-insurer ... as provided by section 38a-371.\u201d See also <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>243 Conn. 677, 683, 705 A.2d 1020 (1998) (\u201cupon electing to become a self-insurer, West Haven . . . became an insurer\u201d). In addition, \u00a7 38a-371 (c) (3) requires a self-insurer to provide payment for all liabilities covered by residual liability insurance as well as other obligations imposed by that section \u201csubstantially equivalent to those afforded by a policy of insurance that would comply with this section.\u201d See footnote 10 of this opinion. This court has recognized that, \u201c[t]hese statutory provisions explicitly reflect the legislature\u2019s intent to create a uniform scheme of insurance protection notwithstanding the source of that protection. That is, irrespective of whether the protection is provided by a program of commercial insurance or self-insurance, within the context of the mandatory insurance schemes, we can discern no distinction based upon the means of funding those benefits.\u201d <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 378-79 n.4. Thus Hertz, as a self-insured corporation, has the same statutory obligations as a commercial insurance company, and likewise may bargain to reallocate primary responsibility for liability coverage of its rented vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Upon examination of the statutes, regulations, and case law of the state, it is clear that the essential concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of our motor vehicle liability insurance scheme is guaranteeing minimum coverage for personal injury and property damage resulting from automobile accidents, not the assignment of that coverage to a particular party. Having concluded that Hertz is not statutorily mandated to provide primary coverage on its vehicles, we now turn to whether the trial court properly considered the Hertz rental agreement in its determination of the priority of coverage in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Farmers contends that it was improper for the trial court to have considered the Hertz rental agreement in determining the priority of coverage for Nasser\u2019s rented vehicle. Farmers claims that, because Hertz was required to file its self-insurance policy with the insurance commissioner for approval, the subsequent rental agreement, which was not filed with the insurance commissioner, cannot be deemed to have modified the coverage in the self-insurance policy, and thus should not have been considered in the determination of the outcome in this case. Hertz contends that the rental agreement is the controlling document for the purposes of determining priority of coverage. We agree with Hertz.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We consider first whether, because Hertz was required to file its self-insurance policy with the insurance commissioner, the rental agreement, which had not been filed with the insurance commissioner, validly can control the liability coverage of Hertz\u2019 rental vehicles. Although we have not addressed this precise issue in the past, we confronted a similar situation in <em>Piersa </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>273 Conn. 519, 521, 871 A.2d 992 (2005), in which the \u201csole issue . . . [was] whether a self-insured municipal employer may reduce the limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of its uninsured motorist coverage<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid, without having created a writing effectuating such a reduction.\u201d Although the facts in <em>Piersa </em>differ from those in the present case, the principles underlying our conclusion pertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In <em>Piersa, </em>a police officer brought an action against his employer, the city of Hartford (city), seeking compensation for injuries he sustained when an uninsured motor vehicle collided with his police cruiser. Id. Although the city, a self-insured entity, compensated the officer for his personal injuries, it refused to provide the officer with uninsured motorist benefits because it claimed that, pursuant to \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (1) (B) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the insurance coverage on the police vehicle was offset by the workers\u2019 compensation benefits received by the officer. Id., 522, 525-26. Prior to the accident in that case, the city had filed a letter with the insurance commissioner, pursuant to \u00a7 38a-371 (c),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> stating that it intended to provide self-insurance for its automobile liability and specifying that it would provide the required uninsured motorist coverage minimum of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per occurrence. Id., 522. The letter did not invoke, however, any reduction in those limits permitted by statute or regulation, including the reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>that the city later sought to invoke by offsetting the officer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation payment in that case. Id. Thus, neither the officer, the insurance commissioner, nor any other potential claimant would have had any notice that the city intended to offset its coverage in the amount of any workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to a claimant. The city argued that, because \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (1) (B) of the regulations permitted it to reduce its uninsured motorist coverage in this manner, it was not required to create a written document specifying that it intended to invoke this permissive reduction. Id., 523, 527. We disagreed and concluded that \u201cthe language of the regulation must be interpreted so as to require a municipal self-insurer that wishes to impose permitted limits on its obligations as such to do so by a written document that appropriately provides for reduction of limits.\u201d Id., 527. We reasoned that this was the proper result because it was \u201cconsistent with the [city\u2019s] obligations as an insurer under \u00a7 38a-371 (c) and with [the] uniform legislative scheme [which does not differentiate between commercial and self-insurers] to require the [city] to create a written document specifying its selected reductions in limits, because a commercial insurer must specify those reductions in limits in its written insurance policy in order to take advantage of them. Similarly, it would be inconsistent with those obligations and that scheme to permit the [city] to take advantage of all of those limits by remaining silent with respect to them, because a commercial insurer would not be able to do so in that fashion.\u201d Id., 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">At the outset, we note that the rules applying to the city as a self-insured municipality are not necessarily the same as those governing other, nonmunicipal self-insured entities. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c). More importantly, in the present case Hertz <em>did </em>specify its coverage terms in a written document, namely the rental contract that was executed by Nasser. See foot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>note 2 of this opinion. Accordingly, applying our holding in <em>Piersa </em>to the facts in the present case, we conclude that the rental agreement validly modified the liability insurance coverage that Hertz was required to provide on the vehicle that Nasser rented. In <em>Piersa, </em>elaborating on the written documentation necessary to effect limitations on coverage, we emphasized that: \u201cthere is no particular form that a self-insured entity must use in order to take advantage of the permitted reductions in limits. The required written document may be part of its written notice to the commissioner of its election to be self-insured .... Or ... it may be as part of a written document that the self-insured entity maintains in its files. Nor is it necessary for the document to repeat verbatim the language of the regulation that the defendant intends to adopt as limits on its coverage. . . . [The self-insured entity] could adopt those limits by appropriate language indicating incorporation by reference. <em>The purpose of the document is to require the self-insured entity to fulfill its obligation as insurer by providing a kind of rough equivalence to the obligation of a commercial insurer to limit its coverage by appropriate language in its policy of insurance. Any document that reasonably fulfills that purpose will suffice.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Piersa </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 531. Applying this substantive standard to the rental contract, we conclude that Hertz properly specified the terms of Nasser\u2019s coverage in that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Moreover, unlike the defendant in <em>Piersa, </em>Hertz did not seek to reduce the dollar amount of liability protection it would supply under the prioritization provision, but rather it sought merely to clarify the order of coverage of overlapping policies. As we have discussed in part I of this opinion, Hertz, like any commercial insurer, was permitted to specify that its liability coverage would not be primary in the event that Nasser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>declined, as he did, to purchase that coverage as part of his rental. Thus, in executing the rental contract, Nasser agreed that his personal automobile coverage provided by Farmers would be primary for the rented vehicle. To deny the enforcement of that provision, bargained for by the parties, would be against the standards according to which we evaluate contracts in this state. See <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Wisvest-Connecticut, LLC, </em>259 Conn. 665, 674, 791 A.2d 546 (2002) (\u201c[t]he law of contract interpretation militates against interpreting a contract in a way that renders a provision superfluous\u201d); <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 381-82 (\u201cThe determinative question is the intent of the parties, that is, what coverage the . . . [insured] expected to receive and what the [insurer] was to provide, as disclosed by the provisions of the policy. ... If the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, then the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Although we agree with the trial court that the rental agreement properly may be considered as the controlling document in the present case, we briefly address Farmers\u2019 claim that we should nonetheless conclude that the prioritization provisions contained in the contract are unauthorized by regulation and are therefore invalid. Initially, we note that, for the reasons we have stated in part I of this opinion, we already have concluded that it is not inconsistent with the statutory and regulatory scheme for Hertz to provide secondary coverage on its rented vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Moreover, this court previously has addressed the valid manner by which insurers may limit uninsured motorist coverage according to permissive statutory and regulatory grants. In <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 591 A.2d 101 (1991), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>we considered an insurer\u2019s attempt to limit its uninsured motorist coverage based on a specific regulation not at issue in the present case. We concluded that \u201c[w]hen an insurer seeks to limit its liability for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage based on [a] regulation ... it may do so only to the extent that the regulation \u2018expressly authorizes.\u2019 ... In order for a policy exclusion to be \u2018expressly authorized\u2019 by the statute, there must be substantial congruence between the statutory provision and the policy provision.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 674. Thus, in determining the propriety of provisions in insurance policies purporting to limit coverage pursuant to applicable insurance regulations, we look for \u201csubstantial congruence\u201d between the regulation and the policy provision at issue. See <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>American Economy Ins. Co., </em>278 Conn. 794, 804 n.9, 900 A.2d 27 (2006) (\u201c[i]n order for apolicy exclusion to be expressly authorized by [a] statute [or regulation], there must be substantial congruence between the statutory [or regulatory] provision and the policy provision\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Vitti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 169, 176, 713 A.2d 1269 (1998); <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 152, 156, 617 A.2d 454 (1992). In the present case, the language of the Hertz rental agreement is substantially congruent with the authorization in \u00a7 38a-334-5 (g) of the regulations allowing a policy to provide for secondary liability coverage as long as the minimum statutory coverage is afforded between all applicable policies. See footnote 13 of this opinion. Therefore, we conclude that the prioritization provision in the Hertz rental contract is valid and enforceable for determining liability coverage on the vehicle at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Finally, we note that other jurisdictions considering this issue have concluded that rental agreements should be given their full effect in determining the priority of coverage. See, e.g., <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Alamo Rent A Car, Inc., </em>319 Ill. App. 3d 382, 389, 744 N.E.2d 300 (2000) (\u201cNeither the language contained in the [v]ehicle [c]ode nor the public policy behind it, which is to protect the public, bars contract terms that purport to shift primary liability under insurance policies. Thus, we cannot ignore the laws and public policy of the state, which permit freedom of contracting between competent parties. . . . Because the parties may properly contract as to which insurer is responsible for primary coverage as long as statutory minimum requirements are met, we hold that, as a matter of law, the rental agreement . . . was valid and enforceable, shifting primary coverage to [the lessee\u2019s personal automobile insurer].\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins.

The guidance of our sister courts further persuades us of the prudence of our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Finally, we note that according to the terms of its own policy; see footnote 3 of this opinion; Farmers has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>agreed to provide primary coverage for its insured\u2019s liability when no other applicable liability coverage exists. Because Nasser expressly declined to purchase the liability insurance supplement from Hertz, there is no \u201cother applicable liability insurance\u201d to render the coverage provided by the Farmers policy secondary. Thus, Farmers must cover the loss in this case. Accord <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 383 (\u201cit is by virtue of [the insurer\u2019s] own policy language that its coverage is primary with respect to policies, such as that provided by Hertz, which are written specifically to provide excess liability coverage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\"> In the first action, Farmers filed an action for declaratory judgment against Hertz seeking a determination of liability arising from an accident involving one of Hertz\u2019 car rentals. In the second action, Hertz filed a declaratory judgment against Farmers Insurance Company, an affiliate of Farmers, seeking a determination of liability arising from a different accident involving a Hertz rental car. We therefore refer to the parties by name, rather than by party designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\"> Two provisions of the rental agreement are relevant to this appeal. Paragraph 10 (b) of the agreement provides, in capital letters: \u201cIf you do not purchase liability insurance supplement ... (a summary of [liability insurance supplement] coverage appears below) at the commencement of the rental and an accident results from the use of the car, your insurance and the insurance of the operator of the car will be primary. This means that Hertz will not grant any defense or indemnity protection under this paragraph if either you or the operator of the car are covered by any valid and collectible automobile liability insurance, whether primary, excess or contingent, with limits at least equal to the minimum required by the applicable state financial responsibility law. If neither you nor the operator of the car have such insurance, Hertz will grant you and any authorized operator of the car limited protection under the terms and conditions stated in sub-paragraphs 10 (a) above and 10 (c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In addition, the first page of the rental agreement reads, also in capital letters: \u201c[liability insurance supplement] declined \u2014 Hertz liability protection is secondary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\"> The insurance policy issued by Farmers to Nasser provides in relevant part: \u201cAGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u201cIn return for payment of the premium and subject to all the terms of this policy we agree with you as follows . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201cA.

Therefore, we consider only those facts surrounding the claim arising out of Nasser\u2019s accident. We note, however, that because the insurance policies and rental agreements involved in each case are virtually identical, this development does not impact our determination in any significant manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-12b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No motor vehicle registration shall be issued by the commissioner [of motor vehicles] for any private passenger motor vehicle . . . unless (1) the application for registration is accompanied by a current automobile insurance identification card or a copy of a current insurance policy or endorsement issued by a company licensed to issue such insurance in this state or an approved self-insurer . . . verifying that the applicant has the required security coverage, and (2) the applicant signs and files with the commissioner, under penalty of false statement ... a statement . . . that the owner of the vehicle has provided and will continuously maintain throughout the registration period the minimum security required by section 38a-371. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u201c(c) A person presenting an insurance identification card to the commissioner or to a law enforcement officer is deemed to have full knowledge and understanding that presentation of the card means the owner of the vehicle so registered has provided and will continuously maintain throughout the registration period the minimum security required by section 38a-371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (e) provides: \u201cAn owner of aprivate passenger motor vehicle with respect to which security is required who fails to have such security in effect at the time of an accident shall have all of the rights and obligations of an insurer under sections 38a-363 to 38a-388, inclusive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>and shall remain subject to all the obligations of the Financial Responsibility Law, sections 14-112 to 14-133, inclusive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-213b (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo owner of any private passenger motor vehicle . . . registered or required to be registered in this state may operate or permit the operation of such vehicle without the security required by section 38a-371 or with security insufficient to meet the minimum requirements of said section . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>or have attached thereto a conspicuous statement specifying whether the policy provides liability, collision or comprehensive coverage for damage to a rented private passenger motor vehicle and, where the policy provides such coverage, the limit of coverage provided and whether any deductible amount applies. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\"> We note additionally that the insurance commissioner is mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 to adopt regulations prescribing the minimum provisions that those policies are required to contain. Pursuant to this directive, the insurance commissioner has promulgated \u00a7\u00a7 38a-334-1 through 38a-334-10 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. In the present case, the parties dispute the import of \u00a7 38a-334-5, which describes the minimum provisions for personal ipjury and property damage liability. Farmers points to subsection (d) of that provision, which provides in relevant part: \u201c[t]he insurance afforded shall apply for the benefit of the named insured and any other person or organization using the motor vehicle within the scope of his permission from the named insured . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38a-334-5 (d). This provision, Farmers contends, mandates that Hertz\u2019 self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>insurance must cover Nasser, a permissive user of its vehicle. In light of our conclusion that, although Hertz must provide liability insurance coverage on its vehicles, that coverage need not be primary, this claim is not dispositive of the issues in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Hertz, on the other hand, points to subsection (c) (11) (B) (ii) of \u00a7 38a-334-5, which provides in relevant part: \u201cExclusions. The insurer\u2019s obligation to pay and defend may be made inapplicable ... to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of any . . . motor vehicle . . . while rented to others by the named insured . . . .\u201d Hertz claims that this provision \u201cexempts Hertz, as a renter, from providing liability protection to cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of the rental and use of its motor vehicles,\u201d and that, because Hertz would be permitted under this regulation to decline to provide <em>any </em>coverage, the regulation also supports its right to provide only secondary coverage under the terms of its rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In support of Hertz\u2019 position, the amicus curiae, Car and Truck Rental Leasing Association, addresses the question we raised, but did not answer in <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 380 n.6, of whether this regulatory exclusion would be valid under Hertz\u2019 construction because it may conflict with the mandate under our insurance scheme that vehicle owners must provide coverage for permissive users of their vehicles. The amicus contends that \u00a7 14-154a, which imposes direct indemnification obligations on owners of rental vehicles, reinforces the validity of Hertz\u2019 construction of the exemption in \u00a7 38a-334-5 (c) (11) (B) (ii) because \u00a7 14-154a otherwise affords the public redress against the owner of a rental vehicle, and, therefore, the regulatory exception, when viewed in the context of the entire scheme, can be given effect consistent with the public policy of providing minimum amounts of recovery for individuals harmed by a motor vehicle. In fact, the amicus contends, \u00a7 14-154a provides even greater protection than minimum liability insurance coverage for an injured party because the owner of a rented vehicle could be found vicariously liable for additional punitive damages at common law. The amicus also notes, however, that this reasoning is effectively defeated by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106, which became effective for actions commencing after the date of its enactment on August 10,2005 (and therefore does not apply to the present case), and preemptively eliminated the vicarious liability imposed by \u00a7 14-154a.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Just as we did not need to reach the question of the validity of \u00a7 38a-334-5 (c) (11) (B) (ii) under the facts of <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 380 n.6, based on our conclusion in part I of this opinion that the statutory scheme does not require that Hertz provide primary coverage on its rented vehicles, and because Hertz did in fact maintain liability coverage on Nasser\u2019s vehicle, this case likewise does not invoke the terms of the exemption in \u00a7 38a-334-5 (c) (11) (B) (ii). Thus, the resolution of this case does not require any further analysis of the exclusion in \u00a7 38a-334-5 (c) (11) (B) (ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b569-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cSubject to approval of the Insurance Commissioner the security required by this section, may be provided by self-insurance by filing with the commissioner in satisfactory form: (1) A continuing undertaking by the owner or other appropriate person to perform all obligations imposed by this section; (2) evidence that appropriate provision exists for the prompt and efficient administration of all claims, benefits, and obligations provided by this section; and (3) evidence that reliable financial arrangements, deposits or commitments exist providing assurance for payment of all obligations imposed by this section substantially equivalent to those afforded by a policy of insurance that would comply with this section.

In addition, as we previously have discussed, Hertz was required to file, as part of its self-insurance application, afinancial responsibility bond demonstrating that it maintains resources sufficient to cover the minimum liability on its rental vehicles in the state of Connecticut.
