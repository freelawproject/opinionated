Daigle, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the basis of a bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>costs filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 18-5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that it did not and we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The factual background of the underlying action is set forth in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Traystman, Coric &amp; Keramidas, P.C. </em>v. <em>Daigle, </em>84 Conn. App. 843, 844-45, 855 A.2d 996 (2004). In that decision, the Appellate Court considered the enforceability of a promissory note in the amount of $26,973 executed by the defendant in favor of the plaintiff, Traystman, Cone and Keramidas, P.C., a law firm, to secure payment for services that the plaintiff had provided in connection with the defendant\u2019s marital dissolution proceedings. Id. The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s determination that the promissory note was void because the defendant had executed it under duress was not clearly erroneous. Id., 849. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the defendant. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion was released on September 7, 2004. On October 21, 2004, the defendant filed a second amended bill of costs<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which he requested costs in the amount of $ 1287.19 for defending the action on the note. Specifically, the defendant requested $50 for \u201c[proceedings before trial\u201d (item one); $75 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201c[t]rial\u201d (item two); $200 for \u201c[d]efense of claim\u201d (item three); $30 for \u201c[deposition\u201d (item four); $121.35 for \u201c[mjarshal fee for service\u201d (item five); $310.84 for \u201c[t]ranscripts used in evidence\u201d (item six); $200 for \u201c[i]nvestigative costs\u201d (item seven); $100 for \u201c[a]ppellate proceeding\u201d (item eight); and $200 for \u201c[reproduction of appellate briefs\u201d (item nine).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In addition, the defendant requested attorney\u2019s fees of $350 pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-13<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> based on an offer of judgment he had made but that had been rejected by the plaintiff in the underlying action, and \u201cattorney\u2019s fees of approximately $11,048.75 for trial and approximately $20,000 for the appellate matter\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. The defendant stated that \u201c[t]he approximate fee for trial is based upon [the] plaintiffs estimated counsel fees as stated by [the] plaintiffs counsel in his [t]rial [b]rief of February 25, 2003, for a period ending February 27, 2003. The approximate fee for the appellate matter was determined by an estimate of the fee for [the] plaintiffs counsel. Upon substantiation of actual fees charged by [the] plaintiffs counsel for both the trial and the appeal, the actual attorney\u2019s fee for [the] defendant\u2019s counsel can be determined. The method of determination of fees of [the] defendant\u2019s counsel is in accordance with ... \u00a7 42-150bb . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The plaintiff objected generally to the defendant\u2019s bill of costs on the ground that no costs had been taxed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>in favor of either party. It also objected specifically to items three and five through nine,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the request for $350 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-13, and to the request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. With respect to the request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant was not entitled to such fees because:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">(1) he never had filed a counterclaim or requested attorney\u2019s fees in any claim for relief; (2) attorney\u2019s fees cannot be requested in a bill of costs; (3) the defendant had provided no supporting documentation; (4) \u00a7 42-150bb did not apply to this case; and (5) the request was untimely under Practice Book \u00a7 11-21.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant then filed a reply to the plaintiffs objection in which he claimed that: (1) the contract between the parties was a consumer contract subject to \u00a7 42-150bb;</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">(2) under that statute, the amount of the award should be based on the fee that the defendant would have been required to pay to the plaintiff if it had prevailed; (3) the defendant previously had filed bills of costs claiming attorney\u2019s fees but, in any event, he was not required to give notice of his intent to make such a claim prior to judgment under <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997); and (4) the trial court\u2019s general knowledge of the trial constituted a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>basis for the determination of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee without additional documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The court clerk granted items one, two and four of the defendant\u2019s bill of costs in the amount of $155 and advised the parties that item three and the requests for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-13 and \u00a7 42-150bb had been referred to the trial court. The court conducted a hearing on the bill of costs on February 14, 2005. The court first addressed the plaintiffs objections to items three and five through nine. With respect to item three, the court found that the case was sufficiently difficult to come within General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 (a) (3), and awarded the $200 defense costs. After a brief discussion of items five through nine, the defendant waived his claims for each of those items. Addressing the plaintiffs claim for $350 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-13, the court concluded that it should award that item. The court then noted that \u00a7 17-13 provided that the plaintiff \u201cshall also pay [the] defendant\u2019s costs accruing after [receipt of the defendant\u2019s offer of compromise],\u201d and asked the defendant whether he had requested any such costs. The defendant responded that all of the items in the bill of costs \u201cshould be picked up under the fact that [the plaintiff] didn\u2019t accept the [defendant\u2019s offer of compromise].\u201d After additional discussion, and over the plaintiffs objection, the court concluded that it would award items five through nine \u201cupon production] of the bills to support those costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The court then addressed the defendant\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. Counsel for the defendant argued that, under the statute, the defendant was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees in the amount that the plaintiff, as the commercial party to the underlying consumer contract, had expended in attorney\u2019s fees during the trial of the action. He noted that, in its trial brief on the underlying action on the promissory note, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>plaintiff had represented that its attorney\u2019s fees through the conclusion of the trial amounted to $11,048.75. Counsel for the defendant also gave the trial court a copy of a letter from the defendant to counsel stating that counsel would represent him for $125 per hour and one third of any reduction of the amount owed by the defendant on the promissory note, less any accumulated hourly charges. Counsel for the plaintiff objected that the letter had not been marked as an exhibit and that he had had no opportunity to cross-examine counsel for the defendant with regard to the letter. The court remarked that \u201c[t]he letter doesn\u2019t mean a thing,\u201d and stated that it would not \u201caward anything if [counsel for the defendant did not] give [the court] a number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">At that point, pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum that the defendant previously had served on counsel for the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant asked counsel for the plaintiff to take the witness stand to produce the plaintiffs legal bills and to testify as to the amount of the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees. Counsel for the plaintiff objected that the defendant could not seek attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150bb without having filed a counterclaim seeking that specific relief and that the statute did not apply to this action in any event. He further argued that the defendant had failed to comply with the timing provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 11-21. The court overruled the objections and counsel for the defendant again asked counsel for the plaintiff to take the witness stand. Counsel for the plaintiff then pointed out that he had filed a motion for a protective order and a motion to quash the defendant\u2019s subpoena. The court stated that it would not require counsel for the plaintiff to produce any documents, but ordered him to tell counsel for the defendant the amount of his fees for trying this action. Counsel for the plaintiff responded that the fees were approximately $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The defendant also argued at the hearing that he was entitled to $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees for the proceedings on appeal to the Appellate Court. In support of that claim, the defendant relied on an affidavit from Wesley Horton, an attorney specializing in appellate law, stating that a reasonable fee for handling the appeal would be $30,000 if Horton personally had handled the appeal and $20,000 if one of his partners had handled the appeal. The affidavit had been attached to the defendant\u2019s December 21, 2004 reply to the plaintiffs objection to the second amended bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">At the close of the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff requested that he be allowed to submit a brief on the issue of whether the defendant had met his burden of establishing a basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court responded that all briefs were to have been filed on the date of the hearing and that no further briefs would be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On February 15,2005, the day after the hearing, counsel for the defendant sent a letter to the trial court, with a copy to counsel for the plaintiff, to which he attached several pages of typewritten notes concerning his representation of the defendant, a bill in the amount of $270.83 from a court reporter for the transcript of a proceeding on February 4, 2003, a bill in the amount of $40.81 from a court reporter for the transcript of a proceeding on December 18, 2002, and a bill in the amount of $121.35 from a state marshal for service of three subpoenas. On March 10, 2005, the plaintiff filed a motion to recuse in which it claimed that, as a result of the letter and other materials sent by counsel for the defendant to the trial court, which the plaintiff characterized as an ex parte communication, the appearance of impartiality on the part of the trial court had been compromised. After a hearing, the court denied the motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>On April 18, 2005, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision on the bill of costs. With regard to the claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb, the court concluded that: (1) the statute applied to the contract for legal services between the plaintiff and the defendant and to the promissory note that guaranteed payment for those services; (2) the statute does not contain a time limit for requesting attorney\u2019s fees and, therefore, Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 did not apply and the defendant was required only to file his request within a reasonable time; and (3) under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del </em>Grosso, supra, 240 Conn. 58, the defendant was not required to give notice of his intention to request attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb by bringing a counterclaim for relief. The court declined to address the plaintiffs claims that a request for attorney\u2019s fees cannot be made in a bill of costs and that the defendant had failed to present evidence in support of his claim because the plaintiff had not provided any authority for those propositions. The court awarded $11,500 in attorney\u2019s fees for the trial proceedings and $20,000 for the appellate proceedings. The court also awarded costs in the amount of $311.64 for the preparation of the transcripts and $121.35 for marshal fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 42-150bb applies in this case because: (1) the underlying contract had been found void; (2) the plaintiff was not a commercial party; and (3) the promissory note did not contain a reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees clause. The plaintiff further claims that, even if the statute applies, the court improperly granted the request for attorney\u2019s fees because: (1) the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>dant had failed to present sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees; (2) no timely motion for attorney\u2019s fees had ever been filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21; and (3) the court had no statutory authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in excess of $350 in a proceeding on a bill of costs. Finally, the plaintiff claims that the trial court had no statutory authority to award costs for the preparation of transcripts and state marshal fees. The defendant claims, essentially as an alternate ground for affirmance, that, if the plaintiff is correct that he was required under Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 to file a motion for attorney\u2019s fees within thirty days of the date that the Appellate Court rendered its decision, we may review the trial court\u2019s action as the effective equivalent of granting a motion for attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, the defendant claims that the trial court properly could have excused his failure to comply with the time limitation of the rules of practice because it is merely directory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees because he failed to file a timely motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21. Accordingly, we need not address the plaintiffs other claims pertaining to the award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. We further conclude that the trial court improperly awarded costs for the preparation of transcripts and state marshal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">At the outset, we set forth our standard of review. Whether the defendant followed the proper procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>under the governing statutes and the rules of practice, for requesting attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb and, if not, whether the trial court was nevertheless authorized to grant his request for attorney\u2019s fees, are questions of law over which our review is plenary. See <em>State v. Pare, </em>253 Conn. 611, 621-22, 755 A.2d 180 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u201cThe law expects parties to bear their own litigation expenses, except where the legislature has dictated otherwise by way of statute. <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 217, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982). Costs are the creature of statute . . . and unless the statute clearly provides for them courts cannot tax them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>61 Conn. App. 834, 853-54, 767 A.2d 1237 (2001). Section 42-150bb clearly authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees to \u201cthe consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim\u201d on a consumer contract or lease. The statute does not, however, specify the procedure for requesting an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Similarly, Practice Book \u00a7 18-5 (a) provides for the filing of a written bill of costs, but does not specify the costs that may be requested in that filing. Although these provisions are silent as to the proper procedure for requesting attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb, for the following reasons, we conclude that the trial court improperly awarded such fees based on a request in a bill of costs pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 18-5 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">First, the costs to be included in a bill of costs generally are of a type that may be granted automatically by the court clerk. See <em>Fengler </em>v. <em>Northwest Connecticut Homes, Inc., </em>215 Conn. 286, 291, 575 A.2d 696 (1990) (\u201c[a]n examination of ... \u00a7 52-257, entitled \u2018[f]ees of parties in civil actions,\u2019 reveals that most of the awards are automatic assessments, not involving the discretion of the court\u201d). We recognized in <em>Fengler </em>that there were exceptions to this general rule in \u201c[\u00a7 52-257] (d) concerning minor specific matters and [\u00a7 52-257] (e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>reserving to the court its time-honored discretion in taxing costs in actions in which equitable relief is granted.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id. We also recognize that the fees and costs that may be requested in a bill of costs are not necessarily limited to those listed in \u00a7 52-257, or even to those included in chapter 901 of the General Statutes governing fees and costs in civil litigation. We have concluded, for example, that a trial court properly granted a bill of costs for reasonable appraisal fees filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-133. See <em>Northeast Ct. Economic Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>ATC Partnership, </em>272 Conn. 14, 45-50, 861 A.2d 473 (2004); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-195 (authorizing award of costs accruing after plaintiff received notice of defendant\u2019s offer of judgment, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees not to exceed $350). Nevertheless, it is implicit in our statutes governing recoverable costs, and our rules of practice expressly contemplate, that the costs requested in a bill of costs generally are intended to be of a type that the court clerk may grant automatically. See Practice Book \u00a7 18-5 (a) (\u201ccosts may be taxed <em>by the clerk </em>in civil cases\u201d [emphasis added]). As the court clerk in the present case properly recognized, the determination of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb requires the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion and is not subject to automatic assessment by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Second, and more fundamentally, Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 provides a specific postjudgment procedure for seeking statutory attorney\u2019s fees. See Practice Book, 1999, \u00a7 11-21, commentary (rule \u201cis aimed principally at statutory attorney\u2019s fees\u201d) and therefore is controlling; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State, </em>189 Conn. 550, 555-56 n.7, 457 A.2d 304 (1983) (\u201cwhen general and specific statutes conflict they should be harmoniously construed so the more specific statute controls\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 was adopted in 1999, apparently in response to concerns raised by the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>38 Conn. App. 506, 662 A.2d 137 (1995), aff'd, 237 Conn. 28, 675 A.2d 851 (1996). See Practice Book, 1999, \u00a7 11-21, commentary; <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 30 (recognizing unfairness of allowing substantial delay after judgment in awarding attorney\u2019s fees but concluding that concern must be addressed by changing statutes or rules of practice).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Appellate Court had concluded in <em>Oakley </em>that post-judgment motions for attorney\u2019s fees under General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a \u201cmust be filed within a reasonable time of the entering of the final judgment, and that the determination of whether such a motion has been filed within a reasonable time is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 517. It is reasonable to conclude that the rule requiring motions for attorney\u2019s fees to be filed within thirty days of a final judgment was adopted in recognition of the fact that a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees requires the trial court to have fresh familiarity with the nature and conduct of the case that is not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>for an automatic award of costs pursuant to provisions such as those contained in \u00a7 52-257. Compare Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 (requirement that motion for attorney\u2019s fees be filed within thirty days of judgment) with Practice Book \u00a7 18-5 (containing no deadline for filing bill of costs); cf. <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 517 (before adoption of \u00a7 11-21, five months after judgment was held to be reasonable time within which to file motion for attorney\u2019s fees). Moreover, as the facts of the present case establish, unlike the generally modest costs that may be granted automatically by the court clerk, attorney\u2019s fees may amount to a substantial award. It is reasonable to conclude that \u00a7 11-21 was adopted to avoid an extended period of uncertainty about this potential liability after judgment. Accordingly, we conclude that the proper procedural vehicle for requesting an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb is a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, not a bill of costs pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 18-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Indeed, the defendant does not appear to dispute this conclusion. Rather, he maintains that, despite his failure to request attorney\u2019s fees within the thirty day time limit provided by Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, \u201cthe trial court nevertheless reached the correct result.\u201d Thus, he appears to contend that this court should review the trial court\u2019s action as if it had treated his bill of costs as the equivalent of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees. He further suggests that, if the trial court had treated his bill of costs as a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, it would have had the discretion to excuse his failure to file a request for attorney\u2019s fees within thirty days of judgment on the ground that the rule\u2019s time limit is directory rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The principal flaw in the defendant\u2019s argument is that, even if it is assumed that there may be circumstances under which a trial court can treat a bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>costs as a motion for attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 an issue on which we express no opinion here \u2014 the trial court in the present case clearly did not do so. Indeed, the court expressly concluded that Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 did <em>not </em>apply to a request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb, and indicated that it had concluded that it <em>was </em>authorized to award such fees in a proceeding on a bill of costs when it stated that it would not address the plaintiffs claim to the contrary because the plaintiff had not provided any authority in support of that claim. Thus, the trial court saw no need to consider whether the time limits provided by \u00a7 11-21 are mandatory or directory, or to exercise its discretion to excuse compliance with those time limits. Indeed, in the proceedings before the trial court, the defendant never responded to the plaintiffs claim that the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees was time barred by \u00a7 11-21, never argued that the rule\u2019s timing provision was directory rather than mandatory, and never explained why his failure to comply with the rule should be excused. We conclude that, under these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for this court to review the action of the trial court as if it had treated the portion of the defendant\u2019s bill of costs requesting attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb as the effective equivalent of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 and had exercised its discretion to excuse compliance with the rule\u2019s timing requirement. We conclude, therefore, that the court improperly awarded the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly awarded costs in the amount of $311.64 for transcript costs and $121.35 for marshal fees. As we previously have indicated, at the February 14, 2005 hearing, the defendant initially had waived his claim for these costs pursuant to \u00a7 52-257, thereby implicitly conceding that the costs were not authorized by that statute. The court then indicated that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>award the costs pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-13 if the defendant provided supporting bills. Neither the defendant nor the trial court, however, has identified any statute authorizing these specific costs or provided any authority for the proposition that the costs referred to in \u00a7 17-13 may include costs not otherwise authorized by statute. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly awarded these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to amend the judgment to eliminate the award for $31,500 in attorney\u2019s fees, $311.64 in transcript costs and $121.35 in marshal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb provides: \u201cWhenever any contract or lease entered into on or after October 1, 1979, to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney\u2019s fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney\u2019s fee shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based upon the contract or lease. Except as hereinafter provided, the size of the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer shall be based as far as practicable upon the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party. No attorney\u2019s fee shall be awarded to a commercial party who is represented by its salaried employee. In any action in which the consumer is entitled to an attorney\u2019s fee under this section and in which the commercial party is represented by its salaried employee, the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer shall be in a reasonable amount regardless of the size of the fee provided in the contract or lease for either party. For the purposes of this section, \u2018commercial party\u2019 means the seller, creditor, lessor or assignee of any of them, and \u2018consumer\u2019 means the buyer, debtor, lessee or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>personal representative of any of them. The provisions of this section shall apply only to contracts or leases in which the money, property or service which is the subject of the transaction is primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 18-5 (a) provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, costs may be taxed by the clerk in civil cases fourteen days after the filing of a written bill of costs provided that no objection is filed. If a written objection is filed within the fourteen day period, notice shall be given by the clerk to all appearing parties of record of the date and time of the clerk\u2019s taxation. The parties may appear at such taxation and have the right to be heard by the clerk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\"> The defendant initially filed a bill of costs on April 3,2003, approximately one month after the trial court\u2019s judgment while the appeal to the Appellate Court was pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 17-13 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the plaintiff does not, within the time allowed for acceptance of the offer of compromise and before any evidence is offered at the trial, file the plaintiffs notice of acceptance, the offer shall be deemed to be withdrawn and shall not be given in evidence; and the plaintiff, unless recovering more than the sum specified in the offer, with interest from its date, shall recover no costs accruing after the plaintiff received notice of the filing of such offer, but shall pay the defendant\u2019s costs accruing after said time. Such costs may include reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not to exceed $350. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Section 17-13 was amended in 2006, effective January 1,2007, for purposes not relevant to this appeal. For convenience, we refer to the current version of the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> The plaintiff objected to item three because it is \u201cnot a taxable item of costs\u201d; to item five because there was no basis for the marshal fees allegedly incurred by the defendant; to item six because there was no authority for transcript fees; to item seven because there was no authority for the investigative cost; and to items eight and nine because appellate costs must be sought from the appellate clerk pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 71-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 provides: \u201cMotions for attorney\u2019s fees shall be filed with the trial court within thirty days following the date on which the final judgment of the trial court was rendered. If appellate attorney\u2019s fees are sought, motions for such fees shall be filed with the trial court within thirty days following the date on which the appellate court or supreme court rendered its decision disposing of the underlying appeal. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect an award of attorney\u2019s fees assessed as a component of damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> The court did not include in the judgment the $350 in attorney\u2019s fees that it had awarded pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-13 at the February 14, 2005 hearing. The defendant has not raised any claim concerning this amount in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> The defendant also claims that the plaintiff failed to preserve its claims that the trial court was not authorized to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb in a proceeding on a bill of costs and that certain other costs awarded by the trial court were not authorized by statute. We disagree. A fair reading of the plaintiffs objection to the bill of costs and the transcript of the February 14,2005 hearing reveals that the plaintiff raised these claims. The defendant also points out that the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to provide any authority for its assertions. As we have indicated, the burden is on the party claiming costs to establish a statutory authority for an award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 (a) (3) (providing for allowance of fee not to exceed $200 \u201cin difficult or extraordinary cases ... in the discretion of the court\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 (b) (4) (providing for award for services of expert on value of land when such value is in dispute in amount \u201ccourt or judge determines to be reasonable\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 (b) (12) (providing for award for \u201creasonable expenses incurred\u201d in taping, transcribing and presentation of certain depositions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b455-5\"> The trial court relied on the Appellate Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Oakley </em>and in <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>57 Conn. App. 189, 194-95, 752 A.2d 1098 (2000), in support of its conclusion that, because \u00a7 42-150bb is silent as to the time limit for its enforcement, a request for attorney\u2019s fees under the statute must be filed within a reasonable time. Both of those decisions involved requests for attorney\u2019s fees that had been made before the adoption of \u00a7 11-21 in 1999.
