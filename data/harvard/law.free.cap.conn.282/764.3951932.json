The plaintiff subcontractor, Ferguson Mechanical Company, Inc., appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of dismissal by the trial court rendered in favor of the defendant, the state department of public works (department), on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action because the plaintiff had no standing to bring an appeal under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On May 4, 2005, the department opened and solicited competitive bids for construction work on the science center and classroom building at Eastern Connecticut State University. The plaintiff, a mechanical contractor licensed by the state of Connecticut, supplied subcontract bids to several general contractors that were submitting bids for the project in the amount of $12.2 million for the mechanical and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) portion of the project. The responsible low bidder, O and G Industries, Inc. (O &amp; G), listed the plaintiff as its HVAC subcontrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>tor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 12, 2005, the department presented O &amp; G with a contract for the project and requested that O &amp; G submit executed subcontract agreements for each of the listed subcontracts in its bid proposal, pursuant to the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 4b-96.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Three days later, O &amp; G submitted a subcontract proposal to the plaintiff that included the statutorily mandated form plus four riders defining the scope and terms of the work to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The plaintiff objected to rider A, which required that (1) the plaintiff obtain surety bonds for the payment and performance of the work, provided that O &amp; G would pay the plaintiff up to 1.8 percent of the total value of the subcontract for the cost of the bonds, and (2) the value of the bond would be determined by the invoice from the bonding company to the plaintiffs insurance broker, rather than by the invoice from the plaintiffs insurance broker to the plaintiff. The plaintiff and O &amp; G negotiated the terms of the subcontract over the course of several weeks, and as of August 11, 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>they had reached an agreement on the terms of the subcontract with the exception of O &amp; G\u2019s requirement that the plaintiff submit the cost of the performance and payment bonds via invoice from the bonding company to the plaintiffs insurance broker. The plaintiff refused to provide the documentation, claiming that the requested document was not under its control because its insurance broker had refused to provide the invoice. On August 11, 2005, O &amp; G sent to the department a request to substitute another subcontractor for the plaintiff for \u201cgood cause,\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4b-95 (c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> due to the plaintiffs refusal to sign the subcontract. The plaintiff received no notice of O &amp; G\u2019s request until August 17, 2005, when the department authorized the substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">On August 24, 2005, the plaintiff filed a petition with the department, pursuant to the regulations adopted under General Statutes \u00a7 4b-100 (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> protesting the department\u2019s action. On September 29,2005, the department held an informal conference, at which the plaintiff and O &amp; G outlined their positions regarding the alleged violation of the competitive bidding statutes, specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>cally \u00a7\u00a7 4b-95 and 4b-96. The presiding officer at the conference denied the plaintiffs bid protest petition in a ruling dated October 25, 2005, and three days later, the plaintiff filed a written appeal from that ruling with James T. Fleming, the department\u2019s commissioner (commissioner). The commissioner upheld the decision of the presiding officer and denied the plaintiffs appeal on November 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">On December 6, 2005, the plaintiff appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. The plaintiff also filed applications for a stay and for a temporary injunction to enjoin the department from allowing the substitution of another subcontractor for the plaintiff. The department filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and applications for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In its motion to dismiss, the department claimed that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim because: \u201c(1) the [s]tate is immune from suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity; (2) a subcontractor has no standing to challenge the [sjtate\u2019s approval of [O &amp; G\u2019s] request for subcontractor substitution; and (3) the [department\u2019s] action is not a \u2018final decision in a contested case\u2019 and therefore the [p]laintiff does not have standing to pursue its claim under the UAPA.\u201d The trial court granted the motion to dismiss the administrative appeal, after finding that the plaintiff was not an aggrieved person authorized to bring an appeal under the UAPA, and rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly dismissed the appeal because it failed to distinguish the plaintiffs status as a listed, successful bidder from that of a disappointed, unsuccessful bidder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>which would have no standing to bring an appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff argues that its status as a listed subcontractor in a successful bid imparts upon it a statutory entitlement akin to a property interest, which means that it has suffered an injury that makes it classically aggrieved. The department argues in response that (1) the plaintiff, as a listed subcontractor, has no more standing to challenge public bid awards than a disappointed bidder, (2) the plaintiff is not aggrieved by an agency\u2019s final decision, so the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear its appeal, and (3) the plaintiffs claim is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. We agree with the department\u2019s second argument, namely, that the plaintiff was not aggrieved because of the lack of a final decision, and we, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We begin our analysis with the subject matter jurisdiction claim and the applicable standard of review. \u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . Moreover, [i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>time. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . .

The UAPA grants the Superior Court jurisdiction over appeals of agency decisions only in certain limited and well delineated circumstances. . . . Judicial review of an administrative decision is governed by ... \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA, which provides that [a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies . . . and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the superior court .... A final decision is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A) as the agency determination in a contested case . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>224 Conn. 693, 699-700, 620 A.2d 780 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">A contested case is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (2) as \u201ca proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are <em>required by state statute or regulation </em>to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) \u201cNot every matter or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>issue determined by an agency qualifies for contested case status. . . .

Freedman, 191 Conn. 497, 503, 467 A.2d 674 (1983). Our courts have had ample opportunity to construe the definition of \u201ccontested case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe test for determining contested case status has been well established and requires an inquiry into three criteria, to wit: (1) whether a legal right, duty or privilege is at issue, (2) and is statutorily [or regulatorily] required to be determined by the agency, (3) through an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held.\u201d <em>Herman v. Division of Special Revenue, </em>193 Conn. 379, 382, 477 A.2d 119 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Even if we were to assume, for the purposes of this opinion, that the plaintiff had a legal right or privilege as a listed subcontractor on the winning bid, \u201cthe plaintiff still cannot prevail unless the [department was] <em>statutorily [or regulatorily] required to determine the plaintiff's legal right or privilege . . . in a hearing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 443. \u201cThe statutory requirement that an appeal to the Superior Court may be taken only from a contested case as defined in \u00a7 4-166 (2) is an obvious indicator that the legislature did not intend to authorize a right of appeal to the Superior Court from every determination of an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 792, 800, 629 A.2d 367 (1993).

Such claims may be initiated by the [department] or any party whose financial interests may be affected by the decision on such a claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Pursuant to \u00a7 4b-100, the commissioner adopted <em>\u201cgrievance procedures . . </em>. for promptly hearing and ruling on claims alleging a violation or violations of the contract bidding provisions . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 4b-100-1. The statement of purpose in the regulations provides: \u201cIn view of the fact that time is normally of the essence in awarding construction contracts . . . the grievance procedures are intended to be <em>quick, informal and conclusive so </em>as to avoid delays which can increase costs and jeopardize the very ability of the [s]tate to proceed with needed public works projects.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. In light of these considerations, the grievance procedures provide that an \u201cinformal conference\u201d be held in order to allow the parties \u201can opportunity to argue their respective positions regarding the alleged violation(s)\u201d of the public bidding statutes. Id., \u00a7 4b-100-6 (a). During the conference, the presiding officer designated by the commissioner reviews all documentation provided by both sides and listens to the parties present oral argument on their positions. See id., \u00a7\u00a7 4b-100-7 and 4b-100-8. The presiding officer is required to issue a written ruling after the conclusion of the conference, and a party adversely affected by that ruling may file an appeal with the commissioner. See id., \u00a7\u00a7 4b-100-9 and 4b-100-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>10.

Section 4b-100 (b) requires only that the commissioner <em>establish a procedure </em>for the hearing of claims; it does not require that the department hold hearings. The regulations adopted pursuant to the statutory mandate accordingly label the claim resolution process as \u201cgrievance procedures\u201d and require quick, informal and conclusive conferences rather than hearings. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 4b-100-1. We note that the legislature has, elsewhere in our statutory scheme, expressly required that state agencies hold hearings. See, e.g., <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 446-47 n.11 (listing seventeen statutes providing for hearings by state agencies).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u201cThe contrast between [the statute at issue] and those statutes is persuasive evidence of a lack of a similar legislative purpose to impose by statute a hearing requirement . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 446-47; see also <em>East Hampton </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>supra, 80 Conn. App. 255-56 (\u201cHad the legislature intended ... to require a hearing, it could have expressly done so. . . . The difference in the language used in [the statutes at issue] and in those statutes that expressly require a hearing is persuasive evidence of a lack of similar legislative intent to impose the same requirement.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Similarly, the legislature has, elsewhere in our statutory scheme, expressly provided for judicial review of agency decisions by calling the decision a \u201ccontested case\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or by referring to \u00a7 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>183.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The competitive bidding statutes contain no such provision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf.

Deciding which class of cases qualifies for contested case status reflects an important matter of public policy and the primary responsibility for formulating public policy must remain with the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 445. In the present case, the absence of judicial review is consistent with the purpose of the public bidding statutes, which is \u201cpromot[ing] the public interest in the efficient completion of public works projects.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Associated Builders &amp; Contractors </em>v. <em>Anson, </em>251 Conn. 202, 214, 740 A.2d 804 (1999); see also <em>Connecticut Associated Builders &amp; Contractors </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>251 Conn. 169,180, 740 A.2d 813 (1999) (\u201cOur policy to limit standing so as to deny some claims brought by unsuccessful and precluded bidders is designed to protect twin goals that serve the public interest in various, sometimes conflicting, ways. The standing rules aim \u2018to strike the proper balance between fulfilling the purposes of the competitive bidding statutes and preventing frequent litigation that might result in extensive delay in the commencement and completion of government projects to the detriment of the public.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that, because the department was not under a statutory or regulatory mandate to conduct a hearing with respect to the plaintiffs allegations, there was no agency determination in a contested case. Thus, the plaintiff had no right to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>review of the commissioner\u2019s decision because it was not aggrieved by a final decision required to trigger judicial review pursuant to the UAPA, and the trial court properly rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs administrative appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4b-95 (b) and schedule 7.5.1 of the bid proposal form used by the department mandate that each general contractor submitting a bid also provide a \u201clisting [of] the names and prices of subcontractors for the [masonry, electrical, heating, ventilating and air conditioning, and mechanical work other than heating, ventilating and air conditioning] . . . .\u201d Therefore, the plaintiff was a \u201clisted subcontractor\u201d in O &amp; G\u2019s successful bid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4b-96 provides in relevant part: \u201cWithin five days after being notified of the award of a general contract by the awarding authority, or, in the case of an approval of a substitute subcontractor by the awarding authority, within five days after being notified of such approval, the general bidder shall present to each listed or substitute subcontractor (1) a subcontract in the form set forth in this section and (2) a notice of the time limit under this section for executing a subcontract.

We decline, however, to construe the absence of such explicit language as an implication that the legislature intended to provide for judicial review, because the right to such review from an administrative decision exists only under a grant of statutory authority.
