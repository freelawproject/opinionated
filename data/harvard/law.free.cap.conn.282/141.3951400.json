The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motion to suppress certain oral and written statements made to the police; and (2) instructed the jury concerning the presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden of proof. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The defendant was charged by substitute information with two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-278 (a), one count of conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (a) and 53a-48, and one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a licensed child day care center in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b). Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress certain oral and written statements that he had made to the police following their entry into his residence to execute a search warrant. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. Thereafter, the jury found the defendant guilty of all charges, and the trial court rendered judgments of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant facts. In June, 2001, the defendant resided at 95 Ives Street in the city of Waterbury with his wife, Beverly Lawrence (Beverly), their two minor children and their four minor grandchildren, of whom they had legal custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the evening of June 21, 2001, officers from the Waterbury police department executed a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s residence. In a bureau located in the second floor master bedroom, the officers found a brown paper bag containing approximately 106 grams of powder cocaine and 15.5 grams of crack cocaine separated and packaged in forty-eight small plastic bags. They also found a digital scale, empty plastic bags and an open box of baking soda containing a razor. Additionally, in Beverly\u2019s purse, the police found twenty-eight small plastic bags each containing crack cocaine. The amount, as well as the type and packaging of the cocaine found in the defendant\u2019s resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>dence, was consistent with commercial sale, rather than personal use. The defendant confessed, both orally and in writing, that all of the cocaine and packaging paraphernalia belonged to him. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain oral and written statements that he had made to the police concerning ownership of the cocaine and packaging paraphernalia found in his residence. The defendant claims that these statements were the product of police coercion, namely, the threat that the department of children and families would remove his children and grandchildren from his home unless he confessed to owning the cocaine. In support of this claim, the defendant makes two arguments. First, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly found, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the alleged threats had not occurred and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s statements had been made voluntarily. Alternatively, the defendant urges this court to overrule <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 412-26, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996), wherein we concluded that the constitution of Connecticut, like the constitution of the United States, requires the state to establish the voluntariness of a confession by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 486, 92 S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972). The defendant contends that sister state authority, the unique history of this state and public policy considerations compel the conclusion that the constitution of Connecticut requires the state to meet a higher burden of proof \u2014 specifically, proof beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 than is mandated by the federal constitution. The defendant further claims that the evidence adduced by the state was insufficient to establish the voluntariness of his confession beyond a reasonable doubt. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of fact concerning the occurrence of the alleged threats is not clearly erroneous. Additionally, we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to overrule <em>James.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. On August 14, 2003, the defendant filed a motion to suppress \u201cany oral or written statements made by him to law enforcement authorities in connection with the [present] case\u201d because, inter alia, the \u201cstatements in question were not given voluntarily\u201d and, therefore, had been obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of the motion, the defendant claimed that the constitution of Connecticut requires the state to establish the voluntariness of a confession beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant further claimed that his oral and written statements were the product of police coercion because \u201cone of the police officers told the defendant that if he did not confess to the ownership of the narcotics . . . the police would have [the department of children and families] come to the residence and take his children away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">At the suppression hearing, both the state and the defendant stipulated that Michael Goggin, a detective with the Waterbury police department, who allegedly had threatened the defendant, was unavailable to testify. Upon the state\u2019s motion, the trial court admitted into evidence Goggin\u2019s prior testimony at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing. Goggin testified that, on June 21, 2001, he assisted in the execution of a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s residence. Upon entry into the home, Goggin secured the defendant, advised him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), and directed him to a bedroom on the second floor. Goggin then asked the defendant \u201cwhere the narcotics were hidden.\u201d The defendant responded that, \u201che didn\u2019t know what [Goggin] was talking about.\u201d Goggin informed the defendant that the police were going to commence the search, to which the defendant responded, \u201c[g]o ahead.\u201d Goggin proceeded to search the defendant\u2019s bedroom, wherein he found a paper bag containing both powder and crack cocaine in the defendant\u2019s bureau. The defendant admitted that the cocaine belonged to him. Thereafter, the defendant was transported to police headquarters, where he repeated his confession in a sworn written statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to the circumstances surrounding the production of the defendant\u2019s written statement, Goggin explained that he questioned the defendant alone and that, based on his conversation with the defendant, he typed the defendant\u2019s statement, which the defendant then signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The state also presented the testimony of Patrick Moynihan, a Waterbury police detective who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>assisted in the execution of the search warrant. Moynihan testified that, upon entry into the defendant\u2019s residence, Goggin secured the defendant, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and directed him to a bedroom on the second floor where he spoke to the defendant privately in an attempt to elicit information regarding the presence and location of narcotics in the residence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moynihan, who was situated in the hallway outside of the second floor bedroom, overheard \u201c[b]its and pieces\u201d of the conversation and monitored Goggin and the defendant visually from an approximate distance of ten feet. Moynihan testified that neither Goggin nor any other police officer had threatened the defendant with the removal of his children and grandchildren by the department of children and families.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Frank Koshes, a sergeant in the vice and intelligence unit of the Waterbury police department, also testified at the suppression hearing. Koshes, who had assisted in the search of the defendant\u2019s residence and in the transportation of the defendant to police headquarters, testified that neither Goggin nor any other police officer had threatened the defendant. Koshes farther testified that he was stationed immediately outside of the office where Goggin interviewed the defendant, and that the door was partially open so that he could \u201cgo right in and intervene\u201d if \u201cvoices got raised, or if there was any kind of problem . . . .\u201d Koshes did not hear raised voices or anything unusual during the interview, however, that would necessitate his intervention. At the conclusion of the interview, Koshes reviewed the defendant\u2019s written statement. After evaluating the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>dant\u2019s literacy proficiency,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Koshes asked the defendant to read the statement to himself, which the defendant did. Koshes then asked the defendant \u201cif everything within the statement was the truth,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201c[y]es.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The defendant testified at the suppression hearing on his own behalf. The defendant testified that, in 1998, he and Beverly lived in North Carolina with their two minor children and their four minor grandchildren, of whom they had physical, but not legal, custody. In October of that year, Beverly brought the children and grandchildren to Connecticut to visit Althea Vines, the adult daughter of the defendant and Beverly and the mother of their four grandchildren. One afternoon, Beverly left her children and grandchildren in the care of Vines while she went shopping. The defendant testified that when Beverly returned, she discovered that Vines had gotten into \u201csome type of argument with someone, and . . . the police were called, and when they came in, there were drugs found at the residence. So, at that point, the kids were . . . taken away from [Vines] and placed in the custody of the [department of children and families].\u201d The department of children and families released the defendant\u2019s children into Beverly\u2019s custody later that same day. Because neither Beverly nor the defendant had legal custody of their grandchildren, however, the grandchildren were held for approximately ninety-six hours. In the meantime, the defendant traveled to Connecticut to assist Beverly in securing the safe return of their grandchildren. After the expiration of the ninety-six hour period, the department of children and families released the four grandchildren into the physical custody of the defendant on the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tion that the grandchildren remain in the state. In light of this condition, the defendant moved his family from North Carolina to Connecticut and began the lengthy and arduous process of obtaining legal custody of his grandchildren. He described his experience with the department of children and families as \u201ctaxing\u201d and \u201ca nightmare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the events on June 21,2001, largely mirrored the testimony of Goggin, Moynihan and Koshes, with the exception of Goggin\u2019s alleged threats concerning the removal of the defendant\u2019s children and grandchildren by the department of children and families. The defendant testified that, prior to commencing the search of his home, Goggin had said, \u201cwell, you know, you can make it easier on yourself. Just tell us where the drugs are, and we\u2019ll make sure, you know, that [the department of children and families] does not . . . take your kids.\u201d After the defendant informed Goggin that no narcotics were present in the home, the police searched the defendant\u2019s residence and found cocaine in his bureau. The defendant testified that, \u201cthe officer asked me were [the drugs] mine, and I said, no. At that point, when I said no, one of the officers, not the officer that had me in [hand] cuffs, but one of the officers . . . asked me where\u2019s the money. I said, what money? He said, do you have any more drugs or money in this house? I said, no, there\u2019s no more drugs or money in this house. What you say you found, apparently that\u2019s it. He said, well, we know there\u2019s more drugs ... in this house. We are going to have [the department of children and families] come in and take your kids. At that point, with the thought of . . . what I had already gone through with [the department of children and families], I said to him, I said, listen, you say you found drugs here, whatever you say you found. I said, I will take total responsibility for that. I do not want my kids or wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>to get caught up in anything like this. I said, I\u2019ve been through dealing with [the department of children and families] before. I said, I don\u2019t want my kids taken away from me, and that\u2019s when the officer took me back into the room. At that point was when ... he said, all right, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do for you. He said, if you will sign a statement for me saying that these drugs are yours, all these drugs are yours, your wife has nothing to do with it, I will make sure that [the department of children and families] does not come in and take your kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The defendant subsequently was transported to police headquarters, where he produced a sworn written statement. The defendant testified that, \u201c[b]ecause of what the officer told me at my house about [the department of children and families], that he would make sure that if I gave him a statement that the drugs were mine, and if I gave him a signed statement, he would make sure he absolutely guaranteed me that [the department of children and families] would not come in and take my kids. And that was the most important thing in my mind, because I had dealt with [the department of children and families] before, and I had my four grandkids living with me already in North Carolina, and the reason being, was because of my daughter\u2019s\u2014 my daughter was young at the time she had the kids, so we\u2019ve always had the kids with us, and I always did the best I could to try to keep my family together. And because of the dealings with [the department of children and families] and because of just trying to keep my family together, that was the reason that I gave them that statement, because he absolutely assured me that [the department of children and families] would not come in and take my kids if I gave him a statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">On March 1, 2004, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that it must apply the reasonable doubt standard and, instead, followed \u201cthe existing law of Connecticut when making [its] determinations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>which is by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d The trial court observed that, \u201c[t]here is no evidence offered, other than the [defendant\u2019s testimony],\u201d that the alleged threats concerning the department of children and famines actually had occurred. The court stated that, \u201cas fact finder, [it] must assess credibility and that includes that of the defendant\u2019s testimony. Accrediting his testimony, his interest in the outcome of the case, the consistency of his testimony with other witnesses, but for the [department of children and families] issue, leads this fact finder to question its existence.\u201d The trial court therefore did not find \u201cthe defendant\u2019s testimony on that issue credible\u201d and \u201cdecline [d] to credit that portion of the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court concluded that, \u201cthe state has sustained its burden [of establishing] that the oral and written statements of the defendant [were] freely given . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The principles governing our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling are well established. \u201c[T]he use of an involuntary confession in a criminal trial is a violation of due process. . . . The state has the burden of proving the voluntariness of the confession by a fair preponderance of the evidence. . . . [T]he test of voluntariness is whether an examination of all the circumstances discloses that the conduct of law enforcement officials was such as to overbear [the defendant\u2019s] will to resist and bring about confessions not freely self-determined .... The ultimate test remains . . . Is the confession the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker? If it is, if he has willed to confess, it may be used against him. If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of his confession offends due process. . . . The determination, by the trial court, whether a confession is voluntary must be grounded upon a consideration of the circumstances surrounding it. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u201cFactors that may be taken into account, upon a proper factual showing, include: the youth of the accused; his lack of education; his intelligence; the lack of any advice as to his constitutional rights; the length of detention; the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning; and the use of physical punishment, such as the deprivation of food and sleep. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u201cTo begin, we note the established rule that [t]he trial court\u2019s findings as to the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation and confession are findings of fact . . . which will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u201c[Although we give deference to the trial court concerning these subsidiary factual determinations, such deference is not proper concerning the ultimate legal determination of voluntariness. . . . Consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the well established approach taken by the United States Supreme Court, we review the voluntariness of a confession independently, based on our own scrupulous examination of the record.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinder, </em>250 Conn. 385, 418-20, 736 A.2d 857 (1999). Accordingly, we \u201cconduct a plenary review of the record in order to make an independent determination of voluntariness.\u201d Id., 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly found that Goggin had not threatened the defendant with the removal of his children and grandchildren by the department of children and families. The defendant claims that this finding of fact is clearly erroneous because Goggin was unavailable to testify at the suppression hearing and, therefore, the trial court did not have the opportunity to assess personally Goggin\u2019s credibility. Additionally, the defendant contends that Goggin\u2019s prior testimony at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing, which was admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing, did not address the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements and, therefore, \u201cgave the trial court no insight into whether . . . the threats [of removal had] occurred.\u201d We conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual finding concerning the occurrence of the alleged threats is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u201cThe law governing [our] limited appellate review is clear. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we give great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>deference to its findings. ... In reviewing factual findings, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the [court] could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . Instead, we make every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>Schaller Subaru, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 526, 558-59, 893 A.2d 389 (2006) <em>(Pellegrino, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">At the suppression hearing, the defendant testified that he admitted to ownership of the cocaine only because Goggin had threatened that the department of children and families would remove his children and grandchildren from his home if he did not confess. Both Moynihan and Koshes testified, however, that neither Goggin nor any other police officer had threatened the defendant. Moreover, Goggin, who testified as to the circumstances leading to the defendant\u2019s oral and written statements, did not mention that these statements had been precipitated by any threats or references to the department of children and families. The trial court resolved the conflicting evidence in favor of the state, finding that the alleged threats had not occurred. Specifically, the trial court did not find the defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the alleged threats to be credible and, therefore, declined to credit it. It is well established that \u201c[i]t is within the province of the trial court, when sitting as the fact finder, to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility and effect to be given the evidence. . . . Credibility must be assessed . . . not by reading the cold printed record, but by observing firsthand the witness\u2019 conduct, demeanor and attitude. ... An appellate court must defer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of credibility because [i]t is the [fact finder] . . . [who has] an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and the parties; thus [the fact finder] is best able to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary inferences therefrom. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burton v. Mottolese, </em>267 Conn. 1, 40, 835 A.2d 998 (2003), cert, denied, 541 U.S. 1073, 124 S. Ct. 2422, 158 L. Ed. 2d 983 (2004). We defer to the trial court\u2019s assessments concerning credibility and, therefore, conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the alleged threats had not occurred. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 427 (\u201c[t]he court reasonably credited the police version of the events leading up to the defendant\u2019s confession, and we will not retry those credibility determinations on appeal\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s factual finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant claims, however, that although this court ordinarily defers to the trial court\u2019s assessment of credibility, such deference is unwarranted in this case because the trial did not have the opportunity to observe personally the in-court testimony of the relevant witnesses. Specifically, the defendant claims that because the trial court did not have the opportunity to observe Goggin\u2019s conduct, demeanor and attitude on the witness stand, and because the trial court\u2019s assessment of the defendant\u2019s credibility necessarily is intertwined with its assessment of Goggin\u2019s credibility, we should afford no deference to the trial court\u2019s credibility assessments. We reject this claim for two reasons. First, although the trial court did not have the opportunity to observe Goggin\u2019s in-court testimony, it did have the opportunity to observe the defendant\u2019s in-court testimony, which it did not find credible. Second, the defendant misapprehends the fundamental distinction between the function of the fact finder, which is to make credibility determinations and to find facts, and the function of the appellate tribunal, which is \u201cto review, and not to retry, the proceedings of the trial court.\u201d <em>In re Quanitra M., </em>60 Conn. App. 96, 106, 758 A.2d 863, cert, denied, 255 Conn. 903, 762 A.2d 909 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(2000). In light of our limited function, it would be improper for this court to supplant its credibility determinations for those of the fact finder, regardless of whether the fact finder relied on the cold printed record to make those determinations. Cf. <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 447-49, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989) (rejecting claim that this court need not defer to factual findings because evidence largely was documentary and, therefore, findings were not based on personal appraisal of witness\u2019 demeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendant next claims that, in finding that the alleged threats had not occurred, the trial court improperly relied on Goggin\u2019s prior testimony from the probable cause hearing at which the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements and, thus, the occurrence of the alleged threats, was not at issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We reject this claim. Goggin testified with respect to the circumstances surrounding the search of the defendant\u2019s home, the discovery of the cocaine in the defendant\u2019s bureau, and the defendant\u2019s subsequent oral and written admissions concerning ownership of the cocaine. At no point did Goggin mention that either he or any other police officer had threatened the defendant in any manner. Accordingly, the trial court reasonably could have inferred from Goggin\u2019s testimony that the alleged threats had not occurred. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>205 Conn. 515, 526, 534 A.2d 882 (1987) (\u201cIt is . . . the [trier of fact\u2019s] prerogative to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts found proven. ... A reasonable inference is a conclusion arrived at by a process of reasoning.

In light of the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, we conclude that ample evidence existed in the record to support the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the alleged threats involving the department of children and families had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The defendant next claims that this court should overrule <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 412-26, in which we concluded that the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut requires the voluntariness of a confession to be established by a preponderance of the evidence only. The defendant claims that three elements of constitutional analysis enumerated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> compel the conclusion that the constitution of Connecticut requires the state to meet a higher burden of proof to establish the voluntariness of a confession, namely, proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

In arriving at this conclusion, the court rejected the claim that \u201cjudging the admissibility of a confession by a preponderance of the evidence undermines the mandate of <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358 [364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970)],\u201d which requires proof of each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 486. The court noted that the purpose of a voluntariness hearing is not to ensure the accuracy and reliability of a jury\u2019s verdict, but, rather, to safeguard \u201cthe right of an individual, entirely apart from his guilt or innocence, not to be compelled to condemn himself by his own utterances.\u201d Id., 485. The court therefore concluded that, \u201c[a] guilty verdict is not rendered less reliable or less consonant with <em>[In re] Winship </em>simply because the admissibility of a confession is determined by a less stringent standard.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 487. Moreover, in <em>Lego, </em>the court was not convinced that the values served by the exclusionary rules compel the conclusion that the federal constitution requires the admissibility of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>confession to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 488. The court noted that, \u201cno substantial evidence has accumulated that federal rights have suffered from determining admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d; id.; and, without good cause, the court was \u201cunwilling to expand currently applicable exclusionary rules by erecting additional barriers to placing truthful and probative evidence before state juries . . . [particularly because] exclusionary rules are very much aimed at deterring lawless conduct by police and prosecution and it is very doubtful that escalating the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof in [f]ourth and [f]ifth amendment suppression hearings would be sufficiently productive in this respect to outweigh the public interest in placing probative evidence before juries for the purpose of arriving at truthful decisions about guilt or innocence.\u201d Id., 488-89. Lastly, the court observed that, \u201cthe [s]tates are free, pursuant to their own law, to adopt a higher standard.\u201d Id., 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>175 Conn. 398, 403, 399 A.2d 1269 (1978), the defendant claimed that this court should adopt a more stringent standard to determine the voluntariness of a confession under the Connecticut constitution because \u201cwhen a confession of guilt is attacked as having been involuntarily obtained, the reliability of the confession is raised and the principle requiring that guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is \u2018debased\u2019 unless it is required that voluntariness be proven by the same standard of proof.\u201d Id., 403-404. We rejected this claim because it relied on the \u201cunjustified assumption that a voluntariness hearing [is] designed to enhance the reliability of jury verdicts or to implement the presumption of innocence.\u201d Id., 405, citing <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 404 U.S. 482, 485, 487. We relied on <em>Lego </em>for the proposition that a guilty verdict is not rendered less reliable or less consonant with <em>In re Winship, </em>supra, 397 U.S. 364, simply because the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>sibility of a confession is determined by a fair preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>supra, 404-405. We also relied on <em>Lego </em>to reject the defendant\u2019s implicit claim that, \u201cthe values served by the exclusionary rules, including the deterring of improper police conduct, independently demand that the reasonable doubt standard be required in the admissibility of confessions.\u201d Id., 405. Because the defendant had failed to present a \u201cvalid reason why proof by [a preponderance of the evidence], with a judge making a positive finding on voluntariness, does not provide a fair and workable test which affords a criminal defendant those rights guaranteed him by both the United States and Connecticut [c]onstitution[s]\u201d; id., 406; we concluded that, \u201ca trial court should follow the preponderance of the evidence standard and not the reasonable doubt standard in determining whether or not the state has sustained its burden of proving voluntariness when a confession of a criminal defendant is offered into evidence.\u201d Id., 406-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 413, the defendant asked this court to overrule <em>Staples </em>and to conclude that the constitution of Connecticut requires the voluntariness of a confession to be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of this claim, the defendant relied on three <em>Geisler </em>factors, namely, sister state authority, historical considerations, and economic and sociological considerations. Id., 413-14. First, the defendant pointed to the decisions of several of our sister states that had determined that the voluntariness of a confession must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt under state law. Id., 419. Second, the defendant claimed that \u201cthe common-law approach to the admissibility of confession evidence, as reflected in certain case law and in commentary by Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift and William Blackstone, demonstrates a historical commitment to requiring the state to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the highest standard of proof on the voluntariness issue.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 414. Third, the defendant advanced two public policy considerations in support of his claim, namely, \u201cthat the reasonable doubt standard is necessary both to protect adequately a criminal defendant\u2019s right not to be compelled to incriminate himself or herself, and to protect a criminal defendant from an inaccurate jury verdict based on confession evidence.\u201d Id., 420-21. For the reasons hereinafter explained, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">With respect to sister state authority, we noted that, although a minority of states have concluded that the voluntariness of a confession must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, a \u201csubstantial majority of states to have considered this issue have followed <em>Lego </em>v. Twomey, supra, 404 U.S. 477, and have adopted the preponderance standard under state law. Furthermore, of those states adopting the higher standard, a number have failed to make clear whether their decisions are constitutionally based; see <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>439 S.W.2d 61, 64 (Ky. 1969), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 974, 90 S.

See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jiminez, </em>21 Cal. 3d 595, 605, 580 P.2d 672, 147 Cal. Rptr. 172 (1978) (adopting reasonable doubt standard of proof as \u2018judicially declared rule of criminal procedure\u2019), rev\u2019d, <em>People </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>49 Cal. 3d 63, 65, 775 P.2d 1042, 260 Cal. Rptr. 273 (1989) (pursuant to amendment to state constitution, California law on standard of proof for voluntariness determination is same as federal constitutional law); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 152, 430 N.E.2d 1198, cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1137, 102 S. Ct. 2967, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1356 (1982) (reasonable doubt standard imposed as matter of state\u2019s \u2018humane practice\u2019 rule). Also, a number of states appear to have adopted the reasonable doubt standard in anticipation of the adoption of such a standard by the [United States] Supreme Court under the federal constitution. See <em>Burton </em>v. <em>State, </em>260 Ind. 94, 105, 292 N.E.2d 790 (1973); <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>State, </em>285 So. 2d 889, 890 (Miss. 1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Yough, </em>49 N.J. 587, 589-601, 231 A.2d 598 (1967).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 419-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">With respect to historical considerations, we noted that, \u201c[t]he authorities relied upon by the defendant reflect the common-law evidentiary rule that a confession may be kept from the jury if the circumstances under which it was given render it unreliable evidence of guilt. . . . The purpose of the rule, which arose during the middle of the eighteenth century, prior to which time extrajudicial confessions were freely admitted . . . was to protect a defendant from an erroneous conviction based upon a false confession. . . . Generally, the approach under the common law rule was to identify certain inducements which made a confession unreliable. ... As frequently stated, the rule required a confession to be excluded from evidence, as involuntary, if it was obtained as a result of a promise of a benefit or leniency or a threat of harm. . . . This princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>pie was clearly part of the common law of evidence in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u201cIn <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 81 S. Ct. 735, 5 L. Ed. 2d 760 (1961), however, the [United States] Supreme Court rejected the common law focus on reliability in determining whether a confession is admissible. The court concluded that, under the federal constitution, in determining whether a confession should be excluded as involuntary, the test is whether the defendant\u2019s will was overborne, which is to be determined with complete disregard of whether or not the [accused] in fact spoke the truth. . . . This is so, the court reasoned, because involuntary confessions are excluded not because such confessions are unlikely to be true but because the methods used to extract them offend an underlying principle in the enforcement of our criminal law: that ours is an accusatorial and not an inquisitorial system \u2014 a system in which the [s]tate must establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured and may not by coercion prove its charge against an accused out of his own mouth. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u201cIt is clear, then, that the common law exclusionary rule employed a different notion of voluntariness and relied upon a different rationale for excluding confession evidence than its constitutional counterpart. The former was an evidentiary rule aimed at safeguarding the trustworthiness of evidence at trial, while the latter is aimed at protecting a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be free from compulsion to incriminate himself or herself. Our common law on this issue, is, therefore, of limited usefulness in defining the contours of the constitutional exclusionary rule, for the common law authorities upon which the defendant relies simply did not address themselves to the question of what rule or standards of proof would be appropriate or necessary to effectuate the goal of protecting a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be free from coercion, without regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>probativeness of the confession produced.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 414-16. Accordingly, we concluded that the histoiy of this state did not support the defendant\u2019s claim that the constitution of Connecticut requires the voluntariness of a confession to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that a voluntariness determination serves the important public interest of ensuring the accuracy of a jury\u2019s verdict, we noted that we previously had rejected this claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 405, because it \u201cis not the primary purpose of the voluntariness inquiry and . . . the reasonable doubt standard is not mandated in order to satisfy the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the ultimate issue of guilt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>supra, 237 Conn. 421. Without retreating from that position, however, we acknowledged that, \u201cthe concern that coercion provides a reason to confess falsely is, nevertheless, a long-standing ground for not receiving coerced confessions into evidence, which is reflected in our own common law precedent. Thus, to the extent that there may be a correlation between involuntariness and falsity, this is a relevant consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u201cWe have said that [t]he function of the burden of proof employed by the court is to allocate] the risk of error between the litigants and indicate] the relative importance of the ultimate decision. ... [A] standard of proof represents an attempt to instruct the fact finder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication. Although the phrases preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt are quantitatively imprecise, they do communicate to the finder of fact different notions concerning the degree of confidence he is expected to have in the correctness of his factual conclusions. . . . Further, the standard of proof influences the relative frequency ... of erroneous outcomes . . . either in favor of the state when the true facts warrant judgment for the defendant or in favor of the defendant when the true facts warrant judgment for the state. . . . Because the standard of proof affects the comparative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes, the choice of the standard to be applied in a particular kind of litigation should, in a rational world, reflect an assessment of the comparative social disutility of each. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cThe preponderance standard is said to [require] the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before [it] may find in favor of the party who has the burden to persuade the [trier] of the fact\u2019s existence . . . and to reflect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>view that the social disutility of an erroneous decision in either direction is comparable. ... In contrast, the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt dramatically shifts the risk of an erroneous decision, reflecting the view that it is far worse to make an erroneous decision in favor of one party than it is to make it in favor of the other.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 421-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">With this background in mind, we addressed the defendant\u2019s claim that his right to be free from self-incrimination required the imposition of the standard of proof that minimized, to the greatest extent possible, the risk of an erroneous decision on voluntariness in favor of the state. We observed that, \u201c[t]he state, of course, currently bears the burden of persuasion on the voluntariness issue, and must convince the trial court by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession sought to be admitted was voluntarily given. Our focus in the present inquiry is, therefore, on any incremental gains to be realized from imposing the higher reasonable doubt standard. As the defendant points out, this determination often turns on the trial court\u2019s resolution of conflicting testimony by police and the accused. In such circumstances, we believe, it is only in rare cases that the trial court might be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that a confession is voluntary but nevertheless harbor a reasonable doubt about the same. Although closing this gap would of course benefit defendants in those cases, we are unpersuaded that it would significantly advance the deterrence function of the exclusionary rule. The greatest part of any deterrent effect of exclusion must, in the first instance, be attributed to requiring the prosecution to prove, even by a preponderance, that the confession sought to be admitted was not obtained by improper methods. We are not convinced that the exclusion of confessions in very close cases, under the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>doubt standard, is likely to produce a significant change in the behavior in police officers in pursuing such evidence. Cf. <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 404 U.S. 489. In this regard, we note that the [United States] Supreme Court has indicated that the preponderance standard of proof is sufficient for all determinations of the applicability of an exclusionary rule, which, in its view, is aimed primarily at deterrence. See <em>Nix </em>v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 444-45 n.5, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 81 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1984); see also <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>[479 U.S. 157, 168, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986)] (adopting preponderance standard for preliminary question of validity of <em>Miranda </em>waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u201cWe also are unpersuaded that the relationship between the court\u2019s preliminary determination of voluntariness and the accuracy of jury verdicts provides a compelling basis for imposing a higher standard of proof. The defendant\u2019s contention, and that of some sister states, that this concern is weighty appears to rest on two premises: first, that involuntary confessions are of <em>highly </em>suspect reliability, and second, that juries are likely to accept a confession uncritically. With regard to the first, however, the defendant has not suggested, nor do we perceive, that involuntariness necessarily equates with falsity. Although coercion is reasonably thought to create a reason to confess falsely, whether a particular coerced confession is also likely to be false depends on many variables. Thus, the exclusion of a confession where there is a reasonable doubt about its voluntariness does not invariably mean that a false confession has been suppressed. Furthermore, safeguards against the admission of false confessions other than a stringent burden of proof are already in place. The state must demonstrate the corpus delicti of the crime to which the defendant has confessed. . . . Additionally, the defendant ... [is free] to familiarize a jury with circumstances that attend the taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of his confession, including facts bearing upon its weight and voluntariness. . . . Before deciding to convict, the jury must determine whether the confession is to be credited, and, if so, whether it is sufficient with any other evidence to demonstrate guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We have recently reiterated our confidence in the ability of juries to discern the proper weight to be afforded conflicting evidence in this area. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u201cAt stake for the state in the application of any exclusionary rule is its interest in efficient, effective law enforcement. The exclusionary rule at issue occasions the loss of otherwise relevant and powerful evidence of guilt, the loss of which might seriously weaken if not decimate a state\u2019s case. The cost of the trial court possibly excluding more confessions because of a higher standard of proof is to permit defendants to avoid trial and a just conviction by a jury, when the jury would have the opportunity to consider all of the circumstances under which the confession was elicited and weigh it accordingly. We are not persuaded that any incremental, indirect or speculative benefit that might flow from imposition of the reasonable doubt standard to the voluntariness determination substantially outweighs its increased costs to effective law enforcement and to the truth seeking process. . . . We remain convinced, rather, that the preponderance standard provides a fair and workable test; <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 406; that strikes the appropriate balance, in light of our historical background and contemporary policy concerns, between the various interests at stake. The preponderance standard, we believe, is entirely consonant with the general contours of a constitutional safeguard rooted in flexible principles of due process.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 423-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>With this background in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that <em>James </em>was wrongly decided and, therefore, must be overruled.

Stare decisis is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency. . . . Stare decisis, however, is not an end in itself. . . . Experience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better. . . .

For the reasons explained in <em>James, </em>\u201cwe do not read the common-law rule as applied in this state to have held the prosecution to an especially severe standard of proof . . . and, consequently, we agree with the state that it does not support the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Lastly, the defendant and the amicus curiae Connecticut Ciiminal Defense Lawyers Association claim that the reasonable doubt standard is necessary both to protect adequately a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be free from self-incrimination, and to ensure the accuracy and reliability of a jury verdict based on confession evidence. In support of this claim, the amicus curiae relies on various sociological studies indicating that juries are unable to recognize and disregard false confessions. See, e.g., S. Drizin <em>&amp; </em>R. Leo, \u201cThe Problem of False Confessions In the Post-DNA World,\u201d 82 N.C. L. Rev. 891, 962-63, 996 (2004); R. Leo &amp; R.

Indeed, the studies establish that the \u201cfalse confession problem is . . . not pandemic in the American criminal justice system, but rather concentrated among a narrow and vulnerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>population: persons with mental disabilities. \u201d P.

It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . The plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ...

Even if we assume, arguendo, that the jury instruction at issue in this case, like the jury instruction at issue in <em>Wilson, </em>possibly is susceptible of an unacceptable interpretation when viewed in isolation, the instruction nevertheless was not offered in isolation. Indeed, as previously explained, the trial court\u2019s instructions, when viewed in their entirety, adequately informed the jury of the presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Furthermore, their advocacy of a stringent rule of exclusion appears to reflect a temporary expansion of the common-law rule during the early nineteenth century that was later rejected. According to Wigmore, the common-law exclusionary rule was initially quite narrow in scope, but underwent significant expansion by English judges, who, largely out of concern arising from the common-law rule prohibiting criminal defendants from testifying in their defense came to espouse mistrust of confessions and to apply the common-law evidentiary rule to require exclusion upon the finding of any conduct that qualified as an inducement, however slight. 3 J. Wigmore [Evidence (Chadbourne Rev. 1970)] \u00a7\u00a7 820 and 820a, pp. 297-301 .... Wigmore suggested, however, that this formal, exacting approach to confession evidence constituted a distortion of the rule that was not justified by its true rationale \u2014 to keep false confessions from the jury \u2014 and that, once criminal defendants were permitted to testify in their own trials, it was proper in most cases to submit a confession to the jury. See [id.], \u00a7\u00a7 820a and 820b, pp. 300-306. This court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>[71 Conn. 293, 310-11, 41 A. 820 (1898)], also suggested that the formalistic approach that derived from English case law applying the common-law rule, upon which Swift relied, was unwarranted, and indicated instead that a more moderate, or \u2018common sense\u2019 view should prevail. The defendant, points to no case applying the commonlaw rule that adopts the severe approach to exclusion advanced by these commentators. \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 417-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> The defendant concedes that the remaining <em>Geisler </em>factors, namely, federal precedent, Connecticut precedent and the text of the relevant constitutional provisions do not support the imposition of a higher burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> The defendant claims that this court improperly concluded in <em>James </em>that the jurisprudence of New Hampshire and Wisconsin fails to make clear whether their decisions are constitutionally based. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 420.

The presumption of innocence was with this defendant when he was first presented for trial in this case. He must be considered free of any bias or prejudice of burden arising out of the fact that he has been arrested. This continues with him through this trial unless and until such time as all the evidence produced here in the orderly conduct of the case, considered in the light of these instructions of law and deliberated upon by you in the jury room, satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u201cThus the presumption of innocence alone is sufficient to acquit the defendant unless the jurors are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt after a careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence and facts in this case.

The burden to prove the defendant guilty of the crime or crimes with which he is charged is upon the state. The defendant does not have to prove his innocence.

Although the defendant does not challenge the foregoing instruction in the present appeal, he claims that because this instruction was issued in conjunction with the challenged instruction, it reasonably is possible that the jury was misled. After reviewing the jury charge as a whole, we are convinced that the trial court adequately apprised the jury that the defendant was entitled to a presumption of innocence and that the state bore the burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>275 Conn. 205, 245 n.21, 881 A.2d 160 (2005) (no reasonable possibility that jury was misled by trial court\u2019s instruction that \u201c[t]he law is made to protect society and persons whose guilt. . . has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and not to protect persons who have been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 176-77 (no reasonable possibility that jury was misled).

First, the defendant does not claim, and there is no evidence in the record to suggest, that the trial court intentionally disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>garded the Appellate Court\u2019s suggestion in <em>Wilson. </em>Indeed, because the language of the instruction at issue in the present case is distinct from the language of the instruction at issue in <em>Wilson; </em>see footnote 25 of this opinion; it is difficult to perceive how the trial court could have disregarded the Appellate Court\u2019s suggestion intentionally and flagrantly. Second, as the defendant concedes, \u201ca suggestion by the Appellate Court does not carry the same weight as an exercise of . . . supervisory authority\u201d and, therefore, does not implicate the same institutional concerns. Lastly, and most importantly, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that a per se rule of reversal is required under the plain error doctrine in the absence of manifest injustice in the trial court proceedings.

I agree with and join the majority opinion. For the reasons set forth therein, I am not persuaded that we should overrule our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 425-26, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996), that, under the Connecticut constitution, a confession is admissible if the state has demonstrated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>voluntariness of the confession by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">I write separately only to underscore that, to the extent that false confessions have led to a number of wrongful convictions across the United States, our legislature is free to enact legislation requiring police to videotape confessions whenever it is reasonably feasible to do so. Although valid reasons may exist not to impose such a requirement on the police, there can be little doubt that recording confessions would dramatically reduce, if not eliminate, any possible likelihood of an erroneous conviction predicated on an involuntary confession. Indeed, videotaping confessions would greatly aid both the trial court and the jury in evaluating the voluntariness and, ultimately, the reliability of those confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Moreover, as the dissent notes, it is apparent that the risk of a false confession is appreciably greater in cases of juveniles and persons with mental disabilities. Because children and mentally disabled persons are especially vulnerable to police overreaching \u2014 and because it appears that they also are more likely than others to confess falsely even in the absence of improper government coercion \u2014 videotaping confessions by such persons would serve an especially salutary purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b209-8\">KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">dissenting.

Given the growing body of evidence that has come to light since <em>James </em>demonstrating the problem of erroneous convictions generally and false confessions specifically, I would use this opportunity to overrule this court\u2019s holding in <em>James </em>that \u201cthe preponderance standard provides a \u2018fair and workable test\u2019 . . . that strikes the appropriate balance . . . for the preliminary determination of voluntariness [of confessions].\u201d (Citations omitted.)

Although in 18 of the cases the record is unclear as to the motivation for the false confession, in only 5 instances did the confessions appear to have been given freely and voluntarily. Id.

A 2004 study analyzed 125 \u201cinterrogation-induced false confessions that can be classified as \u2018proven\u2019 \u2014 that is, confessions that are indisputably false because at least one piece of dispositive evidence objectively establishes, beyond any doubt, that the confessor could not possibly have been the peipetrator of the crime.\u201d S.

See <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), this court noted that, although \u201c[w]e have frequently relied upon decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the . . . United States constitution ... to define the contours of the protections provided in the various sections of the declaration of rights contained in our state constitution . . . [w]e have also, however, determined in some instances that the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our own constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Therefore, we decided, \u201c[i]n order to construe the contours of our state constitution and reach reasoned and principled results, the following tools of analysis should be considered to the extent applicable: (1) the textual approach ... (2) holdings and dicta of this court, and the Appellate Court . . . (3) federal precedent ... (4) sister state decisions or sibling approach ... (5) the historical approach, including the historical constitutional setting and the debates of the framers . . . and (6) economic/sociological considerations.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 684-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">I acknowledge that, strictly speaking, several of these factors weigh in favor of adhering to the federal constitutional standard. In my view, however, a reexamination of the factual and legal underpinnings of the federal precedent and this court\u2019s decision in <em>James, </em>read in light of the sixth <em>Geisler </em>factor, demands that we adopt the reasonable doubt standard under our state constitution. Accordingly, I begin with a discussion of the reasoning of the cases from which the preponderance standard eventually emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In analyzing this issue, it is important to begin with the rationale underlying the utilization of the reasonable doubt standard. In <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), the Supreme Court underscored the well settled standard for the burden of proof in criminal cases: \u201cLest there remain any doubt about the constitutional stature of the reasonable-doubt standard, we explicitly hold that the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d In his concurring opinion in <em>In re Winship, </em>Justice Harlan expounded on the basis for the distinction between the standards of proof in civil and criminal trials. \u201cBecause the standard of proof affects the comparative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes [factually erroneous convictions and factually erroneous acquittals], the choice of the standard to be applied in a particular kind of litigation should . . . reflect an assessment of the comparative social disutility of each. When one makes such an assessment, the reason for different standards of proof in civil as opposed to criminal litigation becomes apparent. In a civil suit . . . we view it as no more serious in general for there to be an erroneous verdict in the defendant\u2019s favor than for there to be an erroneous verdict in the plaintiffs favor. A preponderance of the evidence standard therefore seems peculiarly appropriate for . . . it simply requires the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before [he] may find in favor of the party who has the burden to persuade the [judge] of the fact\u2019s existence. In a criminal case, on the other hand, we do not view the social disutility of convicting an innocent man as equivalent to the disutility of acquitting someone who is guilty. ... In this context, I view the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>case as bottomed on a fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 371-72 (Harlan, J., concurring). In light of the recent exposure of the systemic problem of wrongful convictions in our criminal justice system, the importance of protecting this \u201cfundamental value determination\u201d is stronger than ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In 1964, the United States Supreme Court declared: \u201cIt is now axiomatic that a defendant in a criminal case is deprived of due process of law if his conviction is founded, in whole or in part, upon an involuntary confession, without regard for the truth or falsity of the confession . . . and even though there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction. . . . Equally clear is the defendant\u2019s constitutional right at some stage in the proceedings to object to the use of the confession and to have a fair hearing and a reliable determination on the issue of voluntariness, a determination uninfluenced by the truth or falsity of the confession.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 376-77, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964). The court continued: \u201cIt is now inescapably clear that the [fourteenth [a]mendment forbids the use of involuntary confessions <em>not only because of the probable unreliability of confessions that are obtained in a manner deemed </em>coercive, but also because of the strongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will . . . and because of the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>themselves.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 385-86. These moral judgments expressed in the <em>In re Winship </em>and <em>Jackson </em>opinions constitute the foundation of the constitutional right against self-incrimination as well as the right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 404 U.S. 477, the Supreme Court considered which burden of proof should be applied in the determination of the voluntariness of confessions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unlike the <em>Jackson </em>court, the <em>Lego </em>court rejected the notion that the purpose of a voluntariness hearing was to enhance the reliability of jury verdicts. Id., 486. Although the court noted that it had acknowledged in <em>Jackson </em>that \u201ccoerced confessions are forbidden in part because of their \u2018probable unreliability\u2019 \u201d; id., 484 n.12; it remarked that the \u201csole issue in [a voluntariness] hearing is whether a confession was coerced. Whether it be true or false is irrelevant; indeed, such an inquiry is forbidden.\u201d Id., 484-85 n.12. This is because \u201cdue process forbids the use of coerced confessions, whether or not reliable.\u201d Id., 485 n.13. Because it concluded that the purpose of excluding coerced confessions was unrelated to improving the reliability of jury verdicts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the <em>Lego </em>court rejected the notion that admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>sibility of a confession proven voluntary by a preponderance of the evidence undermined the mandate in <em>In re Winship, </em>which, the court reasoned, requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt only of the essential elements of the charged crime. Id., 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The <em>Lego </em>court did not end its inquiry there. The court addressed a second contention, \u201cthat evidence offered against a defendant at a criminal trial and challenged on constitutional grounds must be determined admissible beyond a reasonable doubt in order to give adequate protection to those values that exclusionary rules are designed to serve.\u201d Id., 487. The court acknowledged its decisions in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) (excluding confessions acquired though custodial interrogations unless adequate warnings were administered and waiver of rights obtained), <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652 (1914) (rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>impermissible admission of evidence obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights), and <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961) (extending fourth amendment protections to actions by state actors), and noted that in these cases evidence was kept from the jury, regardless of its probative value, for reasons other than ensuring the reliability of verdicts. <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 404 U.S. 487-88. The court, however, rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that the values underlying the exclusionary rule \u2014 protection of fundamental rights and deterrence of police misconduct \u2014 demanded a higher standard of proof in determining admissibility of confessions. Id., 488-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In rejecting this claim, the <em>Lego </em>court explained: \u201c[F]rom our experience [with the exclusionary rule] ... no substantial evidence has accumulated that federal rights have suffered from determining admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence. [The] [petitioner offers nothing to suggest that admissibility rulings have been unreliable or otherwise wanting in quality because not based on some higher standard. Without good cause, we are unwilling to expand currently applicable exclusionary rules by erecting additional barriers to placing <em>truthful and probative evidence </em>before state juries and by revising the standards applicable in collateral proceedings. Sound reason for moving further in this direction has not been offered here nor do we discern any at the present time. This is particularly true since the exclusionary rules are very much aimed at deterring lawless conduct by police and prosecution and it is very doubtful that escalating the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof in [f]ourth and [f]ifth [a]mendment suppression hearings would be sufficiently productive in this respect to outweigh the public interest in placing <em>probative evidence </em>before juries for the purpose of arriving at truthful decisions about guilt or innocence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Thus, even while rejecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>idea that the admissibility test should in part be concerned with trustworthiness, the court noted the probative value of confession evidence at trial and assumed that admitted confessions were \u201ctruthful . . . .\u201d Id., 489. Moreover, although the petitioner in <em>Lego </em>may not have been able to produce evidence that \u201cadmissibility rulings [had] been unreliable or otherwise wanting in quality\u201d; id., 488; the flood of evidence collected by scholars and researchers regarding false confessions impacting wrongful convictions since Lego was decided demonstrably undermines the propriety of the preponderance standard. Notably, after concluding that preponderance of the evidence was the proper burden for the state to sustain in proving voluntariness, the court took the unusual step of adding, \u201c[o]f course, the [s]tates are free, pursuant to their own law, to adopt a higher standard. They may indeed differ as to the appropriate resolution of the values they find at stake.\u201d Id., 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Supreme Court decided <em>Lego </em>in 1972, long before the use of DNA testing exposed the significant problem of wrongful conviction in the criminal justice system. In light of the substantial evidence uncovered regarding the considerable role of false confessions in this alarming and widespread phenomenon, it is reasonable to imagine that the <em>Lego </em>court would come to a different conclusion today. At the very least, the court would have to acknowledge and reconcile the evidence that we currently confront. Certainly, there is a distinction to be made between involuntary confessions and false confessions. The <em>Lego </em>court explicated that distinction thoroughly in its decision. See id., 482-87. As the court also recognized, however, the two issues are closely related. If the primary purpose of the voluntariness determination is to evaluate whether a defendant confessed of his or her own volition and to exclude all confessions that are involuntary, both true and false involuntary confessions would be identified as inadmis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>sible. All involuntary confessions are equally abhorrent to our criminal law. The anecdotal evidence of the significant role of false confessions in wrongful convictions necessarily implicates the voluntariness concern. While the strong-arm tactics that often led to false confessions before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision effectively abolishing that practice in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 384 U.S. 436, may no longer be prevalent, anecdotal evidence shows that the deceptive interrogation techniques currently employed by police interrogators are equally capable of coercing innocent suspects into false confessions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">As discussed previously in this dissent and reiterated by the majority in its opinion, this court has stated unequivocally that the constitutional standard in this state for determining the voluntariness of a confession is preponderance of the evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 425-26; see also p. 158 of the majority opinion. The majority remains steadfastly loyal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>court\u2019s reasoning in <em>James. </em>In light of the previous, discussion of erroneous convictions based on false confessions, however, I cannot join in that unflinching adherence, and I instead utilize this opportunity to revisit some of the reasoning of the <em>James </em>decision in favor of the preponderance standard. Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>175 Conn. 398, 406, 399 A.2d 1269 (1978), the <em>James </em>court noted, \u201cthat there was not substantial evidence that voluntariness determinations governed by the preponderance standard were <em>unreliable </em>or would result in derogations of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, [and] concluded that \u2018[w]e have been given no valid reason why proof by [the preponderance] standard, with a judge making a positive finding on voluntariness, does not provide a fair and workable test which affords a criminal defendant those rights guaranteed him by both the United States and Connecticut constitutionfs].\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 413. Thus, even as the <em>James </em>court considered \u201cunjustified\u201d the assumption that the purpose of a voluntariness hearing was to \u201cenhance the reliability of jury verdicts\u201d; id., 412; immediately thereafter, it claimed that there was no proof offered to show that determinations under the preponderance standard were unreliable, undermining its previous claim that admissibility of confessions was unrelated to reliability. Id., 412-13. The majority cites with approval the <em>James </em>court\u2019s iteration of the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Lego </em>that a voluntariness determination is not intended to ensure the ultimate reliability of a jury\u2019s verdict, but adds that \u201c[w]ithout retreating from that position . . . we acknowledged [in <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 421-22] that, \u2018the concern that coercion provides a reason to confess falsely is, nevertheless, a long-standing ground for not receiving coerced confessions into evidence, which is reflected in our common law precedent. Thus, to the extent that there may be a correlation between involuntariness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>falsity, this is a relevant consideration.\u2019 \u201d See p. 166 of the majority opinion. This solipsistic reasoning seems to me a distinction without a difference. Either reliability is a concern in voluntariness determinations or it is not. It is irresponsible for this court to espouse a standard based on the rationale that a determination of voluntariness is divorced from any concern of coercion, and then in the next breath acknowledge, almost parenthetically, that \u201cto the extent\u201d they are related, this is, in fact, \u201ca relevant consideration.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In light of the copious evidence of wrongful convictions and admission of false confessions in this countiy, the claim that admission of confessions should be divorced from any consideration of reliability is, at a minimum, socially irresponsible. Undeniably, many unreliable confessions have been admitted for consideration by triers of fact. The majority\u2019s reiteration of the <em>James </em>court\u2019s affirmation of its \u201cconfidence in the ability of juries to discern the proper weight to be afforded to conflicting evidence\u201d regarding whether to credit a confession \u201cand if so, whether it is sufficient with other evidence to demonstrate guilt beyond a reasonable doubt]\u201d; id., 424; see p. 169 of the majority opinion; plainly has been discredited by several scholarly studies conducted subsequent to that case. Statistics have shown not only that juries are unable to identify false confessions, but that they regularly base their verdicts on such confessions despite other evidence pointing to innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">One recent study demonstrated that in a sample of thirty proven false confession cases, 73 percent of the defendants were convicted even in the absence of any physical or other significant credible evidence to corroborate the confession. See R. Leo &amp; R. Ofshe, supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>88 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 481-82;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see also S. Drizin &amp; R. Leo, supra, 82 N.C. L. Rev. 960 (in study of 125 proven false confession cases, 81 percent of those defendants who went to trial were convicted by juries even though their confessions were later proven false). Mock jury studies have shown that confession evidence has greater impact than eyewitness testimony, character testimony and other forms of evidence. See S. Kassin &amp; K. Neumann, \u201cOn the Power of Confession Evidence: An Experimental Test of the \u2018Fundamental Difference\u2019 Hypothesis,\u201d 21 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 469 (1997). These studies demonstrate that jurors are unable to detect false confessions because of the commonsense expectation of self-serving behavior in others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and the accompanying disinclination to believe that a person would falsely confess.

Indeed, the facts of the present case would appear' to exemplify a scenario in which the trial court very well might have been convinced that the confession by the defendant, David Lawrence, was more likely than not voluntary, and yet still have harbored a reasonable doubt as to its voluntariness. The defendant testified that, while he was being interrogated alone in his bedroom by Detective Michael Goggin of the Waterbury police department, Goggin threatened to have the department of children and families remove the defendant\u2019s children if he did not admit to possession of the drugs found in his home. Although other police officers testified that Goggin did not threaten the defendant, they were not in the room at the time of the interrogation, and it is not surprising that Goggin did not admit that he threatened the defendant when he testified at the probable cause hearing. While I make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>no assumptions about the internal deliberations of the trial court on this issue, it is far from inconceivable that the facts presented to the court regarding the voluntariness deliberation could have raised a reasonable doubt in the court\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Justice Brennan was all too accurate when he stated that \u201c[t]riers of fact accord confessions such heavy weight in their determinations that the introduction of a confession makes the other aspects of a trial in court superfluous . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colorado </em>v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 182, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986) (Brennan, J., dissenting). As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 296, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991), \u201c[a] confession is like no other evidence.\u201d Thus, the <em>James </em>court\u2019s contention, reiterated with approval by the majority in its opinion, that the defendant is free \u201cto familiarize a jury with circumstances that attend the taking of his confession, including facts bearing upon its weight and voluntariness\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 425; see pp. 168-69 of the majority opinion; is unavailing. Although the jury must decide whether to credit a confession and must weigh whether the other evidence adduced at trial is in accordance with the confession or demands acquittal, as discussed previously, experience shows that a jury\u2019s ability to evaluate that evidence is biased dramatically by the introduction of a confession, no matter how incredible it appears in light of other evidence. Requiring the state to prove the voluntariness of a confession beyond a reasonable doubt before it is submitted to the jury increases the chances that, when a jury does consider a confession, that confession will be reliable and voluntary. There is simply no reason not to utilize every opportunity our legal system affords to ensure the accuracy of jury verdicts and avoid wrongful convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>This court has, on more than one occasion, decided that the Connecticut constitution provides greater protection of its citizens than that mandated by the United States constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our reasoning for doing so in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 579 A.2d 58 (1990), is instructive. In <em>Marsala, </em>we rejected the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 920-21, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984), and <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 987-88, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737 (1984). <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 171. We deteimined that, \u201c[although we recognize that the exclusionary rule exacts a certain \u2018cost\u2019 from society in the form of the suppression of relevant evidence in criminal trials, we conclude, nevertheless, that this \u2018cost\u2019 is not sufficiently \u2018substantial\u2019 to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>come the benefits to be gained by our disavowal of the <em>Leon </em>court\u2019s good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.\u201d Id., 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In the context of this case, the cost of the higher burden of proof does not outweigh the benefit to society. Although some voluntary and reliable confessions may be barred from introduction when there is doubt about their vohmtariness, the overall effect will be to hold police officers and prosecutors to the highest standard when prosecuting their cases for the state. It is difficult to fathom the argument against assuring the protection of our citizens from unduly coercive police tactics in interrogation,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> especially if we are concerned with protecting the innocent from unwarranted prosecution. In that vein, we acknowledged in <em>Marsala </em>our \u201cwillingness in other areas of the law to uphold the exclusion of concededly reliable and relevant evidence on the basis of some greater benefit that will be realized by its suppression.\u201d Id. The present case presents an ideal opportunity to exercise that willingness to exclude for the greater benefit of ensuring the reliability of evidence before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Under the fourth prong of the <em>Geisler </em>analysis, we examine the approach of our sister states for guidance. While it is true that a majority of states follow the federal preponderance standard, a significant minority have chosen to require greater protection for criminal defendants under their state constitutions and utilize the reasonable doubt standard. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 430 N.E.2d 1198, cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1137, 102 S. Ct. 2967, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1356 (1982), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court explained its rationale for requiring a judge to find a confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt before submitting it to the jury for consideration. \u201cUnder our \u2018humane practice\u2019 the initial screening by the judge is the \u2018basic determination safeguarding the accused.\u2019 ... [A] defendant\u2019s statement is usually \u2018the key item in the proof of guilt, and certainly one of overpowering weight with the jury.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 152. Recently, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine refused to overrule its long-standing policy requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt of voluntariness, even though the court acknowledged that this standard went beyond what was required of it under the federal constitution, reaffirming that state public policy required the most stringent test. \u201c[T]o confirm and preserve the value reflected in the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination we must minimize the risks of allowing legal effectiveness to non-voluntary, or involuntary, testimonial self-condemnation even at the expense of producing a loss of evidence which might have probative value; such was the price that our society had chosen to pay when it conferred constitutional protection upon the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Rees, 748 A.2d 976, 979 (Me. 2000), quoting <em>State </em>v. Collins, 297 A.2d 620, 627 (Me. 1972). The New Hampshire Supreme Court also determined that the federal standard was not sufficiently protective of its citizens\u2019 rights. \u201cThe preponderance test does not provide a sufficient safeguard against [the] danger [of admitting involuntary confessions]. The adoption of the preponderance standard would amount to a determination that it is no more serious for an involuntary confession to be admitted than it is for a voluntary one to be excluded. ... A confession is a special type of evidence. Its acceptance basically amounts to conviction. Confessions are usually obtained in the psychological atmosphere of police custody and in the greatest secrecy in which the cards can be stacked against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>accused. He has no means of combating the evidence produced by the police save by his own testimony. The stakes are too high and the risk of error too great to permit a determination of admissibility to be decided by abalance of probabilities.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>117 N.H. 145, 147, 370 A.2d 1153 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In addition, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and New York all utilize the reasonable doubt standard of proof for voluntariness. See, e.g., <em>Pruitt </em>v. <em>State, </em>834 N.E.2d 90, 114 (Ind. 2005), cert, denied, 548 U.S. 910, 126 S. Ct. 2936, 165 L. Ed. 2d 962 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>385 So. 2d 200, 204 (La. 1980); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>858 So. 2d 190, 194 (Miss. App. 2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Yough, </em>49 N.J. 587, 595, 231 A.2d 598 (1967); <em>People </em>v. <em>Witherspoon, </em>66 N.Y.2d 973, 974, 489 N.E.2d 758,498 N.Y.S.2d 789 (1985). Maryland and South Carolina require a judge to make a pretrial finding of voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence, but require the jury to find voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt before considering it as evidence against the accused. See, e.g., <em>Baynor </em>v. <em>State, </em>355 Md. 726, 729 n.1, 736 A.2d 325 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>296 S.C. 54, 56, 370 S.E.2d 611 (1988). These states all have determined that their state constitutions mandate proof of voluntariness by the highest legal standard before a confession may be used as evidence against an accused person.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although they represent a minority, it is a significant minority consisting of a wide geographical and political range. Thus, any misgiving that the reasonable doubt standard is unworkable is refuted by the states that have been utilizing it for decades. Connecticut should seize this opportunity to afford its citizens this basic protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Although I am unaware of studies examining the connection between the admission of false confessions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the requisite burden of proof for admissibility, I believe it is safe to assume that raising the burden of proof decreases the chance of admitting both a coerced false confession and a coerced true confession, either of which, according to the United States Supreme Court and this court, is equally offensive to constitutional due process rights. As noted previously, studies have been conducted, however, examining the persuasive power of confessions, even when much if not all of the additional evidence points to the defendant\u2019s innocence. These studies show the vast disproportionate credence allotted to confessions by juries weighing evidence. Thus, it is inconceivable, given the demonstrated problem of wrongful convictions and the concomitant role of false confessions in that epidemic, that this court would refuse the opportunity it is offered to combat this constitutionally abhorrent scourge.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-9\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions . . .

Individuals who are coerced into falsely confessing but ultimately not convicted may still lose their freedom for extended periods of time and suffer a number of other significant corollary harms as well: the stigma of criminal accusation (particularly if the person has falsely confessed to serious crimes such as murder or rape), the ongoing damage to their personal and professional reputation (even if charges are dropped or the innocent defendant is eventually acquitted), loss of income, savings, a job or career (sometimes resulting in bankruptcy), and the emotional strain of being apart from one\u2019s friends and family (which sometimes results in marital separation or divorce). To those innocents who suffer these uqjust fates, the assertion by some scholars that only false confessions leading to wrongful convictions should count for scholarly inquiry or public policy reform or that only false confessions leading to wrongful convictions impose any meaningful harm is obviously misguided and myopic, if not downright cruel.\u201d S.

Commentators have explained that, \u201c[i]nitially, the dominant and preferred rationale was to promote reliability in the trial process by excluding confessions that were the product of police coercion or improper influence because they were likely to be false or untrustworthy. However, the 1930s and 1940s saw the ascendance of another idea \u2014 that courts should only admit confessions into evidence that were the product of a free and independent will. A third but subordinate rationale underlying the voluntariness test was that confessions elicited through fundamentally unfair police methods should be excluded so as to deter offensive police behavior, regardless of whether the suspect confessed involuntarily or his statements were likely to be trustworthy. These underlying purposes \u2014 reliability, protecting free will, and fundamental fairness \u2014 roughly correspond to the three goals of the adversary system: promoting truth-finding, protecting individual rights, and checking state power.\u201d R.

See P. Cassell, supra, 22 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Policy 526. Cassell\u2019s main criticism of Leo and Ofshe is their reliance on secondary sources for factual information underpinning the claims of innocence in some of their case studies. See id., 525, 580. In support of his claim that \u201c[e]ven among the fifteen \u2018proven\u2019 cases of wrongful conviction from false confession [cited in the Leo and Ofshe article], many are disputed\u201d; id., 581; however, Cassell cites the opinions of the prosecutors, district attorneys, and state police who worked on these cases that those people whom they helped to prosecute were in fact guilty, despite the fact that two of those people were officially exonerated by DNA evidence. Id., 581-82. Though there may be dispute about the accuracy of the media in reporting details of crimes, it hardly can be argued that those people with a personal stake in winning convictions are less biased than the members of the media. For example, Steven Linscott had his conviction overturned twice before prosecutors submitted biological evidence to DNA testing that proved conclusively that he could not have been the source of the seminal fluid in the murder for which he was convicted, leading the prosecutors to decline to try him a third time.
