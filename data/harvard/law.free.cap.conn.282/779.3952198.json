The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction of conspiracy to commit murder. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>92 Conn. App. 110, 112, 883 A.2d 1257 (2005). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court properly held that the trial court\u2019s charge on conspiracy was deficient because it did not set forth an essential element, the object of the conspiracy?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>276 Conn. 929, 889 A.2d 819 (2005). We conclude that certification was improvidently granted and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The factual background of this case is set forth in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion in the companion case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>of <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>92 Conn. App. 92, 93-97, 883 A.2d 813 (2005). The defendant was charged in a four count information with the murder of Cesar Rivera (Rivera) (count one), the attempted murder of Luis Romero (count two), conspiracy to commit murder (count three) and conspiracy to attempt to commit murder (count four).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 111. Following the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal as to all counts. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 99. During the arguments on that motion, the defendant also argued that count four should be dismissed because it did not charge a crime recognized in this state. Id. The state ultimately conceded that count four should be dismissed and sought to amend count three to add Romero\u2019s name as the intended victim. Id., 99-100. The court stated that it would not allow the request because to do so would constitute a substantial change. Id., 100. The trial court then granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to count four. Id., 100 n.8. Thereafter, the state filed a substitute information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>charging the defendant with murder (count one), attempt to commit murder (count two) and conspiracy to commit murder (count three). Id., 100. In its instructions to the jury on the third count, the trial court did not identify Rivera specifically as the alleged intended victim of the conspiracy. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Following the judgment of conviction on the charges of attempt to commit murder and conspiracy to commit murder,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court raising the unpreserved claim that the trial court improperly had failed to instruct the jury that, to convict him of the conspiracy charge, it was required to find that Rivera had been the intended victim of the conspiracy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 111-12. The Appellate Court concluded that the case was controlled by its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 107-109, in which it had reviewed the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and had concluded that \u201cthe conspiracy to commit murder charge was limited to an alleged conspiracy to murder . . . Rivera and, therefore, the court should have instructed the jury that the state was required to prove that the defendant intended to cause the death of . . . Rivera.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 112. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of conviction of conspiracy to commit murder and remanded the case for a new trial on that count. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">This certified appeal followed. The state claims on appeal that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court improperly had failed to instruct the jury that it must find that Rivera had been the intended victim of the conspiracy in order to convict the defendant of conspiracy to commit murder. After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\"> \u201cThe state also charged [Sigfredo DeJesus], Kelvin Sanchez, Wilfredo Fernandez and Jose Vasquez with the same counts. The cases were joined and all five defendants were tried together.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 94. \u201cThe court subsequently acquitted Vasquez of all counts, and acquitted Sanchez and Fernandez of the first and second counts. The court also dismissed the fourth count against all the defendants. The jury found [DeJesus] guilty of attempt to commit murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The jury also found Sanchez guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. After the jury failed to reach a verdict as to Fernandez, the court declared a mistrial.\u201d Id., 94 n.2. Sanchez and DeJesus appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgments of conviction of conspiracy to commit murder, and the Appellate Court reversed the judgments. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>92 Conn. App. 112, 122, 884 A.2d 1 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 109. We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal in both cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>276 Conn. 932, 933, 890 A.2d 573 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>276 Conn. 929, 930, 889 A.2d 818 (2005). In the companion cases of <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>282 Conn. 787, 790, 924 A.2d 844 (2007), and <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>282 Conn. 783, 786, 928 A.2d 533 (2007), which were released on the same date as this opinion, we dismissed the appeals on the ground that certification improvidently had been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> The juiy rendered a verdict of not guilty on the murder charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
