The city of Bridgeport (city), the defendant in the first case and the plaintiff in the second case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>appeals, and C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC (Klewin), the plaintiff in the first case and the defendant in the second case, cross appeals, from the judgment of the trial court in a consolidated proceeding granting Klewin\u2019s application to confirm pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and denying the city\u2019s application to vacate pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an arbitration award resulting from a dispute concerning a contract to build a new sports arena for the city.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the city claims that the trial court improperly confirmed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>should have vacated, the arbitration award because: (1) its claim that the arbitration panel (panel) lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the contract containing the arbitration clause was illegally procured, and therefore void ab initio, is committed to the trial court, and not the panel, in the first instance; (2) even if the panel did have subject matter jurisdiction over the contract illegality claims, it failed to address them, rendering the award incomplete and defective; (3) confirmation of an arbitration award enforcing an illegally procured contract would violate public policy; (4) the city was deprived of its due process right to an evidentiary hearing with respect to the illegality issues raised on its application to vacate the award, and subsequent motion to reargue; and (5) the panel lacked subject matter jurisdiction because a vacancy had resulted in a panel of only two arbitrators, when the parties had agreed on three. In its cross appeal, Klewin claims that the trial court improperly failed to grant its request for offer of judgment interest pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. In March, 2000, the city and Klewin entered into a public works contract, known as the CM agreement, whereby Klewin would manage the construction of a sports arena, parking garage and other transportation facilities. The CM agreement set forth a guaranteed maximum price of $44,524,515 for the construction of the arena, which was to be used as a minor league hockey facility and a basketball court for Fairfield University. Thereafter, a dispute arose between the city and Klewin, wherein Klewin claimed entitlement to an increase in the guaranteed maximum price as a result of changes to the arena design.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">On June 1, 2001, pursuant to the dispute resolution procedure set forth in \u00a7 11.7 of the CM agreement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Klewin filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (association), claiming damages resulting from numerous alleged breaches of contract by the city. The city filed an answer to Klewin\u2019s subsequently amended demand for arbitration that denied the allegations therein, and also posed two counterclaims for liquidated damages stemming from a delay in the project\u2019s completion, and actual damages for other alleged breaches of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Thirty-seven days of hearings took place before the panel, which initially had consisted of three members, including a construction attorney, a construction professional and a design professional. During the pendency of the hearings, one member of the panel became ill and was unable to complete his service, creating a vacancy on the panel. Over the continued objection of the city, which had desired a panel of three members, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the two remaining arbitrators finished the proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the twentieth day of the arbitration proceedings, the city attempted to raise a defense that the CM agreement had been procured illegally. The panel determined that the defense was not raised in a timely manner, and the merits of that claim were never presented to the panel. Ultimately, the panel rendered an award of $6,020,231, including interest, in Klewin\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Thereafter, Klewin filed an application to confirm the award in the judicial district of New London at Norwich, and the city filed an application to vacate the award in the judicial district of Fairfield. Both applications were consolidated before the complex litigation docket in the judicial district of Waterbury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In support of its motion to vacate the award, the city claimed that the panel improperly: (1) proceeded with only two arbitrators after the third member became unable to serve due to illness; (2) continued the hearings, despite the fact that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the entire CM agreement was void ab initio as a result of corruption surrounding its procurement; (3) rendered an award that violated public policy by enforcing a contract that was obtained in violation of policies prohibiting contingent fee lobbying agreements, as well as the city\u2019s own ethics ordinance; and (4) committed misconduct by refusing to consider certain issues or to admit certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The trial court, <em>Alander, J., </em>rejected all of the city\u2019s claims in a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. The court first concluded that the parties\u2019 agreement and the applicable association rules had authorized the panel to proceed with two, rather than three, arbitrators, after the vacancy arose. The trial court also concluded that the city had waived its objection to the arbitrability of Klewin\u2019s claims, and specifically the city\u2019s defense that the CM agreement had been obtained illegally, by not raising that issue until the twentieth day of the arbitration proceedings, which was almost two and one-half years after the federal indictment of the city\u2019s former mayor, Joseph Ganim, on corruption related charges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court determined that allowing the city to assert its illegality claim in an application to vacate the award would undermine the essential purposes of arbitration and \u201cthe fundamental principle which underlies the waiver doctrine of not permitting parties to await a hoped-for favorable decision on the merits, reserving the right to attack should it go against them.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court further concluded that the city had waived its claim that the award violated public policy because that claim did not arise from the award itself, but rather from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>waived defense that the underlying contract itself was illegally procured. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment denying the city\u2019s application to vacate the award, and granting Klewin\u2019s application to confirm the award. The trial court subsequently denied the city\u2019s motion for reargument. This appeal and cross appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">On appeal, the city claims that the trial court improperly: (1) determined that the city had waived its right to claim that the panel lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the CM agreement had been procured illegally, and therefore, was void ab initio; (2) disregarded the panel\u2019s conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the city\u2019s contract illegality claims, which rendered the award fatally defective because it was not \u201cfinal or definite\u201d; (3) concluded that the city had waived its right to claim that confirmation of the arbitration award enforcing the illegally procured CM agreement would violate public policy; (4) failed to grant the city\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing with respect to the jurisdictional issues raised in its application to vacate and motion to reargue; and (5) failed to conclude that the panel lacked subject matter jurisdiction because it had consisted of two, rather than the agreed upon three, arbitrators. Additional relevant facts and procedural history will be set forth in the context of each claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">WHETHER THE COURT OR THE ARBITRATION PANEL HAD JURISDICTION OVER THE ISSUES ARISING FROM THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITY IN THE PROCUREMENT OF THE CM AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">For the sake of clarity, we begin by organizing and summarizing our resolution of the somewhat intermingled nature of the jurisdictional and public policy issues in this case. First, we must consider the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>city\u2019s claim that the entire CM agreement was illegally procured, and therefore, void ab initio. Guided by our decision in <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>271 Conn. 65, 856 A.2d 364 (2004), and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>546 U.S. 440, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (2006), we conclude that this claim presents a defense of contract illegality, which is an issue that is firmly committed to the arbitration panel in the first instance. We also conclude that the panel\u2019s failure to reach this issue, although improper, does not render the award fatally defective because the city waived its right to pursue that particular claim during the arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We next conclude that if a party, either explicitly or implicitly by its conduct, waives the defense of illegality before the arbitration panel, that party is precluded from raising it in subsequent judicial proceedings to confirm or to vacate an arbitration award by characterizing it as a claim that the arbitration award violates public policy. This is because the waiver of that claim before the arbitration panel deprives the reviewing court of the factual predicate for the public policy challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history, which begin with the city\u2019s allegations of corruption in the procurement of the CM agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Leonard Grimaldi, a close friend and confidant of Ganim was the owner and operator of Harbor Communications, Inc. (Harbor), a public relations consulting business. Grimaldi testified that Ganim had \u201cmade it clear\u201d that he expected to be compensated if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>any of Grimaldi\u2019s clients were to receive work for the city. Klewin was one of Grimaldi\u2019s clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In February, 1997, Grimaldi entered into a secret written agreement with Paul Pinto, another confidant and fundraiser for Ganim, to do business and share their fees with Ganim. Pinto was an officer, and subsequently majority owner, of The Kasper Group, Inc., an architectural and engineering firm that had been retained by Ganim to do design work for the city, including the arena at issue in this case. The agreement between Grimaldi and Pinto contemplated a contract steering scheme whereby contractors and vendors seeking to do business with the city would hire Harbor as a consulting firm, <em>without </em>knowledge of the illegal partnership. Grimaldi then funneled to Pinto nearly $1 million in fees paid to him by the contractors, a sum that Pinto in turn was to share with Ganim. Ganim then would use his office to assure the success of those contractors seeking work with the city, interfering with normal contracting procedures if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In June, 1999, Grimaldi entered into a written agreement with Klewin for \u201cmarketing services\u201d in exchange for a $150,000 payment contingent on the procurement of the arena project contract, with additional payments of $10,000 per month. Klewin ultimately paid Grimaldi $370,000 for \u201c \u2018services\u2019 \u201d in connection with the arena project, and a significant portion of those funds was funneled through Pinto to Ganim. No actual work was ever done for that $370,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">At a dinner meeting in July, 1999, Ganim told Klewin officials that their company would be selected for the arena project. Shortly thereafter, other city officials told Klewin that the city would proceed with negotiations for the possibility of contracting for the arena services. In January, 2000, Ganim and Klewin signed the CM agreement for a guaranteed maximum price of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>$44,524,515 for the arena, with a separate project agreement for an adjacent garage also to be built by Klewin.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The city claims that these activities in the procurement of the CM agreement violated numerous laws, including Bridgeport Ethics Ordinance \u00a7 2.38.030,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>which prohibits an employee or official from entering the city into a contract in which he or she has a direct or indirect financial interest. Under the city\u2019s reasoning, the CM agreement is, therefore, expressly void ab initio under the terms of the ethics ordinance. See Bridgeport Ethics Ordinance \u00a7 2.38.030 (E). Indeed, we also note that, in October, 2001, a federal indictment was issued against Ganim, charging him with racketeering in the procurement of various municipal public works contracts, including the CM agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>On May 19,2003, after twenty days of hearings already had been held, the city moved to revise its amended arbitration answer and counterclaim to assert, for the first time, the defense of contract illegality.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On May 21, 2003, after considering the jurisdictional implications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>a finding of contract illegality, the panel denied the city\u2019s motion to amend its answer, concluding that the proffered amendment was untimely because the indictment of Ganim containing the operative facts had issued in October, 2001, more than one and one-half years earlier. The panel reiterated that position several months later, on October 28, 2003, stating its additional concern that a finding of contract illegality would render the agreement void ab initio, and deprive it of jurisdiction over the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In November, 2003, the city moved to bifurcate the proceedings and have the illegality issues, which the panel previously had declined to review, considered by a court. The panel denied the city\u2019s motion to bifurcate the proceedings, and determined that the issue of contract illegality could be considered, if necessary, during the court proceedings that would follow the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Shortly thereafter, the chairman of the panel broached the possibility of, if both parties agreed, considering the contract illegality issue at that point, notwithstanding the panel\u2019s prior jurisdictional rulings to the contrary. The panel and counsel then engaged in off-the-record discussions, and the issue was not pursued further before the panel, although the panel left that option open for the duration of the proceedings. When the panel subsequently issued the award in this case, it ruled that \u201cthe issues concerning the illegality of the contract because of alleged [Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act] violations and other illegal acts as stated in [the city\u2019s] [c]ounterclaim and [a]ffirmative [d]efenses would not be considered by the [p]anel because [the city\u2019s] pleading was: (a) filed too late, being twenty months after the date of . . . Ganim\u2019s indictment when facts to support this argument were known, or should have been known by [the city]; and that (b) to give credence to [the city\u2019s] argument that the [c]ontract was void ab initio would deprive the [p]anel of its jurisdiction.\u201d Thereafter, during the confirmation proceedings, the trial court concluded that the panel had jurisdiction in the first instance over the contract illegality claim, but that the city had waived that claim by its conduct during the arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Whether the Legality of a Contract Containing an Arbitration Clause Is To Be Decided by an Arbitrator or by the Trial Court in the First Instance</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The city first contends that a claim that a contract containing an arbitration clause is void ab initio on the ground of illegality falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court, and not the arbitration panel. In support of that proposition, the city argues that a declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that a contract is void ab initio logically would render void an arbitration clause contained in that contract, thereby depriving the panel of subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute and the trial court of jurisdiction to confirm any resulting award. Klewin, relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 440, and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 65, contends in response that the issue of contract illegality is one that is committed to the panel in the first instance. We agree with Klewin, and conclude that, in the absence of an attack specifically on the validity of the arbitration clause, which is an issue for the court, the issue of the legality of the entire underlying contract lies solely and squarely within the purview of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We note at the outset that the city\u2019s claim in the present case, which concerns the intersecting subject matter jurisdiction of the panel and the court sitting in a confirmation proceeding, presents a question of law. Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision in this case is, therefore, plenary. See, e.g., <em>Alexson </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>276 Conn. 599, 604, 887 A.2d 872 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">This court most recently addressed an arbitration clause in a purportedly illegal contract in <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 68, which involved a dispute under a new home construction contract that contained an arbitration clause. The plaintiffs applied for an order to stay the arbitration proceedings and an order to show cause on the ground that the contract was void under General Statutes \u00a7 20-417d of the New Home Construction Contractors Act; General Statutes \u00a7 20-417a et seq.; because the defendant was unlicensed at the time he had entered the contract and the contract failed to comply with certain statutory notice requirements. <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>supra, 67-68. We concluded that the \u201cclaim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the contract is unenforceable is within the scope of the arbitration clause and must be decided initially by the arbitrator.\u201d Id., 75. We determined that the \u201cclaim that the contract is unenforceable because of the defendant\u2019s alleged failure to comply with \u00a7 20-417d clearly is a claim \u2018arising out of or relating to\u2019 the contract,\u201d and is \u201ctherefore, arbitrable.\u201d Id., 74. We noted that \u201cthe arbitration clause is in writing, as required under [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-408,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the <em>plaintiffs do not allege that the agreement to arbitrate is void </em>for reasons that involve the formation of that agreement, such as duress, misrepresentation, fraud or undue influence. . . . Finally, the plaintiffs do not make a claim of any improprieties in the formation of the underlying contract that would render the arbitration agreement void.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 74-75. We also relied on the sever-ability principle discussed in <em>Success Centers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Huntington Learning Centers, Inc., </em>223 Conn. 761, 772, 613 A.2d 1320 (1992), namely, that an \u201carbitration provision in an agreement is, in effect, a separate and distinct agreement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>supra, 77. We, therefore, concluded \u201cthat the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the contract is unenforceable is within the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>arbitration clause and must be decided initially by the arbitrator.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id., 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In Nussbaum, we noted that \u201c\u00a7 52-408 is similar to \u00a7 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq. Section 2 of that act provides that written arbitration agreements shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000). In construing a Connecticut statute that is similar to federal law, we are guided by federal case law. . . . Thus, when there is no Connecticut case law directly on point, we may turn for guidance to the applicable federal law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 73 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Accordingly, our embrace of the persuasive value of federal arbitration law renders <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 440, wherein the United States Supreme Court decided the issue of \u201cwhether a court or an arbitrator should consider the claim that a contract containing an arbitration provision is void for illegality,\u201d especially relevant to our disposition of the present case. Id., 442. In <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>two individuals had entered into agreements with a check cashing business wherein \u201cthey received cash in exchange for a personal check in the amount of the cash plus a finance charge.\u201d Id. Each separate transaction included a broad arbitration clause governed by Florida substantive law and the Federal Arbitration Act. Id. The customers brought a \u201cputative class action in Florida state court, alleging that [the check cashing business] charged usurious interest rates and that the [agreement violated various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Florida lending and consumer-protection laws, rendering it criminal on its face.\u201d Id., 443. The Florida Supreme Court had concluded that a court, rather than an arbitrator, should decide the issue of a contract\u2019s legality because \u201cto enforce an agreement to arbitrate in a contract challenged as unlawful could breathe life into a contract that not only violates state law, but also is criminal in nature . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">On appeal, the United States Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court. The court noted that \u00a7 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act \u201cembodies the national policy favoring arbitration and places arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts\u201d; id.; and also that \u201c[c]hallenges to the validity of arbitration agreements \u2018upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u2019 can be divided into two types. One type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate. . . . The other challenges the contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement (e.g., the agreement was fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contract\u2019s provisions renders the whole contract invalid.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The Supreme Court concluded that the customers\u2019 claim was \u201cof this second type . . . [because] [t]he crux of the complaint is that the contract as a whole (including its arbitration provision) is rendered invalid by the usurious finance charge.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court relied on its previous decision in <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 403-404, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270 (1967), in which the court had held, that \u201cif the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself \u2014 an issue which goes to the making of the agreement to arbitrate \u2014 the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it. But the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 445. The court noted that its decision in <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>\u201crejected the view that the question of \u2018severability\u2019 was one of state law, so that if state law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge to the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The Supreme Court stated that <em>\u201cPrima Paint [Corp. ] </em>and <em>Southland [Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 104 S. Ct. 852, 79 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1984)]<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> answer the question presented here by establishing three propositions. First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract. Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract\u2019s validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance. Third, this arbitration law applies in state as well as federal courts.\u201d <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 445-46. Applying those holdings, the court concluded that, \u201cbecause respondents challenge the [agreement, <em>but not specifically its arbitration provisions, </em>those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract. The challenge should therefore be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 446; see also id., 449 (\u201c[w]e reaffirm today that, regardless of whether the challenge is brought in federal or state court, a challenge to the validity of the contract as a whole, and not specifically to the arbitration clause, must go to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>arbitrator\u201d). The Supreme Court stated that the Florida court improperly had \u201crelied on the distinction between void and voidable contracts\u201d in declining to apply the severability rule of <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>because that case \u201crejected application of state severability rules to the arbitration agreement <em>without discussing </em>whether the challenge at issue would have rendered the contract void or voidable.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) Id., 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Given the similarity of \u00a7 52-408 to \u00a7 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, we adopt the <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>rule as applied in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>as a matter of state arbitration law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although we find somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>troubling the \u201cchicken or the egg\u201d scenario embodied by the present case, namely, that requiring arbitration in this context conceivably might give partial effect to a contract that subsequently will be determined to be void, we agree with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of this particular issue. \u201cIt is true . . . that the <em>Prima Paint [Corp. </em>] rule permits a court to enforce an arbitration agreement in a contract that the arbitrator later finds to be void. <em>But it is equally true that [the] respondents\u2019 approach permits a court to deny effect to an arbitration provision in a contract that the court later finds to be perfectly enforceable. Prima Paint [Corp.] </em>resolved this conundrum \u2014 and resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 448-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We also find instructive the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s application of <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>in <em>Martz </em>v. <em>Beneficial Montana, Inc., </em>332 Mont. 93, 135 P.3d 790 (2006). In that case, the plaintiffs claimed that a secured consumer loan agreement, which contained an arbitration clause, was void ab initio under Montana\u2019s consumer loan and unfair trade practices acts. Id., 95. The Montana Supreme Court relied on <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>and concluded that the trial court properly had granted the defendant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. Id., 96-98. The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that, \u201ceven where contracts contain arbitration provisions, challenges to the contract as a whole must be heard by courts, since void contracts would necessarily invalidate any included arbitration provisions.\u201d Id., 96. The court noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge was to the contract as a whole, and not just to the arbitration clause. Id., 98. Thus, the Montana Supreme Court concluded that claims that a contract is void ab initio as a \u201cwhole are properly decided via arbitration, given the existence of an arbitration clause.\u201d Id., 99. Compare <em>Nagrampa </em>v. <em>Mailcoups, Inc., </em>469 F.3d 1257, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>1271 (9th Cir. 2006) (breach of contract complaint containing attacks on validity of arbitration clause was properly before court and not arbitrator when allegations of contractual unenforceability were limited to arbitration clause because \u201c[w]here, as here, no claim threatens to invalidate or otherwise directly affect the entire contract, the federal court must decide claims attacking the validity of the arbitration provision, even if substantive state law requires an examination of the making of the entire contract as part of that analysis\u201d) with <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Pacific Life Ins. Co., </em>462 F.3d 384, 397 (5th Cir. 2006) (Declining to address claims that \u201cfraud and error\u201d vitiated a contract containing an arbitration clause because the plaintiff investors did \u201cnot distinguish between their attacks on the validity of the client agreements and the arbitration clauses themselves. They assert only that they would not have entered into the client agreements containing the arbitration clauses if [the investment broker] had not misrepresented the terms of their investments.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the city\u2019s proffered defense of contract illegality based on ethical and statutory violations attendant to the formation of the CM agreement is one committed to the jurisdiction of the panel in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We address briefly the city\u2019s reliance on <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 444 n.1, wherein the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe issue of the contract\u2019s validity is different from the issue of whether any agreement between the alleged obligor and obligee was ever concluded. Our opinion today <em>addresses only the former, and does not speak to the issue decided in the cases cited by [the] respondents </em>(and by the Florida Supreme Court), which hold that it is for courts to decide whether the alleged obligor ever signed the contract . . . whether the signor lacked authority to commit the alleged principal . . . and whether the signor lacked the mental capacity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>assent . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) In relying on this footnote, the city emphasizes its ethics ordinance, which prohibits an employee or official from entering into a contract in which he or she has a direct or indirect financial interest, and expressly voids such contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>See Bridgeport Ethics Ordinance \u00a7 2.38.030; see also footnote 13 of this opinion. The city claims that, because of his violation of the ethics ordinance, Ganim had no authority to assent to the CM agreement, thereby taking this case outside the scope of the rule of <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>and <em>Prima Paint Corp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We find footnote 1 of <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>far from conclusive in the present case, because it does not state an exception to the primary rule of <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.; </em>instead, it merely states that the Supreme Court did not need to reach the issue posed by cases that involve capacity or assent, as compared to substantive illegality. Moreover, the analysis in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>which emphasizes an inquiry into whether the challenge is to the arbitration clause, rather than the entire contract, renders the cases cited in footnote 1 of little value in the present case, particularly to the extent that they focus on the void/voidable distinction, an approach <em>specifically rejected </em>by the Supreme Court. See <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 447-48; see also footnote 19 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Indeed, the city\u2019s claims in this case focus on the fact that the CM agreement was unenforceable because it had been procured illegally. Thus, the city\u2019s protestations notwithstanding, this case does not present the near Kafkaesque problem envisioned in <em>Sphere Drake Ins. Ltd. </em>v. <em>All American Ins. Co., </em>256 F.3d 587, 590 (7th Cir. 2001), wherein the court stated that whether a reinsurance broker had exceeded its authority in committing an insurance company to an insurance contract that contained an arbitration clause, a defense that would render the contract void, is for the court and not the arbitrator. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the applicability of <em>Prima Paint Corp., </em>noting that \u201cwhether there was any agreement is a distinct question . . . [because whether] a person whose name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>was written on a contract by a faithless agent who lacked authority to make that commitment [does not create] a defense to enforcement, as in <em>Prima Paint [Corp.]; </em>it is a situation in which no contract came into being; and as arbitration depends on a valid contract an ar gument that the contract does not exist can\u2019t logically be resolved by the arbitrator (unless the parties agree to arbitrate this issue after the dispute arises). It was possible to arbitrate in <em>Prima Paint [Corp.] </em>without circularity; in forgery and agency cases, by contrast, the arbitrator\u2019s authority to resolve the dispute would depend on one particular answer to that very dispute. Only a court can break that circle.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Id., 590-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In our view, the present case falls into the gray area between a case involving a contract that is void, or nonexistent, because it is substantively unenforceable, such as that contemplated in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., </em>or <em>Martz </em>v. <em>Beneficial Montana, Inc., </em>supra, 332 Mont. 93, and a contract that is void, or nonexistent, because of lack of assent or capacity. See, e.g., <em>Sphere Drake Ins. Ltd. </em>v. <em>All American Ins. Co., </em>supra, 256 F.3d 590-91. The nature of the illegal contract defense, however, as found in our case law; see footnote 15 of this opinion; puts this case solidly toward the enforceability side of that spectrum, rather than in the realm of the question of whether such a contract to arbitrate even exists.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, because the city does not claim only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>that this particular arbitration clause was the result of a corrupt mayor\u2019s chicanery and prostitution of his office, but rather, attacks the validity of the entire contract, we conclude that the issue of the legality of the CM agreement is committed to the province of the arbitration panel, and not the court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Whether the City Waived Its Defense of Contract Illegality</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The city next claims that, because the arbitration panel lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether a contract is void ab initio, that claim is not subject to waiver. In part I A of this opinion, we concluded that the city\u2019s claim that the CM agreement was void ab initio on the grounds of illegality is squarely within the jurisdiction of the panel, and not the court. Accordingly, we next consider whether the trial court properly concluded that the city, by its conduct during the arbitration proceedings, waived that contract defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural histoiy. As noted previously, on May 19, 2003, after twenty hearing days had already been held, the city moved to revise its amended answer and counterclaim to assert the defense of contract illegality. On May 21, 2003, after considering the jurisdictional implications of a finding of contract illegality, the panel denied the city\u2019s motion to amend the pleadings to reflect illegal procurement of the contract, noting that the indictment of Ganim containing the operative facts had been issued in October, 2001; see footnote 14 of this opinion; and that it was \u201ctoo late in the game to make that counterclaim [because] the facts that underlie that counterclaim were known, or should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>known, by the city ... as of the date of the stated indictment against Ganim, and I guess his two, for lack of a better word, cohorts or henchmen.\u201d Indeed, in considering proffered evidence on similar claims several months later, on October 28, 2003, the panel reiterated that it was \u201cdeciding this case as a construction claim and a construction counterclaim and to the extent any evidence can come out showing that the change orders were, let\u2019s say, unwarranted in initiation or unwarranted payment, that\u2019s one thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201cBut we are not going to try this issue as to illegal contracts which we consider, if permitted, would be void ab initio and therefore, we would have no jurisdiction if the entire contract with Klewin were to be found illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cAnd furthermore, this claim has arisen much too late in the process as far as the illegality of the [CM agreement]. It should come as no surprise to anybody around here in [the city] that [Ganim] was indicted a particular count or counts \u2014 excuse me \u2014 relative to the letting of the arena contract. That information was available long before this panel ever began to sit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Subsequently, in November, 2003, the panel considered the city\u2019s motion to bifurcate the proceedings and to have the illegality issues, which it had declined to review, considered by the court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The panel denied the city\u2019s motion, and again reiterated that the basis of its decision was the timing of the allegations, and that the city should have raised the issue at the outset of the arbitration proceedings or filed court proceedings to stop the arbitration. The panel also took the position that the issue of contract illegality could be considered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>if necessary, during the judicial proceedings to follow the arbitration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Shortly thereafter, the chairman of the panel raised the possibility of, with the consent of the parties, considering the illegality issue at that point, notwithstanding the panel\u2019s prior jurisdictional rulings to the contrary. The panel and counsel then engaged in off-the-record discussions, and subsequently went back on the record, with the chairman noting that \u201cthe panel and the counsel for both parties [have] had an opportunity to discuss privately a proposition of the panel that, contrary to its previous ruling on the lack of jurisdiction of subject matter and the lateness of filing the amended complaint or the amended counterclaim regarding the illegality of the entire contract, the panel had suggested to the parties that if they could agree in writing in a form that we would all have had some input on, that they \u2014 the parties were giving the panel the subject matter jurisdiction over the illegality of the entire contract issue and would waive the lateness in filing for an amendment in the hopes that this would, let\u2019s say, do away with a possible legal issue down the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u201cThe parties talked about that and with their counsel, and one of the parties does not want to do that for its own reasons. So, we will continue with the hearings. We will issue a ruling on the bifurcation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u201cAnd we\u2019ve told the parties in an interest to resolve the dispute that if there is a change of mind by the reluctant party that it wants to proceed as we had suggested, we will get something in writing and so proceed.\u201d Klewin then asked the panel to identify which party was willing to proceed, and which party was not. The city objected to this request as \u201cunfair,\u201d and the panel\u2019s chairman overruled the objection and denied the city\u2019s motion to strike Klewin\u2019s comment, despite the fact that, \u201c[t]he panel was very particular in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>naming the party because it thought that it would be unfair. There are many reasons for not assenting to what the panel suggested.\u201d The panel did, however, leave the option available for the parties for the duration of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">When acting on the consolidated proceedings to vacate or to confirm the arbitration award, the trial court concluded that the city waived its right to claim that the dispute was not arbitrable because of its conduct in the proceedings. The trial court specifically credited the panel\u2019s emphasis on the fact that the city did not seek to amend its pleadings to raise its illegality claim until after twenty days of hearings had already been held, which was more than two and one-half years after the arbitration had commenced. The trial court noted that the panel had denied the city permission to amend its answer to assert an illegality defense because it deemed the amendment untimely, as the city had had notice of the alleged illegal conduct since October, 2001, when Ganim was indicted in federal court. Indeed, the trial court emphasized that the city had taken no action to contest the arbitrability of the dispute at that point by either filing an objection in the arbitration, filing an action for a declaratory judgment, or refusing to participate further in the arbitration, thus requiring Klewin to file a motion to compel pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-410. Ultimately, the trial court concluded that the city\u2019s actions amounted to seeking \u201ctwo bites at the apple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We note briefly the proper standard of review. Ordinarily, \u201c[w]aiver is a question of fact\u201d subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 704 </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>272 Conn. 617, 622, 866 A.2d 582 (2005); id., 624-25 (applying clearly erroneous standard of review to case wherein evidence consisted of letter by plaintiff waiving deadline for arbitration decision). We agree with the city, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>plenary review is appropriate in the present case because \u201cwhen a trial court makes a decision based on pleadings and other documents, rather than on the live testimony of witnesses, we review its conclusions as questions of law.\u201d <em>State v. Lewis, </em>273 Conn. 509, 516-17, 871 A.2d 986 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u201cWaiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 704 v. Dept. of Public Health, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 623. \u201c[V]arious statutory and contract rights may be waived.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cWaiver is based upon a species of the principle of estoppel and where applicable it will be enforced as the estoppel would be enforced. . . . Estoppel has its roots in equity and stems from the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed .... Waiver does not have to be express, but may consist of acts or conduct from which waiver may be implied. ... In other words, waiver may be inferred from the circumstances if it is reasonable to do so.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The waiver doctrine applies to arbitration because \u201c[w]e have made it clear that we will not permit parties to anticipate a favorable decision, reserving a right to impeach it or set it aside if it happens to be against them, for a cause which was well known to them before or during the trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Diamond Fertiliser &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Commodities Trading International Corp., </em>211 Conn. 541, 553, 560 A.2d 419 (1989), quoting <em>Krattenstein </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>155 Conn. 609, 616, 236 A.2d 466 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Local 884, Council 4, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, </em>237 Conn. 378, 380, 677 A.2d 1350 (1996), we concluded that a city that was party to a labor grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>arbitration proceeding had waived its right to vacate the award because of its affirmative conduct during the proceeding. The city sought to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that the state mediation and arbitration board had committed misconduct by refusing to grant the city\u2019s attorney a continuance when he became ill during the proceedings. Id., 381. We concluded that the trial court did not commit clear error when it determined that the city implicitly had waived its claim that the arbitrator committed misconduct because its attorney had continued to negotiate \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d after the denial of the continuance. Id., 389-90. Similarly, in <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 704 </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 626, we concluded that \u201cthe Appellate Court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs unilateral grant of the arbitrator\u2019s request for an extension was ineffective in the absence of the defendant\u2019s consent, and therefore could not amount to a waiver of the plaintiffs right to challenge the untimeliness of the award.\u201d See also <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>229 Conn. 465, 478, 641 A.2d 1381 (1994) (The defendant objected to the arbitrability of the dispute based on the parties\u2019 failure to satisfy the preconditional mandatory negotiation clause at issue, but \u201c[b]ecause the defendants preserved their objection to the arbitration, they had the option of committing the issue to the arbitrator without risking any waiver of their right to have the issue ultimately determined by the trial court. . . . Under these circumstances, we hold that the defendants did not waive consideration of the issue of arbitrability by the trial court.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>Diamond Fertiliser &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Commodities Trading International Corp., </em>supra, 211 Conn. 552-53 (\u201cthe plaintiff could not prevail in its attempt to vacate the award as untimely because it waived any right to object to the timeliness of the award by failing to object when it was notified of the date on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>which the award would be rendered\u201d); cf. <em>Nagrampa </em>v. <em>Mailcoups, Inc., </em>supra, 469 F.3d 1278 (concluding that plaintiff did not waive her objection to arbitration via participation when her participation therein was limited to two preliminary telephone conferences and steps necessary to preserve her objections to arbitration and rights in proceeding, including filing of counterclaim and discovery requests, when she \u201cnever participated in any proceedings which even touched the merits of the contractual claims that were to be the subject of arbitration\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It is apparent to us that the city acted aggressively, and, indeed, properly; see part I A of this opinion; in attempting to present its contract illegality claim to the panel. We agree with the trial court\u2019s determination, however, that the city\u2019s attempt was, in essence, too little, too late. Our conclusion that the city waived its contract illegality claim is based on the findings by the panel and the trial court that the city unduly delayed the presentation of the claim, notwithstanding the fact that it was aware of the bases for the claim since October, 2001, when the federal indictment against Ganim was issued.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Indeed, the city did nothing <em>at that point </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>to preserve its objection to or stay the arbitration proceedings pending developments with respect to facts alleged in the indictment. Moreover, the record indicates that, when the panel reconsidered its improper initial determination as to subject matter jurisdiction, as well as its timeliness ruling, and offered the city the chance to present its illegality claim, the city did not avail itself of that opportunity to go on the record to present or to preserve its right to make that claim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the city\u2019s actions before the panel constituted a waiver of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Whether the Panel\u2019s Improper Subject Matter Jurisdiction Ruling Rendered the Award Incomplete or Defective</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The city correctly notes that the panel\u2019s conclusion on the face of the award that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the contract illegality claim conflicts with the trial corut\u2019s conclusion, which was upheld by this court, that such a claim was within the jurisdictional ken of the arbitrators.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See part IA of this opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ion. The city further contends that, since the panel concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the illegality claim, and it in fact did have such jurisdiction, the award is incomplete, and therefore fatally defective as not final or definite. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">If the record in this case were as simple as the city apparently envisions, reversal and vacatur of the award would in fact be required because the panel would have executed its powers in an incomplete and defective manner. The city gives short, or no, shrift, however, to the fact that the panel also emphasized in the award that the city\u2019s amended pleading was untimely because it had been filed twenty months after the indictment of Ganim. Moreover, on the record of this case, the city\u2019s claim is unavailing because the panel did in fact offer the city the opportunity to submit its illegality claim, however untimely, for resolution. By not pursuing that opportunity further before the panel, the city waived that claim. See part I B of this opinion. This waiver rendered the panel\u2019s incorrect legal determination, in effect, harmless error not requiring vacatur of the award.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Whether the City\u2019s Waiver of the Illegal Contract Defense Before the Panel Affected Its Right to Claim that the Arbitration Award Should Be Vacated on Public Policy Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The city next contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the city waived its right to assert that arbitral enforcement of the illegally procured CM agreement would violate public policy. Citing our decision in <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000), the city argues that, because the public policy claim was raised in a timely application to vacate the award, it was not subject to waiver since the court engages in de novo review in a public policy challenge to an arbitration award. The city, with the support of the amici curiae, namely, the state of Connecticut, the Connecticut Association of Municipal Attorneys and the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, further argues that the panel\u2019s award in this case violated the public policy against corruption in municipal contracting because it enforced an agreement that was the product of improper conflicts of interest that violated applicable state statutes and ethics ordinances. In response, Klewin contends that the city\u2019s arguments conflate two issues: (1) whether enforcement of an arbitration award, which deals with the lawfulness of the award itself, violates public policy; and (2) whether the contract underlying the award violates public policy because of its terms or the manner in which it was procured. Klewin claims that, because there is nothing facially illegal about the contract or the award, its enforcement would not violate public policy, and that attacks on the legality of the underlying contract are exclusively within the province of the panel. Accordingly, Klewin argues that the city\u2019s claim is merely an improper relabeling of its contract illegality defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We conclude that, on this record, the city\u2019s public policy claim is functionally indistinguishable from its contract illegality defense, and because the city waived its opportunity to present that claim before the panel, the trial court properly determined that the city had waived its public policy claim because there was no factual predicate under which it could be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Whether the trial court properly concluded that the city\u2019s public policy claim was subject to the waiver doctrine presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary. See <em>LaSalla </em>v. <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., </em>278 Conn. 578, 586, 898 A.2d 803 (2006) (\u201c[w]e agree with the defendant that the proper scope of review, in both the trial court and this court, for a colorable claim that an award violated public policy is plenary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u201cA court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award . . . because it is contrary to public policy is a specific application of the more general doctrine, rooted in the common law, that a court may refuse to enforce contracts that violate law or public policy.\u201d <em>United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 42, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987). \u201cThis rule is an exception to the general rule restricting judicial review of arbitral awards.\u201d <em>MedValUSA Health Programs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Memberworks, Inc., </em>273 Conn. 634, 655, 872 A.2d 423, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Vertrue, Inc. </em>v. <em>MedValUSA Health Programs, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 960, 126 S.

Id. To be vacated under the narrow public policy exception, \u201cthe award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>must be <em>clearly </em>illegal or <em>clearly </em>violative of a strong public policy.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 656. \u201cFurthermore, [t]he party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; see also id., 641, 654 (concluding that Connecticut does not have explicit, well-defined public policy prohibiting excessive punitive damages awards, and that judicial confirmation process was not state action for purposes of due process clause protections against excessive punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Judicial review of whether an arbitration award violates public policy is de novo, but not completely unfettered. The legal determination of whether a particular award violates public policy necessarily depends on the facts found by the arbitrator during those proceedings. For example, in <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 416, a case involving a public policy challenge under rule 5.6 of the Rules of Professional Conduct to a partnership agreement provision that had conditioned the receipt of retirement benefits on compliance with a noncompete clause, we concluded that \u201cwhen an arbitrator has been called upon to determine whether an . . . agreement violates a legitimate and clearly established public policy, such as that underlying rule 5.6, de novo review is proper\u201d; id., 426; because the determination of \u201cwhether . . . there exists a public policy mandate with which an arbitral award must conform . . . indisputably involves an issue of law properly resolved by an exercise of this court\u2019s plenary authority.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 428-29 (discussing expressions of public policy in statutes, case law or administrative regulations). We also stated that once \u201cit has been determined that an arbitral award does implicate a clearly established public policy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ultimate question remains as to whether the award itself comports with that policy\u201d; id., 429; and concluded that judicial review of that determination is de novo. Id. In noting that \u201ccourts have greater expertise and knowledge than arbitrators\u201d in \u201cthe identification and application of the public policy of this state\u201d; id., 430; we emphasized that \u201ca reviewing court [is] better suited to evaluate whether <em>certain facts, as found by the arbitrator, </em>comport with the specific public policy that is at issue.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Indeed, in <em>Schoonmaker, </em>we emphasized our adherence \u201cto the long-standing principle that findings of fact are ordinarily left undisturbed upon judicial review. Thus, in the present case, we defer to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreements regarding the scope of the forfeiture upon competition provision, as well as the terms upon which postemployment benefits are offered to former employees. We conclude only that as a reviewing court, we must determine, pursuant to our plenary authority and giving appropriate deference to the arbitrator\u2019s factual conclusions, whether the forfeiture provision in question violates those policies.\u201d Id., 432; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, AFL-CIO, Council 4, Local 2663, </em>257 Conn. 80, 95, 777 A.2d 169 (2001) (\u201cTo the extent that the plaintiff claims that the award violated public policy because the arbitrator misapplied the [contract\u2019s] definition of salaried employee, we decline to undertake judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations in interpreting the terms of the contract. The arbitrator made a factual determination that commission staff attorneys are hourly, rather than salaried employees.\u201d); <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>254 Conn. 35, 51-52, 757 A.2d 501 (2000) (noting that legal system \u201cordinarily\u201d gives \u201cgreat deference ... to both the factual and legal determinations of the arbitrators,\u201d and that even in a de novo public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>policy challenge, \u201cwe give deference to the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations\u201d [citations omitted]).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Whether an arbitration award violates the public policy against corruption in governmental contracting turns on a subsidiary factual determination that the underlying contract was illegally procured. This determination is fundamentally indistinguishable from resolution of the defense that the contract is void ab initio on grounds of illegality. This type of public policy claim is, therefore, especially dependent on arbitral findings of fact, which, as previously discussed, on which we both rely and defer to. In this regard, we find instructive Justice Vertefeuille\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Kasper Group, Inc., </em>278 Conn. 466, 899 A.2d 523 (2006). In that case, Justice Vertefeuille, in addressing a proffered alternate ground for affirmance,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>that enforcement of an arbitration \u201caward would violate the public policy against enforcing a contract that was illegally procured\u201d; id., 495; concluded that, \u201ceven if I . . . were to assume, arguendo, that there exists an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy against enforcing illegally procured contracts, I would defer to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings under this court\u2019s standard of review of the narrow public policy exception. . . . Thus, I would not review the correctness of the finding, implicit in the arbitrator\u2019s award, that the contract was not illegally procured. . . . The plaintiff contended throughout the arbitration that the [school construction] contract was illegally procured. The arbitrator\u2019s award in favor of the defendant reveals his clear rejection of this defense. Even if I were to consider the evidence excluded by the arbitrator, I would nevertheless conclude that this evidence was insufficient to prove clearly that the [school construction] contract was obtained illegally.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) Id., 499 <em>(\"Vertefeuille, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In the present case, as in <em>Kasper Group, Inc., </em>the nature of the public policy claim renders it particularly fact bound and inextricably linked to the illegal contract defense; indeed, they are one and the same.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>when the city waived the illegal contract defense before the panel; see part I B of this opinion; it necessarily deprived the trial and reviewing courts of the factual findings necessary to decide that claim in the context of a public policy challenge, even assuming the existence of a strong, well-defined public policy against corruption in the procurement of public contracts.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We are, however, \u201cmindful . . . that the arbitration under review is complicated by the fact that it involves public funds and the question of whether the city had a full and fair opportunity to contest the use of such funds for purposes of illegal dealings. Although we do not advocate different rules to govern such arbitrations, we must remain vigilant in ensuring that the efficiency and economics generally associated with arbitrations do not swallow the public interest that has been compromised as a result of the arbitrator\u2019s misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Kasper Group, Inc., </em>supra, 278 Conn. 486. In the present case, having already concluded that factual development of the contract illegality issue solely was committed to the panel, to then conclude that the trial court was required to hold extensive hearings, essentially amounting to a trial, in a confirmation proceeding addressing that identical issue in the guise of a public policy challenge would vitiate that first conclusion. Put differently, we decline to accept what we view as the city\u2019s invitation to turn public policy challenges into the arbitration equivalent of a \u201cmulligan\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> by inviting de novo <em>factual </em>review of illegal contract issues. See <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 429 n.7 (\u201c[A] party raising such a challenge to an arbitral award may not succeed in receiving de novo review merely by labeling its challenge as falling within the public policy exception to the normal rule of deference. The substance, not the form, of the challenge will govern.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that, when the city waived the illegal contract defense before the panel; see part I B of this opinion; it also deprived the court of the factual basis necessary to consider that same claim in the context of a public policy challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED THE CITY\u2019S MOTIONS FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND FOR REARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The city next argues that the trial court improperly denied its motion for an evidentiary hearing to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the disputed jurisdictional facts at issue, namely, the circumstances surrounding the illegal contract procurement, which went to the panel\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Klewin contends in response that this claim was not raised adequately before the trial court, and further is a \u201cred herring\u201d because the factual issues were within the jurisdiction of, and waived before, the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The city correctly points out that \u201c[w]hen issues of fact are necessary to the determination of a court\u2019s jurisdiction, due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held, in which an opportunity is provided to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schaghticoke Tribal Nation </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>264 Conn. 829, 833, 826 A.2d 1102 (2003). In the present case, we already have concluded that all of the factual issues surrounding the allegedly illegal procurement of the contract were firmly committed to the panel in the first instance, notwithstanding their import to a subsequent public policy determination. See part I A and D of this opinion. Because the city waived its right to present those factual issues by its conduct before the panel; see part I B of this opinion;<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the trial court did not improperly deny its motion for an evidentiary hearing, and did not abuse its discretion by denying the city\u2019s subsequent motion for reargument on this point.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">WHETHER THE PANEL PROPERLY PROCEEDED WITH ONLY TWO ARBITRATORS AFTER A VACANCY DEVELOPED</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The city next claims that the trial court should have vacated the arbitration award because the arbitrators lacked subject matter jurisdiction as the panel only had two members, rather than the agreed upon three members. The city claims that the parties had agreed at the outset of the arbitration that a balanced panel of three arbitrators was required, thus requiring departure from the association\u2019s commercial arbitration rules that permit an incomplete panel to continue with an arbitration. In response, Klewin argues that the issue of whether to proceed with two arbitrators was committed to the panel, which decided that issue correctly. We agree with Klewin, and conclude that, after a vacancy developed on the panel during the proceedings, the arbitrators properly continued the proceedings with a panel of two members.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. In June, 2001, the city requested that the association select a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules for large, complex disputes that would include an experienced construction attorney, an experienced design professional and an experienced contractor; the letter noted specifically that \u201c[b]y agreement with [Klewin\u2019s attorney], we request that you use the construction industry panel for purposes of selection of the panel.\u201d Subsequently, in February, 2002, prior to commencement of the hearings, the attorney member, Edwin Hebb, withdrew from the panel for personal reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>In March, 2002, the parties agreed that Attorney Peter Lawson Kennedy would replace Hebb on the panel, and serve as chairperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Thereafter, the hearings commenced, but, in September, 2002, Frank Juliano, another member of the panel, resigned because of illness. At that point, the parties disagreed about whether to proceed with the remaining two arbitrators, with only Klewin favoring that course of action. Relying on rule R-21 (b) of the association\u2019s commercial dispute resolution procedures,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the arbitrators elected to continue with the proceedings with a two member panel, concluding that the parties had not \u201c \u2018agree [d] otherwise\u2019 \u201d in accordance with the rules.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Thereafter, the city renewed its objection and participated in the subsequent hearings under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The trial court concluded that, under the arbitration rules, it properly was in the purview of the panel to determine whether the vacancy should be filled.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>trial court further noted that, because the parties\u2019 arbitration clause did not expressly or specifically establish the composition of the panel, the panel properly interpreted the association\u2019s rules to permit the use of only two arbitrators. The court also concluded that the letter from the city requesting that the panel be selected in accordance with the rules for large commercial disputes, which would require three arbitrators, indicated that Klewin had agreed to those rules only for purposes of the selection of the initial panel. The court also rejected the city\u2019s argument that Klewin\u2019s acquiescence to filling the first vacancy corroborated the existence of such an agreement, indicating that it was only evidence of such an agreement to a panel of three on that particular occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Whether the panel had the authority, under the agreement of the parties and the applicable association rules, to proceed with two arbitrators after a vacancy had developed raises an issue of whether the panel exceeded its powers, a ground for vacatur under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). This presents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. See, e.g., <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 84, 881 A.2d 139 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">An agreement about the initial composition of an arbitration panel is distinct conceptually from an agreement about how to address vacancies on that panel, and the association\u2019s rules incorporated by reference into an arbitration clause properly are the subject of interpretation by the arbitration panel. <em>Bernstein </em>v. <em>On-Line Software International, Inc., </em>232 App. Div. 2d 336, 337, 648 N.Y.S.2d 602 (1996), appeal denied, 89 N.Y.2d 810, 678 N.E.2d 1354, 656 N.Y.S.2d 738 (1997). Moreover, in the absence of a specific agreement as to the composition of the arbitration panels, which signi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>fies an \u201cagreement otherwise\u201d by the parties, a panel of three neutral arbitrators properly may continue with fewer than three members if a vacancy arises on the panel. Id., 336-37; see <em>Board of Neosho County Commissioners </em>v. <em>Central Air Conditioning Co., </em>235 Kan. 977, 979-80, 683 P.2d 1282 (1984); <em>MMR-Radon Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>714 So. 2d 1, 9 (La. App.), review denied, 721 So. 2d 915 (La. 1998); <em>Wiekhorst Bros. Excavating &amp; Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Sanitary &amp; Improvement District No. 337, </em>232 Neb. 377, 379, 440 N.W.2d 488 (1989); cf. <em>Szuts </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>931 F.2d 830, 831-32 (11th Cir. 1991) (vacating award because arbitration improperly continued with two arbitrators when parties\u2019 arbitration agreement specifically required panel of three).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement did not contemplate any variation from the association\u2019s rules with respect to panel vacancies arising during the course of hearings. The CM agreement\u2019s arbitration clause stated in relevant part only that unresolved disputes \u201cshall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association for resolution in accordance with its commercial rules of arbitration then in effect,\u201d and does not prescribe specifically the composition of the panel. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Moreover, the correspondence of the parties does not evince any particular agreement as to the handling of subsequent vacancies on the panel. Accordingly, how to proceed in the event of a vacancy was an issue squarely within the authority of the panel, and the trial court, therefore, properly concluded that the association\u2019s rules permitted the panel to proceed with two arbitrators after a vacancy had developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">CROSS APPEAL:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">WHETHER OFFER OF JUDGMENT INTEREST IS AVAILABLE IN PROCEEDINGS TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Finally, we consider KLewin\u2019s cross appeal, in which it claims that the trial court improperly failed to add offer of judgment interest to the judgment in this case pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a. In response, the city, relying on, inter alia, <em>Nunno </em>v. <em>Wixner, </em>257 Conn. 671, 778 A.2d 145 (2001), claims that arbitration confirmation proceedings are not \u201ccivil actions\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-192a. We decline to reach this claim because the trial court did not rule on it, rendering the record inadequate for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">In its application to confirm the award, Klewin noted that it had filed an offer of judgment during the arbitration proceedings in the amount of $5,800,000, which the city rejected. In its claim for relief, Klewin then requested offer of judgment interest pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a, in addition to confirmation of the award. Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment confirming the award, but neither the memorandum of decision nor the judgment file make any mention of KLewin\u2019s claim for offer of judgment interest. We also note that there are no postjudgment motions, such as a motion for articulation or rectification; see Practice Book \u00a7 66-5;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>or a motion to open the judgment; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> or a motion to correct the judgment; see, e.g., <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Gager, </em>263 Conn. 321, 326, 820 A.2d 1004 (2003);<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> addressing the issue of offer of judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u201cAs is always the case, the [appellant], here the [defendant], bearfs] the burden of providing a reviewing court with an adequate record for review. ...

In the absence of any such attempts, we decline to review this issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>Grimm, </em>276 Conn. 377, 388-89, 886 A.2d 391 (2005), cert, denied, 547 U.S. 1148, 126 S.

Thus, we will not engage in the \u201cinappropriate task of speculating about the trial court\u2019s reasoning\u201d by reviewing Klewin\u2019s cross appeal. <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 233, 828 A.2d 64 (2003); id.

[and] the plaintiffs never remedied this defect in the record by moving for articulation or rectification of the trial court\u2019s decision\u201d); see also <em>Heaven </em>v. <em>Timber Hill, LLC, </em>96 Conn.

These provisions exist to protect the citizens and taxpayers of the municipality from upjust, ill-considered, or extortionate contracts, or those showing favoritism. The reason these contracts are generally not enforced is that if the municipality is allowed to disregard the formalities and the other contracting party is, nevertheless, permitted to recover for the property delivered or the services rendered, either on the ground of ratification, estoppel or implied contract, then it follows that the statute or charter provision can always be evaded.\u201d 10 E.

This argument echoes Justice Black\u2019s dissent in <em>Prima Paint </em>[Corp.]: \u2018Sections 2 and 3 of the [a]ct assume the existence of a valid contract. They merely provide for enforcement where such a valid contract exists.\u2019 . . . We do not read \u2018contract\u2019 so narrowly. The word appears four times in \u00a7 2. Its last appearance is in the final clause, which allows a challenge to an arbitration provision \u2018upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 . . . There can be no doubt that \u2018contract\u2019 as used this last time must include contracts that later prove to be void. Otherwise, the grounds for revocation would be limited to those that rendered a contract voidable \u2014 which would mean (implausibly) that an arbitration agreement could be challenged as voidable but not as void. Because the sentence\u2019s final use of \u2018contract\u2019 so obviously includes putative contracts, we will not read the same word earlier in the same sentence to have a more narrow meaning. We note that neither <em>Prima Paint </em>[Corp.] nor <em>Southland, [Corp.] </em>lends support to [the] respondents\u2019 reading; as we have discussed, neither case turned on whether the challenge at issue would render the contract voidable or void.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 447-48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> We agree with the city that, as recognized by the trial court, this case is governed by state, and not federal, arbitration law.

This court concluded that, although the company had declined to participate in the arbitration proceedings at issue, the union was not obliged to move to compel arbitration and properly had presented its case to the arbitrators, and also that the company had not been deprived of its right to a judicial determination of the contract\u2019s validity.

Indeed, this is exactly what the company did.

These arguments ring hollow to us. The indictment was available when the city proceeded voluntarily with the arbitration.

Although the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision appears to conflate the city\u2019s arguments with respect to its arbitral misconduct claims and the illegality of contract claims, it is clear that the trial court considered this development in its review of the proceedings before the panel, and it is properly before us on appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\"> Specifically, the arbitration award provided: \u201cThe panel had stated previously on the record that the issues concerning the illegality of the contract because of alleged [Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act] violations and other illegal acts as stated in [the city\u2019s] [c]ounterclaim and [a]ffirmative [d]efenses would not be considered by the [p]anel because [the city\u2019s] pleading was: (a) filed too late, being twenty months after the date of. . .

Inasmuch as we conclude that the city waived this claim when the panel finally and correctly offered to exercise its jurisdiction over the illegality claims; see part I B of this opinion; that determination by the panel was, at worst, harmless error not requiring vacatur of the award.

Kasper Group, Inc., </em>supra, 278 Conn. 467-68, the majority concluded that the trial court had properly vacated an arbitration award under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3) because the arbitrator had committed misconduct by denying the city\u2019s motions to stay the proceedings and submit additional \u201cpertinent and material evidence\u201d with respect to its claim that the design contract at issue was void ab initio because it had been procured illegally. We concluded that the trial court properly determined that the arbitrator\u2019s denial of these motions to stay the proceedings until the end of the related criminal trial and to supplement the record with excerpts of testimony from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>that trial constituted misconduct requiring vacatur of the award, because that trial testimony was \u201ccentral to the plaintiffs case\u201d as relevant, noncumulative direct evidence of illegality. Id., 481-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Justice Vertefeuille dissented, concluding that, although the proffered testimony was relevant and not cumulative, the city was not substantially prejudiced by its exclusion in light of other evidence already in the record. Id., 486. Accordingly, because Justice Vertefeuille would have reversed the judgment of the trial court, she considered the city\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> Justice Vertefeuille also addressed the city\u2019s claim that \u201cenforcement of the award would violate the public policy against binding a municipality to an agreement entered into by its unauthorized agent.\u201d <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Kasper Group, Inc., </em>supra, 278 Conn. 494-95 <em>(Vertefeuille, J., </em>dissenting). Relying on <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 429, she rejected this claim and concluded that, \u201ceven if I were to assume, arguendo, that this state has an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy against enforcing contracts entered into by a municipality\u2019s agent who lacked the authority to bind the municipality, the plaintiffs claim seeks to disturb the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings in violation of this court\u2019s traditional deference to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Kasper Group, Inc., </em>supra, 496 <em>(Vertefeuille, J., </em>dissenting). She noted that, although the arbitrator had not set forth his findings of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the award of contract damages \u201cindicates that he found, as a factual matter, a breach of either an express or implied in fact contract,\u201d and therefore, \u201cnecessarily found that the committee had either the implied or apparent authority to bind the municipality.\u201d Id., 496-97 <em>(Vertefeuille, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Indeed, Justice Vertefeuille emphasized that \u201c[d]eclining to review the factual findings of an arbitrator is consistent with our admonition to construe narrowly the public policy grounds for vacating arbitration awards lest this exception swallow this court\u2019s rule of deference to arbitrators\u2019 determinations. ... If this court were to engage in a review of the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings each time a dissatisfied party to an arbitration could make a color-able claim that the award implicates an explicit, well-defined, and dominant precedent of our case law, then an arbitrator\u2019s award would likely mark the beginning of litigation and not the resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 498 <em>([Vertefeuille, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> Citing <em>Haynes Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Cascella &amp; Son Construction Co., </em>36 Conn. App. 29, 647 A.2d 1015, cert, denied, 231 Conn. 916, 648 A.2d 152 (1994), Klewin claims that because the terms and purpose of the CM agreement are not illegal, judicial enforcement of an arbitration award rendered pursuant thereto would not violate public policy. In <em>Haynes Construction Co., </em>the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court improperly determined that arbitral enforcement of a construction subcontract would violate public policy because the subcontractor\u2019s payment arrangement with its workers violated prevailing wage statutes. Id., 40. The Appellate Court noted that the agreement \u201cwas simply a contract by the defendant to render certain subcontracting services to the plaintiff\u2019 and that the \u201ccontract contains no mention whatever of payment of the prevailing wages, nor was it necessary to prove the illegal wage payment plan in order to prove the defendant\u2019s claim in the arbitration proceedings.\u201d Id. The court concluded that, \u201c[a]s the purpose of the contract was legal, enforcing it by way of an arbitration award would not violate public policy. Indeed, failure to enforce the contract would be much more frustrating of public policy. Allowing the plaintiff to escape liability after breaching the contract would mean that it would not be required to produce the very funds that the defendant and its employees relied on for payment of the prevailing wages.\u201d Id., 40-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">In our view, Klewin\u2019s argument takes an improperly circumscribed view of the public policy exception. The public policy implications in <em>Haynes Construction Co. </em>were tangential to the subcontract at issue. In the present case, the city\u2019s public policy challenge arises directly from the circumstances surrounding the formation and enforceability of the CM agreement. Presented with an appropriately developed factual record, the public policy challenge in this case properly would have been before the judicial authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> The city\u2019s reliance on the conclusion in <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 430, that a public policy challenge may be raised for the first time before the trial court is overbroad. Although we have not required that <em>all </em>such claims be raised first before the arbitral authority, that determination depends on the nature of the public policy challenge, as \u201coften the question of whether [an] award [violates public policy] will not arise until after the award has been rendered. . . . Thus, in such a case, there would be no reason to defer to the arbitrator regarding a question that might not have been considered in the arbitration proceeding.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. Indeed, public policy cases frequently are characterized by straightforward, if not undisputed, facts that present classic questions of law for this court. See, e.g., <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 36-37 (trial court properly vacated arbitration award reinstating employee who had been convicted of embezzlement of his employer\u2019s funds following plea of nolo contendere because award had violated public policy against embezzlement found in relevant criminal statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 [1]). The present case is, however, distinguishable from these cases because, although ascertaining statutory or other bases for a policy against illegality in the procurement of municipal public works contract is readily within the domain of the courts, that policy nevertheless must be applied to the facts of a particular case, the finding of which remains the province of the arbitrator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities contends in its amicus curiae brief that \u201c [r] ecent scandals involving state and local officials highlight the problem of corruption and the need to safeguard the public interest and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>purse against misuse of public trust and funds.\u201d Its arguments, and those of the other amici curiae, suffer, however, from the same deficiency as do the city\u2019s claims, namely, that the factual predicate for this public policy challenge does not exist in this case because of the plaintiffs conduct of its defense in the underlying arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> \u201cA \u2018mulligan\u2019 is \u2018a free shot sometimes awarded a golfer in nontoumament play when the preceding shot has been poorly played.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bortner </em>v. <em>Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 256 n.15, 736 A.2d 104 (1999), quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\"> The city claims that, had the trial court held a hearing, it would have presented evidence supporting the reasons for its delay in raising the illegality defense, including concealment by Klewin and interference by Ganim, who had continued to hold office until his conviction on other federal corruption charges.

In other words, it is clerical error if the judgment as recorded fails to agree with the judgment in fact rendered .... Thus, a motion to correct properly is granted when the moving party demonstrates that the recorded judgment is inconsistent with the actual judgment. . . .

We disagree. Because the application of \u00a7 52-192a in voluntary arbitration proceedings is heretofore uncharted waters, other legal issues also remain as to, for example, whether the interest would begin to run when the offer of judgment was first filed in the underlying arbitration, or upon commencement of the confirmation proceedings. This renders a trial court ruling, which was not present in this case, particularly crucial to our review of this issue. In any event, a party\u2019s failure to respond to a discrete legal argument in the context of a judicial proceeding is not necessarily a concession of its validity.
