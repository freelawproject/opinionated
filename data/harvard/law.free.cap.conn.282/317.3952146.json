Mead, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the habeas court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner claims on appeal that the habeas court improperly concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35b,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which defines a sentence of life imprisonment as a definite sentence of sixty years, does not apply retroactively to persons who committed crimes prior to that statute\u2019s enactment. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On March 8, 1971, the petitioner was indicted on three counts of murder in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-9 for offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>committed on or about August 12, 1970.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 6, 1972, the petitioner changed his pleas of not guilty as to the three counts of murder in the first degree to guilty of three counts of murder in the second degree. On April 11, 1972, the petitioner was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences, under General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-11,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was confined to the custody of the respondent, the commissioner of correction (commissioner), pursuant to a mittimus issued on that date. As of the date of the petitioner\u2019s crimes, a sentence of life imprisonment was regarded as a sentence of imprisonment for the duration of the defendant\u2019s natural life. General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Thereafter, as part of the Penal Code that became effective on October 1, 1971, the legislature adopted Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7 35, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-35, which provides in relevant part that, \u201c(a) [a] sentence of imprisonment for a felony shall be an indeterminate sentence . . . .\u201d The statute also sets a maximum term of life imprisonment and a minimum term of not less than ten nor more than twenty-live years for a class A felony. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-35 (b) and (c). In 1980, as part of the legislature\u2019s comprehensive revision of the state\u2019s sentencing structure abolishing indeterminate sentencing and creating definite sentencing, the legislature enacted \u00a7 53a-35b and amended \u00a7 53a-35 (a) to provide in relevant part: \u201cFor any felony committed prior to July 1,1981, the sentence of imprisonment shall be an indeterminate sentence . . . .\u201d Public Acts 1980, No. 80-442, \u00a7 9, now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35 (a). Accordingly, the commissioner recalculated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>petitioner\u2019s sentence for murder, a class A felony,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from a sentence of life imprisonment to an indeterminate sentence with a minimum term of twenty-five years and a maximum term of life imprisonment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Accounting for statutory good time credits, jail credit, and earned seven day job credit, the twenty-five year minimum portion of the petitioner\u2019s sentence expired on February 25, 1985, making him parole eligible on that date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The petitioner was first denied parole on April 2, 1985, and subsequently denied parole on six more occasions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petitioner\u2019s next parole eligibility date is 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">On January 15, 2004, the petitioner filed the present second amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The petition alleges, in relevant part, that the commissioner\u2019s custody of the petitioner is unlawful because the commissioner has not calculated the petitioner\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment in accordance with the current version of \u00a7 53a-35b, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] sentence of imprisonment for life shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>mean a definite sentence of sixty years . . . .\u201d The petitioner seeks a recalculation of his life sentence to a definite sentence of sixty years, and the reduction of such sentence by all applicable credits, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-7.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The commissioner opposed the petition on the grounds that \u00a7 53a-35b does not apply retroactively to the petitioner\u2019s sentence, and that the petitioner is serving the correct indeterminate sentence of twenty-five years to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Following a hearing on March 9, 2004, on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, the habeas court issued a memorandum of decision on May 20, 2004. The court, relying in part on <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>24 Conn. App. 612, 622, 590 A.2d 984, cert, denied, 219 Conn. 913, 593 A.2d 138 (1991), concluded that the enactment of P.A. 80-442 was part of a comprehensive revision of this state\u2019s sentencing structure that altered substantive, rather than procedural rights. The court noted that statutes that affect substantive rights are presumed to apply prospectively only. Finding no clear and unequivocal expression by the legislature rebutting the presumption of prospective application, either in the text of \u00a7 53a-35b or in its relationship to other statutes, the habeas court concluded that \u00a7 53a-35b did not apply to the petitioner\u2019s current controlling sentence. The habeas court granted the commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and, accordingly, rendered judgment denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The petitioner appealed to the Appellate Court challenging the habeas court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the habeas court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>improperly concluded that \u00a7 53a-35b does not apply retroactively to persons sentenced prior to that statute\u2019s enactment. The Appellate Court heard oral argument on the appeal on February 7, 2006. Thereafter, the Appellate Corut ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing what effect, if any, this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 888 A.2d 985, cert, denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006), had on the application of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35 and 53a-35b. After the filing of the supplemental briefs, the Appellate Court panel moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-2,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that this appeal be transferred to the Supreme Corut. We granted the motion on March 17, 2006, and thereafter heard oral argument on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 53a-35b affects substantive rights and, in the absence of any clear and unequivocal expression by the legislature rebutting the presumption of prospective application, that the statute does not apply retroactively to persons sentenced prior to its enactment. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cAlthough a habeas court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard of review, questions of law are subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>261 Conn. 806, 816, 808 A.2d 653 (2002), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>538 U.S. 1005, 123 S. Ct. 1914, 155 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2003). Whether a legislative act applies retroactively is a question of law over which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>this court has plenary review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>262 Conn. 686, 701, 817 A.2d 76 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">When considering the retroactivity of a penal statute, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that, [w]hether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. ... In seeking to discern that intent, [o]ur point of departure is . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 55-3,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which ... we have uniformly interpreted ... as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . The [legislature only rebuts this presumption when it clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. ... As a corollary to this principle, we also have presumed that procedural or remedial statutes are intended to apply retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary .... While there is no precise definition of either [substantive or procedural law], it is generally agreed that a substantive law creates, defines and regulates rights while a procedural law prescribes the methods of enforcing such rights or obtaining redress.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 679-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Quinet, </em>253 Conn. 392, 411-12, 752 A.2d 490 (2000), we considered the retroactivity of Public Acts 1995, No. 95-142, \u00a7 2, which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-29 (e), to require the imposition of a probationary term of not less than ten years and not more than thirty-five years for certain serious sexual offenses. The amendment increased the maximum probationary period of five years previously allowed under \u00a7 53-29. Expressing concern that applying the new stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ute retroactively would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States constitution by exposing the defendant to a longer probationary period, we refused to give retroactive effect to a change in the state\u2019s probationary structure. Id., 414-16. Thus, we concluded that changes in the structure of probation, an alternative form of sentencing, affect substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 804, 805-807, 786 A.2d 1091 (2002), we considered the retroactivity of Public Acts 1995, No. 95-255, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 95-255), now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a. Prior to P.A. 95-255, certain violent offenders were eligible for parole upon completion of 50 percent of their sentence, whereas after the amendment, persons convicted of offenses involving the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person were not parole eligible until they had served 85 percent of their sentence. General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a (b). Finding no clear expression of legislative intent for the statute to apply retroactively, and expressing concerns about ex post facto violations, we refused to give retroactive effect to the 85 percent requirement. <em>Johnson v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 828-29. Thus, we concluded that changes in the eligibility for parole, a part of the state\u2019s sentencing scheme, affect substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">With these cases in mind, we conclude that, contrary to the petitioner\u2019s claim, \u00a7 53a-35b is a substantive statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Like the statutes at issue in <em>Quinet </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>\u00a7 53a-35b defines and regulates the length of time that a prisoner is deprived of his liberty. The statute does not merely tell the commissioner how to administer an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>existing right, but, instead, governs the right that the commissioner must administer. Accordingly, the statute presumptively does not apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The presumption that \u00a7 53a-35b has only prospective effect can be overcome only by a clear and unequivocal expression of legislative intent that the statute shall apply retrospectively. <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 680. The language of \u00a7 53a-53b itself is silent as to whether the legislature intended it to be applied retroactively. Accordingly, we look to the relationship of \u00a7 53a-35b to related statutes enacted as part of P.A. 80-442, which comprehensively revised this state\u2019s sentencing structure by abolishing indeterminate sentencing and creating definite sentencing. Section 53a-35a expressly provides that definite sentences shall be imposed only for felonies committed on or after July 1, 1981. The statute further provides that the penalty for the class A felony of murder is a term of imprisonment not less than twenty-five years nor more than life. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a (2). Prior to 1981, the term \u201clife imprisonment\u201d was inherently indeterminate because it referred to the natural life of the prisoner. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the purpose of \u00a7 53a-35b was to define life imprisonment \u2014 the one remaining indeterminate term in the now definite sentencing scheme\u2014 as a definite sentence of sixty years. It is also reasonable to conclude that \u00a7 53a-35b applies only to post-1981 determinate sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">A retroactive application of \u00a7 53a-35b would also raise some of the same concerns that troubled the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>889 F.2d 445 (2d Cir. 1989). The petitioner in <em>Davis </em>claimed that he was entitled to have his pre-1971 life sentence changed to an indeterminate sentence in accordance with the provisions of the Penal Code that took effect in 1971 and were amended in 1980. Id., 448-50. The petitioner asserted that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>created an entitlement to a judicially imposed indeterminate sentence by amending \u00a7 53a-35 to apply indeterminate sentencing to \u201c \u2018any felony committed prior to July 1, 1981,\u2019 \u201d and by failing to limit this provision to felonies committed after October 1, 1971. Id., 450. The court in <em>Davis </em>concluded that neither the 1971 provisions nor the 1980 amendment to \u00a7 53a-35 was retroactive, as a retroactive application of \u00a7 53a-35 would mean that \u201cevery defendant sentenced under the pre-1971 penal code would be entitled to be re-sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.\u201d Id. The court found it \u201cimprobable that the legislature intended to impose such a burden on the Connecticut courts.\u201d Id. We find it equally improbable that the legislature intended to impose such a burden on our court system by requiring that every defendant sentenced to life imprisonment prior to 1981 would be entitled to have his life sentence recalculated as a term of sixty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Finally, our careful review of the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-35b reveals that it is void of any clear and unequivocal expression by the legislature for \u00a7 53a-35b to apply retroactively. We therefore reject the petitioner\u2019s claim that \u00a7 53a-35b, a substantive statute, must be given retroactive application to prisoners sentenced prior to its enactment. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court and its conclusion that \u00a7 53a-35b affects substantive rights and must be given only prospective application.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">We note that the petitioner claims for the first time in his supplemental brief that, if \u00a7 53a-35b does not apply retroactively, he should be treated as serving a definite life sentence under General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-11, and that the commissioner improperly has treated his sentence as an indeterminate sentence of twenty-five years to life imprisonment in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>with \u00a7 53a-35.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a- 35 (a) (\u201c[f]or any felony committed prior to July 1,1981, the sentence of imprisonment shall be an indeterminate sentence\u201d). The petitioner argues that, despite the language of \u00a7 53a-35 (a), under <em>Davis, </em>the indeterminate sentencing provisions adopted as part of the Penal Code in 1969 do not apply to defendants who committed crimes before October 1, 1971. Accordingly, the petitioner contends, he should be treated as having been sentenced to a definite sentence of life imprisonment under General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We agree that the decision in <em>Davis </em>appears squarely to support the petitioner\u2019s argument. See id., 450 (\u201cthe indeterminate sentencing requirements found in \u00a7 53a-35 apply only to those crimes committed between October 1,1971, and June 30,1981\u201d). We conclude, however, that we need not decide this issue which, as we noted previously, the petitioner raised for the first time in his supplemental brief and to which the commissioner has had no opportunity to respond.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The petitioner makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>no claim that, if we were to conclude that \u00a7 53a-35b is not retroactive, then the commissioner\u2019s treatment of his sentence as an indeterminate sentence of twenty-five years to life imprisonment under \u00a7 53a-35 instead of a definite sentence of life imprisonment under \u00a7 53-11 would have some deleterious effect on him. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>supra, 889 F.2d 450 (although indeterminate sentencing did not apply to prisoner who committed crime in 1966, Connecticut department of correction was justified in treating petitioner\u2019s definite life sentences as requiring that he serve minimum of twenty-five years less appropriate good time credits), citing <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 392, 362 A.2d 971 (1975) (prisoner sentenced to definite life sentence in 1970 was entitled to parole after twenty-five years less good time and jail time credits). Accordingly, even if we were to assume that the commissioner improperly applied \u00a7 53a-35 to the petitioner, any such impropriety necessarily would be deemed harmless because the petitioner has not claimed that he will suffer any deleterious effect as a result of serving a sentence in accordance with \u00a7 53a-35 when \u00a7 53a-35b is not given retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The judgment of the habeas court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-12\"> The petitioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court where, after having heard oral argument on the appeal, the Appellate Court filed a statement with this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-2 requesting that we transfer the appeal to this court.
