The defendant contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs business activities do not constitute taxable \u201c \u2018[services\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (I).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Message Center Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>50 Conn. Sup. 317, 328, 927 A.2d 378 (2006). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff, a developer and operator of wireless communication sites, is in the business of identifying geographical areas without wireless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>coverage, constructing wireless towers or antennas to service those areas, and marketing that infrastructure to wireless carriers. To that end, the plaintiff contracts with property owners for the exclusive rights to construct and maintain the requisite equipment. Typically, these \u201cmanagement\u201d agreements appoint the plaintiff as the exclusive managing agent for the property owner in exchange for a percentage of any licensing revenue that the plaintiff collects from sublicensing wireless carriers. Having determined that the foregoing business activities constituted taxable management services to industrial, commercial or income producing property, the defendant assessed sales and use tax against the plaintiff, which appealed that assessment to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">On appeal, the trial court examined the meaning of the word \u201cmanagement\u201d in the context of \u201c \u2018the nature of the services being rendered, and not what those services are called or termed by the service provider or service recipient ....\u201d\u2019 Id., 324. Comparing the plaintiffs business activities with those of traditional retail and residential property managers, the court found that the \u201cdominant economic characteristic of the transaction between the plaintiff and the property owner is the development by the plaintiff, at its own expense and risk, of a portion of an owner\u2019s property into a wireless communication site for the benefit of wireless carriers.\u201d Id., 328. Accordingly, the court concluded that the plaintiffs business activities were not taxable management services within the meaning of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (I), and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The central issue of the applicability of the sales and use tax to the plaintiffs activities was properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision filed by the trial court. See id. Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on that issue. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.
