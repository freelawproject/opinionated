Exec. Law \u00a7 296(15). The plaintiffs are two former employees of Astro Moving and Storage Co. (\u201cAstro\u201d), which, as its name suggests, provides certain moving and storage services as a \u201cdisclosed households goods agent\u201d on behalf of defendant-appellee Allied Van Lines, Inc. (\u201cAllied\u201d). Defendant-appellee Sirva, Inc. (\u201cSirva\u201d) is a holding company of Sir-va Worldwide, Inc. (\u201cSirva Worldwide\u201d) and Sirva Worldwide is the parent company of North American Van Lines, Inc. (\u2018Van Lines\u201d). Van Lines is the parent company of Allied.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">In its agency contract with Allied, Astro agreed to require any employees working on Allied jobs to undergo a criminal background check. If an employee was found to have one of several serious criminal convictions on his or her record, Allied effectively prohibited Astro from allowing those employees to work on Allied jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">Griffin and Godwin both submitted consent forms for a background check in February 2011. When the background check was completed, the contractor that performed the check found that Griffin and Godwin had both been convicted of certain felony sexual offenses. Sometime thereaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ter, the President of Astro, Keith Verder-ber, terminated their employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Griffin and Godwin, along with another terminated employee not party to this appeal, then brought suit against Astro, Allied, and Sir-va, alleging violations of the NYSHRL, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 290 et seq., and against Astro alone for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), and the New York Labor Law. Plaintiffs then moved for partial summary judgment against all defendants on the issue of liability under NYSHRL \u00a7 296(15) for discrimination on the basis of a criminal conviction. Sirva and Allied then cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The district court (Brodie, /.) denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and granted Sirva and Allied\u2019s motion. The district court determined that Section 296(15) applied only to the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d The district court examined a variety of cases discussing how an entity is determined to be an individual\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d Because Griffin and Godwin were not directly employed by either Allied or Sirva, the district court determined that Allied and Sirva could not be held liable under the NYSHRL for Astro\u2019s termination of Griffin and Godwin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The question of who may be held liable under Section 296(15) is an unresolved question of New York State law. The case presents the following three questions that the New York Court of Appeals has not had the opportunity to address:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\"><em>First, </em>does Section 296(15) limit liability for unlawful denial of employment only to the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d? <em>Second, </em>if Section 296(15) is limited in that way, how should courts determine whether an entity is the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d for the purposes of a claim under Section 296(15)? <em>Third, </em>does the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d liability provision of the NYSHRL, Section 296(6), apply to Section 296(15) such that a non-employer may be liable under Section 296(15) as an aider and abettor of an employer\u2019s unlawful denial of employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Because we conclude that New York law is unsettled with respect to these three questions, we conclude the law is too undeveloped \u201cin this area to enable us to predict with confidence how the New York Court of Appeals would resolve these issues of New York State law presented on appeal.\u201d <em>Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, </em>673 F.3d 50, 55 (2d Cir.), <em>certified question accepted sub nom. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, </em>18 N.Y.3d 952, 944 N.Y.S.2d 472, 967 N.E.2d 697 (2012), and <em>certified question answered sub nom. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, </em>20 N.Y.3d 327, 960 N.Y.S.2d 695, 984 N.E.2d 893 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Therefore, we certify to the New York State Court of Appeals these three questions concerning liability under NYSHRL Section 296(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The facts set forth below are drawn from the district court\u2019s opinion denying Griffin and Godwin\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting Sirva and Allied\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Griffin v. Sirva Inc., </em>No. 11-CV-1844 MKB, 2014 WL 2434196 (E.D.N.Y. May 29, 2014). With a few ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>eeptions, the relevant material facts are not in dispute. Thus we provide only those facts we think necessary for a complete understanding of this appeal and the questions of law posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">I. The Agency Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Griffin and Godwin are both former laborer employees of Astro, which \u201cprovides local warehouse services and transportation services under its own authority from the New York State Department of Transportation.\u201d App\u2019x at 274. Under its agency contract with Allied, Astro was entitled to, among other things, \u201cpack, crate, prepare for transportation, receive, load, transfer, unload, store, warehouse, deliver, and otherwise to service ... shipments of household goods and all other freight which [Allied] ha[d] authority to transport[.]\u201d App\u2019x at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The agency contract also required Astro to comply with Allied\u2019s \u201cCertified Labor Program\u201d (the \u201cACLP\u201d). The ACLP required Astro to ensure that all of its employees working on any Allied jobs successfully complete a criminal background check. Under the ACLP, Allied was granted the \u201csole authority and responsibility to establish and determine the consent process, adjudication standards, and documentation criteria for both certification of indi-wduals and alternative vendors\u201d running the background checks on employees. App\u2019x at 63. Allied was also entitled to conduct \u201cperiodic audits\u201d of Astro\u2019s employees to \u201cverify the use of certified individuals and compliance with the ACLP.\u201d App\u2019x at 64. If Astro was found in noncompliance, Allied was permitted to levy a series of fines based on whether the violation was a first, second, or third offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Allied maintains certain \u201cadjudication guidelines\u201d that are \u201cused to determine the eligibility of its agents\u2019 contractors and employees for participation in Allied\u2019s interstate moving services.\u201d App\u2019x at 112. Under the guidelines, an employee\u2019s \u201cfelony conviction for any (A) sexual offense; (B) kidnapping; (C) death related offenses; (D) attempted murder; (E) assault with a deadly weapon; (F) assault with intent to kill or (G) armed robbery, mandates the [employee\u2019s] permanent disqualification from any jobs performed by\u201d one of Allied\u2019s agents. App\u2019x at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">To facilitate the background screening process, Sirva Worldwide entered into an agreement with HireRight Solutions, Inc. (\u201cHireRight\u201d), a vendor providing background screening services, effective August 24, 2010. After an employee fills out a consent form, HireRight conducts a background check and then provides one of Allied\u2019s agents with information as to whether a particular employee is \u201ccleared or not\u201d from working on any of Allied\u2019s jobs. App\u2019x at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">II. The Relationship between Allied and Astro</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Seventy- to eighty-percent of Astro\u2019s business is projects for Allied. But Allied asserts it is a separate legal entity from Astro, and maintains that it does not share employees, common ownership, or management with Astro. Further, Allied states it \u201cdoes not control ASTRO\u2019s local moving business, ... nor does ALLIED control ASTRO\u2019s employment policies or practices relating to its own business.\u201d App\u2019x at 96. Allied further asserts that \u201cAllied has no authority to select or hire Astro\u2019s employees and has never possessed such authority\u201d and that Allied \u201cdoes not establish the salaries or benefits of Astro\u2019s employees, make any payments to Astro\u2019s employees, have the authority to discipline or dismiss Astro\u2019s employees, control the conduct of Astro\u2019s employees, or control the work schedules of, assign jobs to, or supervise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the work of Astro\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>2014 WL 2434196, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">III. Griffin and Godwin\u2019s Convictions, Employment with Astro, and Terminations</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Griffin began working for Astro in August 2008 and Godwin began working for the company in May 2010. Both worked as \u201chelpers,\u201d which required them to, among other things, pack household goods for transportation and move goods \u201cin and out of ASTRO\u2019s customer\u2019s homes.\u201d App\u2019x at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In 1997, Griffin pleaded guilty to first degree child abuse and sexual misconduct. He was sentenced to six to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment and served ten years. He is designated a \u201cSexually Violent Offender,\u201d and is currently under the supervision of the New York State Division of Parole with conditions that he is not permitted to have contact with children under the age of eighteen unless he is in the company of another adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In 1999, Godwin pleaded guilty to rape in the first degree and sexual abuse in the first degree. He was sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment and was released in 2008. He remained on parole until May 2010. Like Griffin, Godwin is also designated a \u201cSexually Violent Offender\u201d and subject to the same condition that he have no contact with children under the age of eighteen unless in the company of another adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Although Griffin began working for As-tro in August 2008, he was not asked to consent to a background check until 2011, and both Godwin\u2019s and Griffin\u2019s consent forms were submitted to HireRight in February 2011. In response to a question asking whether Griffin had \u201cbeen convicted of any felony criminal offenses,\u201d Griffin admitted that he was convicted of \u201cchild abuse.\u201d App\u2019x at 79. When HireRight\u2019s reports on Griffin and Godwin were returned, both reports stated that neither was eligible to work on any Allied jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">It is settled that this court \u201creview[s] a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>... construing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing] all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Tracy v. Freshwater, </em>623 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">Sirva and Allied dispute the standard of review, claiming that because the jury\u2019s verdict found that Astro did not unlawfully violate the New York State Human Rights Law (\u201cNYSHRL\u201d), that Griffin and Godwin are bound by this verdict on appeal. But \u201c[u]pon review of a grant by a district court of a motion for summary judgment, a federal appellate court may examine <em>only the evidence which was before the district court.\u201d Katir v. Columbia Univ., </em>15 F.3d 23, 25 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Indeed, the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s grant of summary judgment must be examined independently of the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Harrods Ltd. v. Sixty Internet Domain Names, </em>302 F.3d 214, 242 (4th Cir. 2002). This court\u2019s \u201creview is limited to the record presented to the district court at the time of summary judgment. ... [This court] likewise do[es] not rely on evidence introduced at trial or on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Lippi v. City Bank, </em>955 F.2d 599, 604 (9th Cir. 1992). \u201cNeither the evidence offered subsequently at the trial nor the verdict is relevant.\u201d <em>Voutour v. Vitale, </em>761 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">II. The New York State Human Rights Law</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b311-17\">\u201cAs a general matter, it is unlawful in [New York] for any public or private em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ployer to deny any license or employment application \u2018by reason of the individual\u2019s having been previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Acosta v. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>16 N.Y.3d 309, 314, 921 N.Y.S.2d 633, 946 N.E.2d 731 (2011) (quoting N.Y. Correct. Law \u00a7 752). \u201cThis general bar was enacted to further certain goals that the Legislature has identified as among the \u2018general purposes\u2019 of the Penal Law, hamely, \u2018the rehabilitation of those convicted\u2019 and \u2018the promotion of their successful and productive reentry and reintegration into society.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 921 N.Y.S.2d 633, 946 N.E.2d 731 (quoting NYSHRL \u00a7 296). The statute provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5p\">[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person, agency, bureau, corporation or association, including the state and any political subdivision thereof, to deny any license or employment to any individual by reason of his or her having been convicted of one or more criminal offenses, or by reason of a finding of a lack of \u201cgood moral character\u201d which is based upon his or her having been convicted of one or more criminal offenses, when such denial is in violation of the provisions of article twenty-three-A of the correction law. Further, there shall be a rebuttable presumption in favor of excluding from evidence the prior incarceration or conviction of any 'person, in a case alleging that the employer has been negligent in hiring or retaining an applicant or employee, or supervising a hiring manager, if after learning about an applicant or employee\u2019s past criminal conviction history, such employer has evaluated the factors set forth in section seven hundred fifty-two of the correction law, and made a reasonable, good faith determination that such factors -militate in favor of hire or retention of that applicant or employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296(15). There are, however, two significant exceptions to this general prohibition. The first exception arises where \u201cthere is a direct relationship between one or more of the previous criminal offenses and the specific license or employment sought or held by the individual.\u201d N.Y. Correct. Law \u00a7 752(1). The Legislature has clarified that a \u201c \u2018[d]irect relationship\u2019 means that the nature of criminal conduct for which the person was convicted has a direct bearing on his fitness or ability to perform one or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the license, opportunity, or job in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 750(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The second exception allows for adverse treatment where \u201cthe issuance or continuation of the license or the granting or continuation of the employment would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 752(2). The New York Court of Appeals has \u201cnoted that the Legislature has not provided a statutory definition of the phrase \u2018unreasonable risk\u2019 in this context \u2018for the obvious reason that a finding of unreasonable risk depends upon a subjective analysis of a variety of considerations relating to the nature of the license or employment sought and the prior misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Acosta, </em>16 N.Y.3d at 315, 921 N.Y.S.2d 633, 946 N.E.2d 731 (quoting <em>In </em>re <em>Bonacorsa v. Van Lindt, </em>71 N.Y.2d 605, 612, 528 N.Y.S.2d 519, 523 N.E.2d 806 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Although the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d analysis under the second exception is a subjective one, Section 753(1) of the Correction Law provides that, \u201c[i]n making a determination\u201d as to whether either the \u201cdirect relationship\u201d exception or the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d exception applies, \u201cthe public agency or private employer shall consider\u201d the following eight factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>(a) The public policy of [New York], as expressed in this act, to encourage the licensure and employment of persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">(b) The specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the license or employment sought or held by the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">(c) The bearing, if any, the criminal offense or offenses for which the person was previously convicted will have on his fitness or ability to perform one or more such duties or responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">(d) The time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">(e) The age of the person at the time of occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">(f) The seriousness of the offense or offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">(g) Any information produced by the person, or produced on his behalf, in regard to his rehabilitation and good conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">(h) The legitimate interest of the public agency or private employer in protecting property, and the safety and welfare of specific individuals or the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">N.Y. Correct. Law. \u00a7 753(1). \u201cA failure to take into consideration each of these factors results in a failure to comply with the Correction Law\u2019s mandatory directive.\u201d <em>Acosta, </em>16 N.Y.3d at 316, 921 N.Y.S.2d 633, 946 N.E.2d 731 (citing <em>In re Arrocha v. Bd. of Educ. of City of </em>N.Y., 93 N.Y.2d 361, 364, 690 N.Y.S.2d 503, 712 N.E.2d 669 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">While there is a considerable body of law interpreting the NYSHRL by both state and federal courts, few cases have addressed the provisions at issue in this case. The district court held that Allied and Sirva cannot be liable under the NYSHRL in this case because they were not Griffin and Godwin\u2019s \u201cemployers.\u201d However, we find there are three problems with this determination because of open and unresolved questions of New York State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">First, it is unclear whether Section 296(15) is strictly limited to \u201cemployers.\u201d The district court inferred that to \u201c \u2018deny employment,\u2019 the denying entity must be an employer as understood by the caselaw interpreting the NYSHRL.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>2014 WL 2434196, at *11. While the New York Court of Appeals may interpret the statute in this manner, we cannot say that this interpretation is obviously dictated by the statute\u2019s language or existing case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">Second, even if Section 296(15) is limited to \u201cemployers,\u201d that does not resolve the question of the scope of the term \u201cemployer.\u201d \u201cThe Human Rights Law definition of employer [refers] only to the number of persons employed[.]\u201d <em>Patrowich v. Chem. Bank, </em>63 N.Y.2d 541, 543, 483 N.Y.S.2d 659, 473 N.E.2d 11 (1984) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7292(5). While New York courts have provided balancing tests to determine whether an entity is an \u201cemployer,\u201d they have not applied those tests to Section 296(15). There is also reason to believe that the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d could be broader in the context of Section 296(15). For example, in most cases it is unlikely that a New York company would be bound by a contractual term to apply a policy that explicitly discriminates on the basis of race or sex. But in this case, the agency contract explicitly required Astro to discriminate on the basis of prior criminal convictions. Thus, Section 296(15) may be distinguishable from other provisions of the NYSHRL having to do with discrimination on the basis of race or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>sex, and may well require a broader definition of \u201cemployer\u201d to effectuate its prohibition against discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Third, the NYSHRL also provides for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d liability. <em>See </em>N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296(6). We have found no New York State case law applying this provision to Section 296(15). It is possible that an agency contract, such as the one at issue in this case, could fall within the ambit of aiding and abetting liability under Section 296(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\n<em>i. Whether the Statutory Provision is Expressly Limited to \u201cEmployers\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Griffin and Godwin argue that because \u00a7 296(15) on its face is not limited to employers, \u201cit is not necessary for Griffin and Godwin to prove that SIRVA and ALLIED were their employers.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 14. For their part, Alied and Sirva claim that Section 296(15) \u201conly applies to employers.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 18. While the word \u201cemployer\u201d appears nowhere in the first half of the provision, which addresses discrimination on the basis of a conviction, the word is used twice in the second half of the provision addressing negligent hiring practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Athough Sirva and Alied insist that the \u201crepeated use of the term \u2018employer\u2019 \u201d in Section 296(15) \u201cleaves no doubt that its discrimination provisions apply only to employers,\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 19, we find this argument unpersuasive absent definitive case law from New York State courts. The second half of this provision addresses an entirely different subject matter than the first portion. In fact, that the term is used twice in the second half of the provision makes its absence in the first half addressing discrimination even more glaring.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Sirva and Alied also suggest that a limitation to \u201cemployers\u201d can be inferred because \u201conly an employer can \u2018deny employment,\u2019 \u201d a position the district court adopted. <em>See Griffin, </em>2014 WL 2434196, at *11. Further, Sirva and Alied point to Section 753 of the New York State Correction Law, incorporated by reference in Section 296(15), which states that \u201c[i]n making a determination pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-two of this chapter, the public agency or <em>private employer </em>shall consider\u201d the eight relevant factors. N.Y. Correct. Law \u00a7 753(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Griffin and Godwin respond that the \u201cdrafters of the Executive Law provision here, ... took great pains precisely to avoid limitation of the law\u2019s applicability to employers.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 9. They contend that other sections of the NYSHRL demonstrate this legislative intent. For example, the provision barring employment discrimination on the basis of age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status, and domestic violence victim status, is expressly limited to an \u201cemployer or licensing agency.\u201d N.Y. Exec. Law . \u00a7 296(l)(a). Similarly, the prohibition on discrimination in training programs applies only to an \u201cemployer, labor organization, employment agency or any joint labor-management committee controlling apprentice training programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7296(1-a).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Neither party cites convincing New York State legal authority to support their claims. Absent clear authority in the precedents of the New York State Court of Appeals, we conclude it is appropriate to certify these questions to that Court, respectfully further guidance on these questions of New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">\n<em>ii. The Scope of the term \u201cEmployer\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">Even if we were to decide that \u00a7 296(15) is strictly limited to the aggrieved party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u201cemployer,\u201d we would still have to decide the scope of the term \u201cemployer.\u201d State courts have held that \u201c[gjenerally, four elements are considered in determining whether the relationship of employer and employee exists: \u201c(1) the selection and engagement of the servant; (2) the payment of salary or wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the power of control of the servant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>State Div. of Human Rights v. GTE Corp., </em>109 A.D.2d 1082, 487 N.Y.S.2d 234, 235 (4th Dep\u2019t 1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts have often stressed that the \u201creally essential element of the relationship is the right of control, that is, the right of one person, the master, to order and control another, the servant, in the performance of work by the latter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The district court seems to have relied on this factor-based analysis in its determination that Allied and Sirva were not Griffin and Godwin\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d The district court concluded that Allied and Sirva \u201chad no employment relationship\u201d with Griffin and Godwin and did not have \u201cany ownership interest in Astro.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>2014 WL 2434196, at *12. The district court also found that Sirva and Allied did not have any other \u201cliability-engendering authority over Plaintiffs\u201d such as (1) the power to hire and fire employees, (2) supervision and control of employee work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determination of the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintenance of employment records. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the district court observed that according to Thomas Lambert, the Director of Agency Services at Allied, \u201cAllied did not instruct Astro to terminate Griffin\u2019s or Godwin\u2019s employment[,] and no one had any advance notice of the termination of their employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *13. Finally, the district court noted that Astro could have simply moved Griffin and Godwin off of Allied jobs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">But these factors have been taken into account by courts when addressing whether an <em>individual </em>is liable under other provisions of the NYSHRL. In <em>Patrowich v. Chemical Bank, </em>the New York Court of Appeals held that an individual is not subject to suit under \u00a7 296 of the NYSHRL as an employer unless he \u201cha[s] an ownership interest\u201d in the employer or if the individual has \u201cthe power to do more than carry out personnel decisions made by others.\u201d 63 N.Y.2d at 542, 483 N.Y.S.2d 659, 473 N.E.2d 11. Many cases relied on by the district court in its analysis applied this standard. <em>See e.g., Tomka v. Seiler Corp., </em>66 F.3d 1295, 1317 (2d Cir. 1995) (an individual may not be hable \u201cif he is not shown to have any ownership interest or any power to do more than carry out personnel decisions made by others.\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998); <em>Scalera v. Electrograph Sys., Inc., </em>848 F.Supp.2d 352, 371 (E.D.N.Y. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">But it is not clear that the factors relevant to individual liability under the NYSHRL should control or whether other factors might merit consideration where, as here, the question is whether liability may be imposed on another corporation that has simply a contractual relationship with the employing company. The Court of Appeals does not appear to have addressed the scope of the term \u201cemployer\u201d in these circumstances. <em>See Kaiser v. Raoul\u2019s Rest. Corp., </em>72 A.D.3d 539, 899 N.Y.S.2d 210, 211 (1st Dep\u2019t 2010) (\u201cIn the more than 25 years since <em>Patrowich, </em>the Court of Appeals has not again had occasion to construe the definition of \u2018employer\u2019 under the Human Rights Law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">When determining whether an individual falls under the \u201ccontrol\u201d prong, courts have frequently applied the so-called \u201ceco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>nomic realities\u201d test, balancing \u201cwhether the alleged employer (1) had the power to hire and fire employees, (2) supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained employment records.\u201d <em>Herman v. RSR Sec. Servs. Ltd., </em>172 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 1999). Individuals may be held liable if they \u201cactually participate[ ] in the conduct giving rise to a discrimination claim[.]\u201d <em>Tomka, </em>66 F.3d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The district court assumed that \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff seeks to sue an additional defendant, other than a direct employer, and that additional defendant is a business, courts have also applied the four economic realities factors to determine whether the two companies are \u2018joint employers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin, </em>2014 WL 2434196, at *13. To support this proposition, the district court relied on <em>Voltaire v. Home Servs. Sys., Inc., </em>823 F.Supp.2d 77, 96 (E.D.N.Y. 2011). But <em>Voltaire </em>assumed the application of the economic realities factors because \u201cboth parties\u2019 submissions state[d] that these factors [were] applicable to both NYSHRL and NYCHRL cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97. Further, the district court here makes no distinction between the \u201cjoint employer\u201d doctrine and the \u201csingle employer\u201d doctrine, both of which have been utilized by courts in this circuit in discrimination cases brought against a business that is not the plaintiffs \u201cdirect employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The joint employer doctrine, along with the \u201csingle employer\u201d (or \u201csingle integrated employer\u201d) doctrines \u201chave been developed to allow a plaintiff to assert employer liability in the employment discrimination context against entities that are not her formal, direct employer.\u201d <em>Barbosa v. Continuum Health Partners, Inc., </em>716 F.Supp.2d 210, 216 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); <em>see also Arculeo v. On-Site Sales &amp; Marketing, LLC, </em>425 F.3d 193, 197 (2d Cir. 2005). \u201cA \u2018single employer\u2019 situation exists \u2018where two nominally separate entities are actually part of a single integrated enterprise ....\u2019\u201d <em>Clinton\u2019s Ditch Coop. Co. v. NLRB, </em>778 F.2d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 1985) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Pa., Inc., </em>691 F.2d 1117, 1122 (3d Cir. 1982)). In contrast, a \u201cjoint employer\u201d relationship involves separate legal entities that \u201chandle certain aspects of their employer-employee relationship jointly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u201cThe single employer doctrine provides that, \u2018in appropriate circumstances, an employee, who is technically employed on the books of one entity, which is deemed to be part of a larger single-employer entity, may impose liability for certain violations of employment law not only on the nominal employer but also on another entity comprising part of the single integrated employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fowler v. Scores Holding Co., </em>677 F.Supp.2d 673, 681 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (quoting <em>Arculeo, </em>425 F.3d at 198).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">To determine whether two separate entities should be considered a single employer for the purposes of employment discrimination claims, courts have relied on four considerations: (1) interrelation of operations; (2) centralized control of labor relations; (3) common management; and (4) common ownership or financial control. <em>See Cook v. Arrowsmith Shelburne, Inc., </em>69 F.3d 1235, 1240 (2d Cir. 1995). \u201cAlthough no one factor is determinative ... control of labor relations is the central concern.\u201d <em>Murray v. Miner, </em>74 F.3d 402, 404 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u201cThe joint employer doctrine applies where there is no single integrated enterprise, but where two employers \u2018handle certain aspects of their employer-employee relationship jointly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fowler, </em>677 F.Supp.2d at 681 (quoting <em>Arculeo, </em>425 F.3d at 198). For example, \u201c[a]n employee formally employed by one entity can be found to be constructively employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>another entity, and thus may impose liability for violations of employment law on the constructive employer.\u201d <em>Id.; see also NLRB v. Solid Waste Servs., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 93, 94 (2d Cir. 1994) (\u201cA joint employer relationship may be found to exist where there is sufficient evidence that the respondent had immediate control over the other company\u2019s employees.\u201d). The doctrine is drawn in part from express language in the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), which provides that separate and distinct entities with separate owners may be \u201cjoint employers under the FMLA if they \u2018jointly exercise some control over the work or working conditions of the employee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Voltaire, </em>823 F.Supp.2d at 96 (quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.106(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The district court made no apparent attempt to distinguish analytically the \u201cjoint employer\u201d doctrine from the \u201csingle employer\u201d doctrine. Both have been applied by courts in this circuit when considering discrimination claims against businesses that are not the plaintiffs \u201cdirect employer.\u201d But whether one or the other (or both) applies to the NYSHRL, especially Section 296(15), remains unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\n<em>Hi The Applicability of the \u201cAiding and Abetting\u201d Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Finally, we do not believe New York case law is settled on whether the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d provision of the NYSHRL, \u00a7 296(6), is applicable to the facts of this case. The district court determined that the \u201cjoint employer\u201d doctrine also applies when a plaintiff is seeking \u201caiding and abetting\u201d liability of \u201can additional defendant, other than a direct employer, and that additional defendant is a business.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>2014 WL 2434196, at *12. We cannot say this is obviously the case. The provision that gives rise to aiding and abetting liability provides that it is \u201can unlawful discriminatory practice for any person to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden ... or to attempt to do so.\u201d N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296(6). At least where the alleged aider and abettor is an individual employee of the corporate employer, we have held that this provision requires that the alleged aider and abettor \u201c \u2018actually participated in the conduct giving rise to the claim of discrimination,\u2019 and that the \u2018aider and abettor share the intent or purpose of the principal actor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Idlisan v. N.Y.S. Dep\u2019t of Taxation &amp; Fin., </em>No. 12-CV-1787 MAD/CFH, 2013 WL 2898050, at *4-5 (N.D.N.Y. June 13, 2013) (quoting <em>Robles v. Goddard Riverside Cmty. Ctr., </em>No. 08-CV-4856, 2009 WL 1704627, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2009)); <em>see also Tomka, </em>66 F.3d at 1317 (\u201cA defendant who actually participates in the conduct giving rise to a discrimination claim may be held personally liable under the [NYS]HRL.\u201d). Again, we see reason to think that New York might construe this provision differently when the liability of a corporation that contracts with the employing corporate defendant is at issue: different considerations may be relevant. Further, even if the standards are similar or the- same for the individual co-employee and the contracting corporate defendant, we think it would be an odd result to hold that a defendant business that \u201cactually participate^] in the conduct giving rise to a discrimination claim,\u201d may be liable only if it is the defendant\u2019s \u201cdirect employer\u201d or if it also satisfies the \u201cjoint employer\u201d doctrine. The district court fails to explain why such a result is dictated by the text of the NYSHRL or existing New York State case law. As with respect to the prior two questions, the law is unsettled on the applicability of Section 296(6) to Section 296(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Before we certify a question to the Court of Appeals, \u201cwe must answer three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>others: (1) whether the New York Court of Appeals has addressed the issue and, if not, whether the decisions of other New York courts permit us to predict how the Court of Appeals would' resolve it; (2) whether the question is of importance to the state and may require value judgments and public policy choices; and (3) whether the certified question is determinative of a claim before us.\u201d <em>Osterweil v. Bartlett, </em>706 F.3d 139, 142 (2d Cir. 2013), (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>certified question accepted, </em>20 N.Y.3d 1058, 961 N.Y.S.2d 832, 985 N.E.2d 428 (2013), <em>and certified question answered, </em>21 N.Y.3d 580, 977 N.Y.S.2d 153, 999 N.E.2d 516 (2013). In this case, the answer to each suggests that certification is appropriate.. First, as discussed above, New York courts have not determined who may be liable under \u00a7 296(15), or addressed the scope \u00a7 296(6) when the alleged aider and abettor is not an individual. Second, the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of prior criminal convictions reflects the New York Legislature\u2019s important policy goal of promoting \u201csuccessful and productive reintegration into society.\u201d <em>See Acosta, </em>16 N.Y.3d at 314, 921 N.Y.S.2d 633, 946 N.E.2d 731 (internal quotation marks omitted). The question of who may be held liable for violating that prohibition will have a substantial effect on how that goal is realized. Finally, the outcome of this appeal will depend \u00f3n the answers to the certified questions. If \u00a7 296(15) applies only to \u201cdirect \u201cemployers, and \u00a7296(6) does not permit aiding and abetting liability in these circumstances, Griffin and God-win\u2019s claims against Allied and Sirva fail as a matter of law. On the other hand, if Griffin and Godwin can assert their claims against Allied and Sirva, the district court\u2019s order must be vacated and their cases allowed to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Accordingly, and pursuant to New York Court of Appeals Rule 500.27 and Local Rule 27.2 of this Court, we certify the following three questions to the New York Court of Appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">(1) Does Section 296(15) of the New York State Human Rights Law, prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of a criminal conviction, limit liability to an aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">(2) If Section 295(15) is limited to an aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer,\u201d what is the scope of the term \u201cemployer\u201d for these purposes, <em>ie. </em>does it include an employer who is not the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cdirect employer,\u201d but who, through an agency relationship or other means, exercises a significant level of control over the discrimination policies and practices of the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cdirect employer\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">(3) Does Section 296(6) of the New York State Human Rights Law, providing for aiding and abetting liability, apply to \u00a7 296(15) such that an out-of-state principal corporation that requires its New York State agent to discriminate in employment on the basis of a criminal conviction may be held liable for the employer\u2019s violation of \u00a7 296(15)?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In certifying these questions, we do not bind the Court of Appeals to the particular questions stated. Rather, the Court of Appeals may expand these certified inquiries to address any further question of New York law as might be relevant to the particular circumstances presented in this appeal. This panel will resume its consideration of this appeal after the disposition of this certification by the New York Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">It is hereby ORDERED that the Clerk of Court transmit to the Clerk of the New York Court of Appeals this opinion as our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>certif\u00edcate, together with a complete set of the briefs, the appendix, and the record filed in this Court by the parties. The parties shall bear equally any fees and costs that may be imposed by the New York Court of Appeals in connection with this certification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">. There is some dispute in the record regarding whether Griffin was actually \"terminated\" or whether he voluntarily resigned. For the purposes of this opinion, we assume, without deciding, that Griffin was terminated because of his criminal conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-14\">.
