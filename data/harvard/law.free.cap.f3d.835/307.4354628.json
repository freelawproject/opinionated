During the trial, the Government introduced a gun that an officer of the New York City Police Department (\u201cNYPD\u201d) found while searching Cunningham\u2019s car during a traffic stop. The primary issue we consider is whether the search violated the Fourth Amendment. Citing Michigan v. Long, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Sullivan, J.) determined after a hearing on Cunningham\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the gun that the officers possessed \u201ca reasonable belief based on \u2018specific and articulable facts\u2019 ... that the suspect [was] dangerous and the suspect [might] gain immediate control of weapons,\u201d entitling them to conduct the search. 463 U.S. 1032, 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983) (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Appeals based on the Fourth Amendment from denied motions to suppress evidence of illegal weapons or contraband (drugs, etc.) are often difficult because the Government is in a sense proven right. Whatever prompted the search (a hunch, suspicion, luck, reasonable belief, or probable cause), incriminating evidence was found. The urge to defer to the assessment of the district judge, particularly one as knowledgeable and experienced as Judge Sullivan, only intensifies our difficulty, as does a set of facts implicating officer safety. On the record here, though, we are persuaded that the events identified as leading to the search of Cunningham\u2019s car and recovery of the gun introduced as evidence at trial are, without more, not enough to justify a full protective search of the passenger compartment of a car based on immediate danger to the officers involved or to others. We therefore REVERSE and REMAND to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">At trial the Government proved that Cunningham participated in a robbery conspiracy. It offered compelling evidence that a co-conspirator, Fahd Hussain, routinely identified potential robbery targets to Bronx-based robbery crews. After receiving Hussain\u2019s tip, the crews robbed the targets and sent Hussain the non-cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>proceeds to convert into cash. Cunningham belonged to a robbery crew composed of black Jamaicans.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">We do not consider in the abstract whether Cunningham\u2019s crew was dangerous and violent. It undoubtedly was. In one robbery in October 2011 (described by the Government at trial as the \u201csnowy day robbery\u201d), for example, Cunningham and fellow crew members Jermaine Dore and Dwayne Barrett kidnapped Ahmed Salahi, eventually stealing $15,000 from Salahi\u2019s home. During the robbery, Cunningham held Salahi hostage with a knife. Salahi testified that Cunningham then grabbed a gun and pointed it at Salahi\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The central issue on appeal is whether the District Court should have suppressed evidence of a loaded gun seized by the police as a result of a search of Cunningham\u2019s car and introduced as evidence during Cunningham\u2019s trial. At the suppression hearing the District Court credited the NYPD officers\u2019 description of the car stop and subsequent search, and we accept their description as true for the purpose of resolving Cunningham\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The car search occurred at around 10:30 pm on December 26, 2011, a few months after the Salahi robbery. Cunningham was driving a Nissan Maxima in the Bronx with another crew' member, Lacey Scott. They were on their way to commit a robbery based on yet another tip from Hus-sain. NYPD Officers McAloon and Mauds-ley were driving in an unmarked police car just behind Cunningham\u2019s Maxima for some time, but at first neither officer noticed \u201canything unusual about the car.\u201d While driving at a \u201cnormal rate of speed,\u201d Cunningham illegally ran a stop sign in front of the officers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer McAloon turned on the police car\u2019s lights and sirens. Cunningham drove for about \u201chalf the block\u201d or between \u201cfive to ten seconds\u201d on a road where cars were parked on both sides of the street. He finally pulled over to what appears to have been an open spot next to the curb in the middle of the block.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Joint App\u2019x 119. Thereafter, Officers McAloon and Maudsley testified based on their different vantage points of the stop and search, which we recount below.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">As the Maxima slowed to a stop, Officer McAloon observed Cunningham\u2019s arm move up and down in the middle console area. Supp. App\u2019x 110. Officer McAloon then got out of the police car, approached the driver\u2019s side of Cunningham\u2019s car, and saw Cunningham with a cellphone \u201cin his [right] hand up to the side of his head.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 112. Officer McAloon asked Cunningham to put down the phone, but Cunningham didn\u2019t immediately respond. Officer McAloon then asked Cunningham to \u201cproduce his license and registration.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 113. Cunningham again failed to respond immediately. After Officer McAloon asked again for his license and registration, Cunningham \u201cstarted fumbling around the center console and then ... reached for the glove compartment.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 113-15. At that point, Officer McAloon, fearing for his safety, ordered Cunningham out of the car. This time, Cunningham listened and got out of the car right away. Officer McAloon asked him if he had any weapons. Cunningham responded that he had a knife in his pocket. Joint App\u2019x 109. Officer McAloon then frisked Cunningham, recovered a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>pocketknife with a two- or three-inch blade from Cunningham\u2019s pocket, and said \u201cknife\u201d out loud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Joint App\u2019x 143; Supp. App\u2019x 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">After recovering the pocketknife, Officer McAloon directed Cunningham to move to the back of the Maxima where, as described below, Officer Maudsley and Scott were already located. Cunningham walked to the back of the Maxima without handcuffs. At trial, Officer McAloon explained that he saw \u201cno need to handcuff\u2019 Cunningham because \u201c[i]n [his] experience ... [Cunningham] was being compliant and he indicated he had a weapon, so I brought him to the back of the car. There was no need to handcuff him at that time.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 520. After directing Cunningham to the back of the car and without speaking to Officer Maudsley, Officer McAloon immediately returned to the driver\u2019s side of the car, searched it, and recovered the loaded gun at issue in this case underneath the front passenger seat, where Scott had been sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We turn next to the testimony of Officer Maudsley. As Officer McAloon approached the driver\u2019s side of Cunningham\u2019s car, Officer Maudsley approached the passenger side where Scott was sitting. From behind the car, Officer Maudsley initially saw Cunningham move his right arm in the center console area and pick up a smart-phone. Supp. App\u2019x 22-23 (\u201cThe right arm moves up and down from the middle area and it comes back up with what appears to be an iPhone and it moved back down out of the sight and back up again several times.\u201d). As Officer Maudsley moved to the side of the car, he saw that Scott\u2019s hands were \u201cin plain view and [ ] did not move\u201d while his shoulder \u201cprotrude[d]\u201d into the console area from the passenger side. Supp. App\u2019x 22-23, 49. Officer Maudsley described Scott as sitting in an \u201cunnatural\u201d position that suggested Scott was trying to obstruct the officers\u2019 view of the car interi- or. Specifically, Officer Maudsley testified, the \u201cleft portion of [Scott\u2019s] body was too far left into the middle area where you would not be seated. The left shoulder was moved towards the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and the body was canted where the left hip was slightly rotated in an upward position.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 31. There is no evidence in the record that Officer Maudsley conveyed what he saw (that is, Scott sitting in an \u201cunnatural position\u201d) to Officer McAloon before the latter started to search the Maxima. At some point, Officer Maudsley heard Officer McAloon say \u201cknife,\u201d whereupon Officer Maudsley opened the passenger side door and told Scott to get out of the car. Scott complied. Officer Maudsley frisked Scott and found nothing. He then escorted Scott, without handcuffs, to the back of the Maxima. Joint App\u2019x 90-91; Supp. App\u2019x 55. As described above, Cunningham soon joined Scott at the back of the car. Both men faced away from the Maxima toward Officer Maudsley while Officer McAloon searched the passenger compartment of the car. Neither officer called for backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">As Officer McAloon continued his search, Cunningham started to fidget and repeatedly looked back over his shoulder. Officer McAloon then said \u201clunch,\u201d a code word the officers used to signify the presence of a firearm. At that point, Scott ran. Apparently, \u201clunch\u201d meant something to him too. Scott was eventually caught, and both he and Cunningham were arrested. The Maxima was later subjected to a standard inventory search at the police pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>cinct, where the police found duct tape and gloves in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The indictment charged Cunningham with participating in a robbery conspiracy (Count One) and using and carrying firearms' during and in relation to the robbery conspiracy (Count Two). After two suppression hearings (one for Scott, who was also indicted, and another for Cunningham), the District Court ruled that Officer McAloon\u2019s warrantless search of the Maxi-ma was lawful under the officer safety exception set forth in Michigan v. Long. Joint App\u2019x 165-70. It separately' ruled that the duct tape and gloves found in the trunk of the Maxima as a result of the inventory search were admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery, since the car was the subject of an inventory search once the gun was found and Cunningham and Scott were arrested. Joint App\u2019x 169-70. The District Court declined to consider the Government\u2019s alternative argument that Officer McAloon could have searched the car initially based on probable cause to believe that the car contained evidence of contraband. Joint App\u2019x at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">At trial, the Government introduced into evidence the gun that Officer McAloon recovered during the December traffic stop. The jury found Cunningham guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">At the outset, we briefly address Cunningham\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the gun charge (Count Two). To prevail in his challenge, Cunningham needed to show that no \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d United States v. Aguilar, 585 F.3d 652, 656 (2d Cir. 2009). At trial, Salahi testified that a masked robber initially held him down with a knife then grabbed a gun from his confederate and pointed it at Salahi\u2019s head, demanding that Salahi reveal where his money was hidden.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taylor testified that Cunningham la,-ter confided that he held a victim hostage at knifepoint. The jury could well and reasonably infer from this evidence that Cunningham actually possessed the gun after holding the knife.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial evidence was therefore clearly sufficient to support Cunningham\u2019s conviction when considering the trial evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Cunningham\u2019s main argument, of course, is not about the sufficiency of the evidence against him. It is that the District Court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence of the gun (and, therefore, the duct tape and gloves) recovered by the officers during the traffic stop. In an appeal from a suppression decision, we review the district court\u2019s legal rulings, including its reasonable suspicion determination, de novo, see United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 275, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); United States v. Stew<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>art, 551 F.3d 187, 190-91 (2d Cir. 2009), and its factual findings for clear error, \u201cgiving special deference to findings that are based on determinations of witness credibility,\u201d United States v. Lucky, 569 F.3d 101, 106 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In Michigan v. Long, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u2019 the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\u201d 463 U.S. at 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)); see id. at 1051, 103 5.Ct. 3469 (\u201c[T]he balancing required by Terry clearly weighs in favor of allowing the police to conduct an area search of the passenger compartment to uncover weapons, as long as they possess an articulable and objectively reasonable belief that the suspect is potentially dangerous.\u201d). \u201cReasonable suspicion requires more than \u2018inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Elmore, 482 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 2007) (emphasis added) (quoting Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 329, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)). Police \u201cmust be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion [on a citizen\u2019s liberty interest].\u201d Id. at 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u201cLike probable cause, reasonable suspicion is determined based on the totality of the circumstances but \u2018the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 179 (quoting Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 273-74, 122 S.Ct. 744). Fundamentally, then, we consider \u201cwhether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d Long, 463 U.S. at 1050, 103 S.Ct. 3469. A suspect \u201cmay gain\u201d control over a weapon in a car both when the police have restrained him and after he is let go and permitted to get back in the car.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id. at 1049, 1051-52, 103 S.Ct. 3469.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Long\u2019s requirement of present dangerousness is based on the premise set forth in Terry that the search must be genuinely protective. Where the search has a purely evidentiary rather than protective purpose, a protective search is inappropriate and Long is inapplicable. In those circumstances we demand a warrant (or some other exception to the warrant requirement). See id. at 1046, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (noting that \u201c[i]n Terry, the Court examined the validity of a \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 in the absence of probable cause and a warrant\u201d); Terry, 392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (\u201cSuffice it to note that [a protective] search, unlike a search ... incident to a lawful arrest, is not justified by any need to prevent the disappearance or destruction of evidence of crime.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"Ag5\">Cunningham first argues that the District Court \u201cconflated the elements of Long\u2019s two-factor test\u201d by considering only whether the police had an articulable suspicion that there was a weapon in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>car. We are not persuaded. In fact, the District Court considered both dangerousness and access to .weapons. It first concluded that the police officers reasonably suspected that Cunningham was dangerous because he was carrying a knife. It then determined that the circumstances surrounding the car stop justified a reasonable suspicion that Cunningham and Scott had access to weapons inside the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">But discerning whether the District Court considered both factors under Long is the start, not the end, of our analysis. The more difficult question is whether it did so properly to determine that the officers reasonably suspected that Cunningham and Scott posed an immediate danger \u2014 that is, whether its holding.is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In arriving at its conclusion that the officers reasonably suspected that the men posed such a danger, the parties agree, the District Court highlighted three central facts: first, Officer Maudsley saw Cunningham move his arm toward the center console of the car; second, Officer Maudsley observed Scott seated in an \u201cunnatural\u201d position that appeared designed to block the officer\u2019s view of the inside of the car; and third, Officer McAloon recovered a knife from Cunningham. It is worth quoting the District Court\u2019s precise description of these facts on which it relied to deny Cunningham\u2019s motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">First, upon approaching the vehicle, Officer Maudsley saw the defendant move his arm towards the center console area of the car. Second, Officer Maudsley observed that Scott\u2019s body was in an unnatural position as if covering something up or hiding something. Third, when Officer McAloon frisked the defendant, he found a knife on him and I think there was also testimony that defendant acknowledged that he had a knife. Behavior suggesting that a vehicle\u2019s occupants are trying to conceal a weapon and then the discovery of an actual weapon on one of those occupants is, in my mind, sufficient to create an articula-ble suspicion that the vehicle [may] contain a weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Joint App\u2019x at 168. We would add to the District Court\u2019s list of central facts Cunningham\u2019s refusal to immediately comply with the officer\u2019s instruction to put down his phone. See United States v. Paulino, 850 F.2d 93, 95- 97 (2d Cir. 1988) (upholding search for weapons under car floor mat after defendant was observed making furtive movement in that direction).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">We ultimately agree with Cunningham that the officers did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger justifying the search of Cunningham\u2019s car as protective, as Long requires. But our agreement with Cunningham on this dis-positive point should not be misunderstood. We have no reason to doubt that each of the officers subjectively suspected that Cunningham and Scott were hiding something and up to no good. And the circumstances of the traffic stop may well have supported a \u201chunch\u201d \u2014 one that was soon confirmed when Officer McAloon found the gun. We also think (and Cunningham does not seriously dispute) that the officers had a basis for asking Cunningham and Scott to step out of the ear. As the Supreme Court explained in Knowles v. Iowa, \u201cthe concern for officer safety\u201d exists even \u201cin the case of a routine traffic stop.\u201d Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U.S. 113, 117-18, 119 S.Ct. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">\u201cBut while the concern for officer safety in this context may justify the \u2018minimal\u2019 additional intrusion of ordering a driver and passengers out of the car, it does not by itself justify the often considerably greater intrusion attending a full field-type search.\u201d Id. In this case, the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>facts articulated by the officers fail to demonstrate that their fear of immediate danger was objectively reasonable so as to justify a full field-type search of Cunningham\u2019s car. Part of our trouble is that stops fitting the same fact pattern (but, say, different passengers of another race, gender, or ethnicity) would, we think, rarely if ever lead the police to suspect the passengers posed an immediate danger and justify a protective search of the passenger compartment. Put another way, allowing a protective search on these bare facts would sweep too broadly. Whatever extra fact prompted Officers McAloon and Maudsley to harbor a suspicion of dangerousness that we might accept as reasonable, it was left unsaid on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We explain our decision in more detail by referring to the specific facts to which the officers pointed and on which the District Court relied in denying Cunningham\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">As an initial matter, the District Court relied on the fact that Officer Maudsley observed Cunningham\u2019s right arm move toward the console area. But Officer Maudsley testified that Cunningham had what appeared to be a smartphone in his right hand when he made those movements. And Officer McAloon confirmed that Cunningham already had a smart-phone in his right hand by the time Officer McAloon approached the driver side of the Maxima. We recognize that it is the totality of the facts and unfolding events that matter. But we are hard pressed to see how a driver in a high crime area in the Bronx (or anywhere else, for that matter) moving his right arm and hand around the center console to retrieve a smartphone can reasonably suggest that danger lurks any more than a suburban father or mother reaching for a smartphone from the center console after a traffic stop to call a spouse or relative could be considered dangerous. This case is therefore distinguishable from Paulino, where the defendant was observed \u201cin the back seat moving his torso and bending over as if placing an object on the floor,\u201d but \u201cthe officer was unable to see [the defendant\u2019s] hands or the object.\u201d 850 F.2d at 94. Here, one of the officers was able to see that the defendant was holding a smartphone in the hand that had been moving and continued moving, and the other officer confirmed that the defendant had a smartphone, not a weapon, in his hand when the officer approached the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Next, we consider Cunningham\u2019s failure to immediately comply with the initial directions of the officer during the stop\u2014 although, again, the District Court did not explicitly rely on this evidence in denying the motion to suppress. As we have explained, it took Cunningham \u201cfive to ten seconds\u201d to stop after the officers turned on their patrol car lights and siren. Cunningham failed to put down his phone as soon as Officer McAloon asked him to do so. And when Officer McAloon asked Cunningham to \u201cproduce his license and registration,\u201d Cunningham again failed to respond right away. It was only after Officer McAloon asked again for his license and registration that Cunningham \u201cstarted fumbling around the center console and then ... reached for the glove compartment.\u201d We do not mean to minimize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>actual danger that police officers face every day. Cunningham\u2019s delayed responses at the early stages of his encounter with the police officers may have raised various suspicions- \u2014 -that he could not understand them, that he was not licensed to drive, that he was under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, that he was hiding contraband, and so on. But the officers did not point to any other specific facts suggesting that Cunningham\u2019s failure immediately to comply with Officer McAloon\u2019s commands justified a reasonable suspicion that he or Scott was dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Nor are we persuaded by the additional fact that Scott was seated in an \u201cunnatural\u201d position in the passenger seat. As noted above, Officer Maudsley described Scott\u2019s position in some detail. Among other things, he testified that Scott was sitting \u201cunnaturally]\u201d close to the middle area of the Maxima, where Officer Maudsley had just seen Cunningham holding a smartphone. That may have been enough to believe that Scott sought to hide something. But insofar as dangerousness is the sole focus of our attention under Long, Scott\u2019s position by itself sheds insufficient light on whether he was hiding something dangerous. As we have also already noted, there was no evidence that Officer Mauds-ley ever conveyed his observations of Scott to Officer McAloon (or that Officer McA-loon saw Scott sitting in an unnatural position) before Officer McAloon started to search the Maxima. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that Officer Mauds-ley communicated anything to Officer McAloon once the officers walked up to the Maxima.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, Officer Maudsley acknowledged that Scott was immediately compliant when instructed to get out of the car, frisked, and escorted to the back of the Maxima.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Finally, the District Court also relied on the presence of a legal folding pocketknife as evidence to support the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that Cunningham, at least, was dangerous. In doing so, the District Court appears to have operated under a factual misimpression in one material respect. The court suggested that Officer McAloon frisked Cunningham, found a knife, and that Cunningham then acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>edged that he had the knife. Joint App\u2019x 168. By emphasizing this point, the District Court may have misunderstood that Cunningham was throughout the encounter less compliant with the police than the record demonstrates. In fact, Officer McA-loon testified that he asked Cunningham whether he had any \u201cweapons,\u201d that Cunningham readily volunteered that he had a knife in his pocket, and that Officer McA-loon thereafter frisked him and recovered the knife. Officer McAloon further testified that Cunningham was fully compliant when he was asked to get out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Prodded by the Government, the District Court also may have overstated the description of the knife as a dangerous \u201cweapon\u201d that signaled the presence of other weapons in the car. We recognize that a criminal is capable of turning just about anything into a weapon: a knife, scissors, a tire iron. Here, for example, the Government argued that Cunningham\u2019s pocketknife resembled the knife he used to threaten Salahi a few months before the traffic stop. But the Government acknowledges that Cunningham\u2019s \u201cweapon\u201d was a lawful pocketknife with a two- or three-inch blade. Joint App\u2019x 416; Or. Arg. Tr. 27. By comparison, we note, the official pocketknife licensed by the Boy Scouts of America (and used by Eagle Scouts) has a three-inch blade, while the blade on the ubiquitous Swiss Army knife is also usually two inches or longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On this record, we are simply not convinced that the circumstances prior to the search of the Maxima supported a reasonable suspicion on Officer McAloon\u2019s part that Cunningham and Scott were dangerous and that the ear contained a weapon. On the same facts, imagine police officers searching the passenger compartment of a car driven by two women (or, for that matter, two people who appear to be businessmen) stopped at night on the ground that: the driver took ten seconds to pull the car over to the curb; her hand moved in the center console area to retrieve a smartphone; she continued to speak on the phone and was slow to respond when asked to put it down; she disclosed, when asked, that she possessed a pocketknife; and both the driver and the passenger fully complied with the officers\u2019 instructions after being asked to step out of the car. Let us even imagine that the passenger appeared to both officers to be hiding something. Virtually everyone will agree that the police officer under those circumstances would have overstepped if they conducted a protective search of the passenger compartment on the ground that the women (or the businessmen) were dangerous and might gain immediate control of a weapon. Yet the Government presses only those facts and circumstances to ask us to affirm the denial of Cunningham\u2019s suppression motion in this case. We might have been convinced to do so had the Government proffered some additional facts for our appellate review to support the officers\u2019 suspicion of immediate dangerousness. On this record, however, we have little choice but to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is REVERSED and REMANDED to the District Court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">. On appeal, Cunningham does not contest that he committed a traffic violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\">. Officer McAloon acknowledged that Cunningham's car would have been double-parked and \"blocked the rest of the traffic on [the] street\u201d had he pulled over any sooner. Supp. App\u2019x 109. He also agreed that Cunningham did not commit a separate infraction by failing to immediately pull over.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. Officer McAloon did not determine that the pocketknife was illegal. And throughout this litigation, the Government has acknowledged that Cunningham's pocketknife was, in fact, legal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\">. Cunningham alternatively argues that Sal-ahi\u2019s testimony was inconsistent. He points out, for example, that Salahi suggested during his testimony that there were three men with him in the van when he was threatened. But the jury was in a position to evaluate these inconsistencies and assess Salahi\u2019s credibility or ability to recall events. In any event, Salahi later clarified that there were only two robbers in the van: a robber with a gun and a robber with a knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b336-12\">. The Government prosecutor argued as much in his summation: \"The government is charging and this case is about actual possession of a gun, which should be apparent from the facts I just described. Damian Cunningham, the defendant, grabbed the gun and pressed it against the forehead of Ahmed Sal-ahi. That\u2019s not aiding and abetting. That\u2019s possession.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 763-64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">. As a result, that Cunningham and Scott were already out of the Maxima and detained when Officer McAloon began his search is not dispositive, since we also consider whether there were reasonable grounds to think that they could have accessed a weapon after returning to the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. Although one of the officers described the precinct in which the traffic stop occurred as a \"high crime area,\u201d neither the officers nor the District Court relied on that fact in justifying the search of the Maxima. In any event, that the car was stopped while driving through a high crime area does not alter our analysis. Cf. Holeman v. City of New London, 425 F.3d 184,190 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"[I]n the dead of night in a high crime neighborhood, it would be more suspicious to be on foot than in a car.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b340-5\">. Absent record evidence that Officer Mauds-ley communicated his suspicion or any relevant information to Officer McAloon before the latter began to conduct the protective search, we will not impute his knowledge or reasonable suspicion to Officer McAloon under the doctrine of collective knowledge. That doctrine allows a court to impute an officer\u2019s knowledge to another officer who actually makes a stop or conducts a search, even if the latter does not possess all the relevant facts. See United States v. Colon, 250 F.3d 130, 135-38 (2d Cir. 2001). In other words, it permits the \"police ... to act on the strength\u201d of work done by fellow officers. Whiteley v. Warden Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U.S. 560, 568, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971). Reasonable suspicion can therefore be premised in whole or in part on the knowledge of the officer conveying the information, not on \"whether those relying on the [information] were themselves aware of the specific facts which led their colleagues to seek their assistance.\u201d United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 231, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985). But we decline to extend the collective knowledge doctrine to cases where, as here, there is no evidence that an officer has communicated his suspicions with the officer conducting the search, even when the officers are working closely together at a scene. Cf. Colon, 250 F.3d at 136-37 &amp; n.3 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing United States v. Shareef, 100 F.3d 1491, 1504 &amp; n.5 (10th Cir.1996) (declining to extend collective knowledge doctrine where evidence showed officers had not communicated with each other; \"[information scattered among various officers in a police department cannot substitute for possession of_ the necessary facts by a single officer related to the arrest.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted)); Terry, 392 U.S. at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (requiring diat courts \"evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure\u201d based on the \"facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">.
