As relevant to this appeal, El-Nahal argued that the TLC\u2019s mandate that all New York City taxicabs install technology systems equipped with Global Positioning System (\u201cGPS\u201d) tracking abilities amounted to a property-based search pursuant to <em>United States v. Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 945, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012), and that this search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The District Court granted summary judgment to Defendants on all of El-Nahal\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims, including his <em>Jones </em>claim, which is the only issue before us on appeal. Because the record is devoid of evidence as to whether El-Nahal had any interest in a taxi at the time of an alleged trespass or physical intrusion, El-Nahal failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of his property-based Fourth Amendment claim and Defendants were entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>grant of summary judgment to Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The TLC is an agency of the City of New York that is tasked with the \u201cregulation and supervision of the business and industry of transportation of persons by licensed vehicles for hire in the city.\u201d N.Y.C., N.Y., Charter ch. 65, \u00a7 2303a. Its duties include the regulation of \u201crates,\u201d \u201cstandards and conditions of service,\u201d \u201cRequirements of standards of safety and ... efficiency in the operation of vehicles and auxiliary equipment,\u201d and the \u201cestablishment of ... [a] uniform system of accounts,\u201d which entails \u201cthe right ... to inspect books and records and to require the submission of such reports as the commission may determine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2303b. Pursuant to the New York City Administrative Code, the TLC may promulgate rules as necessary to implement its authority. N.Y.C., N.Y., Code \u00a7 19-503(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In 2004, the TLC promulgated a rule requiring that all New York City taxicabs begin to use a Taxicab Technology System (\u201cTTS\u201d), a physical device located in the backseat of taxicabs that would, among other things, provide credit and debit card payment services for customers, as well as transmit to the TLC electronic data about trips made by taxi drivers gathered by means of GPS. <em>See </em>N.Y.C., N.Y., Rules tit. 35, \u00a7 1-01 (2010). Through the TTS, the TLC would collect \u2014 only when drivers were on duty \u2014 \u201cthe taxicab license number; the taxicab driver\u2019s license number; the location of trip initiation; the time of trip initiation; the number of passengers; the location of trip termination; the time of trip termination; the metered fare for the trip; and the distance of the trip.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-06(b). Prior to the implementation of the TTS rule, the TLC required drivers to provide this same information in the form of handwritten trip records. The TTS rule mandated that taxicab medallion owners procure TTSs in their taxis by August 1, 2007. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 l-ll(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Around the same time as the TLC promulgated the TTS rule, the TLC also established a new system for taxi fare \u201crate codes,\u201d corresponding to different types of fares a taxi driver may charge. Rate Code 1, for instance, is the standard New York City rate and is used for fares from point-to-point within New York City. Rate Code 4, meanwhile, doubles the fare for each additional unit driven, and may be engaged by a taxi driver only under certain circumstances upon entering Nassau or West-chester County.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">In March 2010, the TLC issued a press release announcing that it had discovered that some taxicab drivers were using the Rate Code 4 setting to overcharge passengers. \u201cUsing GPS technology installed in taxicabs,\u201d the press release explained, the \u201cTLC has discovered 1,872,078 trips where passengers were illegally charged the higher rate\u201d by 35,558 drivers for a total of $8,330,155 in alleged overcharges. J.A. 135. The press release qualified this finding by noting that \u201cthere were 361 million taxi trips during that time period, so the illegal fare was only charged in 0.5% of all trips,\u201d and that the alleged \u201cscam was primarily perpetrated by a small number of drivers, with 3,000 drivers overcharging more than 100 times.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Two months later, in May 2010, the TLC issued a second press release that modified its initial findings, announcing that the \u201cTLC\u2019s completed analysis\u201d revealed that \u201c21,819 taxicab drivers overcharged passengers a total of 286,000 times ... for a total estimated overcharge of almost $1.1 million.\u201d J.A. 146. The press release added that the TLC believed that 13,315 out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the 21,819 drivers had \u201cengaged in overcharging just one or two times,\u201d but that it expected \u201cto be able to prove that some drivers engaged in 1,000 or more overcharges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response to the scandal, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office arrested 59 drivers \u201cfor defrauding and stealing from their customers,\u201d J.A. 150, and the TLC programmed passenger screens to display \u201ca highly visible alert that advises riders when the higher, out of town rate is activated,\u201d J.A. 151. The TLC also brought administrative actions against many drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Among those who faced administrative charges was El-Nahal, who at that point had been a taxi driver for more than twenty years. On January 3, 2012, the TLC sent El-Nahal a letter directing him to appear for a settlement conference in reference to allegations that he overcharged passengers on 10 occasions between November 20, 2009 and February 22, 2010 by improperly using the Rate 4 code. El-Nahal contested the allegations. On May 7, 2012, an administrative law judge found, based on trip records the TLC allegedly obtained via GPS, that El-Nahal violated the TLC\u2019s rules on six occasions. The administrative law judge thus imposed upon El-Nahal $550 in penalties and revoked El-Nahal\u2019s TLC license to drive taxis. On appeal, the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings Taxi and Limousine Tribunal Appeals Unit (\u201cAppeals Unit\u201d) overturned the penalty, ruling that the administrative law judge\u2019s decision was \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence.\u201d J.A. 187. The TLC then re-filed regarding one violation, and the administrative law judge found El-Nahal not guilty. Undeterred, the TLC re-filed five other charges against El-Nahal, and a different administrative law judge once again found El-Nahal guilty, imposed a fine, and revoked his license. El-Nahal again appealed, and the Appeals Unit again overturned the administrative law judge\u2019s decision on the ground that the administrative law judge\u2019s findings with respect to El-Nahal\u2019s alleged intent to overcharge were insufficient. Nonetheless, the TLC re-filed charges against El-Nahal once more. An administrative law judge yet again found El-Nahal guilty, based in part on GPS trip records and Google maps, and the Appeals Unit yet again reversed the decision on appeal. In reversing, the Appeals Unit dismissed the charges with prejudice and emphasized that the GPS evidence used to convict El-Nahal could not, by itself, show that El-Nahal \u201cintended to overcharge, only that he did overcharge.\u201d J.A. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">On May 31, 2013, El-Nahal filed his complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As relevant here, the complaint alleged that \u201c[t]he installation and use of [the] GPS device [through the TTS] ... constitutes a[n unlawful] search under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d J.A. 34. The complaint also alleged violations of the New York Constitution, Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules, the New York City Charter, and New York common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">On August 21, 2013, Defendants moved to dismiss El-Nahal\u2019s complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Attached to the motion were seventy-two pages of exhibits. At an initial pretrial conference held on September 13, 2013, Judge Forrest converted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and directed El-Nahal to file his opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>his own motion for summary judgment by September 24, 2013. On September 24, 2013, El-Nahal cross-moved for partial summary judgment with respect to his \u00a7 1983 and New York Constitution claims, and opposed Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">By order dated January 29, 2014, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on El-Nahal\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, and dismissed the state claims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction. El<em>-Nahal v. Yassky, </em>993 F.Supp.2d 460, 469-70 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). The district court held that the installation and use of the TTS did not constitute a search for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. As to whether the challenged conduct intruded on El-Nahal\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy, the district court, citing our decision in <em>Buliga v. N.Y.C. Taxi &amp; Limousine Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Fed.Appx. 82, 82 (2d Cir. 2009) (affirming a district court\u2019s ruling that the TLC rule requiring the installation of a TTS in all taxis did not invade the plaintiffs reasonable expectation of privacy), concluded that El-Nahal had no \u201creasonable expectation of privacy in any of the information collected\u201d by the TTS. <em>El-Nahal, </em>993 F.Supp.2d at 465. Regarding El-Nahal\u2019s claim that the mandatory. installation of the TTS was a search because it involved a physical intrusion for the purpose of obtaining information, the district court rejected the claim on the grounds that \u201ctaxi drivers are aware of the system, the system is installed pursuant to regulations, and the taxicabs in which the system is installed are not truly private vehicles.\u201d <em>El-Nahal, </em>993 F.Supp.2d at 467. The district court further reasoned that even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the mandatory installation of the TTS did constitute a search for Fourth Amendment purposes, the search was justified pursuant to the \u201cspecial needs\u201d doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 469. El-Nahal timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cWe review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d F.D.I.C. v. Giammettei, </em>34 F.3d 51, 54 (2d Cir. 1994). Upon proper motion, Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates the entry of summary judgment \u201cagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s ease, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Hayut v. State Univ. of N.Y., </em>352 F.3d 733, 743 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). \u201cIn such a situation, there can be \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact,\u2019 since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u201d <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (1963) (current version at Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (2010))). Thus, \u201c[t]he moving party is \u2018entitled to a judgment as a matter of law1 because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (1963) (current version at Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (2010))); <em>see also Goenaga v. March of Dimes Birth Defects Found., </em>51 F.3d 14, 18 (2d Cir. 1995) (noting that \u201cthe movant\u2019s burden will be satisfied if he can point to an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">El-Nahal argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on his Fourth Amendment claim be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>cause pursuant to <em>Jones, </em>\u201c[p]hysical placement of a tracking device on a private vehicle in order to obtain information is ... a search,\u201d so that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when \u201c[t]he TLC mandated the physical placement of tracking devices in privately owned taxicabs.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 29. El-Nahal has not argued on appeal that he was subjected to a search by virtue of an intrusion on any reasonable expectation of privacy he had regarding the installation and use of the TTS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, he asserts here that he \u201cexplicitly \u2018rejected the premise\u2019 of defendants\u2019 argument below that he was required to demonstrate an invasion of privacy\u201d and that his Fourth Amendment claim \u201cdoes not depend on whether his expectation of privacy was violated.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 31-32. Accordingly, we address the only argument El-Nahal has presented on appeal: namely, his contention that the district court erred in concluding that summary judgment was warranted as to his property-based Fourth Amendment claim. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the TLC-mandated installation and use of TTS devices in taxicabs in New York City may constitute a search as to those with sufficient property-based interests in a taxicab, we conclude that the district court nevertheless properly granted summary judgment because there is no evidence in the record as to an essential element of El-Nahal\u2019s claim on which he bears the burden of proof: namely, that he had such a property interest in a taxicab at the time a TTS was installed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\"><em>Jones </em>itself demonstrates that a plaintiff such as El-Nahal must establish such a property-based interest. In <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test did not supplant, but merely supplemented the earlier, property-based approach to defining the circumstances in which a \u201csearch,\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes, has occurred. 132 S.Ct. at 949-50. There, the Government placed a GPS tracking device on the undercarriage of a Jeep that was, as the Government acknowledged, exclusively driven by Jones.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 948-49 <em>&amp; </em>n.2. The Government then tracked the Jeep\u2019s movements for 28 days, using information gleaned from the tracking in Jones\u2019s prosecution for several drug offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 948-49. The <em>Jones </em>Court instructed that pursuant to the property-based approach, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>a Fourth Amendment search \u201cundoubtedly occurfs]\u201d when the Government acts to \u201cobtainf ] information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 950 n.3 \u2014 that is, on individuals\u2019 \u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects,\u201d as enumerated in the Fourth Amendment\u2019s text, U.S. Const. Amend. IV.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Because Government agents had physically intruded on Jones\u2019s Jeep, which was \u201cbeyond dispute ... an \u2018effect\u2019 as that term is used in the [Fourth] Amendment,\u201d <em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 949, to plant and employ a tracking device, the Supreme Court concluded that it need not consider the reasonable-expectation-of-privacy approach in determining whether Jones was subject to a search, <em>see id. </em>at 950-53. Applying the property-based approach, the Court held \u201cthat the Government\u2019s installation of a GPS device on a target\u2019s vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, constitutes a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 949. Thus, Jones was subject to a search because the Government installed a GPS device on <em>his </em>vehicle in order to obtain information \u2014 on a vehicle that, while registered to his wife, he exclusively drove and in which (as the Court took pains to note) he \u201chad at least the property rights of a bailee\u201d at the time the Government installed the tracking device. <em>Id. </em>at 949 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The centrality of some property interest to a property-based Fourth Amendment claim is also evident in the manner in which the <em>Jones </em>Court distinguished <em>United States v. Knotts, </em>460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983), and <em>United States v. Karo, </em>468 U.S. 705, 104 S.Ct. 3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984). In <em>Knotts </em>and <em>Karo, </em>the Government had installed beepers \u2014 \u201cradio transmitterfs], usually battery operated, which emitf] periodic signals that can be picked up by a radio receiver,\u201d <em>Knotts, </em>460 U.S. at 277, 103 S.Ct. 1081\u2014 into containers of chemicals that were thereafter tracked, and that the Government suspected would be used in connection with the manufacture of illegal drugs, <em>see id. </em>at 278-79, 103 S.Ct. 1081; <em>see also Karo, </em>468 U.S. at 708-09, 104 S.Ct. 3296. The Government argued in <em>Jones </em>that <em>Knotts </em>and <em>Karo </em>\u201cforeclosefd] the conclusion that what occurred [to Jones] constituted a search\u201d because in these earlier cases, the Court, employing the reasonable-expectation-of-privacy approach, had determined that using a beeper to track the movement of the containers on public roads did not constitute a search. 132 S.Ct. at 951. The <em>Jones </em>Court disagreed, concluding that the outcomes in <em>Knotts </em>and <em>Karo </em>were \u201cperfectly consistent\u201d with its property-based approach to the. Fourth Amendment\u2019s scope. <em>Id. </em>at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">As <em>Jones </em>explained, the Government in <em>Knotts </em>had installed the beeper in the container at issue <em>\u201cbefore it came into </em>KnottsXs] <em>possession, </em>with the consent of the then-owner\u201d of the container. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Knotts did not challenge the installation, and the Court \u201cspecifically declined to consider its effect.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 952. Similarly, the <em>Jones </em>court explained that in <em>Karo, </em>\u201c[a]s in <em>Knotts, </em>... [t]he Government ... came into physical contact with the container only <em>before it belonged to the defendant Karo\u201d </em>and with the consent of its then-owner: \u201cKaro accepted the container as it came to him, beeper and all, and was therefore not entitled to object to the beeper\u2019s presence, even though it was used to monitor the container\u2019s location.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Jones, meanwhile, was on \u201cmuch dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ferent footing\u201d than Knotts or Karo: he \u201cpossessed the Jeep <em>at the time the Government trespassorily inserted </em>the information-gathering device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 2.7(f) (5th ed. 2012) (noting that \u201cthe date of the requisite trespass\u201d rather than the \u201cperiod of surveillance\u201d is critical to assessing whether a search has occurred pursuant to Jones\u2019s property-based approach). Because the physical intrusion was upon a constitutionally protected area and was undertaken for the purpose of obtaining information, the Government\u2019s conduct amounted to the type of property-based search that the Fourth Amendment protects against. <em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">To be clear, because there was no dispute in <em>Jones </em>that the defendant lawfully possessed the Jeep at the time it was trespassed upon, nor did the Government challenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s determination \u201cthat the vehicle\u2019s registration did not affect [Jones\u2019s] ability to make a Fourth Amendment objection,\u201d the <em>Jones </em>Court had no occasion fully to consider the nature of the property interest that is sufficient to make out a property-based Fourth Amendment claim. <em>Id. </em>at 949 n.2. Neither need we do so here. Because we can discern no evidence at all that El-Nahal had <em>any </em>interest in a particular taxicab at the time of an alleged trespass or physical intrusion, we find no genuine issue of material fact warranting a trial. Summary judgment in favor of Defendants was therefore wholly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">During the proceedings that led to summary judgment in favor of Defendants, Defendants repeatedly stated that the property-based approach in <em>Jones </em>was predicated upon physical intrusion on property, and emphasized how <em>Jones </em>differed from <em>Knotts </em>and <em>Karo. </em>For instance, Defendants\u2019 opening memorandum of law explained that, unlike the defendant in <em>Jones, </em>there was no physical occupation of El-Nahal\u2019s property for the purpose of obtaining information because, as in <em>Knotts </em>and <em>Karo, </em>\u201cthe initial placement of the monitor was not at issue.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem. of L. in Supp. at 11, <em>El-Nahal v. Yassky, </em>993 F.Supp.2d 460 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (No. 13-cv-3690 (KBF)), ECF No. 13.

R. Civ. P. 56(e))). Yet, El-Nahal adduced no evidence as to the circumstances surrounding any alleged trespass or physical intrusion on a taxicab in which he had a property-based interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Here, El-Nahal emphasizes that he drives a taxicab and that the TLC mandated the physical placement of a TTS in all privately owned cabs. But this is not enough to show that the physical placement of a TTS intruded on a constitutionally protected area <em>of Elr-Nahal. </em>Even if El-Nahal at some point drove a taxicab installed with a TTS, this fact, standing alone, is no more relevant than the fact that Knotts and Karo at some point possessed containers installed with beepers. As <em>Jones </em>makes plain, the possibility that the Government may have trespassed or physically intruded on <em>someone\u2019s </em>property does not necessarily entitle <em>someone else </em>who <em>later acquires </em>an interest in that property to claim that the Government trespassed or physically intruded on her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">El-Nahal provided no evidence describing his interest in a taxi at the time of an alleged trespass or physical intrusion. Beyond stating that he has been a taxicab driver for more than 20 years, El-Nahal leaves it a mystery whether he owns a taxicab medallion (and it is the <em>owners </em>of such medallions that TLC regulations require to equip their taxicabs with a TTS, N.Y.C., N.Y., Rules tit. 35, \u00a7 1-11(f)-(g) (2010)), rents a taxi from a corporate owner on a daily or weekly basis, or alternates driving shifts with another driver who rents a cab. Moreover, he has said <em>nothing at all </em>as to what interest he had in a particular taxi (if any) at the time it was installed with a TTS. Thus, so far as the record here discloses, El-Nahal may have rented a taxi after its owner contracted with a third-party provider to install' a TTS, fully cognizant of the presence of the TTS in the cab, and even taking custody of the cab on the-condition that he properly maintain the TTS while operating the taxi. <em>Cf. Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 961 (Alito, J., concurring) (noting that \u201cthe <em>[Jones] </em>theory would provide no protection\u201d if \u201cthe Federal Government required or persuaded auto manufacturers to include a GPS tracking device in every car\u201d). <em>Jones </em>leaves no doubt that in such a case, a property-based search claim would be lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">That the parameters of the property-based search theory outlined in <em>Jones </em>were not fully explicated in that case makes it all the more remarkable that El-Nahal has failed to adduce evidence on one aspect of <em>Jones </em>that <em>is </em>clear: to claim that the Government trespassed or physically intruded upon one\u2019s constitutionally pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>tected area for the purposes of gathering information, a plaintiff must establish a property interest in a constitutionally protected area at the time of the intrusion. Here, El-Nahal has provided no evidence tending to show that he had an interest in any taxi at the time of an alleged trespass or physical invasion \u2014 an element that, whether dependent on or divergent from common-law tort principles, we have described as \u201cthe touchstone for the analysis in <em>Jones.\u201d See United States v. Aguiar, </em>737 F.3d 251, 261 (2d Cir. 2013) (Pooler, J.). No reasonable jury could find for El-Na-hal on his claim that the Government\u2019s conduct constituted a search under <em>Jones, </em>and there is nothing for us to do but to affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants. Accordingly, finding no genuine issue of material fact warranting a trial, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">.

The reasonable-expectation-of-privacy approach for deciding whether a search has occurred within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment derives from Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in <em>Katz v.

We thus affirm on an alternative ground and do not consider the district court\u2019s con-elusions: (1) that Defendants' actions \"did not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment ... under ... the <em>Jones </em>physical-trespass analysis;\u201d and (2) that assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that a search occurred, \"that search was reasonable under the special-needs analysis of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>El-Nahal, </em>993 F.Supp.2d at 468-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\">.Because the Government conceded that Jones was \"the exclusive driver\u201d of the Jeep, <em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 949 n.2 (quoting <em>United States v.

Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 945, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012), on the one hand, and <em>United States v. Knotts, </em>460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983), and <em>United States v. Karo, </em>468 U.S. 705, 104 S.Ct. 3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984), on the other hand. Indeed, had Defendants pressed the same analysis before the district court, I would join the majority in holding that Defendants had successfully shifted the burden to El-Nahal to \u201ccome forward with specific evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact\u201d on the issue of El-Nahal\u2019s property interest in the taxi at the time of the alleged trespass, <em>Brown v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 654 </em>F.3d 347, 358 (2d Cir. 2011), and that El-Nahal failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">I disagree, however, that Defendants \u201cpoint[ed] out to the district court ... an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).

Mem. of L. in Supp. at 11, and the analysis following the heading \u201cThere Was No Trespass on Plaintiffs Person or Property Constituting a Search,\u201d the only even arguably relevant portion of which merely again stated that \u201cthe physical placement of the GPS device in the vehicles is not at issue.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply Mem. of L. in Supp. at 7, <em>El-Nahal v.

Thus, in 64 pages of briefing by Defendants, the only statement referring to an absence of evidence on the point of El-Nahal\u2019s interest in the taxi at the time of the trespass is that \u201cthe physical placement of the GPS device in the vehicles is not at issue.\u201d I, quite frankly, do not know what this statement means. While the majority draws nuanced lines between <em>Jones </em>and <em>Knotts </em>and <em>Karo, </em>showing the importance of an ownership interest at the time of the trespass, <em>at most </em>Defendants implicitly hint at such a distinction. I do not think this was sufficient to shift the burden to El-Nahal to provide evidence of his property interest in the taxi.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">It is evident, moreover, that the district court did not read these statements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>same manner as does the majority, as the district court held that <em>Jones </em>did not control on the grounds that the trespass in <em>Jones </em>was surreptitious, that taxis are not truly private property, and that the system was installed pursuant to regulations. <em>See El-Nahal v. Yassky, </em>993 F.Supp.2d 460, 467-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Although I agree that the majority need not reach these issues, <em>see </em>Maj. Op. at 253 n.3, in my view, they were decided incorrectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">As an initial matter, I cannot agree that the surreptitious nature of the intrusion was a critical factor to the holding in <em>Jones. </em>Beyond the fact that the <em>Jones </em>majority never characterized the intrusion in this manner, its reasoning expressly disclaimed any reliance on the target\u2019s expectations regarding the possibility of surveillance. The physical invasion of a constitutionally protected area is no less actionable under the Fourth Amendment merely because it is conspicuous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Isiofia, </em>370 F.3d 226, 232-33 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that a war-rantless home search was unconstitutional where the defendant witnessed the search and gave consent, later found to be involuntary).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would allow the government to conduct unreasonable searches merely by announcing them. But the government could not, for instance, eliminate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201chomes, papers, and effects\u201d if it \u201cwere suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry.\u201d <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740 n.5, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979). Accordingly, El-Nahal\u2019s awareness of the GPS does not preclude the finding that the surveillance entailed a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Nor, in my view, is the fact that the GPS was installed pursuant to an administrative rule dispositive. On numerous occasions, the Supreme Court has addressed statutes and regulations implicating Fourth Amendment rights. For instance, in <em>Grady v. North Carolina, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct: 1368, 191 L.Ed.2d 459 (2015), the Supreme Court applied <em>Jones\u2019s, </em>reasoning in evaluating a state statute mandating the satellite-based monitoring of certain categories of recidivist sex offenders. By unanimous opinion, the Court concluded that \u201ca State ... conducts a search when it attaches a device to a person\u2019s body, without consent, for the purpose of tracking that individual\u2019s movements,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1370, a decision not changed by the fact that this search was conducted pursuant to statute. <em>See id. </em>at 1371 (rejecting argument that this was not unconstitutional because the \u201cState\u2019s monitoring program is civil in nature\u201d); see <em>also Maryland v. King, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1958, 1968-69, 186 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013) (considering the constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment of DNA swabs taken pursuant to Maryland statute). Most recently, in <em>City of Los Angeles v. Patel, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2443, 192 L.Ed.2d 435 (2015), the Supreme Court struck down a city ordinance requiring hotels to permit the warrantless inspection of their guest records on the basis that it authorized a regime of unreasonable searches without opportunity for precompliance review. <em>Id. </em>at 2447-48, 2451-53. Plainly, the government\u2019s physical intrusion on a constitutionally protected area is subject to Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Amendment scrutiny even if the intrusion is authorized by municipal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">With respect to whether the taxi was constitutionally protected property, the district court answered in the negative, reasoning that \u201c[t]he pervasive regulation of taxis and their openness to public use distinguishes them from the <em>truly </em>private property at issue in <em>Jones.\u201d El-Nahal, </em>993 F.Supp.2d at 467 (emphasis added). Although I agree that taxicabs differ from noncommercial vehicles in important respects, in my view, these distinctions do not strip them of all Fourth Amendment protections. <em>If </em>the taxi was El-Nahal\u2019s private personal property, <em>Jones </em>dictates that such property qualifies as \u201can \u2018effect\u2019 as that term is used in the [Fourth] Amendment.\u201d 132 S.Ct. at 949 (\u201cIt is important to be clear about what happened in this case: The Government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information.\u201d). As such, it was entitled to special \u201cFourth Amendment significance\u201d as \u201cone of those protected areas enumerated\u201d in the constitutional text. <em>Id. </em>at 953. At bottom, the Court must \u201cassur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 950 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 34, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001)). \u201cThe Framers would have understood the term \u2018effects\u2019 to be limited to personal, rather than real, property.\u201d Oliver, <em>v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 177 n.7, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984). The term was not limited, however, to personal property of a <em>noncommercial </em>nature. It included \u201cthe goods of a merchant [or] tradesman.\u201d <em>Altman v. City of High Point, </em>330 F.3d 194, 201 (4th Cir. 2003) (quoting Dictionarium Britannicum (Nathan Baily ed., 1730)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">To recount now familiar history, \u201cone of the primary evils intended to be eliminated by the Fourth Amendment was the massive intrusion on privacy undertaken in the collection of taxes pursuant to general warrants and writs of assistance.\u201d <em>G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 338, 355, 97 S.Ct. 619, 50 L.Ed.2d 530 (1977). \u201cThe hated writs of assistance had given customs officials blanket authority to search where they pleased for goods imported in violation of British tax laws.\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 583 n.21, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). The \u201cparticular offensiveness\u201d engendered by these general warrant \u201cwas acutely felt by the <em>merchants and businessmen </em>whose <em>premises and products </em>were inspected for compliance with the several' parliamentary revenue measures.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 311, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Consistent with this purpose, \u201c[o]ur pri- or cases have established that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches applies to administrative inspections of private commercial property.\u201d <em>Spinelli v. City of New York, </em>579 F.3d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 2009). The Fourth Amendment is therefore implicated by searches conducted by regulatory authorities involving the unlicensed \u201cphysical entry\u201d on a business\u2019s private property. <em>See G. M. Leasing Corp., </em>429 U.S. at 354, 97 S.Ct. 619 (indicating that Fourth Amendment would be implicated by \u201cwarrantless seizure of property, even that owned by a corporation, situated on private premises to which access is not otherwise available for the seizing officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The conclusion that TLC\u2019s rule worked an unlicensed physical intrusion on a constitutionally protected effect is not altered by the taxicab\u2019s \u201copenness to public use.\u201d <em>El-Nahal, </em>993 F.Supp.2d at 467. \u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). An implied license therefore permits regulatory officials to do what \u201cany private citizen might do,\u201d without implicating the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Florida v. Jardines, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1409, 1416, 185 L.Ed.2d 495 (2013) (quoting <em>Kentucky v. King, </em>563 U.S. 452, 131 S.Ct. 1849, 1862, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011)). A government agent, in the same manner as a private person, may hail a taxi when it is on duty and physically occupy it for the duration of a trip. <em>See Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985). But, without the driver\u2019s leave, a typical passenger may not dust the car\u2019s interior for fingerprints, mount a camera on the dashboard, or rifle through the vehicle\u2019s glove compartment to peruse the tips that other passengers have paid. \u201c[TJhere is no basis for the notion that because a retail store invites the public to enter, it consents to wholesale searches and seizures that do not conform to Fourth Amendment guarantees.\u201d <em>Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 319, 329, 99 S.Ct. 2319, 60 L.Ed.2d 920 (1979). The Supreme Court explored a related issue in <em>Jardines, </em>where law enforcement officers invited a narcotics-detecting canine to sniff around a suspect\u2019s front porch. The Court held that a Fourth Amendment search occurred because the detectives had gathered information by \u201cphysically entering and occupying\u201d the constitutionally protected curtilage of the house, in order \u201cto engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the home; owner.\u201d <em>Jardines, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1414. The dog\u2019s investigation amounted to an \u201cunlicensed physical intrusion,\u201d despite the fact that custom extended an implicit license \u201cto approach the home by the front path, knock promptly, wait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to linger longer) leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1415. \u201cThe scope of a license \u2014 express or implied \u2014 is limited not only to a particular area but also to a specific purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1416. The detectives\u2019 conduct was therefore a search under the Fourth Amendment because they engaged in behavior that objectively exceeded the scope of their implicit license to enter while occupying a constitutionally protected area. <em>Id. </em>at 1416-17. Here as well, the implied license all taxis extend to the public does not encompass an invitation to install surveillance technology in their vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Accordingly, I join the majority\u2019s analysis of <em>Jones, Knotts, </em>and <em>Karo. </em>Because I do not believe that Defendants properly put at issue El-Nahal\u2019s interest in the- taxi at the time of the trespass, and because I disagree with the district court\u2019s analysis of the physical trespass-based Fourth Amendment claim, I would vacate and remand for further factual development. I therefore concur in part and respectfully dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">. Indeed, this point is illustrated by <em>Entick v. Carrington, </em>95 Eng.

In <em>Entick, </em>the plaintiff prevailed in an action for trespass after the King\u2019s messengers, acting under the claimed authority of a general warrant, \"with force and arms\u201d entered and searched his dwelling \"against his will.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
