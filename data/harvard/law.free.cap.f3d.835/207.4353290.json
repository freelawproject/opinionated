Weiland was charged as removable based on his conviction for possession of child pornography under New York Penal Law \u00a7 263.11, which the Government characterizes as an aggravated felony. Weiland argues that this conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) because it lacks an interstate commerce element that is present in the analogous federal child pornography statute. But in Torres v. Lynch, which was decided after briefing concluded in this appeal, the Supreme Court held that violation of a state criminal law may constitute an aggravated felony for purposes of the INA even if the law lacks a federal jurisdictional element. \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 1619, 1634, 194 L.Ed.2d 737 (2016). We therefore DENY the petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Weiland entered the United States as a visitor in 1969 and became a lawful permanent resident the following year. In 2004 he was convicted of possessing an obscene sexual performance by a child in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 263.11. The Department of Homeland Security later initiated removal proceedings against him based on the 2004 conviction, which it viewed as an aggravated felony as defined' in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(I). The INA includes in its definition of aggravated felonies any offense \u201cdescribed in section ... 2252 of Title 18,\u201d which prohibits the possession, reproduction, and distribution of child pornography. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(D; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. As the INA further makes clear, \u201c[t]he term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense ... whether in violation of Federal or State law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Weiland argued to the Immigration Judge that this definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d did not cover his conviction. Both parties agreed that \u00a7 2252(a)(4) was the federal provision that most resembled the elements of the New York child pornography statute under which Weiland was convicted. But \u00a7 2252(a)(4) includes a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>jurisdictional requirement that New York\u2019s child pornography statute lacks. In order to convict a defendant under the federal statute, the visual depiction must have been possessed either within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States or on any land or building owned, leased, used, or controlled by the United States Government; or it must have been transported using a means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4). According to Wei-land, his conviction was not an offense described in \u00a7 2252(a)(4) because the New York statute does not. have an interstate commerce requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The Immigration Judge rejected this argument and ordered Weiland removed. Relying on the BIA\u2019s decision in In re Vasquez-Muniz, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 207, 213 (BIA 2002), the Immigration Judge concluded that a state criminal law need not contain a federal jurisdictional element to be \u201cdescribed in\u201d one of the corresponding federal statutes identified in \u00a7 1101(a)(43). The BIA dismissed Weiland\u2019s appeal. In re Thomas Weiland, No. A019 352 694 (BIA Aug. 28, 2014). This appeal followed. With the agreement of both parties, we held our disposition of the appeal in abeyance pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Torres v. Lynch, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1619, 194 L.Ed.2d 737 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">On appeal, Weiland renewed his claim that New York\u2019s child pornography statute is not \u201can offense described in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. But, as Weiland appears to acknowledge, that argument was foreclosed by our decision in Torres v. Holder, 764 F.3d 152 (2d Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">In Torres we considered whether a New York state conviction for attempted arson qualified as an aggravated felony under the IN A. Id. at 153. New York\u2019s arson law, like the child pornography law under which Weiland was convicted, had a federal analogue that was included in the INA\u2019s definition of an aggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(i). The federal statute differed from the state law only insofar as it required that the property damaged was \u201cused in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i). We were inclined to conclude for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43) that an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d a federal statute \u201cneed not reproduce the federal jurisdictional element to have immigration consequences.\u201d Torres, 764 F.3d at 157. But we also acknowledged that \u201cthis conclusion [did not] follow[] inexorably from the INA\u2019s text and structure.\u201d Id. We therefore deferred to the interpretation of the BIA, which held in In re Bautista, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 616 (BIA 2011), that New York\u2019s arson statute was an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i). Torres, 764 F.3d at 158; see also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\u201c[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue ... a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">On appeal, Weiland urged us to reconsider our decision in Torres. \u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d we are \u201cbound by prior decisions of this court unless and until ... [they] are reversed en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d In re Arab Bank, PLC Alien Tort Statute Litig., 808 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]here is an exception to this general rule when an \u2018intervening Supreme Court decision casts doubt on our controlling precedent.\u2019 \u201d Id. (alteration omitted) (quoting Wojchowski v. Daines, 498 F.3d 99, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>(2d Cir. 2007)). Weiland argued we should nevertheless disregard Torres because the Third Circuit has vacated Bautista, the BIA decision to which we deferred. See Bautista v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., 744 F.3d 54, 66 (3d Cir. 2014). Shortly after briefing concluded in Weiland\u2019s appeal, however, the Supreme Court granted certiorari review of our decision in Torres and affirmed, thus abrogating the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in Bautista. See Torres v. Lynch, 136 S.Ct. at 1634 (2016). The Court held that a federal jurisdictional element \u201cis properly ignored when determining if a state offense counts as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">After the Supreme Court decided Torres v. Lynch, we permitted the parties to submit additional briefing. Abandoning his original argument, Weiland now claims that, unlike the arson statute at issue in Torres v. Lynch, which, he asserts, has no \u201cinnate link to interstate commerce,\u201d the interstate commerce component of the federal child pornography statute is a requirement of the underlying substantive offense. See Pet\u2019r\u2019s Letter 2, June 7, 2016, ECF No. 90. This argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, Weiland ignores that, in addition to proscribing the transportation of child pornography using a means of interstate commerce, \u00a7 2252 also criminalizes the possession of child pornography \u201cin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or on any land or building owned by, leased to, or otherwise used by or under the control of the Government of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4). Weiland does not argue that this element is also a requirement of the substantive offense. Second, the Court in Torres v. Lynch expressed concern that requiring a state law to include a federal jurisdictional element in order to be an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d one of the federal laws identified in \u00a7 1101(a)(43) would exclude most state child pornography laws \u2014 an outcome that the Court characterized as \u201cperverse.\u201d Torres v. Lynch, 136 S.Ct. at 1628-29. In light of Torres v. Lynch, we conclude that New York\u2019s child pornography statute is an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d \u00a7 2252.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
