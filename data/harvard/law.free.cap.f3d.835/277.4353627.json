He was also convicted of two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c): one for possession of a firearm in furtherance of the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy and the other for possession of a firearm in furtherance of the narcotics conspiracy. The district court sentenced Simmons to a five-year term of imprisonment for one of the \u00a7 924(c) convictions. Pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) \u2014 which provides for a mandatory minimum of twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction under \u00a7 924(c) \u2014 the court sentenced Simmons to a twenty-five-year term of imprisonment for the second \u00a7 924(c) conviction, each to run consecutively to the other and to the sentences imposed for the racketeering and narcotics convictions, for a total term of fifty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">On appeal, Simmons argues, with respect to that part of his sentence based on the firearms convictions, that (1) the fact of whether he had a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d \u00a7 924(c) conviction should have been determined by the jury, and (2) one or the other of his convictions under \u00a7 924(c) was multiplicitous because they involved potentially overlapping conduct. For the following reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">In 2013, Simmons was charged with multiple offenses stemming from his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>volvement with the Bloods gang operating out of Newburgh, New York (\u201cNewburgh Bloods\u201d). Count One charged him with participating in a racketeering enterprise, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 and 1962(c), and set forth six racketeering acts, all of which related to murder, attempted murder, or robbery, except for predicate act five, which consisted of a narcotics distribution conspiracy. Count Two charged Simmons with participating in a racketeering conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d). The conduct underlying both Counts One and Two was alleged to have occurred \u201c[f|rom at least in or about 2006, up to and including in or about March 2013,\u201d App\u2019x 256, 263. Count Twelve charged Simmons with participating in a conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 280 grams or more of a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, \u201c[f]rom at least in or about 2004, up to and including in or about September 2011.\u201d App\u2019x 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Simmons was also charged with two counts of violating \u00a7 924(c). Count Thirteen charged Simmons with using and carrying firearms during and in relation to, and possession of firearms in furtherance of, the narcotics conspiracy described in Count Twelve, [f|rom at least in or about 2004, up to and including in or about September 2011.\u201d App\u2019x 275. Count Seventeen charged him with using and carrying firearms during and in relation to, and possession of firearms in furtherance of, a crime of violence, namely, the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy charged in Counts One and Two, but \u201con occasions other than those described\u201d in Count Thirteen (among other counts). App\u2019x 277-78.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">At trial, the Government introduced evidence connecting Simmons to numerous firearms. With respect to the firearms possessed in conjunction with the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy, the jury heard testimony that Simmons was in possession (or aided in the possession) of a gun on three occasions: (1) when he and another member of the Newburgh Bloods were arrested in January 2008 while driving through the neighborhood of a rival gang; (2) when Simmons passed along one of his guns to a fellow Newburgh Blood in 2009; and (3) when Simmons was on Lander St. in Newburgh with a fellow member of the Newburgh Bloods.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">As for the firearms possessed in connection with the narcotics conspiracy, the Government offered testimony that numerous guns were hidden in a neighborhood block located on Lander St. in Newburgh where the Newburgh Bloods sold crack cocaine. These so-called \u201cblock guns\u201d were to be used when \u201cneeded,\u201d Trial Tr. 250, and were kept for \u201cprotection\u201d from \u201cother gangs\u201d in the course of selling drugs, Trial Tr. 851. The jury heard testimony that Simmons was seen on Lander St. in possession of one of these block guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">In its summation, the Government sought to link the firearms to the respective counts. Thus, the gun discovered on Simmons when he was arrested in January 2008, the gun he passed along in 2009, and the gun he possessed while out with a fellow blood on Lander St. were tied to the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy, while the block guns were connected to the narcotics conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The district court instructed the jury that the firearms charge contained in Count Seventeen was \u201cconnected to the charges of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy,\u201d Trial Tr. 2211, while the fir\u00e9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>arms charge in Count Thirteen was \u201cconnected to the narcotics conspiracy,\u201d Trial Tr. 2210. Neither Simmons nor the Government asked the district court to instruct the jury that the guns in Count Seventeen were alleged to have been possessed on occasions different from those occasions forming the basis for Count Thirteen, and no such instruction was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">At sentencing, the court sentenced Simmons to a five-year term of imprisonment for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction relating to the narcotics conspiracy and, pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C), to a twenty-five-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for his \u00a7 924(c) conviction pertaining to the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy, each to run consecutively to the other and to the other sentences, for a total term of fifty years\u2019 imprisonment. Simmons did not object to the court\u2019s imposition of the twenty-five-year mandatory minimum for his conviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d \u00a7 924(c) offense. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">I. The Fact of a \u201cSecond or Subsequent\u201d Conviction under \u00a7 924(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Simmons contends that the fact of whether he had a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d \u00a7 924(c) conviction should have been found by the jury and the jury should have been charged accordingly. Because Simmons did not object on this basis to either the district court\u2019s jury charge or to the sentence, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Vilar, </em>729 F.3d 62, 88 (2d Cir. 2013) (jury instructions); <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir. 2007) (sentencing). Plain error review permits relief only where (1) there is \u201cerror,\u201d (2) the error \u201cis plain,\u201d (3) the error \u201caffect[s] substantial rights,\u201d and (4) the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Groysman, </em>766 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The fact of a prior conviction may be decided by a judge and need not be determined by a jury. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) <em>(\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 243-48, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that a prior conviction relevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime is not a fact that must be charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt). We have held that the existence of a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d \u00a7 924(c) conviction is a sentencing factor that need not be determined by a jury. <em>United States v. Anglin, </em>284 F.3d 407, 409 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (holding that \u201cthe fact of [a] prior conviction [under \u00a7 924(c)], a standard recidivist concern, is a sentencing factor, not a separate element or offense\u201d that must be submitted to a jury); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>300 F.3d 202, 212 (2d Cir. 2002) (observing that this Court \u201cheld [in Anglin] that the fact of a prior conviction is not an element of a \u00a7 924(c) offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Simmons argues that Apprendi\u2019s and Almendarez-Torres\u2019s holdings on this issue are no longer good law because they did not survive the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), which held that any fact increasing the mandatory minimum sentence is an element of the crime and must be found by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>id. </em>at 2155. <em>Alleyne, </em>however, has not altered the rule set forth in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>that the fact of a prior conviction need not be determined by a jury. <em>See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 <em>&amp; </em>n.1 (declining to revisit the established rule that a judge not a jury may decide the fact of a prior conviction); <em>United States v. Del Rosario, </em>561 Fed.Appx. 68, 69 (2d Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (observing that <em>Alleyne </em>left intact the rule that the fact of a prior conviction need not be submitted to the jury for determination, and that, \u201cunder controlling Supreme Court precedent, the fact of a prior felony conviction may be decided by a judge ... even if that fact increases the statutory minimum term of imprisonment to which the defendant is exposed\u201d); <em>accord United States v. King, </em>751 F.3d 1268, 1280 (11th Cir. 2014) (\u201cFinding that a defendant\u2019s convictions were \u2018second or subsequent\u2019 is the same as finding that a defendant had a prior conviction, and the issue remains governed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>[and unaltered by <em>Alleyne].\u201d); United States v. Mack, </em>729 F.3d 594, 609 (6th Cir. 2013) (concluding that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding authority notwithstanding <em>Alleyne </em>and that a jury need not find a defendant\u2019s convictions were \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(I)). We are satisfied there is no reason to disturb our established case law on this issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">II. Multiplicity of Simmons\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">We construe Simmons\u2019s remaining arguments as asserting that the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions were multiplicitous, and, relat-edly, that it was error for the court to fail to instruct the jury that proof of the violations in Counts Thirteen and Seventeen needed to be based on separate conduct and error for the court implicitly at sentencing, rather than the jury, to find that the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions were based on separate conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The issue of whether the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions were multiplicitous is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>545 F.3d 179, 204 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>447 F.3d 184, 186 (2d Cir. 2006). As noted, because Simmons did not object to the district court\u2019s jury charge or purported sentencing error, his challenge to each is reviewed for plain error. <em>Vilar, </em>729 F.3d at 88; <em>Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">A \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction under \u00a7 924(c) may be charged in the same indictment as the initial \u00a7 924(c) charge. <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132-33, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 1993; <em>see United States v. Pierce, </em>785 F.3d 832, 846 (2d Cir. 2015) (observing that in <em>Deal, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court clarified that a \u2018second or subsequent conviction\u2019 can arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>when a defendant is charged with multiple violations of Section 924(c) in the same indictment or arising from the same proceedings,\u201d meaning that \u201c[o]ne of the convictions is treated as the first conviction and the others are treated as \u2018second or subsequent\u2019 \u201d). A \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction, however, may not be based on a single \u201cunit of prosecution,\u201d i.e., \u201c[w]here the government links multiple firearms to a single crime,\u201d <em>United States v. Lindsay, </em>985 F.2d 666, 674 (2d Cir. 1993), or where a defendant is in \u201ccontinuous possession of a firearm in furtherance of simultaneous predicate offenses consisting of virtually the same conduct,\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>447 F.3d at 188 (quoting <em>United States v. Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 207 (2d Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In support of his argument that the two convictions may have punished simultaneous conduct, Simmons points to the fact that the \u00a7 924(c) charge relating to the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy was linked to conduct occurring between 2006 and 2013 while the \u00a7 924(c) charge relating to the narcotics conspiracy was based on conduct that occurred between 2004 and September 2011, resulting in a temporal overlap of some 5 years. Simmons also observes that the racketeering enterprise charged in Count One included as a predicate act a narcotics.distribution conspiracy, while the racketeering conspiracy charged in Count Two alleged that the pattern of racketeering activity included, among other criminal acts, \u201cdealing in a controlled substance.\u201d According to Simmons, since one of his \u00a7 924(e) convictions was based on Counts One and Two, both of which included narcotics-related predicate acts, he may have been punished twice for the same conduct because his <em>other </em>\u00a7 924(c) conviction was based on Count Twelve, which alleged a substantive narcotics conspiracy. It was therefore possible, he argues, that the jury convicted him of two \u00a7 924(c) counts based on the same underlying criminal conduct. We conclude, however, that the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions were .not multiplicitous and identify no plain error in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The evidence showed that Simmons possessed (or aided and abetted the possession of) multiple firearms on separate occasions. Furthermore, in its summation, the Government distinguished between the firearms involved in the respective \u00a7 924(c) counts: the \u00a7 924(c) charge relating to the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy was based on possession of the firearm discovered on Simmons when he was arrested in January 2008, the firearm he passed along in 2009, and the firearm he possessed while out with a fellow Blood on Lander St.; the \u00a7 924(c) count based on possession of a firearm in connection with participation in the narcotics conspiracy was based solely on the block guns that were kept on Lander St.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, although these incidents may have occurred within the same five-year period \u2014 or even in the same month or year \u2014 the evidence at trial, and the Government\u2019s presentation of that evidence and argument to the jury, demonstrated that the guns were neither linked \u201cto a single crime,\u201d <em>Lindsay, </em>985 F.2d at 674, nor based on the \u201ccontinuous possession of a firearm in furtherance of simultaneous predicate offenses consisting of virtually the same conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Wallace, </em>447 F.3d at 188 (quoting <em>Finley, </em>245 F.3d at 207).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Given the evidence that Simmons possessed multiple firearms on separate occasions, we conclude that there was an ample basis for the jury to convict Simmons of two separate violations of \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Salameh, </em>261 F.3d 271, 279 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding concerns about multiplicitous \u00a7 924(c) convictions unfounded \u201cgiven the separate, and separately culpable, nature of defendants\u2019 use and carriage of the [firearms]\u201d); <em>United States v. Malpeso, </em>115 F.3d 155, 170 (2d Cir. 1997) (rejecting challenge to two \u00a7 924(c) convictions where evidence \u201cestablished that [defendant] carried guns on several occasions\u201d throughout charged conspiracy, leaving \u201cno realistic possibility\u201d that the jury conviction on both counts was based on single event). That there was no jury instruction clarifying that the firearms subject of each \u00a7 924(c) charge must have been possessed on separate occasions does not amount to plain error. For the same reasons, it was not plain error for the district court to find implicitly at sentencing that the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions were based on separate conduct, thereby subjecting Simmons to mandatory minimum, consecutive sentences based on a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d \u00a7 924(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">We have considered all of Simmons\u2019s remaining arguments with respect to his sentencing and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above and in the accompanying summary order, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">. Simmons also argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of participating in a racketeering conspiracy. We reject this argument and affirm that conviction in a separately filed summary order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. Both \u00a7 924(c) counts included charges that Simmons aided and abetted others in the commission of those firearms offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b305-5\">. To the extent Simmons argues that the district court was not permitted at sentencing to determine the separateness of his \u00a7 924(c) convictions, we disagree. We have held that \"the separateness of convictions is not a fact which is different in kind from the types of facts already left to the sentencing judge by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151, 153, 156 (2d Cir. 2001) (applying <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)\u2019s mandatory minimum prison term for defendants who have three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see United States v. Dantzler, </em>771 F.3d 137, 144 (2d Cir. 2014) (observing that \"we held in <em>Santiago </em>that the question of separateness of predicate offenses is intertwined with the fact of conviction, and because a sentencing judge was authorized to find the fact of conviction under <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>he could also find that such convictions were separate\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b306-5\">. It is conceivable that the racketeering-related gun alleged to have been possessed by Simmons on Lander St. \u2014 the same street where the block guns were kept \u2014 was one of the block guns that formed the basis of the narcotics-related \u00a7 924(c) charge. There were, however, two <em>other </em>guns that were also connected to the racketeering enterprise and conspiracy, neither of which had any apparent connection to the block guns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\">. We also note that the indictment alleged that the \u00a7 924(c) charge relating to the racke<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>teering enterprise and conspiracy was based on firearms that were used or possessed \"on occasions other than those described\u201d in the \u00a7 924(c) charge relating to the narcotics conspiracy.
