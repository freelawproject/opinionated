Popa contends that the district court erred in declining to apply a three-level attempt adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(l). The court reasoned that Popa was not entitled to the adjustment based on its factual finding that he had been about to complete all acts necessary for the successful completion of the substantive offense when he was apprehended. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">Without challenging that factual finding, Popa asserts that the district court erroneously overlooked \u00a7 2X1.1, comment, (n.4), which triggers the attempt reduction where a defendant has completed only part of an intended offense but is assessed losses based on his intended completion of the entire offense. Popa asserts that he was entitled to the reduction because he did not complete his broader scheme of using the access devices to steal money, yet he was assessed the entire intended loss of over $200,000, when in fact there were no actual losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">In applying \u00a7 2Xl.l(b), a sentencing court should consider \u201cthe substantive offense and the defendant\u2019s conduct in relation to that specific offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As in the district court, Popa relies on <em>United States v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263 (5th Cir. 2010), in which we found plain error in the district court\u2019s failure to subtract three levels for a partially completed offense where the defendant was sentenced based on the conspiracy\u2019s intended losses of almost $1.5 million rather than the actual losses of about $75,000. The substantive offense in <em>John, </em>however, was fraud in connection with an access device, which requires both the use of an access device and an actual loss, and only four of the seventy-six devices were in fact used to incur losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Popa\u2019s reliance on <em>John </em>is misplaced, because for its completion, the substantive offense of fraudulently possessing fifteen or more unauthorized access devices does not require any use of the devices or actual losses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1029(a)(3), (b)(1). Furthermore, although the loss calculation in <em>John, </em>597 F.3d at 283-84, was based almost entirely on incomplete offenses, Popa\u2019s loss calculation was derived largely from his completed possession of 427 access devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">More analogous to Popa\u2019s situation is <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>585 Fed.Appx. 869, 870 (5th Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1750, 191 L.Ed.2d 713 (2015), involving the- completed offense of the possession of stolen mail, which likewise does not require actual loss as an element. Finding <em>John, </em>597 F.3d at 283, to be distinguishable, we specifically rejected the argument that \u201cthe key factor in a court\u2019s deciding whether to apply the partially-completed-offense reduction is the amount of criminal activity the defendant still has yet to undertake in order to cause the intended loss.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>585 Fed.Appx. at 870. Instead, we reiterated that \u201cthe focus is on the <em>substantive offense </em>and the defendant\u2019s conduct in relation to that <em>specific offense.\u201d Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in <em>Thomas). </em>We thus concluded that the district court did not plainly err in failing to apply the attempt adjustment in light of \u00a7 2X1.1, comment, (n.4). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Popa acknowledges that <em>Thomas </em>conflicts with his reasoning. Although <em>Thomas </em>was decided under a plain-error standard of review, neither its reasoning nor the facts of the instant case suggest any error by the district court here, even under <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See id.; Soto, </em>819 F.3d at 216. Accordingly, there is no merit to Popa\u2019s contention that his offense was only partially completed under \u00a72X1.1, comment. (n.4). <em>See Thomas, </em>585 Fed.Appx. at 870; <em>accord United States v. Granado, </em>608 Fed.Appx. 247, 248 (5th Cir.) (following <em>Thomas, </em>also on plain-error review), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 423, 193 L.Ed.2d 331 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The district court thus did not err in denying Popa an attempt adjustment under \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(l). <em>See United States v. Soto, </em>819 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir. 2016). The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
