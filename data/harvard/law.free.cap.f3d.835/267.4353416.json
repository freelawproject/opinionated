After receiving unsolicited sexual photographs from a co-worker one night shift, Vasquez promptly informed her supervisor and filed a formal complaint of sexual harassment, which her employer promised to investigate that same morning. Within a few hours, however, Vasquez\u2019s co-worker had discovered her complaint and had provided the employer with false documents purporting to show Vasquez\u2019s consent to and solicitation of a sexual relationship. In reliance on those documents, and notwithstanding Vasquez\u2019s offers to produce evidence in refutation, Vasquez\u2019s employer immediately fired her on the ground that <em>she </em>had engaged in sexual harassment. Vasquez consequently brought suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cNYSHRL\u201d), alleging that she was wrongfully terminated in retaliation for complaining of sexual harassment. The district court dismissed Vasquez\u2019s claims, holding that Vasquez\u2019s employer could not have engaged in retaliation because it could not be held responsible for the retaliatory animus of Vasquez\u2019s co-worker, a low-level employee with no decisionmaking authority. We hold, however, that an employee\u2019s retaliatory intent may be imputed to an employer where, as alleged here, the employer\u2019s own negligence gives effect to the employee\u2019s retaliatory animus and causes the victim to suffer an adverse employment decision. As a result, we vacate the court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">In July 2018, Andrea Vasquez was hired by Empress Ambulance Service, Inc. (\u201cEmpress\u201d) to work as an emergency medical technician on an ambulance crew. In October of that year, Vasquez met Ty-rell Gray, who worked for Empress as a dispatcher and who almost immediately began making romantic overtures to Vasquez. Over the course of their acquaintance, Gray \u201cconstantly asked [Vasquez] out on dates,\u201d \u201cattempted to flirt with her,\u201d and \u201crepeatedly ... put his arm around her or touched her shoulders,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>causing Vasquez \u201cto be extremely uncomfortable\u201d as she tried to reject his advances. App\u2019x 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">This conduct came to a head in January 2014. On January 8, while Vasquez and Gray both worked in Empress\u2019s office, Gray approached Vasquez, placed his arm around her, and asked \u201cWhen are you going to let me take you out?\u201d App\u2019x 9. When Vasquez replied that she had a boyfriend and was not interested in a romantic relationship, Gray insisted that \u201cI bet I can make you leave your man\u201d and promised to \u201csend ... something between you and me.\u201d App\u2019x 9. Around midnight that night, while out on shift, Vasquez received a picture message from Gray: a photograph of his erect penis, captioned \u201cWat u think.\u201d App\u2019x 9-10. Vasquez did not respond to this message or to a follow-up text message from Gray as she continued her work. When Vasquez returned to the office at the conclusion of her shift, however, she was \u201cextremely embarrassed, distraught, and crying.\u201d App\u2019x 10. And she promptly informed an Empress field supervisor about Gray\u2019s conduct. Promising that \u201c[wje\u2019re going to deal with this,\u201d the supervisor walked Vasquez to a computer in Empress\u2019s office and asked that she compose and send a formal complaint right away, which Vasquez began to do. App\u2019x 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">As Vasquez was writing her complaint, however, Gray entered the room \u201cto see a visually distressed [Vasquez] crying and typing at the computer.\u201d App\u2019x 10. Gray, \u201cnoticeably nervous,\u201d asked Vasquez \u201cif she was ok\u201d and, after Vasquez declined to engage his attempts at conversation, stated, \u201cYou\u2019re reporting me, right?\u201d App\u2019x 10. Gray then went out of the room and ran into another emergency medical technician, Almairis Zapata, with whom he began discussing Vasquez\u2019s likely complaint. He asked Zapata, as \u201ca favor,\u201d because he was \u201cafraid he was going to lose his job,\u201d to \u201clie for [him]\u201d and tell their supervisors that Vasquez and Gray had been in a romantic relationship.\u201d App\u2019x 11. Zapata refused, and Gray left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">After Gray\u2019s departure, Vasquez finished writing her complaint, in which she explained that she felt \u201cviolated\u201d and \u201cdisrespected\u201d as a result of Gray\u2019s behavior. She then waited in Empress\u2019s office until Sheri Baia, one of her supervisors, and Elizabeth Shepard, a member of the human resources department, arrived to discuss what had happened. The supervisors thanked Vasquez for \u201ctelling [her] story,\u201d assured her that \u201c[w]e don\u2019t tolerate this sort of behavior here,\u201d and promised to \u201csort the situation out.\u201d App\u2019x 12. To aid in their investigation, Vasquez offered to show the supervisors Gray\u2019s messages on her cell phone, but they rejected her offer. They then asked Vasquez whether she preferred to go home or to wait in the office while they investigated the incident that morning, and Vasquez elected to wait.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Gray, meanwhile, had not finished seeking to undermine the accusations he anticipated from Vasquez. Rather, in the intervening hours, Gray \u201cmanipulated a text message conversation on his iPhone to. make it appear as though a person with whom he had legitimately been engaging in consensually sexual text banter was [Vasquez].\u201d App\u2019x 12. He then \u201ctook screen shots of portions of the conversation, printed them off,\u201d and \u201cpresented it to the management\u201d of Empress as evidence that he and Vasquez had been in a consensual sexual relationship. App\u2019x 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">By the time Vasquez met with a committee of her union representative, Empress\u2019s owner, and Shepard to discuss the incident later that morning, the committee had already considered Gray\u2019s documents and had concluded that Vasquez was \u201chaving an inappropriate sexual relationship\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Gray. App\u2019x 13. Shepard informed Vasquez that Empress \u201ckn[e]w the truth,\u201d as they had spoken with Gray and had seen his \u201cproof\u2019 of her improper conduct by means of \u201cpictures and text messages.\u201d App\u2019x 13. In particular, Shepard reported that Gray had shown them \u201ca racy self-taken photo\u201d that Vasquez had allegedly sent in response to Gray\u2019s explicit picture message, which they considered \u201cproof that [Vasquez] had been sexually harassing [Gray].\u201d App\u2019x 13. Vasquez \u201cadamantly denied\u201d Shepard\u2019s allegations and asserted that Gray was lying, but Shepard insisted that \u201cthe committee had all seen the photograph\u201d and \u201ckn[ew] it was [her in the photo].\u201d App\u2019x 13. She made this assertion even though, in fact, the photo depicted only \u201ca small fraction of a face\u201d that could \u201cby no means [be] concluded to be that of [Vasquez].\u201d App\u2019x 13. When Vasquez asked to see the photograph, moreover, Shepard refused. Likewise, when Vasquez again offered again to show the committee her own cell phone, in an attempt to prove that no such messaging had occurred, the committee declined. They then fired Vasquez for engaging in sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Vasquez subsequently brought suit against Empress<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under Title VII and NYSHRL, claiming that Empress had wrongfully terminated her in retaliation for complaining of sexual harassment. Empress moved to dismiss Vasquez\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and the district court (Buchwald, <em>J.) </em>granted the motion, holding that Gray\u2019s retaliatory intent could not be attributed to Empress and that, therefore, Empress could not have engaged in retaliation against Vasquez. Vasquez now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint and drawing all inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Littlejohn v. City of New York, </em>795 F.3d 297, 306 (2d Cir. 2015). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, \u201cfor a retaliation claim to survive ... a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plausibly allege that: (1) defendants discriminated \u2014 or took an adverse employment action \u2014 against [her], (2) because [s]he has opposed any unlawful employment practice.\u201d <em>Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>801 F.3d 72, 90 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the latter element, a plaintiff must show a \u201cretaliatory purpose\u201d by \u201cplausibly pleading] a connection between the [adverse] act and [the plaintiffs] engagement in protected activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">A. \u201cCat\u2019s Paw\u201d Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Vasquez seeks to recover 'against Empress under what has been termed \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d liability. The phrase derives from an Aesop fable, later put into verse by Jean de La Fontaine, in which a wily monkey flatters a naive cat into pulling roasting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>chestnuts out of a roaring fire for their mutual satisfaction; the monkey, however, \u201cdevour[s] ... them fast,\u201d leaving the cat \u201cwith a burnt paw and no chestnuts\u201d for its trouble. \u201c[IJnjected into United States employment discrimination law by [Judge Richard] Posner in 1990,\u201d <em>Staub v. Proctor Hosp., </em>562 U.S. 411, 415 n.1, 131 S.Ct. 1186, 179 L.Ed.2d 144 (2011), the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d metaphor now \u201crefers to a situation in which an employee is fired or subjected to some other adverse employment action by a supervisor who himself has no discriminatory motive, but who has been manipulated by a subordinate who does have such a motive and intended to bring about the adverse employment action,\u201d <em>Cook v. IPC Intern. Corp., </em>673 F.3d 625, 628 (7th Cir. 2012) (Posner, J.). Because the supervisor, acting as agent of the employer, has permitted himself to be used \u201cas the conduit of [the subordinate\u2019s] prejudice,\u201d <em>Shager v. Upjohn Co., </em>913 F.2d 398, 405 (7th Cir. 1990), that prejudice may then be imputed to the employer and used to hold the employer liable for employment discrimination. In other words, by merely effectuating or \u201crubber-stamp[ing]\u201d a discriminatory employee\u2019s \u201cunlawful design,\u201d <em>Nagle v. Marron, </em>663 F.3d 100, 117 (2d Cir. 2011), the employer plays the credulous cat to the malevolent monkey and, in so doing, allows itself to get burned \u2014 i.e., successfully sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u201cTo date, our Circuit has neither accepted nor rejected the cat\u2019s paw approach.\u201d <em>Nagle, </em>663 F.3d at 118; see <em>also Wright v. City of Syracuse, </em>611 Fed.Appx. 8, 11 n.2 (2d Cir. 2015). The Supreme Court, however, has approved its application under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, a statute \u201cvery similar to Title VII,\u201d <em>Staub, </em>562 U.S. at 417, 131 S.Ct. 1186, and our sister circuits have overwhelmingly adopted the theory in Title VII retaliation cases. <em>See, e.g., Zamora v. City of Houston, </em>798 F.3d 326, 332-33 (5th Cir. 2015); <em>EEOC v. New Breed Logistics, </em>783 F.3d 1057, 1069-70 (6th Cir. 2015); <em>Bennett v. Riceland Foods, Inc., </em>721 F.3d 546, 551-52 (8th Cir. 2013); <em>Hicks v. Forest Preserve Dist. of Cook Cty., Ill., </em>677 F.3d 781, 789-90 (7th Cir. 2012); <em>McKenna v. City of Philadelphia, </em>649 F.3d 171, 180 (3d Cir. 2011). Further, permitting \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d recovery in retaliation cases accords with longstanding precedent in our Court, in the employment-discrimination context, that \u201ca Title VII plaintiff is entitled to succeed, \u2018even absent evidence of illegitimate bias on the part of the ultimate decision maker, so long as the individual shown to have the impermissible bias played a meaningful role in the [decision-making] process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holcomb v. Iona Coll., </em>521 F.3d 130, 143 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., </em>196 F.3d 435, 450 (2d Cir. 1999)). Such a role is surely played by an employee who \u201cmanipulates\u201d an employer into acting as mere \u201cconduit\u201d for his retaliatory intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we now hold that the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>be used to support recovery for claims of retaliation in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">B. Co-Workers and Cat\u2019s Paw(s)</p>\n<p id=\"ALZ\">The mere availability of \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d liability in Title VII retaliation cases, however, does not resolve whether Empress may be held to the fire for its reliance on Gray\u2019s retaliatory information. While the Supreme Court has approved holding an employer liable for the retaliatory intent of one of its \u201csupervisors\u201d under a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory, it specifically \u201cexpress[ed] no view as to whether the employer would be liable if a co-worker, rather than a supervisor, committed a discriminatory act that influenced the ultimate employment decision.\u201d <em>Staub, </em>562 U.S. at 422 n.4, 131 S.Ct. 1186. We must therefore determine in the first instance under what circumstances the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d approach will render an employer responsible for the animus of a low-level employee who works alongside the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">To do so, \u201c[w]e turn to general principles of agency law, for the term \u2018employer\u2019 is defined under Title VII to include \u2018agents\u2019 \u201d and \u201cCongress has directed federal courts to interpret Title VII based on agency principles.\u201d <em>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 754, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998); <em>see also Staub, </em>562 U.S. at 418, 131 S.Ct. 1186 (deriving cat\u2019s paw liability from \u201cgeneral principles of ... agency law\u201d). As set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Ellerth, </em>speaking in a hostile work environment case, there are four circumstances in which \u201cagency principles impose liability on employers even where employees commit torts outside the scope of employment,\u201d and would not ordinarily be deemed \u201cagents\u201d of the employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">(a) the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">(b) the master was negligent or reckless, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">(c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of the master, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal where there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\"><em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 758, 118 S.Ct. 2257 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2) (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Significantly, in addressing employer culpability for employee misconduct, the <em>Ellerth </em>Court expressly noted that Section 219(2)(b) holds employers liable \u201cwhen the [employee\u2019s] tort is attributable to the employer\u2019s own negligence. Thus, although a[n employee\u2019s] sexual harassment is outside the scope of employment ..., an employer can be liable, nonetheless, where its own negligence is a cause of the harassment[, ... i.e.,] if it knew or should have known about the conduct and failed to stop it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758-59, 118 S.Ct. 2257.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">We see no reason why <em>Ellerth, </em>though written in the context of hostile work environment, should not also be read to hold an employer liable under Title VII when, through its own negligence, the employer gives effect to the retaliatory intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>of one of its \u2014 even low-level \u2014 employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Not surprisingly, another circuit court has already determined, in reliance on <em>Ellerth, </em>that a discriminatory termination claim can proceed against an employer who negligently permitted the plaintiffs co-worker, a low-level employee harboring discriminatory intent, to induce the plaintiffs termination. In <em>Velazquez-Perez v. Developers Diversified Realty Corp., </em>the First Circuit explained that the \u201cconclusion that [a biased employee] was not a supervisor d[id] not necessarily absolve [the employer] of potential liability for [the plaintiffs] discharge,\u201d because there was \u201cno basis\u201d to believe that Ellerth\u2019s acceptance of \u201cemployer liability premised on a finding of negligence\u201d should be limited either to \u201ccases of \u2018hostile workplace\u2019 discrimination\u201d or to supervisory employees. 753 F.3d 265, 273 (1st Cir. 2014).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It consequently held that \u201can employer can be held liable under Title VII if: the plaintiffs coworker makes statements maligning the plaintiff, for discriminatory reasons and with the intent to cause the plaintiffs firing; the co-worker\u2019s discriminatory acts proximately cause the plaintiff to be fired; and the employer acts negligently by allowing the co-worker\u2019s acts to achieve their desired effect though it knows (or reasonably should know) of the discriminatory motivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We agree with the First Circuit, and therefore conclude that Vasquez can recover against Empress if Empress was itself negligent in allowing Gray\u2019s false allegations, and the retaliatory intent behind them, to achieve their desired end. Assuming that Empress knew or should have known of Gray\u2019s retaliatory animus, the fact that \u201cGray was nothing more than ... a low-level employee with no supervisory or management authority,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 18, cannot shield Empress from answering for Gray\u2019s conduct because Empress\u2019s own negligence provides an independent basis, under <em>Ellerth </em>and agency law, to treat Gray as Empress\u2019s agent and hold Empress accountable for his unlawful intent. Once . deemed Empress\u2019s agent, Gray stands in the same shoes as <em>Staub\u2019s </em>\u201csupervisor,\u201d and is equally able to play the monkey to Empress\u2019s cat. <em>See Staub, </em>562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>U.S. at 421, 131 S.Ct. 1186 (\u201cThe employer is at fault [in a cat\u2019s paw case] because <em>one of its agents </em>committed an action based on discriminatory animus that was intended to cause, and did in fact cause, an adverse employment decision.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Such a negligence-based approach to \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d liability, moreover, fully comports with established Title VII caselaw in our Circuit requiring that a biased non-decisionmaker play a \u201cmeaningful role\u201d in an adverse employment decision for the unbiased decisionmaker to be culpable. <em>See Bickerstaff, </em>196 F.3d at 450 (\u201cWe recognize that the impermissible bias of a single individual at any stage ... may taint the ultimate employment decision in violation of Title VII. This is true even absent evidence of illegitimate bias on the part of the ultimate decision maker, so long as the individual shown to have the impermissible bias played a meaningful role in the [deci-sionmaking] process.\u201d). Empress\u2019s alleged negligence \u2014 in crediting Gray\u2019s accusations to the exclusion of all other evidence, and specifically declining to examine contrary evidence tendered by Vasquez, when it knew or, with reasonable investigation, should have known of Gray\u2019s retaliatory animus \u2014 caused Gray\u2019s accusations to form the sole basis for Empress\u2019s decision to terminate Vasquez. Thus, as a result of Empress\u2019s negligence, Gray achieved a \u201cmeaningful,\u201d and indeed decisive, role in Vasquez\u2019s termination. Put differently, while Gray might, on other facts, have played no greater part than that of a mere \u201cinformant\u201d or \u201cwitness at a bench trial,\u201d <em>Vasquez v. Empress Ambulance Serv., Inc., </em>14 Civ. 8387, 2015 WL 5037055, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2015) (quoting <em>Staub, </em>562 U.S. at 421, 131 S.Ct. 1186), who simply offered information for the decision-maker\u2019s examination, on the facts before us, viewed in the light most favorable to Vasquez, Gray became the entire case against Vasquez when Empress negligently chose to credit his, and only his, account.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We emphasize that such an approach should not be construed as holding an employer \u201cliable simply because it acts on information provided by a biased coworker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we have long held, when considering the legitimacy of an employer\u2019s reason for an employment action, we look to \u201cwhat <em>\u2018motivated\u2019 </em>the employer\u201d rather than to \u201cthe truth of the allegations against [the] plaintiff\u2019 on which it relies. <em>McPherson v. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>457 F.3d 211, 216 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>see also Jones, </em>796 F.3d at 330 (\u201c[S]howing that an employer incorrectly found an employee guilty.of misconduct is insufficient to prove retaliation.... \u201d). Thus, an employer who, non-negligently and in good faith, relies on a false and malign report of an employee who acted out of unlawful animus cannot, under this \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory, be held accountable for or said to have been \u201cmotivated\u201d by the employee\u2019s animus. And, of course, an employer who negligently relies on a low-level employee\u2019s false accusations in making an employment decision will not be liable under Title VII unless those false accusations themselves were the product of discriminatory or retaliatory intent (although the employer may yet be liable for simple negligence under state law).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Only when an employer in effect adopts an employee\u2019s unlawful animus by acting <em>negligently </em>with respect to the information provided by the employee, and thereby affords that biased employee an outsize role in its own employment decision, can the employee\u2019s motivation be imputed to the employer and used to support a claim under Title VII. Put simply, an employer can still \u201cjust get it wrong\u201d without incurring liability under Title VII, Supp. App\u2019x 114, but it cannot \u201cget it wrong\u201d without recourse if in doing so it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>negligently allows itself to be used as conduit for even a low-level employee\u2019s discriminatory or retaliatory prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Having determined that Vasquez can recover against Empress if Empress negligently gave effect to Gray\u2019s retaliatory animus, we need now only decide whether Vasquez has sufficiently pled that Empress acted negligently in its treatment of Gray\u2019s and Vasquez\u2019s accusations. Although Vasquez does not use the term \u201cnegligence\u201d in her complaint, we conclude that she has pled facts from which a reasonable person could infer that Empress knew or should have known that Gray\u2019s accusations were the product of retaliatory intent and thus should not have been trusted. First, the fact that Gray had just learned that he had been accused by Vasquez of sexual harassment provided Gray with an obvious reason to lie and paint Vasquez as the perpetrator rather than the victim. With Gray more closely resembling a vengeful suspect than an independent informant, Empress had cause to treat with some skepticism his \u201che-said, she-said\u201d cross-accusations. In\u2019addition, as Vasquez notes, \u201cthe timing ... is also suspicious,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 20: it seems unlikely that Vasquez should go from eagerly trading explicit messages to reporting such conduct as unwelcome harassment within the space of only six hours. It likewise seems strange that the very morning Gray is accused by Vasquez of harassment he should, when questioned by Empress, just happen to have on hand printed copies of amorous text messages purportedly received from Vasquez to substantiate his claim that she initiated the inappropriate exchange. Moreover, those messages themselves, viewed in the light most favorable to Vasquez, provide reason to distrust Gray\u2019s account: according to Vasquez\u2019s complaint, the racy picture message \u201cwas by no means unequivocally of [Vasquez],\u201d as it showed only \u201ca small fraction of a face which can by no means [be] concluded to be that of [Vasquez].\u201d App\u2019x 13.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Empress, however, chose to ignore these warning signs and instead blindly credited Gray\u2019s assertions, obstinately refusing to inspect Vasquez\u2019s phone or to receive any other evidence proffered by Vasquez in refutation. Accordingly, accepting Vasquez\u2019s allegations as true, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that Empress acted negligently in terminating Vasquez solely on the basis of Gray\u2019s accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In sum, we hold that an employer may be held liable for an employee\u2019s animus under a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory, regardless of the employee\u2019s role within the organization, if the employer\u2019s own negligence gives effect to the employee\u2019s animus and causes the victim to suffer an adverse employment action. Because Vasquez has plausibly alleged that Empress\u2019s negligence permitted Gray\u2019s retaliatory intent to achieve its desired effect \u2014 her termination \u2014 her claims for retaliation against Empress may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the judgment of the District Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">. Because this appeal involves review at the motion to dismiss stage, we base this factual background on the allegations contained in Vasquez's complaint, which we assume to be true. <em>See Littlejohn v. City of New York, </em>795 F.3d 297, 303 n.1 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. Vasquez also filed suit against Gray individually, but later consented to dismissal without prejudice of the claims against him, in response to an issue about service.

Because \"[t]he standards for evaluating ... retaliation claims are identical under Title VII and the NYSHRL,\u201d our analysis does not distinguish between Vasquez\u2019s federal and state claims. <em>Kelly v. Howard I. Shapiro &amp; Assoc. Consulting Eng\u2019rs, P.C., </em>716 F.3d 10, 14 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\">. We note that the parties do not dispute on appeal whether Vasquez has adequately pled Gray's retaliatory intent. In any event, we conclude that Vasquez\u2019s allegations are more than sufficient to meet her minimal burden plausibly to plead Gray\u2019s retaliatory intent. To do so, she need only plausibly plead that: (1) Gray desired his actions to cause, or knew that his actions were substantially certain to result in, adverse employment action for Vasquez, <em>see Staub, </em>562 U.S. at 422 n.3, 131 S.Ct. 1186; and (2) he took those actions \"because [s]he ha[d] made a charge\u201d of sexual harassment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) \u2014 i.e., he would not have taken those actions if Vasquez had not filed a complaint with human resources, <em>see Univ. of Texas </em>Sw. <em>Med. Ctr. v. </em>Nassar,-U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2533, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013) (holding that \"but-for\u201d causation is the proper standard for claims of retaliation under Title VII).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">. We note that a new Restatement of Agency has been published since the Supreme Court decided <em>Ellerth, </em>which discusses employer liability for employee torts committed outside the scope of employment in a somewhat different way. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.04. Because both parties rely on the language of the Second Restatement as embodied in <em>Ellerth, </em>however, we likewise use that Restatement's formulation of agency principles to guide our analysis. In any event, the Third Restatement continues to hold employers responsible for harm caused by employees as a result of the employer's negligence. See Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.05; <em>id. </em>cmt. b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b298-4\">. We decline Empress's invitation to find that Vasquez failed to raise this argument below and to deem the issue forfeited. At the district court, Vasquez argued that Gray's retaliatory intent should be imputed to Empress under a \"cat\u2019s paw\u201d theory and that the patent insufficiency of Empress's investigation supported imposition of employer liability. <em>See also </em>Supp. App\u2019x 114 (stating, at oral argument before the district court, that \"the adequacy of the investigation is intertwined with the cat's paw theory of liability,\u201d as determined by \"a negligenfce] standard\u201d). Although Vasquez failed to articulate precisely that the insufficiency of the investigation constituted negligence and that such negligence permitted imputation of Gray\u2019s intent, we believe her arguments sufficed to raise the issue we address here. Regardless, \u201cthe rule against considering arguments raised for the first time on appeal is prudential, not jurisdictional, and we are free to exercise our discretion to consider waived arguments ... where[, as here,] an argument presents a question of law and does not require additional fact finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Brunner, </em>726 F.3d 299, 304 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. <em>See also id. </em>(\"Suppose, for example, that a white employee repeatedly taunts a black coworker with vicious racial epithets and also lodges a series of false complaints about the victim to their supervisor in a racially motivated attempt to have the victim fired. Certainly the employer could be held liable for negligently permitting the taunting. So, too, the employer should be liable if it fires the victim based on complaints that it knew (or reasonably should have known) were the product of discriminatory animus. In either situation, the same elements are present: an act of discrimination is allowed to cause harm by an employer that knows or reasonably should know of the discrimination.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\">. In support of its motion to dismiss, Empress attached a copy of the text-message exchange provided by Gray, but the district court does not appear to have considered the document in reaching its judgment, and we therefore do not rely on the document to support our conclusion here. We note, however, that were we to consider the text-message printout as a document incorporated by reference in Vasquez\u2019s complaint, <em>see DiFolco v. MSNBC Cable L.L.C., </em>622 F.3d 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2010), we would find additional fodder to support the inference that Empress should not have believed Gray's account: for instance, the exchange indicates that Gray\u2019s texting partner was \"[a]sleep\u201d at 12:03 AM on January 9th, a time when Vasquez was actually on shift working for Empress. <em>See </em>Supp. App\u2019x 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
