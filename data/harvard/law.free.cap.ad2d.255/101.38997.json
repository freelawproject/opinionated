Cos., </em>88 NY2d 321, 326-327), we find that the policies are unambiguous in setting forth the duration of premium payments, that the entire contract consists only of the policy and the insured\u2019s application, and that agents lack authority to change the policy or application or make promises or statements binding on defendant. Accordingly, the computer generated vanishing premium illustrations and alleged oral misrepresentations on which plaintiffs base their causes of action for breach of contract and fraud are inadmissible parol, rendering such causes of action insufficient. Moreover, in light of the express terms of the policies clearly indicating the duration of the required premium payments, plaintiffs\u2019 claimed reliance on the alleged misrepresentations and illustrations was unreasonable. Nor are there sufficient allegations of a fiduciary or confidential relationship to support the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment and imposition of a constructive trust <em>(see, Kimmell v Schaefer, </em>89 NY2d 257, 263-264). The alleged reliance and trust necessary for a finding of such relationship are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>stated in conclusory fashion <em>(see, Societe Nationale D\u2019Exploitation Industrielle Des Tabacs Et Allumettes v Salomon Bros. Intl., </em>251 AD2d 137), and defendant\u2019s superior knowledge of the actuarial assumptions and the variables affecting when and whether the policy dividends would render the premiums self-liquidating, acquired as a result of its experience in selling insurance, does not create such a relationship <em>(see, Elghanian v Harvey, </em>249 AD2d 206). In any event, even if such a relationship had arisen and given rise to a duty to speak accurately, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance still had to be reasonable <em>(General Elec. Capital Corp. v United States Trust Co., </em>238 AD2d 144), and, as noted, it was not. The absence of any viable tort or breach of contract claim, and the absence of any deceptive or misleading practice, preclude plaintiffs\u2019 claims for equitable relief and negligent supervision of defendant\u2019s agents, as well as their statutory causes of action under General Business Law \u00a7 349 and Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 2123 and 4226. In view of the foregoing, it is unnecessary to reach the other grounds urged for affirmance. We have considered plaintiffs\u2019 other contentions and find them to be without merit.
