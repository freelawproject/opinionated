He argues that the district court erred in determining his criminal history category, USSG \u00a7 4A1.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and erred in increasing his offense level by four upon finding that he possessed the firearm in connection with another felony, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Finding no reversible error, we affirm Cole\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-18\">Cole argues that the sentencing court erred in determining that his sentence on his prior state charges of burglary and driving while under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) exceeded one year and one month and therefore awarding three criminal history points under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(a), rather than two points under \u00a7 4Al.l(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cole asserts that his total sentence on those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>offenses was seven months, seventeen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Cole\u2019s failure to object to this sentencing issue in the district court amounts to a waiver of his right to raise the issue on appeal, absent plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.Sd 1350, 1355-56 (4th Cir. 1996); <em>United States v. Grubb, </em>11 F.3d 426, 440 (4th Cir.1993). To consider an issue under the plain error standard, the court must find that (1) an error was committed, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Lockhart, 58 </em>F.3d 86, 88 (4th Cir.1995). Before it will reach an issue, the court must also determine that failure to address the error will \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736 (quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The state court order imposed sentences for the DUI and burglary offenses, suspended the sentences, and directed that Cole be assigned to West Virginia\u2019s youthful offender program, for six months to two years. The state court further gave Cole credit for seven months and seventeen days served awaiting sentencing. Less than seven months later, the state court entered an order noting that Cole had successfully completed the youthful offender program and placing him on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">We have previously determined that a sentence satisfied by completing West Virginia\u2019s youthful offender program constitutes a term of imprisonment, rather than one of probation. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>988 F.2d 493, 497 (4th Cir.1993). Here, although Cole asserts that he completed the youthful offender program in seven months and seventeen days, and therefore that is the total length of his sentence on the DUI and burglary offenses, the record supports a contrary conclusion. When initially sentencing Cole, the state court awarded him credit for time served prior to sentencing. The length of this time was seven months and seventeen days. The time span between the date of the initial sentencing and referral to the youthful offender program and the date that the court noted Cole\u2019s completion of the program and released him to probation is a few days less than seven months. The sum of these terms of imprisonment exceeds one year and one month. It is upon this reasoning that the sentencing court concluded that Cole\u2019s sentence for the DUI and burglary offenses exceeded one year and one month, and thus three criminal history points were warranted. Because the record does not show that the district court\u2019s determination of his criminal history category was plainly erroneous, we find that this issue is waived and we decline to address it. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-36 (providing plain error standard); <em>Ford, </em>88 F.3d at 1355-56 (discussing waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Cole also argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by four based on its finding that he used the firearm in connection with the felony offense of malicious wounding. Cole argues that he fired the weapon in self-defense and to ward off an attack by the victim. He asserts that he did not commit the offense of malicious wounding and, in fact, the state charge of malicious wounding was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a four-level increase if the firearm was \u201cused or possessed ... in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>another felony offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). \u201cFelony offense\u201d is defined to mean \u201cany offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.7). Thus, contrary to Cole\u2019s assertion, the fact that the state charge of malicious wounding was dismissed does not preclude the federal sentencing court from finding that Cole used the firearm in connection with the crime of malicious wounding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Addressing Cole\u2019s self-defense assertion, the district court considered his account of the incident between Cole and the victim. The court also noted the location of the shots: one to the victim\u2019s stomach \u2014 which was deflected by the victim\u2019s leather jacket \u2014 and one \u201cto the left shoulder, which did penetrate, hit the back of the shoulder.\u201d The court found that the location of the shot \u201ccuts heavily against the argument that the defendant here acted in self-defense.\u201d We find that the preponderance of the evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Cole did \u201cmaliciously shoot ... [a] person ... with intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill.\u201d W. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61-2-9 (2000); <em>see United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1237-38 (4th Cir.1989) (providing standard). We therefore find that the four-level increase to Cole\u2019s offense level was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Cole\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.1 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-10\">.
