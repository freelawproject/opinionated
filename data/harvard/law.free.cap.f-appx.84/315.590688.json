On appeal, he alleges that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance and that the Government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Dale claims his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a continuance at sentencing. Generally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal. To allow for adequate development of a record, a defendant must bring his claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Here, Dale has failed to meet the high burden necessary to raise ineffective assistance of counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Next, Dale claims that the Government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct because it failed to make a motion for a downward departure for substantial assistance under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2001). We find nothing improper regarding the Government\u2019s failure to make the motion. The Government did not promise to make such a motion in its plea agreement with Dale, <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2000), and there is no evidence that it refused to make the motion for an improper motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Dale\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
