We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact at sentencing for clear error, and its application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Anderson, </em>174 F.3d 515, 524 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-23\">Davis argues that the district court erred in finding that all of the checks seized were passable when determining the total amount of the loss involved in this case. With respect to all of the checks, except for one, check number 87561466, payable to Velma Ervin in the amount of $1,395.20, Davis has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding them to be passable. <em>See Anderson, </em>174 F.3d at 524. Whether the district court erred in finding the $1,395.20 check to be passable is arguable. However, even assuming error, such error is harmless because Davis\u2019 guideline imprisonment range would have remained the same and there is no indication in the record that the specific amount of the loss within the applicable range of loss affected the district court\u2019s selection of the 18-month sentence imposed. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
