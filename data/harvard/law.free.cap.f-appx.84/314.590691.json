R.Crim.P. 36, which the district court construed as a successive motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. He also appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a post-conviction proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeal-ability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and Fleming\u2019s preliminary informal brief on appeal and conclude that Fleming has not made the requisite showing. To the extent Fleming\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
