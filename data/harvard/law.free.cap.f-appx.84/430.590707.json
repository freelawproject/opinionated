They request review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed the decision of the immigration judge (IJ) to deny their application for asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Bettran-Resendez v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-20\">Jean has failed to show that the evidence compels a conclusion different from the conclusion reached by the IJ and the BIA that any mistreatment of Jean did not rise to the level of either persecution or torture and that the mistreatment was the result of a personal property dispute and not \u201con account of\u2019 Jean\u2019s ethnicity or political opinion. <em>See Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 582-84 (5th Cir.1996) (mistreatment neither severe nor on account of protected factor); <em>Fleurinor v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 129, 132-34 (5th Cir.1978) (mistreatment not at level of persecution); <em>see also Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cCAT does not require persecution, but the higher bar of torture.\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (defining torture).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">Messeret likewise failed to show that any inconvenience she faced in Ethiopia or any mistreatment she might face in either Ethiopia or Rwanda amounted to persecution or torture. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907; <em>Abdel-Masieh, </em>73 F.3d at 582, 584; <em>Fleurinor, </em>585 F.2d at 132-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"AAvj\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
