Gillus.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-25\">We review the Board\u2019s decisions for errors of law and to ascertain whether the Board adhered to its statutorily mandated standard for reviewing the ALJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>Gilchrist v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>135 F.3d 915, 918 (4th Cir.1998). The factual findings of the ALJ must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3) (2000). Review of legal questions is de novo, and no deference is due to the Board\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Gilchrist, </em>135 F.3d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>An employee covered by the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (2000), is entitled to compensation for a disability resulting from a work-related injury sustained on the navigable waters of the United States. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (2000). \u201cDisability,\u201d the Supreme Court has held, \u201cis a measure of earning capacity lost as a result of work-related injury.\u201d <em>Metro. Stevedore Co. v. Rambo (\u201cRambo II\u201d), </em>521 U.S. 121, 127, 117 S.Ct. 1953, 138 L.Ed.2d 327 (1997). Compensation is authorized not for the physical injury itself but for the economic harm arising out of the worker\u2019s diminished wage-earning capacity. <em>See id. </em>The character of the disability determines the method of compensation. <em>Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>449 U.S. 268, 272, 101 S.Ct. 509, 66 L.Ed.2d 446 (1980). For permanent partial injuries to specific body parts covered by \u00a7 908(c)(l)-(20) of the Act (\u201cthe schedule\u201d), awards are calculated based on the schedule formula pertaining to the particular injury, without regard to the economic effects of the injury. <em>Gilchrist, </em>135 F.3d at 918. However, \u201ca worker is entitled to nominal compensation when [her] work-related injury has not diminished [her] present wage-earning capacity under current circumstances, but there is a significant potential that the injury will cause diminished capacity under future conditions.\u201d <em>Rambo II, </em>521 U.S. at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The LHWCA provides that a prior award of compensation may be modified \u201con the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 (2000). The review process may commence by application of any interested party. <em>See id. </em>An application for modification must be made within one year from the date of any denial or termination of benefits. <em>See id.; Rambo II, </em>521 U.S. at 129. \u201cWhile a claimant\u2019s application for modification need not meet any particular form, there must be some basis for a reasonable person to conclude that a modification request has been made.\u201d <em>I.T.O. Corp. v. Pettus, </em>73 F.3d 523, 527 (4th Cir.1996). Section \u201c922\u2019s requirement that review commence within one year is not automatically fulfilled by just any communication from the claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the communication must show an intent to seek compensation for a \u201cparticular loss.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Board did not err when it affirmed the ALJ\u2019s award of de minimis benefits to Gillus. Section 908(c) applies only to permanent partial disabilities. Gillus has never been found to have a permanent partial disability. Gillus\u2019s previous awards were for temporary total disability. NNS does not contest the Board\u2019s conclusion that Gillus\u2019s injury is a temporary partial disability under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(e). A claimant\u2019s future earning capacity may be considered when issuing an award under \u00a7 908(e). <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(h). Furthermore, NNS waived its objection that it did not have notice of Gillus\u2019s de minimis claim by not raising this issue in its motion for reconsideration before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Second, because Gillus\u2019s claim for de minimis benefits was pending when she filed her temporary total disability claim, Gillus\u2019s second claim was timely. The Board therefore did not err when it affirmed the ALJ\u2019s compensation award for Gillus\u2019s additional days of temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Benefits Review Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
