Chesseman argues that the administrative law judge\u2019s determination that she was not disabled is based on errors of law and is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-20\">Having reviewed the record and briefs on appeal, we conclude that the administrative law judge applied the correct legal standard in determining whether Chesseman was disabled, and the administrative law judge\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-25\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
