Harris appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Harris asserts that the district court clearly erred when it increased his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense. He argues that the \u201cother felony offense\u201d used by the district court as grounds for the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) increase, <em>ie., </em>assault by offensive touching of a public servant, is not a felony under Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">We review the district court\u2019s findings for clear error and its legal interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir. 1997). A finding is clearly erroneous only if \u201cit is implausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1199 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5), U.S.S.G., mandates a four-level increase if the defendant used or possessed any firearm in connection with another felony offense. Another \u201cfelony offense\u201d is defined as any federal, state, or local offense that is punishable by a term of imprisonment that exceeds one year \u201cwhether or not a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">Under Texas law, a person commits a third-degree felony assault when he knowingly causes bodily injury to a person whom he knows is a public servant lawfully discharging an official duty. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) &amp; (b) (Vernon 2003); <em>Bryant v. Texas, </em>47 S.W.3d 80 (Tex.Ct. App.2001). Campus police officers are peace officers. Tex.Code Crim. Proc. art. \u00a7 2.12(8) (West Supp.1993); <em>State v. Carroll, </em>855 S.W.2d 128, 129 (Tex.Ct.App. 1993). Bodily injury is defined as \u201c \u2018physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.\u2019 \u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1.07(a)(8) (Vernon 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">The record supports the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) increase. <em>See </em>Tex.Code Crim. Proc. art. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(b); <em>Bryant v. State, </em>47 S.W.3d 80, 82-83 (Tex. Ct.App.2001). The district court\u2019s finding that Harris\u2019 conduct supported the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) increase is not implausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Condren, </em>18 F.3d at 1199; <em>see United States v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 687 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (district court\u2019s judgment may be affirmed on any alternative ground that is supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-17\">Harris challenges his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction as a violation of the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment. He argues that the Government did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>not produce evidence that the firearm was in or substantially affected interstate commerce. He asserts that evidence showing that at some point the firearm traveled in interstate commerce does not satisfy the jurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Harris also asserts that his indictment and the factual basis for his plea were insufficient because the evidence established only that the firearm had traveled across state lines at some unspecified point in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Harris acknowledges that he raises these arguments solely to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review. As he concedes, the arguments are foreclosed by existing Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Darrington, </em>351 F.3d 632 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
