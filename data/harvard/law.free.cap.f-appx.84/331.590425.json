We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">A determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld unless that determination is \u201cmanifestly contrary to law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). This Court will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">We find the evidence does not compel a finding that Hassen established either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. The immigration judge\u2019s finding that Hassen was not credible is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">We further find Hassen was not prejudiced as a result of alleged due process errors occurring during the hearing before the immigration judge and on appeal to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">The standard for receiving withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Hassen failed to establish entitlement to asylum, she cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
