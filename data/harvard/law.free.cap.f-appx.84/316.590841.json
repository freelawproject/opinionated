On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issues: (1) whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, and (2) whether the Government\u2019s failure to move for a downward departure for substantial assistance under U.S. <em>Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2001) constitutes prosecutorial misconduct. Rector has filed a pro se informal brief and supplement alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. For the reasons that follow, we grant Rector\u2019s motion to amend his pro se supplement and affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">Generally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal; to allow for adequate development of a record, a defendant must bring his claim under a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). We find that neither counsel nor Rector has raised claims of ineffective assistance cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">We do not find that the Government\u2019s failure to move for downward departure for substantial assistance constitutes prosecutorial misconduct. The Government was not obligated under its plea agreement with Rector to so move, <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2000), and there is no indication that it refused to make the motion for an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
