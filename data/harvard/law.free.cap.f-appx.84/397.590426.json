First, he argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose such an order. A court\u2019s imposition of sanctions, such as here, stems from its inherent power. <em>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991); <em>Crowe v. Smith, </em>151 F.3d 217, 266 (5th Cir.1998). The district court was not without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Second, Prewitt argues that he was never informed of \u201cthe specific sanctionable actions at issue\u201d in his show-cause hearing. The district court provided Prewitt with 81 pages of written material relating to his sanctionable conduct. Prewitt has not shown that the notice he received deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>See City of West Covina v. Perkins, </em>525 U.S. 234, 240, 119 S.Ct. 678, 142 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Third, Prewitt argues that Judge Mills, the district court judge who presided over Prewitt\u2019s show-cause hearing, was biased against him. Disqualification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 is appropriate if a \u201creasonable man, were he to know all the circumstances, would harbor doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Levitt v. University of Texas at El Paso, </em>847 F.2d 221, 226 (5th Cir.1988) (citations omitted). Prewitt\u2019s speculation that Judge Mills is biased because of a previously dismissed case in which Judge Mills was neither a party nor the adjudicator is conclusional. He has not shown that a reasonable person would harbor doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">Fourth, Prewitt argues that he was sanctioned on February 27, 1996, and again on April 1, 1996, for the same conduct. The district court held that the April 1996 sanction order was void for failure to comply with due process standards. There is no meaningful relief available that would redress this alleged wrong. Therefore, this issue is moot. <em>See First Indiana Fed. Sav. Bank v. F.D.I.C., </em>964 F.2d 503, 507 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">Fifth, Prewitt argues that the sanctions order violates his First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has stated the general principle that \u201cthe First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.\u201d <em>U.S. Postal Serv. v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Ass\u2019ns, </em>453 U.S. 114, 129, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981). Moreover, the district court found Prewitt to be a threat to public safety, which presents a legitimate cause for limiting his access to the courthouse. <em>See e.g., Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York, </em>519 U.S. 357, 375, 117 S.Ct. 855, 137 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997) (First Amendment rights may be narrowed for legitimate public safety concerns). Prewitt has not shown that the sanctions amount to a First Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">Last, Prewitt argues that the district court failed to comply with the mandate rule, the sanctions order violates his rights under the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses, and the sanctions order is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>unconstitutionally vague. We decline to address these arguments as they are raised for the first time in this appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
