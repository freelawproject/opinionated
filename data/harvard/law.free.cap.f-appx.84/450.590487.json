She contends that the Government improperly adduced and commented at trial on evidence of her silence and calm demeanor manifested prior to her being advised of her rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Barron did not object at trial, and she fails to show that there was any plain or obvious error that affected her substantial rights with regard to the evidence or the Government\u2019s comment upon it. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Flores, </em>246 F.3d 451, 457 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Fletcher v. Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 606-07, 102 S.Ct. 1309, 71 L.Ed.2d 490 (1982); <em>United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 930 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-22\">Barron asserts that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Barron concedes that her claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580 (5th Cir. 2000). She raises the issue only to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-23\">Barron\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
