She argues that the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u2019s\u201d) decision is not supported by substantial evidence because the medical expert\u2019s opinion was meaningless because of (1) the ALJ\u2019s failure to comply with the Appeals Council\u2019s remand order and (2) the expert\u2019s failure to consider Catina\u2019s asthma. Rogers also argues that the ALJ failed fully and fairly to develop the record regarding Catina\u2019s mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits is limited to determining whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards are applied. <em>Ripley v. Chafer, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995). If there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s findings, the findings are conclusive, and the decision must be affirmed. <em>Martinez v. Chafer, </em>64 F.3d 172, 173 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Our review of the record reveals that the ALJ complied with the Appeals Council\u2019s order. Additionally, the record shows that the medical expert did not \u201cfactor in\u201d Catina\u2019s asthma, because there was no recent medical evidence in the record regarding that condition. Nevertheless, in reaching his decision, the ALJ gave full consideration to all of Catina\u2019s impairments, including her asthma. In reaching his decision, the ALJ did not rely solely on the expert\u2019s report. He also relied on the medical evidence, evidence supplied by Catina\u2019s school, and testimony from Catina and her mother. The record contains substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Catina is not disabled. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">According to the record, Catina has (1) a mild mental disability; (2) attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder that is controlled by medication; and (3) mild asthma. Rogers asserts that Catina\u2019s impairments meet the requirements of 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 112.05D. To be disabled under that section, a claimant must have \u201c[a] valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 <em>and </em>a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">Catina\u2019s last reported IQ test scores do not fall within the 60 to 70 range. Rogers\u2019 argument that the ALJ should have ordered additional testing is without merit, because Rogers cannot show that she was prejudiced by the decision. <em>See Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 142 (5th Cir.2000). Even assuming that Catina\u2019s scores fell within the 60 to 70 range, she cannot show that her remaining impairments impose \u201can additional and significant limitation of function.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 112.05D. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
