Prudential Securities Group, Inc., </em>145 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The appellants argue that their interpretation of the Plan to require Harris to be \u201cactively at work\u201d on February 1, 2000, was legally correct. However, their interpretation of the Plan was legally incorrect because the Plan did not contain an \u201cactively at work\u201d requirement and because the correct eligibility date was January 1, 2000. <em>See Wildbur v. ARGO Chemical Co., </em>974 F.2d 631, 637-38 (5th Cir.1992). Furthermore, Gamble\u2019s interpretation of the Plan and its denial of benefits to Harris were an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The appellants also argue that the district court should not have awarded Harris attorneys\u2019 fees. However, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Harris attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Therefore, the district court\u2019s ruling in favor of Harris and its award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Harris are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
