Whitt, Mississippi state prisoner # 38894, has filed a motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal, following the district court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissing Whitt\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. By moving for IFP status, Whitt is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">We ordinarily require a district court to state its reasons for certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See id. </em>Here the reasons are apparent from the record and a remand for their formal statement by the district court would be a pointless exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Whitt has failed to challenge specifically the district court\u2019s finding that his appeal was not taken in good faith and was legally frivolous. Although this court liberally construes <em>pro se </em>briefs, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), the court requires arguments to be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Because Whitt has failed to address the only appealable issue, the district court\u2019s certification of the appeal as frivolous, he has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">Whitt\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cm. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Whitt therefore has two \u201cstrikes\u201d under \u00a7 1915(g), including the one imposed by the district court. Whitt is warned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
