He also argues that the duration of his detention violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-24\">Suppression hearing testimony indicates that the police officers stopped the vehicle in which Fleming was a passenger because the taillights were continuously lit. The officer testified that it appeared that the vehicle was braking when it was not. Specifically, the police officer testified that he stopped the vehicle pursuant to Texas Transp. Code \u00a7 547.323 because the vehicle had defective taillights, which were a traffic hazard. The district court correctly determined that a taillight that is constantly on and that cannot signal when a vehicle is braking does not comply with the Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Transportation Code. <em>See </em>Texas Transp. Code \u00a7\u00a7 545.105, 545.106, 547.323 (Vernon 2003). Because the police officers had probable cause to believe that a traffic violation was occurring when they observed the vehicle\u2019s defective taillights, the decision to stop the vehicle was reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). The appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Lopez-Valdez, </em>178 F.3d 282 (5th Cir.1999), is misplaced. In <em>Lopez-Valdez, </em>the observed defect in the taillight upon which the traffic stop was based was not a violation of the Texas Transportation Code and did not provide a basis for the officer\u2019s belief that a traffic violation had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Suppression hearing testimony also indicates that after the vehicle was stopped, the officers requested a computer check after ensuring their own safety. Questioning both before the computer check and while the computer check was pending provided reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that a search of the vehicle was warranted. Thus, the detention did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d 431, 435 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>328 F.3d 755, 758 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
