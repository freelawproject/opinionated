R. Civ. P. 11. The fees were awarded on the basis that the claims asserted by Todd and his attorney were not warranted by existing law and did not constitute nonfrivolous arguments for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2). In his complaint, Todd alleged that his Fourth Amendment right to privacy was violated when non-community-property items in his home were taken by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>estranged wife, who was accompanied by Deputy McGaskey (at Sheriff Jones\u2019 direction) and two other officers pursuant to a state court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">This court reviews Rule 11 sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Mercury Air Group, Inc. v. Mansour, </em>237 F.3d 542, 548 (5th Cir.2001). Neither Sheriff Jones nor Deputy McGaskey searched the home, and neither seized any items from the home. Todd failed to provide citation to any relevant case law suggesting that Sheriff Jones or Deputy McGaskey violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Rule 11. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
