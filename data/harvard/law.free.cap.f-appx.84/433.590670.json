Shipman, Texas prisoner # 583548, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous. Shipman argues his arrest was unconstitutional because a pharmacist cannot dispense medication for the purpose of a police investigation; the prosecutors, his defense counsel, and the clerk of court are not absolutely immune from suit for monetary damages; the trial judge is not absolutely immune from suit for declaratory and injunctive relief; the district court erred in denying his motion to amend his complaint; the district court erred in finding his claims were barred by the statute of limitations; and the county is liable for the acts of its officials who conspired to violate his constitutional rights. He has abandoned his claim that the county is liable for keeping an \u201copen file.\u201d <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-25\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Shipman\u2019s complaint as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir.1998). The dismissal of Shipman\u2019s claims for monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, based upon the defendants\u2019 alleged con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>spiracy to unconstitutionally arrest, convict, and imprison him, was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Brandley v. Keeshan, </em>64 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>see also Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). Moreover, as the claims sought to be raised in Shipman\u2019s amended complaint were frivolous, the failure of the district court to consider those claims was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 61; <em>Heck, </em>512 at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Gonzales, </em>157 F.3d at 1019; Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Shipman\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Shipman\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Shipman that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Shipman\u2019s motion to expedite his appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
