Wyatt argues the discovering officer lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the protective frisk that led to the subsequent discovery of the firearm and lacked probable cause to search his vehicle. Because we are satisfied that both the frisk and search of Wyatt\u2019s vehicle were reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">On October 12, 2001, Sergeant Samuel Lake of the West Virginia State Police pulled Wyatt over for speeding. At Sergeant Lake\u2019s request, Wyatt exited his vehicle and began walking with Sergeant Lake back to Lake\u2019s patrol car. As the two approached the patrol car, Sergeant Lake stopped, turned (coming within twelve to sixteen inches of Wyatt), and asked Wyatt whether he had any guns or knives in his possession. Wyatt dug his left hand into the left front pocket of his jeans and produced two knives, which Sergeant Lake directed Wyatt to place on the trunk of his car. Wyatt returned to his car as Sergeant Lake directed but deposited the knives instead through the open driver\u2019s side window.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">As Wyatt walked back to where Sergeant Lake stood, Sergeant Lake noted that items remained in the right front pocket of his jeans. Sergeant Lake asked Wyatt whether he had \u201canything else\u201d on him and stepped toward Wyatt as he finished his question. Sergeant Lake\u2019s arm extended slightly in the direction of Wyatt\u2019s right front pocket. At the same</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">time, Wyatt began to stop and withdraw his arms from the area in front of his waist. Pausing only momentarily after Wyatt stopped moving, Sergeant Lake patted down Wyatt\u2019s jeans, starting with the right front pocket. Sergeant Lake felt hard objects in his pocket, including one he believed could have been a knife. Following the conclusion of the frisk and at Sergeant Lake\u2019s request, Wyatt withdrew a third knife and a small amount of marijuana from the right front pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Sergeant Lake asked Wyatt to join him in his patrol car as he wrote the traffic citation. During the discussion, Wyatt admitted having prior arrests for possession of marijuana. Wyatt also admitted there was a marijuana \u201croach\u201d on the center console of his car. Sergeant Lake continued the traffic stop while a canine drug detection unit arrived to investigate Wyatt\u2019s vehicle. The dog\u2019s handler indicated that the dog gave a positive indication for contraband in the area of the front passenger-side floorboard and center console, prompting Sergeant Lake to search those areas. In doing so, Sergeant Lake discovered a loaded North American Arms .22 caliber revolver in the closed center console compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Following Wyatt\u2019s indictment on the sole charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000), he moved to suppress the revolver found in his car. Wyatt argued that Sergeant Lake lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the frisk that lead to its eventual discovery. The district court disagreed, finding that Wyatt\u2019s conduct provided an adequate basis from which to imply his consent to be frisked, and that the circumstances presented a reasonable suspicion that Wyatt possessed additional weapons. Wyatt thereafter pled guilty to the \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge while reserving his right to challenge the district court\u2019s rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ing on his suppression motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). The district court imposed a fifty-one month custodial sentence followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In this appeal, Wyatt renews his contention that Sergeant Lake\u2019s frisk violated the Fourth Amendment. He argues specifically that the circumstances of the stop did not provide Sergeant Lake with an adequate basis to frisk him after he discarded the knives that were in his left front pocket. In addition, Wyatt challenges Lake\u2019s search of his vehicle as an independent violation of the Fourth Amendment. We examine these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The standard of review applicable to the denial of a motion to suppress is mixed. The legal determinations underlying the denial of a motion to suppress are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Hamlin, </em>319 F.3d 666, 671 (4th Cir.2003). This includes determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). However, the factual findings on which those determinations are made are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Our review of the facts must be conducted in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, <em>Hamlin, </em>319 F.3d at 671, and we must give \u201cdue weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Fourth Amendment jurisprudence makes it clear that a police officer observing unusual conduct that \u201cleads him reasonably to conclude ... that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous,\u201d may both briefly stop those individuals for questioning and conduct a pat-down of the outer surfaces of their clothing. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The prerequisites for a valid stop and frisk, therefore, are a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and a concomitant apprehension of danger. <em>United States v. Burton, </em>228 F.3d 524, 528 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">It is equally well-established that the same general principles govern an officer\u2019s ability to conduct a frisk of the driver or passengers of a vehicle during a traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Sakyi, </em>160 F.3d 164, 167-69 (4th Cir.1998) (analyzing various applications of <em>Terry </em>to traffic stops). However, in the context of a valid traffic stop, the analysis must take into account that the fact the individual to be frisked has already been stopped. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 110, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (per curiam) (\u201cIn this case, unlike <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>there is no question about the propriety of the initial restrictions on respondent\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d). Accordingly, the inquiry focuses instead on whether any additional incursion by the officer, beyond the stop itself, \u201cwas reasonable and thus permissible under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Given the facts presented in this appeal, we have no difficulty sustaining the district court\u2019s determination of the validity of Sergeant Lake\u2019s frisk. The facts presented in this appeal are identical to those presented in <em>Mimms. </em>In <em>Mimms, </em>the officer observed the defendant driving with expired license plates. After stopping the vehicle, the officer asked the defendant to step out of the car and, at that point, \u201cnoticed a large bulge under respondent\u2019s sports jacket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107. Similarly, here, after asking Wyatt to exit his car during a legitimate traffic stop, Sergeant Lake noted the presence of protruding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>objects at the bottom of the right front pocket of Wyatt\u2019s jeans. As in <em>Mimms, </em>this bulge in Wyatt\u2019s clothing \u201cpermitted the officer to conclude that [Wyatt] was armed and thus posed a serious and present danger to the safety of the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112. The reasonableness of this conclusion is reinforced by Wyatt\u2019s earlier admission that he had knives in his left front pocket, and his deviation from Sergeant Lake\u2019s specific instructions as to where to place those weapons. Because these facts provide a reasonable basis to conclude that Wyatt may have possessed additional weapons as he returned from his car, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Wyatt\u2019s motion to suppress based on the constitutionality of the frisk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In his brief, Wyatt also argues that even if Sergeant Lake\u2019s frisk was permissible, the subsequent warrantless search of his vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment because Sergeant Lake lacked probable cause of criminal activity. However, Wyatt did not raise this issue before the court in his motion to suppress. Where a criminal defendant advances on appeal an argument not raised before the district court, this Court\u2019s review is limited by the plain error standard. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). As a result, Wyatt must, at a minimum, identify obvious error affecting his substantial rights. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">We find no error in Sergeant Lake\u2019s search of Wyatt\u2019s car. Under the Fourth Amendment, a police officer may extend an otherwise valid traffic stop beyond the time necessary to issue the citation if there is reasonable suspicion of other criminal activity. <em>United States v. Brugal, </em>209 F.3d 353, 358 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc). If the extension of the traffic stop results in probable cause to believe that the car contains contraband, officers may proceed with a warrantless search of the vehicle. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>300 F.3d 415, 422 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1187, 123 S.Ct. 1253, 154 L.Ed.2d 1018 (2003). That search may include any closed containers that the officers have \u201cprobable cause to believe ... may contain contraband.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Given the facts recounted in the district court\u2019s order, Sergeant Lake had both reasonable suspicion to extend the traffic stop and probable cause to search Wyatt\u2019s car. Sergeant Lake\u2019s frisk of Wyatt led to the discovery of marijuana in Wyatt\u2019s right front pocket, and Wyatt later admitted to having a marijuana \u201croach\u201d on the center console of his car. Wyatt also acknowledged prior arrests for possession of marijuana. In addition, a sweep of Wyatt\u2019s car by a canine unit called to the scene following Wyatt\u2019s admissions indicated the possible presence of contraband in the area around the front passenger-side floorboard and center console. Because Wyatt admitted to having marijuana near the center console of his car,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the canine unit indicated the presence of contraband close to the center console, <em>see id. </em>(discussing scope of search permitted by a positive indication <em>of </em>contraband), we find that Sergeant Lake had probable cause to search Wyatt\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We find the district court properly concluded that Sergeant Lake had a reasonable basis to conduct a protective frisk of Wyatt. Further, we find no Fourth Amendment violation in Sergeant Lake\u2019s decision to search Wyatt\u2019s car following Wyatt\u2019s admission that he had marijuana in his car and a positive sweep of the car\u2019s interior by a drug sniffing dog. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s suppression order is</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\">. Wyatt also contests the district court\u2019s conclusion that his conduct demonstrated his consent to be frisked. However, because the search constituted a valid protective frisk under <em>Mimms, </em>we do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-12\">. Although Sergeant Lake did not find the \u201croach\u201d Wyatt stated that he had left on the center console of his car, he eventually discovered the firearm hidden in a closed compartment in the center console.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
