He argues that the increase was improper since the Government failed to demonstrate that the firearms possession conduct recited in the presentence report (PSR) was connected to any illegal drug activity. In response, the Government maintains that the increase was proper since Martinez possessed a dangerous weapon during the time-frame of the conspiracy for which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">Review of the record in this case reveals a sufficient link to support the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) increase. Specifically, the record demonstrates that Martinez and his co-conspirators conducted at least a portion of their drug-trafficking activities out of the Land Sharks Audio business \u2014 the location where a confidential informant observed a handgun fall to the ground from Martinez\u2019s pants. Although Martinez contends that the PSR failed to identify a specific date for this event, he does not dispute the probation officer\u2019s statement that Land Sharks Audio opened for business in 1999, thereby placing Martinez\u2019s gun possession conduct within the time-frame of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">Because Martinez was observed with a gun where at least a portion of the drug-trafficking activities took place, it was not clearly improbable that the weapons possession conduct was connected to the drug conspiracy offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>see also United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in assessing the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) increase. <em>See United States v. Broussard, </em>80 F.3d 1025, 1041 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
