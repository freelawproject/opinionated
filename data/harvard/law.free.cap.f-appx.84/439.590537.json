He challenges the admission of testimony by the cooperating co-defendant, Heath, that for several years prior to the events giving rise to the indictment, Johnson and Heath were partners in crack-trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">We review the admission of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Royal, </em>972 F.2d 643, 645 (5th Cir.1992). Johnson asserts that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403. Johnson further contends that the testimony was inadmissible because it constituted extrinsic evidence of extraneous offenses. Johnson cites cases which involved the application of FedR.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Heath\u2019s testimony concerning his drug-trafficking partnership with Johnson was intrinsic background information which established their relationship as co-conspirators. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 440-41 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1431 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the admission of this testimony was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.
