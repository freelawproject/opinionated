We review the decision of the IJ, <em>see Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003), and will reverse only if the decision is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">As an initial matter, we will not disturb the IJ\u2019s finding, based on witness credibility, that Iqbal left the United States and stayed in Pakistan for over two years for purposes of securing gainful employment. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994). After considering Iqbal\u2019s connections with the United States, his employment history, and his dealings with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, we hold that the evidence does not compel a finding that Iqbal intended to return to the United States \u201cwithin a relatively short period\u201d or that his visit terminated \u201cupon the occurrence of an event that had a reasonable possibility of occurring within a relatively short period of time.\u201d <em>See Moin, </em>335 F.3d at 419 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Therefore, the IJ\u2019s determination that he had abandoned his lawful permanent resident status is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
