Brown appeals bench and jury verdicts in favor of the defendants in his action brought under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The jury decided against Brown on the Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and the district court decided against him on the MTCA claims. The court also denied Brown\u2019s timely motion for judgment as a matter of law (JML) or a new trial. The claims arise from Brown\u2019s arrest following an 11-mile pursuit and an altercation in Brown\u2019s drive<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>way during which Brown suffered a serious eye injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Brown contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for JML or a new trial, particularly in light of the jury\u2019s inconsistent responses to special interrogatories. The jury answered its first interrogatory by determining that Brown did not resist arrest after he stopped his car in his driveway. The jury nonetheless concluded that the arresting officers did not use excessive force in making the arrest, even though Brown was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">When reviewing apparently inconsistent jury answers to special interrogatories, we \u201cmust attempt to reconcile the jury\u2019s findings, by exegesis, if necessary, before we are free to disregard the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Weasler Engineering, 258 </em>F.3d 326, 343 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted). We \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to upholding the jury\u2019s decision by a finding of consistency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition to examining the jury interrogatories, the reviewing court must consider the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. <em>Alverez v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., </em>674 F.2d 1037,1040 (5th Cir.1982) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In light of the interrogatories, the court\u2019s instruction on excessive force, the lack of an instruction on resisting arrest, and the circumstances surrounding the incident, we view the jury\u2019s answers as reconcilable. The jury evidently determined that any use of force by the officers was not excessive due to their reasonable belief that Brown was attempting to resist them or to flee, as he had done during the 11-mile pursuit. This is likely even if the jury may have concluded that Brown\u2019s actions in the driveway did not constitute resisting arrest in some particular legal sense. The jury\u2019s verdict need not be set aside as inconsistent. <em>See Ellis, 258 </em>F.3d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">We review the denial of Brown\u2019s motion for JML <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants. <em>See Burroughs v. FPP Operating Partners, </em>28 F.3d 543, 546 (5th Cir.1994). The jury had a reasonable evidentiary basis for concluding that the officers reasonably perceived a threat from Brown and responded without excessive force. Brown fails to show that \u201cthe evidence at trial points so strongly and overwhelmingly in [his] favor that reasonable jurors could not reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>See Omnitech Int\u2019l v. Clorox Co., </em>11 F.3d 1316, 1323 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Brown is not entitled to a new trial unless the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence as viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Dawson v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>978 F.2d 205, 208 (5th Cir.1992). There was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the officers did not use excessive force under the circumstances. Therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the new trial motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Brown contends that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing Brown to present testimony about two past incidents involving allegations of the officers\u2019 use of excessive force. He argues that the evidence was relevant to showing that the city of McComb had a policy or custom of condoning excessive force. Were we to assume that the exclusion of the evidence was erroneous, there could nonetheless be no municipal liability because the jury found no underlying excessive-force constitutional violation. <em>See Becerra v. Asher, </em>105 F.3d 1042, 1047-48 (5th Cir.1997). Thus, any error in excluding the evidence could not have affected Brown\u2019s substantial rights and was therefore harmless. <em>See Polanco v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>Austin, Tex., </em>78 F.3d 968, 982 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Brown argues that the evidence was contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion that the officers did not act with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for Brown\u2019s safety as required to incur liability under the MTCA. <em>See </em>Miss.Code. Ann. \u00a7 11-46-9(l)(c). Under Mississippi case law, \u2018\u201creckless disregard\u2019 embraces willful or wanton conduct which requires knowingly and intentionally doing a thing or wrongful act.\u201d <em>Maye v. Pearl River County, </em>758 So.2d 391, 394 (Miss.1999). The record contains evidence to support the district court\u2019s apparent conclusion that Brown\u2019s injury likely was the result of negligence or an accident rather than the wanton use of force. Brown fails to show that the district court\u2019s factual finding was clearly eironeous, and he therefore is not entitled to reversal on the MTCA claims. <em>See Williams v. Kaufman County, </em>343 F.3d 689, 696 (5th Cir.2003) (reviewing for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Brown contends for the first time on appeal that Miss.Code. Ann. \u00a7 11-46-9(l)(c) is unconstitutional because it gives police unlimited power to use excessive force in disregard of the Fourth Amendment. This court need not consider the issue because no miscarriage of justice will result if we do not; the MTCA plainly had no effect on Brown\u2019s ability to assert and bring to trial his Fourth Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See North Alamo Water Supply Corp. v. City of San Juan, Tex., </em>90 F.3d 910, 916 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
