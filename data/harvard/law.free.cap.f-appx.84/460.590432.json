Martinez appeals only the district court\u2019s imposition of a $300 fine. At sentencing, Martinez objected to the fine in light of the probation officer\u2019s finding that he lacked the ability to pay any court imposed fine. The Government has filed an unopposed motion to waive the briefing requirement, vacate the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>as to the f\u00edne, and affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Where, as in this case, the district court adopts a presentence report (PSR) showing limited or no ability to pay a fine, the Government must come forward with evidence showing that a defendant can, in fact, pay a fine before one can be imposed. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>979 F.2d 1037, 1041 (5th Cir.1992). The Government admits that no such evidence was adduced, and the district court did not make specific findings regarding Martinez\u2019s ability to pay a fine. Consequently, this court cannot uphold the district court\u2019s imposition of the fine. <em>See United States v. Hodges, </em>110 F.3d 250, 251 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The Government\u2019s motion to waive the briefing requirement is GRANTED. Given our determination that the fine cannot be upheld, we hereby GRANT the Government\u2019s motion to VACATE the $300 fine imposed <em>on </em>Martinez and MODIFY the district court\u2019s judgment accordingly. As modified herein, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">VACATED and MODIFIED in part; and as modified, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
