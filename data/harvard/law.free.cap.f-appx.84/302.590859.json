Nicholas is a native of Argentina who claims citizenship in both Argentina and Bolivia. Sonia and Pablo are both natives and citizens of Bolivia.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The Vallejoses challenge the IJ\u2019s finding, affirmed by the Board, that they failed to demonstrate that either Nicholas or Sonia suffered past persecution or possessed a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. The record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite\u2019 \u201d elements. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84). We have reviewed the administrative record, the IJ\u2019s decision, and the decision of the Board, and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s ruling that the Vallejoses failed to establish their refugee status.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of their application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding is more stringent than that for asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because the Vallejoses fail to show that they are eligible for asylum, they cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
