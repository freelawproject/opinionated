INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Naserddine argues that the IJ erred when she determined that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion or on account of his membership in a particular social group. The IJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence and is correct based on precedent established in <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and <em>Rivas-Martinez v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 1143 (5th Cir.1993). <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002) (this court will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Nasserdine further argues that the BIA violated his due process rights and misapplied its regulations when it issued an affirmance without an opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). The due process argument is without merit. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir. 2003) (rejecting due process challenge to a similar summary affirmance procedure set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003(a)(7)). Moreover, the decision met the criteria for a summary affirmance pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
