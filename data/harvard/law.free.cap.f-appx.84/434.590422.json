Rivers, Sr., appeals from the dismissal of his civil rights suits alleging claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c); the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; the Due Process Clause; and the Equal Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Clause. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">As a preliminary matter, Rivers has inadequately briefed his claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and he has failed to brief his claims concerning the defendants\u2019 alleged distribution of marijuana or his claims arising under state law. Accordingly, those claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224\u201425 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). We find no merit in the argument that the district court should have ruled on Rivers\u2019s motion to recuse because the case was transferred from the district judge who was the subject of the motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Rivers argues that he adequately pleaded his RICO claims because he alleged the predicate acts of mail fraud and extortion. We conclude, however, that Rivers\u2019s complaint fails to allege sufficiently a pattern of racketeering activity connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. <em>See Elliott v. Foufas, </em>867 F.2d 877, 880 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Manax v. McNamara, </em>842 F.2d 808, 811 (5th Cir.1988). Rivers\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to the United States Supreme Court is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
