He first contends that the district court erred in using 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A as the procedural vehicle to dismiss several of his claims because the defendants had already filed an answer to his complaint. However, Lair cites no legal authority in support of his proposition that screening may not be performed after a defendant has filed an answer to the complaint. The argument is belied by the statute, which provides that screening should be done \u201cas soon as practicable after docketing\u201d; it does not provide that screening may not be performed after an answer is filed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">If his brief is liberally construed, Lair renews the claims that he was subjected to harsher visitation rules than other inmates; that his placement in the Special Housing Unit (\u201cSHU\u201d) was done in retaliation for filing a grievance; that his continued detention in SHU was based on his refusal to cooperate with the drug-smuggling investigation; that Deputy Sheriff Ruiz conspired to stop his common-law wife from obtaining his personal papers; that he was denied access to his attorney and his legal mail; and that the conditions of confinement in SHU violated his Eighth-Amendment rights. He does not renew his claims that his continued detention in SHU was based on fabricated documents; that the taking of his address book violated his Fourth Amendment rights; that he was denied access when his trial transcripts were mailed to his attorney instead of to him; or that John Does # 2 and # 3 harassed him. Those claims are thus waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The district court dismissed all but Lair\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915A. This court reviews dismissals under \u00a7 1915A <em>de novo. Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The district court dismissed the First Amendment claims based on visitation irregularities, the due process claims based on Lair\u2019s placement in SHU, the retaliation claims against Lt. Swain and Officer Ayala, and the denial-of-access claim regarding Lair\u2019s trial transcripts as time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The dismissal of the denial-of-access claim is AFFIRMED. However, Lair has made a colorable showing that the limitations period should have been tolled as to the other claims dismissed as untimely during the time he was required to exhaust administrative remedies under Texas\u2019 common-law tolling rule that tolls the limitations period \u201cwhen a person is prevented from exercising a legal remedy by the pendency of legal proceedings.\u201d <em>Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 257 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>cf. Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 158-59 (5th Cir.1999). The dismissal of those claims as time-barred is VACATED, and the claims are REMANDED for further factual development regarding the specific actions Lair grieved and the time during-which the limitations period was tolled thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Lair\u2019s argument that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>defendants in their official capacities lacks merit. <em>See Affiliated Prof l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, </em>164 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.1999). His contention that the amount of time he spent in SHU is a due process violation is similarly unavailing. <em>See Pichardo v. Kinker, </em>73 F.3d 612, 613 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995). Lair\u2019s denial-of-access claims regarding his inability to meet with his attorney or obtain his legal mail fail because he has not shown that his position as a litigant in any pending litigation was implicated. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1328 (5th Cir.1996). The conspiracy claim is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court thus did not err in dismissing these claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Although Lair renews his Eighth Amendment claim regarding the allegedly inhumane living conditions at SHU, the district court dismissed the claim for failure to exhaust, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), and Lair has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s reason for dismissal by failing to brief it. The remainder of the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
