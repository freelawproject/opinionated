Siminalayi argues that the IJ made an improper adverse credibility determination, the IJ erroneously concluded that his abuse by the Nigerian police was not on account of political opinion, and Siminalayi had shown that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">This court gives great deference to an IJ\u2019s decision concerning an alien\u2019s credibility. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). Siminalayi fails to provide any support for his challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, the IJ\u2019s finding that Siminalayi was not subjected to persecution, and did not have a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of his political opinion (the only basis claimed by Siminalayi) is supported by the record. The IJ\u2019s findings that Siminalayi did not qualify for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Gomez-Mejia v. INS, </em>56 F.3d 700, 702 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, Siminalayi\u2019s conclusional allegations regarding the likelihood that he would be tortured if returned to Nigeria are insufficient to show that a \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\u201d that the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT application was incorrect. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
