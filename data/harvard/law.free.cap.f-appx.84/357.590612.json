Clark on Cunningham\u2019s excessive force claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), following the injuries he sustained from being shot several times by the defendants. The district court granted summary judgment to the officers based on its finding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On appeal, Cunningham claims that the award of summary judgment was premature because alleged discrepancies in the affidavits of the officers and forensic and medical experts created issues of material fact that should have precluded summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Higgins v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">In the context of an excessive force claim, not every discrepancy creates a triable issue of fact. <em>Sigman v. Town of Chapel Hill, </em>161 F.3d 782, 787 (4th Cir. 1998) (noting that it will nearly always be the case that witnesses will differ over what occurred). In this matter, Officer Hamilton testified that Cunningham crouched behind a Christmas tree with his gun pointed at her. However, Cunningham testified that he only turned and faced Hamilton with his gun down by his side and was shot within seconds. Cunningham contends that this factual dispute should be evaluated by the trier of fact. However, as the district court noted, whether Cunningham pointed the gun at Hamilton was not dispositive. Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the officers reasonably and objectively believed that their safety was in danger. <em>See Sigman, </em>161 F. 3d at 786-87. On the facts of this case, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that, even accepting Cunningham\u2019s version of events, the officers\u2019 belief they were in danger was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-19\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>materials before the court and oral argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\"> Cunningham does not challenge the court's grant of summary judgment to the officers on his state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
