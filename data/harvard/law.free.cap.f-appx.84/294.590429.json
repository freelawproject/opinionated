The district court correctly held that \u201ca successive application may not be filed in the district court without authorization from the ... court of appeals.\u201d <em>In re Williams, </em>330 F.3d 277, 279 (4th Cir.2003) (regarding a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) habeas corpus petition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000)). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">In accordance with our decision in <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003), we construe Lawton\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">To obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). Lawton does not satisfy either of these conditions. Accordingly, we decline to authorize a second \u00a7 2255 motion. We affirm the order of the district court and deny Lawton\u2019s implicit application for leave to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
