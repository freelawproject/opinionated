R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion seeking reconsideration of the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the district court\u2019s docket sheet reveals that the court denied relief on December 5, 2003. Accordingly, because the district court has recently ruled on Spotts\u2019s motion, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
