The order denied his motion to reopen and reconsider the Board\u2019s dismissal of his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-23\">Lumbu first raises several challenges to the summary affirmance procedure employed by the Board in its initial decision, dated October 8, 2002, affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). As Lumbu did not file a timely petition for review of that decision, we are without jurisdiction to consider his claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405,115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">Lumbu next takes issue with the Board\u2019s decision to deny his motion to reconsider. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Lumbu the relief sought. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-25\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
