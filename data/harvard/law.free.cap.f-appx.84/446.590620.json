We lack jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>review the district court\u2019s order transferring venue of the claims against the Smith Unit personnel. <em>See Enplanar, Inc. v. Marsh, </em>11 F.3d 1284, 1298 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b)(ii) under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, 198 </em>F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Martinez\u2019s claim that Grievance Investigator Sanches failed to protect him from other inmates by refusing to remove him from administrative segregation. <em>See Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Martinez\u2019s denial of access to courts and retaliation claims against Ms. Artiz, Major Carillo, Captain Hinkle, and Mr. Fenner and his claim of supervisory liability against Warden Morales also was not error. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303-04 (5th Cir.1987). We do not consider the merits of the claims against the Smith Unit personnel which have been transferred to the Northern District of Texas or the claims that implicate the liability of individuals not named as defendants in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martinez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, and it did not err in not holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir. 1987); <em>Wesson v. Oglesby, </em>910 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Because Martinez\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Martinez\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. See <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-88 (5th Cir.1996). Martinez is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma paupens </em>(IFP) in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Martinez\u2019s motions for an injunction pending appeal and for appointment of counsel are DENIED. Given that the district court has granted Martinez permission to proceed IFP on appeal, his IFP motion before this court is also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED; ALL MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
