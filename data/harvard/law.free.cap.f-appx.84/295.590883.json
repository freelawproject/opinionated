The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case pursuant to the three strikes rule, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (2000), and advised Green that failure to file timely, specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, the majority of Green\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation were nonspecific and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Am, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Although the district court found that Green filed a specific objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that Green was not in imminent danger of serious physical harm, we find that Green has waived this issue on appeal by failing to raise it in his informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). We further find that Green has waived appellate review of the remainder of his claims by failing to file any other specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
