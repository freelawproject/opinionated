We have ruled that the publisher Defendants and Apple did indeed conspire unlawfully to restrain trade in violation of-the Sherman Act. <em>See United States et al. v. Apple, Inc., et al., </em>791 F.3d 290 (2d Cir. 2015). The unlawful conspiracy was effected by the publishers simultaneously changing their business practices to abandon the wholesale business model in favor of the agency pricing model. Under the former wholesale- business model, the publishers would sell ebooks to retailers -and suggest a retail price, but retailers retained discretion to sell at prices higher or lower than the publisher\u2019s suggested price. Under the new agency pricing model the publisher required:the retailer to sell the ebook at a retail price of the publisher\u2019s choosing, and the publisher paid the retailer a commission for each sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">Diesel eBooks was an independent ebook retailer whose revenues dropped precipitously in the wake of the switch to agency pricing, and it claimed that the switch to agency pricing was the cause of its decline. The district\u2019 court (Cote, <em>J.) </em>granted summary judgment in favor of the publisher Defendants, determining that the record left no genuine issue of material fact as to antitrust injury or causation. <em>See Lavoho, LLC v. Apple, Inc., et al., </em>232 F.Supp.3d 513, 2016 WL 556636 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 2016). Based bn the undisputed facts in the record, the district court determined that Diesel\u2019s' business was not grounded in price competition, that it contemporaneously viewed the adoption of agency pricing as a boon, and that its decline was not a legally cognizable antitrust injury flowing from the unlawful 'nature of the conspiracy. <em>See id. </em>at 531, 2016 WL 556636 at *14. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the distinct court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.\u201d <em>Mihalih v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., </em>715 F.3d 102, 108 (2d Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P, 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We have carefully reviewed the summary judgment record, and we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the record permits no genuine dispute as to any material fact underlying the conclusion that, as a matter of law, the Appellant suffered no antitrust injury caused by the unlawful antitrust conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We affirm for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned written decision, which we hereby adopt. <em>See </em>232 F.Supp.3d 513, 2016 WL 556636.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
