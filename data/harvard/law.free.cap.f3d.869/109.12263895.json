After the children \u2014 A.T.M. and C.E.M. \u2014 were born, MacNeil filed applications for child\u2019s survivors\u2019 benefits, based on her husband\u2019s earnings history, with the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d). As relevant here, the SSA has interpreted the governing statute \u2014 in an interpretation upheld by the Supreme Court \u2014 to treat an individual as a child of the decedent-insured, and thus potentially eligible for survivors\u2019 benefits, if that individual would inherit from the decedent under the intestacy law of the state in which the insured was domiciled. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>nied the twins\u2019 applications for benefits, concluding that, under the version of the New York law in effect at the time of the decision, children conceived and born after a decedent\u2019s death were not entitled to inherit by intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">MacNeil then filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York challenging this determination, and the district court affirmed the agency\u2019s view. We agree with the district court that, under the applicable provisions of New York\u2019s Estates, Powers and Trusts Law (\u201cEPTL\u201d) in effect at and prior to the time of the agency\u2019s final decision, A.T.M. and C.E.M. were not entitled to inherit from the decedent in intestacy. In the absence of any showing of other grounds for eligibility for child\u2019s survivors\u2019 benefits under the Social Security Act, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">I. Factual Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Sharon and Eric MacNeil were married on October 1,1994, a year after they graduated from college. Several months into their marriage, Eric was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma at the age of 23. The couple, knowing that the cancer might be terminal or that treatment might render Eric sterile, decided to bank Eric\u2019s sperm. Eric died intestate on May 24, 1996, at age 24. In June 2007, eleven years after Eric\u2019s death, Sharon underwent <em>in vitro </em>fertilization using the stored sperm. She gave birth to twins, A.T.M. and C.E.M., on February 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">On October 8, 2009, MacNeil filed separate applications for child\u2019s survivors\u2019 benefits for her twins with the SSA, based upon the wage earnings of their deceased father. The SSA denied these applications, and MacNeil then sought a hearing before an ALJ. The only question presented before the ALJ was a legal one: whether A.T.M, and C.E.M. qualified as \u201cchildren]\u201d under the Social Security Act. The ALJ concluded that, though it was uncontested that the twins were biologically Eric MacNeil\u2019s children, they were not entitled to inherit under the applicable provisions of New York intestacy law because they were conceived after Eric\u2019s death. As a result, on February 14, 2013, the ALJ issued two separate and identical decisions denying MacNeil\u2019s applications for each of her children. The SSA\u2019s Appeals Council denied MacNeil\u2019s paired petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">On November 18, 2014, MacNeil filed suit against the Commissioner of the SSA in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, seeking review of the agency\u2019s final determination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The magistrate judge (Hummel, <em>M.J.) </em>issued a Report &amp; Recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) proposing that the SSA\u2019s denial of benefits be affirmed. The district court (Sharpe, <em>J.) </em>adopted the R&amp;R in full and dismissed MacNeil\u2019s complaint. On June 24, 2016, MacNeil timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">When reviewing a final decision of the Commissioner in a Social Security benefits case, this Court examines the administrative record <em>de novo </em>to determine, as relevant here, whether the SSA applied the correct legal standard. <em>See Pollard v. Halter, </em>377 F.3d 183, 188 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">The Sociai Security Act affords \u201ca monthly benefit for designated surviving family members of - a deceased insured wage earner,\u201d including children of the deceased. <em>Astrue v. Capoto ex rel. B.N.C., </em>566 U.S. 541, 132 S.Ct. 2021, 2027, 182 L.Ed.2d 887 (2012); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d). In a definitional 'section, the\u2018Social SecurityAct provides that \u201c[i]n determining whether an applicant is the child ... of a-fully ... insured individual for purposes of th[e] subchapter [governing, <em>inter alia, </em>survivors\u2019 benefits], the Commissioner .of Social Security shall apply such law as would be applied in determining the \u25a0 devolution of intestate person\u00e1l property ... by the courts of the State in which, [the decedent insured] was domiciled at the time of his death.\u201d 42' U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A). Thus, the SSA has explained, an applicant for child\u2019s survivors\u2019 benefits may qualify if the applicant \u201ccould inherit the insured\u2019s personal property as his or her natural child under State inheritance laws.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.355(a)(1); <em>see also Capoto, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2033-34 (upholding the SSA\u2019s interpretation as reasonable under <em>Chevron v. NRDC, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Under its internal regulations, the SSA applies the version of state law most beneficial to the applicant, looking to \u201cthe version of State law that was in effect at the time the insured died, or any version of State law in effect from the first month for which [the applicant] could be entitled to benefits up until [the] final decision on [the] application.\u201d 20 ' ' C.F.R. \u00a7 404.355(b)(4). In adjudicating the merits of the applications filed on A.T.M. \"and C.E.M,\u2019s behalf, the ALJ invoked the version of the EPTL- in effect at the time of his decision in 2013, and -the parties agree that this version of the EPTL properly applies to this case. <em>,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal center on two -sections -of. New York\u2019s EPTL. Section 4-1.1 provides the general rules for distribution of property \u201cnot disposed of by will\u201d via intestacy. <em>See </em>EPTL \u00a7 4-l.i (\u201cThe property of a decedent not disposed of by will.shall be distributed as provided in \u215b\u215b section.\u201d). As relevant here, subsection (a) of Section 4-1.1 sets out the basic rules for allocating a decedent\u2019s property \u201c[i]f a. decedent is survived by\u201d various relatives including the \u201cspouse,\u201d \u201cissue,\u201d \u201cparents,\u201d and \u201cgrandparents.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsection (b) then states that, in making an intestate distribution, the .decedent\u2019s half-relatives \u201cshall be treated as if they were [full] relatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4-l.l(b). Similarly, subsection (c), the subsection at the center of the dispute between the parties in this case, also identifies individuals who are appropriately included as members of the class of distributees. This subsection provides that \u201c[distributees of the decedent, conceived before his or her death but born alive thereafter, take as- if they were born in his or her lifetime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4-l.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The second section, Section 4-1.2, governs the circumstances under which \u201cnon-marital children\u201d are considered legitimate issue under the provisions of intestacy law. Under this' provision, a \u201cnon-marital child is the legitimate' child of his mother so that he and his issue inherit from his mother and from his maternal kindred,\u201d just as a marital child does. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4-1.2(a)(l). A non-marital child can also be the legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>child of his father \u201cso that he and his issue inherit\u201d by the terms of this provision, but only in specified circumstances including, as relevant here, where paternity is \u201cestablished by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d such as \u201cevidence derived from a genetic . marker test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4-1.2(a)(2)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The agency argues that Section 4-l.l(c), which specifically provides for distribution of an intestate\u2019s property to children conceived <em>before </em>the decedent\u2019s- death who are born thereafter, by implication excludes those children conceived <em>after </em>the decedent\u2019s death. MacNeil argues, in contrast, that her twins are entitled to inherit as \u201cnon-marital children\u201d under Section 4-1.2 because Eric\u2019s biological paternity has been clearly established by genetic testing. In her view, Section 4-l.l(c) does not prevent posthumously conceived children from inheriting via intestacy because the subsection does not expressly state that <em>only </em>distributees conceived before the decedent\u2019s death are entitled to inherit. Moreover, she argues, Section 4-1.2, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] non-marital child is the legitimate child of his father so that he ... inherit[s] ... if paternity has been established by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d such as \u201cevidence derived from a genetic marker test,\u201d is applicable by its terms. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4-1.2(a)(2)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201cThe .starting point of statutory interpretation is, of course, plain meaning,\u201d <em>People v. Owusu, </em>93 N.Y.2d 398, 401, 690 N.Y.S.2d 863, 712 N.E.2d 1228 (1999). \u201cIt is well settled that \u2018a. statute or legislative act is to be construed as a whole, and all parts of an act are to be read and construed together.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.Y. State Psychiatric Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>19 N.Y.3d 17, 23-24, 946 N.Y.S.2d 191, 968 N.E.2d 428 (2012) (quoting N.Y. Stat. \u00a7 97). Interpretation of one provision of a statute thus \u201ccannot be divorced from its statutory context.\u201d <em>In re Avella v. City of New York, </em>29 N.Y.3d 425, 436, 58 N.Y.S.3d 236, 80 N.E.3d 982 (2017). \u201c[E]ach section ... must be considered and applied in connection with every other section ... so-that all will have their due, and conjoint[,] effect.\u201d <em>N.Y. State Psychiatric Ass\u2019n, </em>19 N.Y.3d at 24, 945 N.Y.S.2d 191, 968 N.E.2d 428; <em>see also </em>N.Y. Stat. \u00a7 98 (\u201cAll parts of a statute must be harmonized with each other ... and effect and meaning must ... be given to the entire statute and every part and word thereof.\u201d). As a result, \u201c\u00e1 statutory construction which renders one part meaningless should be avoided,\u201d <em>In re Springer v. Bd. of Educ. of City Sch. Dist. of City of N.Y., </em>27 N.Y.3d 102, 107, 29 N.Y.S.3d 897, 49 N.E.3d 1189 (2016) (quoting <em>Rocovich v. Consol. Edison Co., </em>78 N.Y.2d 509, 515, 577 N.Y.S.2d 219, 583 N.E.2d 932 (1991)). Keeping these principles firmly in mind, we turn back to the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">As we have explained, Section 4-1.1 provides the general rules for intestate distribution. Section 4-1.1\u2019s first subsection delineates the hierarchy for distributing the estate to the class of individuals \u201csur-viv[ing]\u201d the decedent. EPTL.\u00a7 4-1.1(a)(1) (\u201cIf a decedent <em>is survived by: </em>(1) A spouse and issue....\u201d (emphasis added)). Survive, when used as a transitive verb, means \u201c[t]o live longer than; [or] outlive.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary, of the English Language 1743 (4th ed. 2000). More specifically, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csurviving\u201d as \u201c[rjemaining alive; living beyond the happening of an event so as to entitle one to a distribution of property or income.\u201d Black\u2019s- Law Dictionary 1675 (10th ed. 2010). That language necessarily limits the class of distributees because the only individuals who could \u201clive longer than\u201d the decedent or \u201cremain alive\u201d after his death are those <em>already </em>alive at the time of the decedent\u2019s passing. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Read in this context, Section 4-l.l(c)\u2019s import is clear. That subsection provides that distributees \u201cconceived before [the decedent\u2019s] death but born alive thereafter take as if they were born in his or her lifetime.\u201d Said differently, Section 4-l.l(c) deems those children conceived before a decedent\u2019s death but born alive thereafter as having \u201csurvived\u201d the decedent, enabling these individuals to take by operation of Section 4-l.l(a). The. treatment of other potential distributees bom after the death of the decedent is determined by omission: children who did not \u201csurvive\u201d the decedent, or are not otherwise deemed by statute to survive the decedent, do not inherit in intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">MacNeil argues that requisite statutory authorization for inheritance by genetic children conceived after \u2014 even long after \u2014 the death of the decedent is found in Section 4-1.2. Under her proposed interpretation, pursuant to Section 4-1.2, .a man\u2019s genetic child may always inherit regardless of the timing and circumstances of conception, so long as paternity is clearly established by genetic testing. That argument misreads Section 4-1.2, which, by its terms, supplies an expansive definition of child legitimacy but nowhere indicates that it is meant to expand the class of distributees entitled to take from the estate of an intestate decedent <em>temporally. </em>In other words, whereas, as the ALJ recognized, Section 4-l.l(c) explicitly operates as an exception to \u201can otherwise clear demarcation between the rights of those born during the decedent\u2019s lifetime and the rights of those who [we]re not\u201d by expanding the class of distributees born during the decedent\u2019s lifetime to encompass those born after his death, so long as conceived while he lived, <em>see </em>Admin. Rec. 21, 30, Section 4-1.2 does no such thing. That provision does not say that a child born after the death of the genetic father may inherit in intestacy, but instead provides the circumstances under which \u201c[a] non-marital child is the legitimate child of his father,\u201d including, among others, when \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of genetic paternity exists. EPTL \u00a7 4-1.2. Particularly set against the clear language of Section 4-l.l(c), which explicitly provides for expansion of the class of distributees based on time of conception, Section 4 \u2014 1.2(a)(2) cannot reasonably be read to similarly expand the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In effect, MacNeil seeks to isolate one of Section 4-1.2\u2019s several mechanisms for establishing paternity and to have this sub-provision serve as the general intestate distribution rule for children born after a genetic father has passed away, relegating Section 4 \u2014 1.1(c) to a provision that governs in the narrow case in which paternity cannot be clearly established. There is no reason, however, why a distribution rule drastically expanding the class of distribu-tees to include children conceived after the death of their genetic father would be buried in a subparagraph to Section 4-1.2 when the statute explicitly provides (narrowly) for such a temporal expansion in Section 4 \u2014 1.1(c), the preceding section. Nor is it clear why, under MacNeil\u2019s interpretation of Section 4-1.2, the child of an intestate father who is conceived after his death may establish genetic paternity (and so, on her theory, inherit), without affording any such mechanism for establishing the genetic maternity for a child born after the death of a woman.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>MacNeil\u2019s interpretation is also inconsistent with Section 4-1.2\u2019s amendment history. Prior to 2010, Section 4-1.2(a)(2), the specific paragraph on which MacNeil relies, provided for inheritance by a non-marital child in cases where the child was able to establish (1) the \u201copen[ ] and notorious!!]\u201d acknowledgment of the child by the putative father during that father\u2019s lifetime and (2) that genetic testing or other clear and convincing evidence proved paternity. <em>See In re Davis, </em>27 A.D.3d 124, 812 N.Y.S.2d 543, 544-47 (2d Dep\u2019t 2006) (quoting EPTL \u00a7 4-1.2(a)(2)(C)); see <em>also In re Poldrugovaz, </em>50 A.D.3d 117, 851 N.Y.S.2d 254, 257-62 (2d Dep\u2019t 2008). A non-marital child could also inherit if a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d declared paternity \u201cduring the lifetime of the father,\u201d EPTL \u00a7 4-1.2(a)(2)(A), the father had \u201csigned an instrument acknowledging paternity,\u201d or \u201ca blood genetic marker test\u201d establishing paternity had been administered during the father\u2019s lifetime. <em>In re Davis, </em>812 N.Y.S.2d at 545 (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 4-1.2(a)(2)(B),(D)). In 2010, the New York Legislature amended Section 4-1.2(a)(2) to ease the evidentiary requirements for a non-marital child to establish legitimacy. Rather than requiring both clear and convincing evidence of paternity (such as a genetic marker test) <em>and </em>open and notorious acknowledgment, the 2010 amendments permitted a non-marital child to establish legitimacy by clear and convincing evidence, defined as including <em>either </em>a genetic marker test <em>or </em>open and notorious acknowledgment. <em>See Seaton v. Cty. of Suffolk, </em>78 A.D.3d 1158, 912 N.Y.S.2d 289, 291 (2d Dep\u2019t 2010); 2010 N.Y. Sess. Laws Ch. 64 (A.7899-A) (McKinney). MacNeil\u2019s contention, therefore, amounts to an argument that the amendment of a subparagraph of a statutory provision dealing with paternity determinations served to revise the entirety of New York\u2019s intestacy scheme, creating a default pursuant to which children born after \u2014 even decades after \u2014 their genetic father\u2019s death are properly within the class of distributees for purposes of intestacy. But \u201clegislative bodies generally do not \u2018hide elephants in mouseholes,\u2019\u201d <em>Cruz v. TD Bank, N.A., </em>22 N.Y.3d 61, 72, 979 N.Y.S.2d 257, 2 N.E.3d 221 (2013) (quoting <em>Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc., </em>531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001)), and MacNeil has given us no convincing reason to believe that New York\u2019s legislature did just that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Our view of the proper interpretation of Sections 4-l.l(c) and 4-1.2(a)(2) also coheres with the background rules underlying the EPTL. It is a very longstanding rule of New York law that an estate\u2019s\u2019 distributees are properly determined as of the time of the decedent\u2019s death. <em>See In re Bump\u2019s Will, </em>234 N.Y. 60, 64, 136 N.E. 295 (1922) (explaining that \u201cheirs\u201d in a will should \u201cbe interpreted in its natural sense \u2014 those who are heirs at the death of the testator\u201d). This background rule, which fixes interests in an estate as of the time of the decedent\u2019s death, allows estates to determine their distributees and then close, so serving the state\u2019s \u201cproper objective\u201d of the \u201cefficient\u201d and \u201corderly settlement of estates,\u201d <em>See Trimble v. Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 770-71, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52 L.Ed.2d 31 (1977). And, under our reading, Section 4-1.1(c) gains effect specifically by affording a narrow exception to this general background rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>MacNeil\u2019s interpretation \u2014 whereby posthumously conceived children may inherit by intestacy no matter how long after their father\u2019s death they were born \u2014 runs, on the other hand, directly counter to this general rule. If, as MacNeil suggests, a child conceived decades after the genetic father\u2019s death may inherit, an estate might forever remain open or subject to redistribution. For example, if a decedent who dies intestate is survived only by his or her spouse, the entirety of the decedent\u2019s estate goes to the spouse. EPTL \u00a7 4-1.1(a)(2). If that decedent is survived, by his spouse and children, however, the spouse receives \u201cfifty thousand dollars and one-half of the residue,\u201d with the remainder being distributed to the decedent\u2019s issue. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4-l.l(a)(l). Thus, in order to accomplish the distribution contemplated in Section 4~l.l(a) under her interpretation . of Section 4-1.2, a, spouse in Sharon MacNeil\u2019s position could be required to return half of the estate (saving fifty thousand dollars for herself and devise that portion to the children born long after her husband\u2019s death. Redistribution would become yet more complicated where grandchildren are involved. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4-l.l(a)(6) (discussing distribution via grandparents). As the Supreme Court has observed, it is for precisely this reason that, in states that do permit posthumously conceived children to inherit via intestacy, these rights are generally qualified by time limits not present in either Section 4-1.1 or 4-1.2. <em>See Capato, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2031-32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In addition, though we recognize the hazards of using later-adopted law to construe the meaning of an earlier enacted provision, <em>see Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., </em>496 U.S. 633, 650, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990), we note that new Section 4-1.3, enacted in 2014 after the final agency decision in this case, is, as one would expect given our analysis above, designed to provide a specific framework for inheritance by children conceived by assisted reproductive technology after the passing of their genetic parent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to this provision, a \u201cgenetic child,\u201d defined as a \u201cchild of the'sperm or ova provided by a genetic parent,\u201d may inherit by intestacy \u201cif and when such child is born,\u201d subject to certain conditions. EPTL \u00a7 4-1.3(a)(3). Among other things, for the child to inherit, the genetic parent must execute a written instrument \u201cnot more than seven years\u201d prior to his or her death permitting the use of the genetic material for purposes of posthumous conception, and the child must be \u201cin \u00fatero no later than-twenty-four months after the genetic parent\u2019s death or born no later than- thirty-three months after the genetic parent's death.\u201d <em>Id. . </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4-1.3(b)(l)(A), (b)(4). Moreover, recognizing the implications of Section 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>1.1(c) described above, Section 4-1.3(b) specifically provides that a \u201cgenetic child\u201d is deemed issue of the genetic parent for purposes of inheritance law \u201cnotwithstanding paragraph (c) of [S]ection 4-1.1 of this part,\u201d language notably absent from Section 4-1.2(a)(2)(C), the provision for non-marital children on which MacNeil relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Finally, MacNeil fails to address the impact that her interpretation of Section 4-1.2 would have on the interpretation of other provisions of the EPTL. <em>See, e.g., </em>EPTL \u00a7\u00a7 2-1.3 (addressing dispositions to adopted and posthumous children as members of a class); 5-3.2 (concerning the effect of the birth of a child after the execution of a will); 5-4.5 (concerning the rights of family members resulting from wrongful acts causing the decedent\u2019s death). For example, Section 5-3.2(b) defines an \u201cafter-born child\u201d as a \u201cchild of the testator born during the testator\u2019s lifetime or in gestation at the time of the testator\u2019s death.\u201d The provision goes on to state that, for purposes of the section, \u201ca non-marital child ... <em>shall be considered an after-born child </em>... where paternity is established pursuant to [Sjection 4-1.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-3.2(b) (emphasis added). The most natural reading of this definitional provision (as with our interpretation of the interaction between Sections 4-l.l(e) and 4-1.2) is that a non-marital child is thus also' included in the class of after-born children \u2014 who are children born \u201cduring the testator\u2019s lifetime or in gestation at the time of, the testator\u2019s death\u201d \u2014 so long as paternity can be established under the rules provided in Section 4.1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">But, under MacNeil\u2019s reading, Section 4-1.2 operates to permit a genetic child born long after his or her father\u2019s death to inherit. Under this view, the definition provided in Section 5-3.2(b) descends into logical impossibility: an \u201cafter-born child\u201d is <em>both </em>a \u201cchild of the testator born during the testator\u2019s lifetime or in gestation at the time of the testator\u2019s death\u201d <em>and </em>a child born long after the testator has passed away.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, by ignoring the effect of her reading on other statutory provisions incorporating Section 4-1.2, MacNeil muddies the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d meaning of a section of the statute which, it bears repeating, nowhere permits a posthumously conceived child to inherit. <em>See People v. Pabon, </em>28 N.Y.3d 147, 152, 42 N.Y.S.3d 659, 65 N.E.3d 688 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">In <em>Capoto, </em>the Supreme Court- observed that the Social Security Act was designed specifically to \u201cprovide dependent' members of a Wage earner\u2019s family with protection against the hardship occasioned by the loss of the insured\u2019s earnings\u201d \u2014 a specific hardship to which those conceived after the death of the wage earner, and thus never reliant on his support, are not subject. 132 S.Ct. at 2032. Citing the fact that \u201c[ijntestacy laws in a number of States ... do provide for inheritance by posthumously conceived children,\u201d the Court noted in <em>Capoto </em>that \u201cthe intestacy' criterion yields benefits to some children outside the'Act\u2019s central concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded, however, that \u201c[i]t was ... Congress\u2019 prerogative -to legislate for -the generality of cases .... by employing eligibility to inherit under state intestacy law as a workable substitute for burdensome case-by-case determinations whether the child was, in fact dependent on her father\u2019s earnings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Here, we conclude that New York\u2019s intestacy law, as it existed in 2013 at the time of the agency\u2019s final determination, did not permit children conceived posthumously to inherit via intestacy. This determination, which requires the further conclusion that the MacNeil twins\u2019 applications for benefits were properly denied, is dispositive of the present appeal. Having considered the remainder of MacNeil\u2019s arguments and finding them to be without merit, and for the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\">. The factual background presented here is derived from undisputed facts from the administrative record of the agency proceedings, as filed by the SSA in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-5\">. For instance, this subsection provides that if a decedent is survived by a spouse and issue, $50,000 and one-half of the residue goes to the spouse with the balance to the issue, whereas in the case of a decedent who is survived by one or both parents, no spouse and no issue, the whple goes to the surviving parent or parents, EPTL \u00a7 4-1.1(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-5\">. The differential effect of MacNeil\u2019s reading of Section 4-1.2 on men and women is obvious. Under her reading, a man\u2019s genetic children are entitled to inherit in intestacy no matter how long after the man\u2019s death they are bom, whereas no clear statutory mechanism exists in that section that would permit a woman\u2019s genetic children to secure the same entitlement. (Whether some other mechanism might exist for establishing genetic ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ternity, <em>see, e.g., T.V. v. N.Y.

As an aside, dicta in <em>Capato </em>align with our interpretation of Section 4-1.1(c). There, the Supreme Court recognized that \"[\u00a1Intestacy laws in a number of States ... do provide for inheritance by posthumously conceived children,\" <em>Capato, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2032. Then, using a \"but see\" signal in an accompanying footnote, the Court cited directly to Section 4-1.1(c), suggesting that this provision, read most naturally, does not grant such inheritance rights. <em>See id. </em>at 2032 n.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b140-5\">. Though MacNeil requests that we ask the New York Court of Appeals to resolve whether posthumously conceived children may inherit in intestacy and the SSA does not oppose certification, we see no reason to certify in this case. First, \"certification is not proper\" where \"there is no split of authority [on a question] and 'sufficient precedents exist for us to make a determination,\u201d <em>Schoenefeld v. New York, </em>748 F.3d 464, 470 n.5 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and notations omitted). Second, after the adoption of Section 4-1.3, the New York law governing future cases is clear, and thus we cannot say that the question is of sufficient importance to the state and state public policy choices to warrant certification. <em>See id. </em>at 470.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. And if MacNeil would argue that Section 4-1,2 operates differently when incorporated into Section 5-3.2(b) than it does in the intestacy- context, she fails to either provide any textual evidence in support of that proposition or answer the further question -why, in the absence of statutory language indicating otherwise, Section 4-1.2 <em>should </em>operate differently in these two contexts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b142-4\">Gerard E. Lynch,</author>\n<p id=\"ACA\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">I concur fully in Judge Livingston\u2019s thorough and detailed opinion, which accurately explains the law governing this case. As the panel opinion demonstrates, the denial of the MacNeil children\u2019s application for survivors\u2019 benefits follows inexorably from two clear legal rules: First, the Social Security Act defines eligible children by reference to state intestacy law. And second, New York intestacy law does not now, and never has, permitted intestate inheritance by children conceived long after the death of a parent. I write separately only to note some additional facts about the case, and to suggest that Congress may wish to take up the unique problem it poses.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">First, the facts. The claimant children are the product of a combination of a moving romantic connection and modern reproductive technology. As the panel opinion describes, Sharon MacNeil married her college sweetheart not long after their graduation. Shortly thereafter, Eric MacNeil was diagnosed with a dangerous cancer. The couple were deeply committed to each other, however, and discussed their hopes for having children together. They determined to preserve Eric\u2019s sperm, against the possibility that his cancer treatment would either fail, or, if it succeeded in saving his life, render him infertile. When Eric learned that his death was inevitable, he gave his wife permission to use the preserved sperm if she decided to have his children after his death, and took what limited steps were in his power to provide some financial support to his wife and to any children of his that she might bear, including making them the beneficiaries of a life insurance policy. Eric Mac-Neil died at twenty-four, barely a year and a half into his marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Needless to say, in the wake of her young husband\u2019s death, dealing with her grief, struggling with limited financial resources, and enduring the loss of both of her parents in the next few years, for some time Sharon MacNeil felt unable to undergo the expensive and difficult process of <em>in vitro </em>fertilization or to raise children as a single parent. Instead, she returned to school, obtained an advanced degree, and went to work. But her desire to have children \u2014 her late husband\u2019s children \u2014 remained with her over years of struggle and saving. Eleven years after Eric\u2019s death, Sharon began the process of <em>in vitro </em>fertilization of her eggs with Eric\u2019s sperm and implantation of the resulting embryos. The procedure was successful: Sharon became pregnant, carried two babies to term, and gave birth to the twins whose claims are before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The MacNeils\u2019 story, though commenced in sadness, is one of love, commitment, and determination. It is also a story of modern scientific accomplishment. Although the possibilities opened up by assisted reproductive technology are by now well established and even familiar, they would have been utterly unimaginable to the drafters of the Social Security Act in the depths of the Great Depression over 80 years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Second, the suggestion. As noted, the Congress that adopted the Social Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Act, and thereby provided for benefits for orphaned children, had no intentions whatever with respect to children <em>conceived </em>(as opposed to born) posthumously, because such conception was unimaginable at the time. In undertaking to define which children were eligible for benefits, a principal concern was drawing lines with respect to non-marital children: specifically, how could such children demonstrate their \u201cdependence\u201d on a deceased parent such that their entitlement to survivors\u2019 benefits could be established? It was eminently reasonable for Congress, concerned primarily with the larger outlines of the complex social security program, to defer this question to the law of the states, which had, and still have, primary responsibility for family law, and had already developed a set of \u201clegitimacy\u201d laws to answer that question in the inheritance context. And the choice to rely on state intestacy laws appears to have stood the test of time; there is little evidence of controversy, difficulties, or complex litigation deriving from that decision over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The rise of scientifically-assisted reproduction technologies may, however, have opened a fissure between the policies of the Social Security Act and those of intestate succession in the small category of cases like the present one. As the panel opinion discusses, New York has recently changed its inheritance laws to confer succession rights on posthumously conceived children under limited circumstances, and in particular only when such children are born within a relatively short period after the death of the intestate parent. Imposing a strict time-limit is an eminently practical decision in the inheritance context. As the Court notes, estates cannot be held open indefinitely (delaying distribution to existing heirs and incurring administrative expenses) against the possibility of the birth of additional heirs years in the future, nor is it practical to distribute an estate to existing heirs but reclaim the assets and unscramble the distributions through further litigation years later at the behest of after-born heirs. But those considerations are not relevant to the functioning of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The panel opinion notes another policy that may dovetail with those concerns, however. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Astrue v. Capato, </em>566 U.S. 541, 132 S.Ct. 2021, 182 L.Ed.2d 887 (2012), the panel suggests that Congress may have been concerned only with protecting \u201cdependent members of a wage earner\u2019s family with protection against the hardship occasioned by the loss of the insured\u2019s earnings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2032 (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted), a hardship which the Court suggested is not experienced by \u201cthose conceived after the death of the wage earner, and thus never reliant on his support,\u201d Panel op. at 117, citing <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">That is perhaps a reasonable view. Certainly the original drafters of the Act were concerned about children who <em>did </em>enjoy a parent\u2019s financial support for some period of time (or, in the \u201cpregnant widow\u201d scenario, were at least conceived with that expectation), and then were deprived of that support by the parent\u2019s untimely death. But again, Congress had no occasion at the time to think of children in the situation of the MacNeil twins.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">It is perhaps unduly narrow, however, to consider that children such as the claimants here are somehow not financially burdened by the death of their biological father, simply because it occurred long before they were born. Surely, if Eric MacNeil had lived, his children would have benefitted from his earning power. And equally surely, the existing children are in a less secure financial position than they would be if their father were alive to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tribute to their support. Indeed, it would be entirely reasonable for a person, anticipating that problem, to purchase insurance for the purpose of supporting his or her offspring in the event of premature death, whether or not he or she already had children or had yet developed a significant earning capacity. In the present case, Eric made the same effort: the record indicates that Eric told his wife to use the proce\u00e9ds of his life insurance policy to support any children she conceived after his death. In the same spirit, it is not clear that social insurance should exclude the possibility of paying benefits on the basis of the insured\u2019s earnings record to children who are conceived after the insured\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Of course, I \u00e1m i\u00f1 no position to assess whether doing so would be good or bad policy. It is the role of Congress, and not of the courts, to study the situation, assess the costs and benefits of providing such coverage, and weigh the complexities of dealing with any program to provide for posthumously conceived children (how would such children be defined, independently of state intestate succession law? how would the biological children of married parents like Eric MacNeil be distinguished from the biological offspring of an insured donor to a sperm' bank? would it matter if the children were born into a two-parent household and adopted by the surviving parent\u2019s spouse?). Perhaps it would be reasonable to leave the law unchanged, adhering to the advantage of a clear and simple rule that provides for the originally intended class of orphaned children, rather than to attempt to create a more complicated program for the relatively few (but increasing number of) children in the situation of the present claimants, I do not have any settled view about whether it would be practical or desirable social or fiscal policy to provide a special rule for posthumously conceived' children \u2014 and if I did, It would not be my role to promote \u00be and there would be little reason for Congress to attend to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">But I do know that there is no evidence that Congress has ever considered or addressed, the new possibilities created by assisted reproductive technology in this context, and I think, it is a mistake to pretend that anything in the <em>original </em>intentions of Congress in adopting the Social Security. Act tells, us what the long-deceased drafters of the Act would have thought about this case, or what a present or future Congress would conclude if it studied the question, Moreover, it is tolerably clear to me that this is an instance in which there are entirely sound reasons for states to utilize restrictive rules in the context of intestacy, which reasons diverge from the considerations relevant to the sound administration of the Social Security Act. It would therefore make sense, I think, for the Social Security Administration, and members of the relevant congressional committees and their staffs, to devote some thought to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In the present -case, however, we can only apply the law as it was written, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>under the law as written it is clear that Congress has not provided benefits for children in the category of the MacNeil twins. \u25a0</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\">. Of course, the social security system is, in fact, a \"trust fund financed, in large part,-by taxes levied on the wage earners who are, the primary beneficiaries of the fund,\u201d rather than a traditional form of insurance. <em>See Califano v</em>. <em>Jobst, </em>434 U.S. 47, 52, 98 S.Ct. 95, 54 L.Ed.2d 228 (1977); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep.
