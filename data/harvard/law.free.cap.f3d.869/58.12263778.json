Martoma argues primarily that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction and that the district court did not properly instruct the jury in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Newman, </em>773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014), issued after Martoma was convicted. This appeal is our first occasion to consider <em>Newman </em>in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Salman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 420, 196 L.Ed.2d 351 (2016). We hold that the logic of <em>Salman </em>abrogated Newman!s \u201cmeaningfully close ' personal relationship\u201d requirement and that the district court\u2019s jury instruction was not obviously erroneous. Further, any instructional error would not have affected Martoma\u2019s substantial rights because the government presented overwhelming evidence that at least one tipper received a financial benefit from providing confidential information to Martoma. As a result, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">Martoma\u2019s convictions stem from an insider trading scheme involving securities of two pharmaceutical companies, Elan Corporation, pic (\u201cElan\u201d) and Wyeth, that were jointly developing an experimental drug called bapineuzumab to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Martoma worked as a portfolio manager at S.\u00c1.C. Capital Advis-ors, LLC (\u201cSAC\u201d), a hedge fund owned and managed by Steven A. Cohen. In that capacity, Martoma managed an investment portfolio with buying power of between $400 and $500 million that was focused on pharmaceutical and healthcare companies. He also recommended investments to Cohen, who managed SAC\u2019s largest portfolio. While at SAC, Martoma began to acquire shares in Elan and Wyeth in his portfolio and recommended that Cohen acquire shares in the companies as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">In order to obtain information about ba-pineuzumab, Martoma contacted expert networking firms and arranged paid, consultations with doctors knowledgeable about Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including two who were working on the bapineuzumab clinical trial. Dr. Sidney Gilman, chair of the safety monitoring committee for the bapineuzumab clinical trial, participated in approximately 43 consultations with Mar-toma at the rate of around $1,000 per hour.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a member of the safety monitoring committee, Dr. Gilman had an obligation to keep the results of the clinical trial confidential. His consulting contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>reiterated that he was not to disclose any confidential information in a consultation. He nevertheless provided Martoma, whom he knew was an investment manager, with confidential updates on the drug\u2019s safety that he received during meetings of the safety monitoring committee. Dr. Gilman also shared with Martoma the dates of upcoming safety monitoring committee meetings, which allowed Martoma to schedule consultations with Dr. Gilman shortly after each one. Another consultant, Dr. Joel Ross, one of the principal investigators on the clinical trial, met with Mar-toma on many occasions between 2006 and July 2008 and charged approximately $1,500 per hour. Like Dr. Gilman, Dr. Ross had an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information about the bapineuzu-mab clinical trial. Nevertheless, during their consultations, Dr. Ross provided Martoma with information about the clinical trial, including information about his patients\u2019 responses to the drug and the total number of participants in the study, that Dr. Ross recognized was not public.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">On June 17, 2008, Elan and Wyeth issued a press release regarding the results of \u201cPhase II\u201d of the bapineuzumab clinical trial. The press release described the preliminary results as \u201cencouraging,\u201d with \u201cclinically meaningful benefits in important subgroups\u201d of Alzheimer\u2019s patients with certain genetic characteristics, but indicated that the drug had not proven effective in the general population of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. J.A. 547. The press release further stated that the results of the trials would be presented in greater detail at the International Conference on Alzehimer\u2019s Disease to be held on July 29, 2008. Elan\u2019s share price increased following the press release.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In mid-July of 2008, the sponsors of the bapineuzumab trial selected Dr. Gilman to present the results at the July 29 conference. It was only at this point that Dr. Gilman was unblinded as to the final efficacy results of the trial. Dr. Gilman was \u201cinitially euphoric\u201d about the results, but identified \u201ctwo major weaknesses in the data\u201d that called into question the efficacy of the drug as compared to the placebo. Tr. 1419-20. On July 17, 2008, the day after being unblinded to the results, Dr. Gilman spoke with Martoma for about 90 minutes by telephone about what he had learned. That same day, Martoma purchased a plane ticket to see Dr. Gilman in person at his office in Ann Arbor, Michigan. That meeting occurred two days later, on July 19, 2008. At that meeting, Dr. Gilman showed Martoma a PowerPoint presentation containing the efficacy results and discussed the data with him in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The next morning, Sunday, July 20, Martoma sent Cohen, the owner of SAC, an email with \u201cIt\u2019s important\u201d in the subject line and asked to speak with him by telephone. The two had a telephone conversation lasting about twenty minutes, after which Martoma emailed Cohen a summary of SAC\u2019s Elan and Wyeth holdings. The day after Martoma spoke to Cohen, on July 21, 2008, SAC began to reduce its position in Elan and Wyeth securities by entering into short-sale and options trades that would be profitable if Elan\u2019s and Wyeth\u2019s stock fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Dr. Gilman publicly presented the final results from the bapineuzumab trial at the International Conference on Alzehimer\u2019s Disease in the afternoon of July 29, 2008. Elan\u2019s share price began to decline during Dr. Gilman\u2019s presentation and at the close of trading the next day, the share prices of Elan\u2019s and Wyeth had declined by about 42% and 12%, respectively. The trades that Martoma and Cohen made in advance of the announcement resulted in approximately $80.3 million in gains and $194.6 million in averted losses for SAC. Marto-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ma personally received a $9 million bonus based in large part on his trading activity in Elan and Wyeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The procedural history of this case is inextricably intertwined with recent developments in insider trading law. Insider trading is a violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and codified at 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. The Supreme Court has long held that there is no \u201cgeneral duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material, nonpublic information.\u201d <em>Chiarella v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 222, 233, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980). However, the \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cclassical theory\u201d of insider trading provides that a corporate insider violates \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 when he \u201ctrades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of material, non-public information\u201d because \u201ca relationship of trust and confidence [exists] between the shareholders of a corporation and those insiders who have obtained confidential information by reason of their position with that corporation.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Hagan, </em>521 U.S. 642, 651-52, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Chiarella, </em>445 U.S. at 228, 100 S.Ct. 1108). Similarly, the \u201cmisappropriation theory\u201d of insider trading provides \u201cthat a person ... violates \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5[] when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, 117 S.Ct. 2199. It is thus the breach of a fiduciary duty or other \u201cduty of loyalty and confidentiality\u201d that is a necessary predicate to insider trading liability. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">In <em>Dirks v. S.E.C., </em>463 U.S. 646, 103 S.Ct. 3255, 77 L.Ed.2d 911 (1983), the Supreme Court held that a \u201ctippee\u201d \u2014 someone who is not a corporate insider but who nevertheless receives material nonpublic information from a corporate insider, or \u201ctipper,\u201d and then trades on the information \u2014 can also be held liable under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, but \u201conly when the insider has breached his fiduciary duty to the shareholders by disclosing the information to the tippee and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660,103 S.Ct. 3255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he test\u201d for whether there has been a breach of a fiduciary duty or other duty of loyalty and confidentiality \u201cis whether the [tipper] personally will benefit, directly or indirectly, from his disclosure\u201d to the tippee. <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 662, 103 S.Ct. 3255. As examples of \u201cdirect or indirect personal benefits] from the disclosure,\u201d the Supreme Court cited \u201cpecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663,103 S.Ct. 3255. The Supreme Court went on to list \u201cobjective facts and circumstances that often justify\u201d an inference of personal benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">For example, there may be a relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a <em>quid pro quo </em>from the latter, or an intention to benefit the particular recipient. The elements of fiduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information also exist when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend. The tip and trade resemble trading by the insid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>er himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255. Building on this language, we have observed that \u201c[personal benefit is broadly defined to include not only pecuniary gain, but also, <em>inter alia, </em>any reputational benefit that will translate into future- earnings and the benefit one would obtain from simply making a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiau, </em>734 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2013) (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Accordingly, the district court instructed the jury in Martoma\u2019s trial that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">If you find that Dr. Gilman or Dr. Ross disclosed material, non-public information to Mr. Martoma, you must then determine whether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr. Gilman and Dr. Ross received or anticipated receiving some personal benefit, direct or indirect, from disclosing the material, non-public information at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">The benefit may, but need not be, financial or tangible in nature; it could include obtaining some future advantage, developing or maintaining a business contact or a friendship, or enhancing the tipper\u2019s reputation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">A finding as to benefit should be based on all the objective facts and inferences presented in the case. You may find that Dr. Gilman or Dr. Ross received a direct or indirect personal benefit from providing .inside information to Mr. Martoma if you find that Dr. Gilman or Dr. Ross gave the information to Mr. Martoma with the intention of benefit[t]ing themselves in some manner, or with the intention of conferring a benefit on Mr. Martoma, or as a gift with the goal of maintaining or developing a personal friendship or a useful networking contact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Tr. 3191.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">After Martoma was convicted and while his appeal was pending, we considered one of the situations described in <em>Dirks </em>\u2014 giving a \u201cgift\u201d of inside information to \u201ca trading relative or friend\u201d \u2014 in greater detail in <em>United States v. Newman, </em>773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014). The Court noted \u201cthat [pjersonal benefit is broadly defined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452 (quoting <em>Jiau, </em>734 F.3d at 153) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court went on, however, to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">This standard, although permissive, does not suggest that the Government may prove the receipt of a personal benefit by the mere fact of a friendship, particularly of a casual or social nature. If that were true, and the Government was allowed to meet its burden by proving that two individuals were alumni of the same school or attended the same church, the personal benefit requirement would be a nullity. To the extent <em>Dirks </em>suggests that a personal benefit may be inferred from a personal relationship between the tipper and tippee, where the tippee\u2019s trades \u2018resemble trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\u2019 we hold that such an inference is impermissible in the absence \u00f3f proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-13\"><em>Id, </em>at 452 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">Based, on this language from <em>Newman, </em>Martoma challenged on -appeal both the sufficiency of the evidence presented at his trial and the adequacy of the instructions given to the jury. Martoma argued that he and Dr. Gilman did not have a \u201cmeaningfully dose personal relationship\u201d, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Dr. Gilman had not received any \u201cobjective, consequential ... gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\u201d in exchange for providing Martoma with confidential information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, according to Marto-ma, even if the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction, the district court\u2019s jury instructions were inadequate in light of <em>Neuman </em>because they did not inform the jury about the limitations on \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d developed in <em>Newman. </em>This inadequate-instruction, Martoma argued, warranted a retrial. The initial round of briefing and oral argument focused in large part on whether Martoma\u2019s conviction could stand in light of <em>Neuman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Shortly after we held oral argument, however, the Supreme Court granted cer-tiorari in <em>Salman v. United States, see </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 899, 193 L.Ed.2d 788 (2016), and issued a decision in the case on December 6, 2016. <em>See </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 420, 196 L.Ed.2d 351 (2016). The defendant in <em>Salman </em>argued that a \u201cgift of confidential information to a trading relative or -friend,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 426 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255), was insufficient to establish insider trading liability \u201cunless the tipper\u2019s goal in disclosing inside information [wa]s to obtain money, property, or something of tangible value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the defendant in <em>Sal-man </em>urged the Supreme Court to adopt a standard similar to the ruling in <em>Newman. </em>The Supreme Court declined to do so and instead \u201cadhere[d] to <em>Dirks,\u201d </em>which contained a \u201cdiscussion of gift giving [that] resolve[d] the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. According to the <em>Salman </em>Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\"><em>Dirks </em>specifies that when a tipper gives inside information to \u201ca trading relative or friend,\u201d the jury can infer that the tipper meant to provide the equivalent of a cash gift. In such situations, \u25a0 the tipper'benefits personally because giving a gift of trading information is the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds. Here, by disclosing confidential information as a gift to his brother with the expectation that he would trade on it, [the tipper] breached his- duty of trust' and confidence to [his employer] and its clients \u2014 a duty [the defendant] acquired, and breached himself, by trading on the information with full knowledge that it had been improperly disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 428. The Supreme Court also mentioned the <em>Neuman </em>decision, observing that \u201c[t]o the extent the Second Circuit held that the tipper must also receive something of a \u2018pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\u2019 in exchange'for a gift to family or 'friends, ... this requirement is inconsistent with <em>Dif'ks.\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">In light of <em>Salman, </em>we requested additional briefing from the parties and scheduled a second round of oral argument to address how <em>Salman </em>affects this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-19\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">As noted, above, Martoma challenges both the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial and the adequacy of the district court\u2019s jury instruction. A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cbears a heavy burden,\u201d and \u201cthe standard of review is exceedingly deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Coplan, </em>703 F.3d 46, 62 (2d Cir. 2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn evaluating a sufficiency challenge, we \u2018must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, crediting every inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>could have been drawn in the government\u2019s favor, and deferring to the jury\u2019s assessment of witness credibility and its assessment of the weight of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>549 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2008)). \u201cAlthough sufficiency review is <em>de novo, </em>we will uphold the judgment[ ] of conviction if <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (citation omitted). \u201cA judgment of acquittal is warranted only if the evidence that the defendant committed the crime alleged is nonexistent or so meager that no reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiau, </em>734 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2013) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">With respect to Martoma\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s jury instruction, \u201c[w]e review a jury charge in its entirety and not on the basis of excerpts taken out of context.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>328 F.3d 77, 82 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Zvi, </em>168 F.3d 49, 58 (2d Cir. 1999)). \u201cA conviction based on a general verdict is subject to challenge if the jury was instructed on alternative theories of guilt and may have relied on an invalid one.\u201d <em>Hedgpeth v. Pulido, </em>555 U.S. 57, 58, 129 S.Ct. 530, 172 L.Ed.2d 388 (2008). Such a challenge, however, is subject to harmless error review. <em>See id. </em>at 58, 61-62, 129 S.Ct. 530. And because Marto-ma raises his challenge to the jury instruction for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Vilar, </em>729 F.3d 62, 70 (2d Cir. 2013). Under the plain error standard, an appellant must demonstrate that \u201c(1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; (3) the error affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights ...; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>560 U.S. 258, 262, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201c[W]e look not to the law at the time of the trial court\u2019s decision to assess whether the error was plain, but rather, to the law as it exists at the time of review.\u201d <em>Vilar, </em>729 F.3d at 71. Even with respect to an instructional error that \u201cincorrectly omitted an element of the offense,\u201d we will not overturn a conviction \u201cif we find that the jury would have returned the same verdict beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and thus that \u201cthe error did not affect [the defendant\u2019s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Nouri, </em>711 F.3d 129, 139-140 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">We first evaluate Martoma\u2019s sufficiency challenge. In <em>Newman, </em>the Court noted that \u201cthe tipper\u2019s gain need not be <em>immediately </em>pecuniary,\u201d and, invoking <em>United States v. Jiau, </em>734 F.3d 147 (2d Cir. 2013), explained that \u201center[ing] into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>relationship of <em>quid quo pro </em>with [a tip-pee], and therefore halving] the opportunity to ... yield future pecuniary gain,\u201d constituted a personal benefit giving rise to insider trading liability. <em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452. That is exactly what happened in this case. Martoma was a frequent and lucrative client for Dr. Gilman, who was paid $1,000 per hour for approximately 43 consultation sessions. At the same time, Dr. Gilman was regularly feeding Martoma confidential information about the safety results of clinical trials involving bapineu-zumab. And when Dr. Gilman gained access to the final clinical study efficacy data in July 2008, he immediately passed it along to Martoma. It is time that Dr. Gil-man did not bill Martoma specifically for the July 17 and 19, 2008 meetings at which Dr. Gilman provided Martoma with the efficacy data \u2014 because, as he admitted at trial, doing so \u201cwould [have been] tantamount to confessing that [he] was .., giving [Martoma] inside information.\u201d Tr. 1918. But in the context of their ongoing \u201crelationship of <em>quid pro quo,\u201d Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452, where Dr. Gilman regularly disclosed confidential information in exchange for fees, \u201ca rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime [of insider trading] beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d under a pecuniary <em>quid pro quo </em>theory. <em>Coplan, </em>703 F.3d at 62 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Because the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to sustain Martoma\u2019s conviction, we turn next to his challenge to the district court\u2019s jury instruction. His argument on this front focuses on the theory, originating in <em>Dirks, </em>that the personal benefit necessary to establish insider trading liability in a tipping case can be inferred from a gift of inside information \u201cto a trading relative or friend.\u201d <em>See Dirks, </em>463\u2019 U.S. at 663-64, 103 S.Ct. 3255; <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428. As noted above, <em>Neuman </em>held that this inference was \u201cimpermissible in the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship.\u201d 773 F.3d at 452. Martoma argues that this requirement survives the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Salman </em>and that the jury was not properly instructed on it. Following the logic of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Salman, </em>interpreting <em>Dirks, </em>we think that <em>Neuman\u2019s, </em>\u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement can no longer be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The Supreme Court explained in <em>Dirks </em>that a tippee who knowingly trades on material nonpublic information obtained from an insider does not necessarily violate insider trading law. <em>See </em>463 U.S. at 658-59, 103 S.Ct. 3255. But \u201c[t]he conclusion that recipients of inside information do not invariably acquire a duty to disclose or abstain does not mean that such tippees always are free to trade on the information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 103 S.Ct. 3255. Instead, \u201cthe tippee\u2019s duty to disclose or abstain is derivative from that of the insider\u2019s duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 103 S.Ct. 3255. \u201cThus, some tippees must assume an insider\u2019s duty to the shareholders not because they receive inside information, but rather because it has been made available to them <em>improperly.\u201d Id. </em>at 660, 103 S.Ct. 3255 (emphasis in original). As a result, \u201ca tippee assumes a fiduciary duty ... not to trade on material nonpublic information only when the insider has breached his fiduciary duty ... by disclosing the information to the tippee and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 103 S.Ct. 3255.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\"><em>Dirks </em>further observed that \u201c[w]hether disclosure is a breach of duty ... depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>in large part on the purpose of the disclosure,\u201d namely \u201cwhether the insider personally will benefit, directly or indirectly, from his disclosure,\u201d because \u201c[a]bsent some personal gain, there has been no breach of duty to stockholders.\u201d 463 U.S. at 662, 103 S.Ct. 3255; <em>see also id. </em>at 659, 103 S.Ct. 3255 (\u201c[Tippers] may not give [inside] information to an outsider for the ... improper purpose of exploiting .the information for their personal gain.\u201d). In the context of this discussion, <em>Dirks </em>gave several . examples of situations in which an insider would personally benefit from disclosing inside information: disclosing inside information in a <em>quid pro quo </em>relationship, disclosing inside information with \u201can intention to benefit the particular recipient,\u201d and disclosing inside information as \u201ca gift ... to a trading relative or friend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s claim, <em>see </em>Dissent Op. at 83, this discussion did not purport to <em>limit </em>to these examples the situations in which a personal benefit can be inferred; the broader inquiry underlying the examples remained \u201cwhether the insider personally will benefit, directly or indirectly, from his disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 103 S.Ct. 3255.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><em>Newman, </em>however, did view these examples as limiting the situations in which a personal benefit could be inferred. As relevant to this case, <em>Neuman </em>held that the jury was <em>never </em>permitted to infer that a tipper had personally benefited from disclosing inside information as a gift unless that-gift was made to someone with whom the tipper had \u201ca meaningfully close personal relationship,\u201d 773 F.3d at 452, seek-tag to give definition to the \u201cfriend\u201d language from <em>Dirks</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But in evaluating this gloss on <em>Dirks, </em>it is critical to keep in mind that the ultimate inquiry under <em>Dirks </em>is whether a tipper has personally benefited from a disclosure of inside information such that he has violated his fiduciary duty, and it is not apparent that the examples in <em>Dirks </em>support a categorical rule that an insider can never benefit personally from gifting inside information to people other than \u201cmeaningfully close\u201d friends or family members \u2014 especially because the justification for construing gifts as involving a personal benefit is that \u201c[t]he tip and trade resemble trading, by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\u201d <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255, an observation that holds true even if the tipper and tippee were, for example, business school classmates who \u201chad known each other for years\u201d rather than \u201cclose friends.\u201d <em>See Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Despite some tension between <em>Newman </em>and <em>Dirks, </em>\u201cit would ordinarily be neither appropriate nor possible for [a panel] to reverse an existing Circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Shipping Corp. of India v.

The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Salman </em>explicitly rejected certain aspects of <em>Newman. See </em>137 S.Ct. at 428. While the Supreme Court did not have occasion to expressly overrule <em>Newman's </em>requirement that the tipper have a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d with a tippee to justify the inference that a tipper receiv\u00e9d a personal benefit from his gift' of inside information \u2014 because that aspect of <em>Neio-man </em>was not at issue in <em>Salman </em>\u2014 \u201c[e]ven if the effect of a Supreme Court decision is \u2018subtle,\u2019 it may nonetheless alter the relevant analysis fundamentally enough to require overruling prior, \u2018inconsistent\u2019 precedent.\u201d <em>Doscher, </em>832 F.3d at 378 (quoting <em>Wojchowski v. Daines, </em>498 F.3d 99, 108 (2d Cir. 2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We respectfully conclude <em>that: Salman </em>fundamentally altered the analysis underlying <em>Newman's </em>\u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement such that the \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement is no longer good law. In a case involving a tipper and tippee who were brothers, <em>Salman </em>found it \u201cobvious\u201d that an insider would personally benefit from \u201ctrading] on [inside] information ... himself and then giv[ing] the proceeds as a gift to his brother.\u201d 137 S.Ct. at 427-28. And <em>Salman </em>observed that an insider \u201ceffectively achieved] the same result by disclosing the information to [the tippee], and allowing him to trade on it,\u201d because \u201cgiving a gift of [inside] information is the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cMaking a gift of inside information to a relative ... is little different from trading on the information, obtaining the profits, and doling them out....\u201d). For this reason, <em>Salman </em>cited <em>Dirks\u2019s </em>observation that \u201c\u2018insiders [are] forbidden\u2019 both \u2018from personally using undisclosed corporate information to their advantage\u2019 and from \u2018giv[ing] such information to- an outsider for the same improper purpose of exploiting the information for their personal gain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 659, 103 S.Ct. 3255) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">It is true that <em>Dirks </em>and <em>Salman </em>largely confine their discussion of gifts to \u201ctrading relative[s] and friend[s],\u201d and, as indicated earlier, <em>Salman </em>did not specifically hold that gifts to anyone, not just relatives and friends, give rise to the personal benefit needed to establish insider trading liability (presumably because <em>Salman </em>involved tips between brothers, comfortably within the \u201ctrading relative\u201d language of <em>Dirks). </em>However, the straightforward logic of the gift-giving analysis in <em>Dirks, </em>strongly reaffirmed in <em>Salman, </em>is that a' corporate insider personally benefits whenever he \u201cdisclos[es] inside information as a gift ... with the expectation that [the recipient] would trade\u201d on the basis of. such information or otherwise exploit it for his pecuniary gain. <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428. That is because such a disclosure is the functional equivalent of trading on the information himself and giving a cash gift to the recipient. Nothing in <em>Salman\u2019s </em>reaffirmation of this logic supports a distinction between gifts to people with whom a tipper shares a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d \u2014 a term left undefined in <em>Newman, </em>but which apparently did not reach two people who \u201chad known each other for years, having both attended business school and worked ... together,\u201d 773 F.3d at 452 \u2014 and gifts to those with whom a tipper does not share such a relationship. If the insider discloses inside information \u201cwith the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it,\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428, and the disclosure \u201cresemble[s] trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 427 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255), he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>personally benefits for the reasons described in <em>Dirks </em>and <em>Salman.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Indeed, <em>Dirks </em>seems to have at least implicitly shared this understanding: Although the tippee in <em>Dirks </em>did not have a personal relationship of any kind, let alone a friendship, with the tippers who gave him inside information, the Supreme Court applied the gift theory to his case. <em>See Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 648-49, 667, 103 S.Ct. 3255 (\u201c[N]or was [the tippers\u2019] purpose to make a gift of valuable information to Dirks.\u201d); <em>see also Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 427 (\u201cWe then applied this gift-giving principle to resolve <em>Dirks </em>itself....\u201d). This approach makes sense in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201c\u2018insiders [are] forbidden\u2019 both \u2018from personally using undisclosed corporate information to their advantage\u2019 and from \u2018giv[ing] such information to an outsider for the same improper purpose of exploiting the information for their personal gain\u2019 \u201d \u2014 a statement not limited by the relationships of the parties. <em>See Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 659, 103 S.Ct. 3255) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">An example illustrates the point. Imagine that a corporate insider, instead of giving a cash end-of-year gift to his doorman, gives a tip of inside information with instructions to trade on the information and consider the proceeds of the trade to be his end-of-year gift. In this example, there may not be a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d between the tipper and tippee, yet this clearly is an illustration of prohibited insider trading, as the insider has given a tip of valuable inside information in lieu of a cash gift and has thus personally benefitted from the disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Thus, we hold that an insider or tipper personally benefits from a disclosure of inside information whenever the information was disclosed \u201cwith the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it,\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428, and the disclosure \u201cresemble[s] trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 427 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255), whether or not there was a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d between the tipper and tippee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The dissent criticizes us for \u201chold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ing that someone who gives a gift <em>always </em>receives a personal benefit from doing so\u201d and that \u201can insider receives a personal benefit when the insider gives inside information as a \u2018gift\u2019 to <em>any </em>person.\u201d Dissent Op. at 75. But our holding reaches only the insider who discloses inside information to someone <em>he expects mil trade on the information. </em>This holding is no broader than the logic underpinning the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Salman. </em>Indeed, as noted above, the Supreme Court has found it \u201cobvious\u201d that an insider would personally benefit from \u201ctrad[ing] on [inside] information ... himself and then giv[ing] the proceeds as a gift to his brother.\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 427-28. Our holding comports with <em>Salman\u2019s </em>observation that personal benefit to the insider is equally obvious when an insider \u201ceffectively achievefs] the same result by disclosing the information to [the tippee]\u201d for the purpose of \u201callowing [the tippee] to trade on it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, not all disclosures of inside information will meet this test. For example, disclosures for whistleblowing purposes to reveal a fraud, <em>see Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 649-50, 667, 103 S.Ct. 3255, and inadvertent disclosures, <em>see id. </em>at 663 <em>&amp; </em>n.23, 103 S.Ct. 3255, are not disclosures made \u201cwith the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on\u201d them and thus involve no personal benefit to the insider. <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428. There may also be other situations in which the facts do not justify the inference that information was disclosed \u201cwith the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it,\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428, and that the disclosure \u201cresemble[s] trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 427 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255). As a result, our holding does not eliminate or vitiate the personal benefit rule; it merely acknowledges that it is <em>possible </em>to personally benefit from a disclosure of inside information as a gift to someone with whom one does not share a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship.\u201d Phrased another way, we reject, in light of <em>Salman, </em>the categorical rule that an insider can <em>never </em>personally benefit from disclosing inside information as a gift without a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">It is, of course, the province of the jury to evaluate competing narratives and decide what actually motivated a tipper to disclose confidential information, and consequently, whether there was a personal benefit to the insider on the facts of a particular case. How can jurors, or this Court on appeal, know that inside information was disclosed \u201cwith the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it,\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428, and that the disclosure \u201cresemble[d] trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient\u201d? <em>Id. </em>at 427 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255). Arguably, <em>Newman\u2019s </em>\u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement could be construed as limited to the question of the sufficiency of <em>circumstantial </em>evidence in an insider trading case. <em>See </em>773 F.3d at 451-53. But <em>Neuman\u2019s </em>sufficiency analysis appeared to assume that the personal benefit involved in giving a gift was \u201cthe ephemeral benefit of the ... friendship\u201d of the recipient of the gift. <em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452 (quoting <em>Jiau, </em>734 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>153); <em>see also id. </em>(explaining that the government cannot \u201cprove the receipt of a personal benefit by the mere fact of a friendship\u201d). Because the Court in <em>Newman </em>was of the opinion that friendship <em>itself, </em>\u201cparticularly of a casual or social nature,\u201d did not constitute a perspnal benefit, it required more. 773 F.3d at 452.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Dirks </em>and reaffirmed, again in <em>Salman, </em>the personal benefit one receives from giving a gift of inside information <em>ia.not </em>the friendship .or loyalty or gratitude of the recipient of .the gift; it is the imputed pecuniary benefit of having effectively profited from the trade oneself and given the proceeds as a cash gift. <em>See Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 427-28; <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255. If under <em>Dirks </em>and <em>Salman </em>it is not correct to characterize the personal benefit at issue in gift-giving as the receipt of friendship, then <em>Newman\u2019s </em>discussion of the circumstances in which a jury can infer that a tipper personally benefitted from disclosing inside information as a gift must now be considered inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The dissent argues that \u201c[w]hat counts as a \u2018gift\u2019 is vague and subjective.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dissent Op. at 75. We reiterate the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[determining whether an insider personally benefits from a particular disclosure, a question of fact, will not always be easy for courts.\u201d Salman, 137 S.Ct. at 429 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255) (alteration in original). As the dissent points out, many cases may rely on circumstantial evidence of intent. <em>See </em>Dissent Op. at 82-83; Because we have concluded that the evidence presented at Martoma\u2019s trial was sufficient to convict under a straightforward pecuniary benefit theory, we need not consider the outer boundaries of when a jury is entitled to infer, relying on circumstantial evidence, that a particular disclosure was made \u201cwith the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it,\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428, and \u201cresemble[d] trading by the insider followed by a gift of th\u00e9 profits to the recipient,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 427 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255). It is worth noting, however, that not all insider trading cases rely on circumstantial evidence. In some cases, the tipper may cooperate with the government and testify against the tippee, providing information on the motivation for disclosing inside information. In other cases, other witnesses might testify about conversations with a tipper that shed light on the tipper\u2019s intentions. Thus, while concerns about the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence on the gift theory are not wholly without basis, the response to those 'Concerns lies in appellate review of the suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ciency of the evidence of personal benefit, not in a definition of personal benefit that categorically excludes situations where the requisite personal benefit could be proven. In other words, the fact that some cases of insider trading might be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt based on circumstantial evidence (and might consequently be reversed on appeal as supported by insufficient evidence) does not mean that other cases \u2014 the doorman hypothetical discussed above, for example\u2014 should be outside the bounds of insider trading liability even where the government has put forward adequate proof of personal benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As a final note on this point, the dissent is correct that the legality and ethics of insider trading are not necessarily coextensive. <em>See </em>Dissent Op. at 91. But the legality of insider trading <em>is </em>coextensive with a corporate insider\u2019s-fiduciary duty of loyalty to the corporation. <em>See Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 659-60, 103 S.Ct. 3256. The dissent would hold, in effect, that a corporate insider does not violate his or her duty of loyalty by disclosing inside information to an outsider as a gift with no legitimate corporate purpose so long as the gift is to someone with whom the insider does not share a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship.\u201d In our view, for the reasons discussed above, <em>Salman </em>and <em>Dirks </em>compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Having concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support Martoma\u2019s conviction and that <em>Newman's </em>\u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement is no longer good law, the remaining question is whether the district court\u2019s jury instruction, which Martoma challenges for its failure to include Newman\u2019s \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement, accurately conveyed the elements of insider trading. The jury instruction given at Martoma\u2019s trial stated that a \u201cgift [given] with the goal of maintaining or developing a personal friendship or a useful networking contact\u201d constitutes a personal benefit. Tr, 3191.. Martoma focuses. - on the language .about <em>developing </em>friendships, arguing that .gifts given to develop <em>future </em>friendships do not give rise to the personal benefit needed to trigger insider trading liability. <em>Salman </em>reiterated that when confidential information is given as a gift, it is \u201cthe same -thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds\u201d and is thus the functional equivalent of a cash gift. <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428. Whether ,the recipient of the giffc.-is an existing friend or a potential future friend whom a gift is intended to entice, the logic \u2014 that a tipper personally benefits by giving inside information in lieu of a .cash gift \u2014 operates in a similar manner. For this reason, the aspect of the district court\u2019s instruction on gifts with the goal of <em>developing, </em>friendships, which is at most \u201csubject to reasonable dispute,\u201d did not constitute \u201cobvious\u201d error. <em>Marcus, </em>560 U.S. at 262, 130 S.Ct. 2159 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Even if the jury instruction was obviously erroneous \u2014 which we hold it was not \u2014 that error did not impair Martoma\u2019s substantial rights in light of the compelling evidence that Dr. Gilman, the tipper, received substantial financial benefit in exchange for providing confidential information to Martoma. As discussed above, Dr. Gilman, over the course of approximately 18 months and 43 paid consultation sessions for which he billed $1,000 an hour, regularly and <em>intentionally </em>provided Mar-toma with confidential information from \u25a0the bapineuzumab clinical trial. Martoma kept coming back, specifically scheduling consultation sessions so that they would occur shortly after-the safety monitoring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>committee meetings, when Dr. Gilman would have new information to pass along \u2014 and starting at least in August 2007, Dr. Gilman would reschedule his conversations with Martoma if he had no new information to reveal at the time they were scheduled to meet. Thus, the consulting relationship between Dr. Gilman and Mar-toma at that point involved no \u201clegitimate service,\u201d <em>see </em>Dissent Op. at 91; as Dr. Gilman testified at trial, \u201cthe purpose of those consultations was for [him] to disclose to [Martoma] confidential information about the results ... of the last Safety Monitoring Committee [meeting].\u201d Tr. 1274:6-9. And because Martoma continued to see Dr. Gilman to receive confidential information, Dr. Gilman continued to receive consulting fees. The fact that Dr. Gilman did not specifically bill for his July 17 and 19, 2008 conversations with Marto-ma in which Dr. Gilman divulged the final drug efficacy data does not alter the inescapable conclusion that in the context of this \u201crelationship of <em>quid pro quo,\u201d Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452, Dr. Gilman\u2019s disclosure of confidential information was designed to \u201ctranslate into future earnings.\u201d <em>United States v.

The rule allows many people \u2014 including reporters and stock analysts \u2014 not to worry that they will become felons or face civil liability for telling information to others who later happen to trade on it. Without evidence that an insider let details slip in return for a personal benefit for himself or herself, the government cannot convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Today, the majority holds that an insider receives a personal benefit when the insider gives inside information as a \u201cgift\u201d to <em>any </em>person. In holding that someone who gives a gift <em>always </em>receives a personal benefit from doing so, the majority strips the long-standing personal benefit rule of its limiting power. What counts as a \u201cgift\u201d is vague and subjective. Juries, and, more dangerously, prosecutors, can now seize on this vagueness and subjectivity. The result will be liability in many cases where it could not previously lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In the past, we have held that an insider receives a personal benefit from bestowing a \u201cgift\u201d of information in only one narrow situation. That is when the insider gives information to family or friends \u2014 persons highly unlikely to use it for commercially legitimate reasons. Today\u2019s opinion goes far beyond that limitation, which was set by the Supreme Court in <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. 646, 103 S.Ct. 3266, received elaboration in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d 438, and was left undisturbed by the Supreme Court in <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. 420. In rejecting those precedents, the majority opinion significantly diminishes the limiting power of the personal benefit rule, and radically alters insider-trading law for the worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">1. The Personal Benefit Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">To prevail in an insider-trading case based on a tip from an insider to a trader, the government must prove several elements. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jiau, </em>734 F.3d 147, 163 (2d Cir. 2013). Among them, the government must show that the insider had a fiduciary duty to protect the confidential information and nonetheless disclosed it in return for a personal benefit. <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 659-64, 103 S.Ct. 3266.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The requirement of a personal benefit exists because not \u201c[a]ll disclosures of confidential corporate information are ... inconsistent with the duty insiders owe to shareholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661, 103 S.Ct. 3255. The law targets only someone who \u201ctakes advantage\u201d of inside information to make \u201csecret profits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, 103 S.Ct. 3255. For example, the insider who reveals information inadvertently \u2014 perhaps letting it slip accidentally during a legitimate business conversation \u2014 has not committed insider trading. <em>See S.E.C. v. Obus, </em>693 F.3d 276, 287 (2d Cir. 2012) (noting liability likely would not he for an inadvertent disclosure); <em>see also Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 662, 103 S.Ct. 3255. Similarly, insiders speaking for public-spirited reasons, such as \u201ca desire to expose ... fraud,\u201d do not commit insider trading. <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 667, 103 S.Ct. 3255. To ensure that these cases, and similar ones, do not result in criminal or civil liability, the law requires the government to show that an insider benefitted personally in return for a tip.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">a. Reasons for the Personal Benefit Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">In introducing the personal benefit rule in <em>Dirks, </em>the Supreme Court explained that it was \u201cessential ... to have a guiding principle for those whose daily activities must be limited and instructed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>SEC\u2019s inside-trading .rules,\u201d and that, without the personal benefit rule, there would be no such \u201climiting principle\u201d for insider-trading liability. <em>Id. </em>at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255. The Supreme Court elaborated that, \u201c[without legal limitations, market participants are forced to rely on the reasonableness of the SEC\u2019s litigation strategy, but that can be hazardous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664 n.24, 103 S.Ct. 3255. Before the personal benefit rule, the SEC believed that it had the power to enforce insider-trading rules against \u201cpersons outside the company such as an analyst or reporter who learns of inside information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). The Supreme Court, troubled by that possibility, created a rule foreclosing such prosecutions except when an insider has personally benefitted from a disclosure. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AuqC\">The Supreme Court also noted that the question of whether an insider personally benefitted from disclosure would \u201crequire[] courts to focus on objective criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 103 S.Ct. 3255. Rather than courts attempting to \u201cread'the parties\u2019 minds,\u201d <em>id., </em>they would look to \u201cobjective facts and circumstances that [would] justify ... an inference\u201d that an insider received a personal benefit, <em>id. </em>at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Without the personal benefit rule, many insider-trading cases would require the government to show few objective facts. Consider, for example, a situation where an insider conveys material, nonpublic information to a reporter, and the reporter tells it to a third person who trades on it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a situation is entirely plausible for a financial news reporter who speaks to many sources. Suppose that the government, however, brings a civil suit against the reporter. To prevail, the government first must show that the insider is at fault by demonstrating that (1) the insider had a duty to keep'the information secret,' but did' not, that (2) the insider knew, or should have known, that the reporter would'benefit from the information, and that (3) the insider personally benefitted from disclosing the information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the government shows that the insider was at fault, the government must show that (4) the reporter knew, or should have known, of the insider\u2019s breach of duty and personal benefit;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Last, the government must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>show that (5) the reporter either knew, or should have known, of the third person\u2019s intention to trade, and that (6) the reporter received a personal benefit from passing the information to the third person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">These requirements at first appear weighty. Except for the \u201cpersonal benefits,\u201d however, the requirements relate only to each individual\u2019s state of mind. In a civil suit, to prove these state-of-mind requirements, the government need not show that the insider <em>knew </em>the reporter would benefit, or that the reporter <em>knew </em>of the insider\u2019s duty and breach or the third person\u2019s intention to trade. It is enough to show that the insider and the reporter <em>should have known.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Typically, circumstantial evidence meets this minimal requirement. The government could argue that the insider and the reporter each heard and shared a certain type of. information with certain people, and thus should have known of the relevant duties, breaches, and benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">In a criminal case, at least in this Circuit, it is not enough for the government to show mere recklessness to fulfill the state-of-mind requirements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The reporter\u2019s conduct must be willful \u2014 he must \u201csubjectively believe\u201d duties were breached. <em>United States v. Mylett, </em>97 F.3d 663, 668 (2d Cir. 1996).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As in civil cases, however, \u201c[sjuch belief may ... be shown by circumstantial evidence,\u201d and the government often argues as much. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The personal benefit requirement limits liability in situations like the one described in the hypothetical above. It requires the government, to show that the insider received a benefit for disclosing the information, that the reporter received a benefit for sharing it, and that the reporter had reason to know of both. Assuming that the personal benefit must be demonstrated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>objective facts, it limits the government's ability to hold persons liable where they \u201cmistakenly think ,.. information already has been disclosed or that it is not material enough to affect the market.\u201d <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 662, 103 S.Ct. 3255; <em>see also Obus, </em>693 F.3d at 287 (noting liability likely would not lie for an inadvertent disclosure). The personal benefit rule makes it unlikely that persons with innocent intentions will violate the law by sharing information with others: someone is unlikely to receive a benefit from sharing information unless he or she knows the information is material and nonpublic. It also provides greater notice to persons hearing information that the information was shared improperly: the awareness that someone benefitted from sharing the information suggests that revealing it was not honorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">b. Evolution of the Personal Benefit Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The development of the personal benefit rule from <em>Dirks, </em>to this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Newman, </em>and then to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Salman, </em>is crucial to understanding why the majority\u2019s rule in the opinion today goes far beyond the law\u2019s previous understanding of what constitutes a personal benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">i. <em>Dirks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>Dirks, </em>the Supreme Court first provided a list of items satisfying the requirement that an insider receive a personal benefit from revealing inside information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad6\">[Cjourts [must] focus on objective criteria, <em>i.e., </em>whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings. There are objective facts and circumstances that often justify such an inference. For example, there may be a relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a <em>quid pro quo </em>from the latter, or an intention to benefit the particular recipient. The elements of fiduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information also exist when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend. The tip and trade resemble trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\"><em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 663-64, 103 S.Ct. 3255 (internal citations omitted). Two of the possible personal benefits, \u201ca pecuniary gain\u201d and \u201ca reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings,\u201d correspond closely with the ordinary understanding of a \u201cbenefit.\u201d The third, \u201ca gift of confidential information,\u201d perhaps corresponds less closely. It is not entirely straightforward why <em>giving </em>a gift provides the gift-giver with a benefit. But the Court restricted the applicability of that theory to cases where the gift is given to the tipper\u2019s \u201ctrading relative or friend.\u201d Such a limitation makes the theory defensible, because, as Justice Breyer noted at oral argument in <em>Salman, </em>\u201cto help a close family member [or friend] is like helping yourself.\u201d Transcript of Oral Argument at 8, <em>Salman v. United States, </em>137 S.Ct. 420 (2016) (No. 15-628).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">ii. <em>Newman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">Our opinion in <em>Newman </em>built on the gift-giving theory in <em>Dirks </em>in two ways.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Newman </em>first held that, when the government wishes to show a personal benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>based on a gift within a friendship, as permitted by <em>Dirks, </em>the friendship must be \u201ca meaningfully close personal relationship\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">To the extent <em>Dirks </em>suggests that a personal benefit may be inferred from a personal relationship between the tipper and tippee, where the tippee\u2019s trades \u201cresemble trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\u201d we hold that <em>such an inference is impermissible in the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship </em>that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ald\"><em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452 (emphasis added) (internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). The opinion in <em>Newman </em>expressed concern that, without such a limitation, the government would present superficial \u201cfriendships\u201d not worthy of the name:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">We have observed that personal benefit is broadly defined to include ... the benefit one would obtain from simply making a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend. This standard, although permissive, does not suggest that the Government may prove the receipt of a personal benefit by the mere fact of a friendship, particularly of a casual or social nature. If that were true, and the Government was allowed to meet its burden by proving that two individuals were alumni of the same school or attended the same church, the personal benefit requirement would be a nullity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\"><em>Id. Newman </em>thus expressed concern that inferring a benefit from a gift within a \u201ccasual or social\u201d relationship failed to honor the requirement that \u201cthe personal benefit received in exchange for confidential information ... be of some consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like <em>Dirks, Newman\u2019s, </em>first holding was clearly animated by the idea that the personal benefit requirement could not become \u201ca nullity\u201d given its role as a limiting principle of liability. <em>Id. </em>It attempted to specify what <em>Dirks </em>had left unclear \u2014 how close persons must be for a gift between them to count as a benefit to the gift-giver.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Second, <em>Newman </em>held that an insider\u2019s gift to a friend only amounted to a personal benefit if the gift might yield money (or something similar) for the insider. 773 F.3d at 452. Although <em>Dirks </em>said that \u201c[t]he elements of fiduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information ... exist when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend,\u201d-463 U.S. at 663-64, 103 S.Ct. 3255, <em>Newman </em>interpreted <em>Dirks </em>to require not merely a gift to a friend, but also that it be given in the context of a relationship that \u201cgenerates an exchange that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">iii. <em>Salman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">After <em>Newman, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>Salman v. United States. Salman </em>involved three persons \u2014 Maher and^ Michael, who were brothers, and Salman, the defendant, who was Maher\u2019s brother-in-law and Michael\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cextended family member.\u201d 137 S.Ct. at 423-24. Maher, who had inside information, would disclose it to his brother Michael, who then passed it to Salman. <em>Id. </em>Salman traded on it. <em>Id. </em>at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">The defendant, Salman, \u201cargue[d] that he [could not] be held liable as a tippee because\u201d Maher \u201cdid not personally ... benefit from\u201d giving tips. <em>Id. </em>at 424. The case, in other words, turned on whether \u201cMaher, the tipper,\u201d received a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>benefit when-he \u201cprovided inside information to a close relative, his brother Michael.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. Salman contended that Maher \u201cdid not personally receive money or property in exchange for the tips and thus did not personally benefit from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>.at 424. In short, Salman argued that even though Maher had disclosed information to his (Maher\u2019s) brother, Maher did not receive a personal benefit from that disclosure unless he also stood to benefit financially from it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had rejected Salman\u2019s argument. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe Court of Appeals properly applied <em>Dirks\u201d </em>in ruling that <em>\u201cDirks </em>allowed the jury to ipfer that the tipper here breached- a duty, because he made a gift of confidential information to a trading relative.\u201d <em>Id, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court held that a tipper did not need to receive money or property to benefit personally when .disclosing to a friend or relative. <em>Id, </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Salman </em>overturned <em>Newman\u2019s </em>second holding, which required a showing that a tipper would receive something of \u201cpecuniary or similarly valuable nature\u201d even when making a gift to relatives or friends. Regarding <em>Newman\u2019s </em>second holding, the Supreme Court wrote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">To the extent the Second Circuit held that the tipper must also receive something of a \u201cpecuniary or similarly valuable nature\" in exchange for a gift to family or friends, <em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452, .,. this requirement is inconsistent with <em>Dirks.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\"><em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428 (internal citation omitted). The Supreme Court .stated that, \u201cwhen a tipper gives inside -information to a trading relative or friend, the jury can infer that the tipper meant to provide the equivalent - of a cash gift.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, after <em>Sal-man, </em>a gift of information to -a \u201ctrading relative or friend\u201d is sufficient, without an accompanying monetary or other gain, for a fact-finder to conclude that a tipper received a personal benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The Supreme Court, however, left <em>Newman\u2019s </em>first holding untouched. The Supreme Court quoted the first holding of <em>Newman, </em>that the inference of a personal benefit from a gift \u201cis impermissible in. the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship.\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 425 (quoting <em>Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452). But the Supreme Court explicitly stated that it overruled <em>Newman </em>only <em>\u201c[t]o the extent\u201d </em>that it.required an insider to \u201creceive something of a \u2018pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\u2019 \u201d as a result of giving a gift to a friend. <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court\u2019s statement showed no disapproval of the \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d language in <em>Newman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Had the Supreme Court discussed the \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement of <em>Newman </em>\u2014 which it did not \u2014 that discussion would have been dicta. <em>Salman </em>considered whether a gift shared between <em>brothers </em>could show a personal benefit. <em>See </em>137 S.Ct. at 424. An opinion considering a relationship between brothers does not need to rule on, or even address, how close two persons\u2019 friendship must be for them really to. be \u201cfriends,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">To the.extent <em>Salman </em>discussed the relationship' between Maher and Michael, it took pains to emphasize, repeatedly, that they were extremely close:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">Maher .enjoyed a close relationship with his older brother, Mounir Kara (known as Michael).... At first he relied on Michael\u2019s chemistry background to help him grasp scientific concepts relevant to his new job. Then, while their father was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>battling cancer, the brothers discussed companies that dealt with innovative cancer treatment and pain management techniques.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzl\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">The evidence at trial established that Maher and Michael enjoyed a \u201cvery close relationship.\u201d Maher \u201cloved his brother very much,\u201d Michael was like \u201ca second father to Maher,\u201d and Michael was the best man at Maher\u2019s wedding to Salman\u2019s sister. Maher testified that he shared inside information with his brother to benefit him and with the expectation that his brother would trade on it. While Maher explained that he disclosed the information in large part to appease Michael (who pestered him incessantly for it), he also testified that he tipped his brother to \u201chelp him\u201d and to \u201cfulfill whatever needs he had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAbQ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">Maher, the tipper, provided inside information to a close relative, his brother Michael.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 424, 427 (citations omitted). The fact that Michael and Maher were not only brothers, but otherwise were \u201cvery close,\u201d \u201cenjoyed a close relationship,\u201d \u201cloved\u201d each other \u201cvery much,\u201d that Michael served as \u201cbest man at Maher\u2019s wedding,\u201d and that the two were \u201cclose relatives\u201d demonstrates that any discussion in <em>Salman </em>of the requirements for the closeness of a friendship was unnecessary to resolve the appeal. The Supreme Court did not need to decide how close a relationship must be for two persons to be \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cmeaningfully close,\u201d because the relationship between Michael and Maher would have satisfied any conceivable test.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Beyond leaving <em>Newman\u2019s </em>first holding untouched, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Salman </em>also declined to adopt the government\u2019s theory of the personal benefit rule, which would have broadened the gift-giving doctrine substantially. In <em>Salman, </em>the , government argued that \u201ca gift of confidential information to anyone, not just a \u2018trading relative or friend,\u2019 is enough to prove securities fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, Such a holding would have substantially broadened the rule in <em>Dirks, </em>which stated that a personal benefit may be inferred when \u201can insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.\u201d 463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255. The Supreme Court did not adopt the government\u2019s view, deciding instead to \u201cadhere to <em>Dirks.\u201d Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">To summarize, <em>Dirks </em>held that a gift of information to an insider\u2019s relatives or friends could permit an inference of a personal benefit. In <em>Newman, </em>we held that such an inference could only be made when (1) the gift was exchanged within a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship,\u201d and (2) a gift created the potential for an insider to receive a pecuniary or similar benefit. <em>Salman </em>reversed the second holding of <em>Newman, </em>requiring the potential of pecuniary gain, but left untouched the first holding that, in order to allow inference of a personal benefit, gifts must be exchanged within a \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">c. The Majority\u2019s Change to the Personal Benefit Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">The majority today articulates a rule that permits inference of a personal benefit whenever an insider makes a \u201cgift\u201d of information to <em>anyone, </em>not just to relatives or meaningfully close friends. As the majority puts it, \u201ca corporate insider personally benefits whenever he discloses inside information as a gift with the expectation that the recipient would trade on the basis of such information or otherwise exploit it for his pecuniary gain.\u201d Op. at 69 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). Or, put another way, \u201c[i]f \u2022 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>insider discloses inside information ... and the disclosure resembles trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient, he personally benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83 (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The majority declines to provide further guidance on what counts as a \u201cgift.\u201d Op. at 72 (\u201c[W]e need not consider the outer boundaries of when a jury is entitled to infer ... that a particular disclosure ... resembled trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). Any disclosure of material, nonpublic information clearly resembles a gift, in that it provides the recipient with something of value. The rule limiting the gift theory to relatives and friends made it largely unnecessary to ask what distinguished a \u201cgift\u201d from a non-gift disclosure, in that most insiders have few reasons beyond gift-giving to share valuable business secrets with close friends or family members. But in other cases, simply telling a jury to distinguish between a disclosure that is a gift, as opposed to one that is not, with no further guidance, invites decision-making that is entirely arbitrary and subjective. It puts the analysis largely on the intentions of the parties, which is likely to be unclear and proven through circumstantial evidence. In short, it undermines the objectivity and limitation that the personal benefit rule is designed to provide. <em>See Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 662-64, 103 S.Ct. 3256.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The majority emphasizes that the vastly-expanded \u201cgift\u201d rule \u201creaches only the insider [or other tipper] who discloses information to someone <em>he expects mil trade on the information.\u201d </em>Op. at 71 (emphasis in original). This rule is a separate requirement for insider-trading liability in tipping cases, <em>see Obus, </em>693 F.3d at 286-87; <em>United States v. Gansman, </em>657 F.3d 85, 92 (2d Cir. 2011),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> so the majority\u2019s reiteration of it does not add a new limitation to replace the personal benefit rule. It is, moreover, no significant limitation at all. The majority acknowledges that \u201cmany cases may rely on circumstantial evidence of intent.\u201d Op. at 72. That means, even in a criminal case, that the government needs to show no objective facts to demonstrate a tipper\u2019s expectation that a tippee would benefit from the information. And, as noted above, civil cases do not even require that the tipper <em>actually </em>thought the tippee would trade, but instead just that the tipper <em>should have known </em>that the information would prompt a trade or a further tip.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In short, the independent requirement that the government show circumstantial evidence that a defendant knew, or should have known, that a recipient would trade on information, or otherwise benefit from it, does not rescue the majority\u2019s weakening of the personal benefit rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The majority also notes that defendants convicted under the greatly-expanded \u201cgift\u201d rule will have the right to \u201cappellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence of personal benefit.\u201d Op. at 73. In other words, persons dealing with inside information should not worry that they may be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances, because after they are convicted, they will enjoy a review proceeding where they \u201ccarry a heavy burden\u201d to show that, \u201cdrawing all inferences in favor of the prosecution and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d <em>no </em>rational trier of fact could have found that a disclosure was a gift. <em>See United States v. Santos, </em>449 F.3d 93, 102 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is unclear why the majority believes that the cure for convictions that may rely entirely on circumstantial evidence is a proceeding where that same circumstantial evidence is evaluated in the light least favorable to the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The majority\u2019s rule is inconsistent with <em>Newman's, </em>\u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement, which the majority explicitly overrules. The majority claims that <em>Salman </em>\u201ccast[ ] doubt\u201d on the rule. Op. at 68. The majority takes this view even though <em>Salman </em>explicitly abrogated <em>Newman </em>only in a single, narrower respect; even though <em>Salman </em>had no occasion to discuss friendships since the ease was about brothers; and even though <em>Sal-man </em>emphatically declared the Supreme Court\u2019s intention to adhere to <em>Dirks, </em>which was the basis of <em>Newman. </em>The source of the majority\u2019s doubt is mysterious.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The majority also makes a bolder claim: that the limitation described in Dirks\u2014 that a personal benefit may only be inferred from a gift when the gift is between friends or relatives \u2014 is no longer good law. Op. at 81-82 (noting that \u201c[i]f the insider discloses inside information ... and the disclosure resembles trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient, he personally benefits,\u201d and suggesting that the rule is \u201cnot limited by the relationships of the parties,\u201d and that the rule may apply even without \u201ca personal relationship of any kind, let alone a friendship\u201d between tipper and tippee (internal quotation-marks and brackets omitted)). The majority reaches this conclusion even though, as noted, <em>Salman </em>spoke only of gifts raising the inference of a personal benefit when \u201ca tipper gives inside information to a <em>trading relative or friend,\u201d </em>137 S.Ct. at 428 (emphasis added), and even though <em>Salman </em>specifically noted the government\u2019s view that all gifts (no matter to whom) count as benefits, but did not adopt that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">i. The Majority\u2019s Reading of <em>Salman </em>and <em>Dirks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The majority seizes on several features of <em>Salman </em>to contend that the decision called into question the \u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement of <em>Newman </em>and the \u201cfriends and relatives\u201d limitation of <em>Dirks. </em>First, the majority quotes <em>Salman </em>as saying that \u201c\u2018insiders [are] forbidden\u2019 both \u2018from personally using undisclosed corporate information to their advantage\u2019 and from \u2018giv[ing] such information to an outsider for the same improper purpose of exploiting the information for their personal gain,\u2019 \u201d and sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>gests that this statement is not limited to gifts between relatives, and friends. Op. at 69, 70. 'This quotation, however, comes from a parenthetical in <em>Salman </em>summarizing <em>Dirks, </em>which, when read in context, does not suggest that liability can be sustained by gifts other than those to relatives and friends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_at\"><em>Maher 'effectively achieved the same result by disclosing the information to Michael, [his brother,] and allowing him to trade on it. Dirks </em>appropriately prohibits that approach, as well. <em>Cf. </em>463 U.S., at 669 [103 S.Ct. 3266] (holding that \u201cinsiders [are] forbidden\u201d- both \u201cfrom personally using undisclosed corporate information to their advantage\u201d and from \u201cgivfing] such information to an outsider for the same improper purpose of exploiting the information for their personal gain\u201d). <em>Dirks specifies that when a tipper gives inside information to \u201ca trading relative or friend, </em>\u201d the jury can infer that the tipper meant to provide the equivalent of a cash gift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">137 S.Ct. at 428 (emphasis added) (brackets in original). The majority quotes the Supreme Court\u2019s parenthetical, leaving unstated its previous sentences applying the theory to a family member, and its next sentence summarizing <em>Dirks </em>as permitting an inference of. benefit when the insider gives a gift to \u201ca trading relative or friend.\u201d Given this language, the Supreme Court cannot have meant, by writing the above-quoted passage, to rule on whether gifts permit the inference of a benefit when they are given to persons other than trading relatives or friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Although the Supreme Court repeatedly stated in <em>Dirks </em>and <em>Salman </em>that a personal benefit may be inferred from an insider\u2019s \u201cgift ... to a trading relative or friend,\u201d the majority believes those statements were not meant \u201cto <em>limit\u201d </em>the \u201cgift\u201d theory to gifts between relatives or friends. Op. at 68. But the majority does not explain why, if the Supreme Court meant that <em>any </em>gift could create the inference of a benefit, it would have repeatedly referred only to gifts among friends and relatives. Such an intention would be particularly puzzling given the sheer number of times in <em>Salman </em>the Supreme Court listed this qualification, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">A tipper breaches such a fiduciary duty, we held [in <em>Dirks], </em>when the tipper discloses the inside information for a personal benefit. And, we went on to say, a jury can infer a personal benefit ... where the tipper receives something of value in exchange for the tip or \u201cmakes a gift of confidential information to <em>a trading relative or friend.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAdW\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">In particular, we held [in <em>Dirks] </em>that \u201cthe elements of fiduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information also exist <em>when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAh\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\"><em>Dirks </em>makes clear that a tipper breaches a fiduciary duty by making a gift of confidential information to <em>\u201ca trading relative,\u201d </em>and that rule is sufficient to resolve the case at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAc\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\"><em>Dirks </em>specifies that when a tipper gives inside information 'to <em>\u201ca trading relative or friend,\u201d </em>the jury can infer that the tipper meant to provide the\u2019 equivalent of a cash gift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">137 S.Ct. at 423, 427, 428 (emphasis added). In the majority\u2019s view, the Supreme Court\u2019s references to \u201ca trading relative or friend,\u201d stated in <em>Dirks </em>and rep\u00e9ated nearly a half-dozen times in <em>Salman,' </em>are just superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The majority additionally notes that the Supreme Court \u201capplied\u201d the gift theory in <em>Dirks, </em>where there was no \u201cpersonal relationship of. any kind\u201d between Dirks and the insiders, and suggests that <em>Dirks </em>\u201cimplicitly\u201d agreed with the position that the gift theory is \u201cnot limited by the relationships of the parties.\u201d Op. at 69-70. It is true that, in <em>Dirks, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the insiders\u2019 \u201cpurpose [was not] to make a gift of valuable information to Dirks.\u201d <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 667, 103 S.Ct. 3255. But the Supreme Court did not say that, <em>had </em>the insiders given a gift, it would have been sufficient to support .liability. The intent to give a gift is a necessary but not sufficient condition for liability under the gift theory; having determined that it was absent, the Supreme Court did not need to discuss the parties\u2019 relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">ii. The Majority\u2019s Argument Based on the Theory that Gifts Resemble an Insider\u2019s Trade Followed by a Gift of Profits</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The majority also emphasizes the .following passage in <em>Salman;</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">In particular, [in <em>Dirks,] </em>we held that \u201cthe elements of fiduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information ... exist <em>when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend\u2019\u2019 </em>In such cases,, \u201cthe tip and trade resemble trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">137 S.Ct. at 427 (citations and brackets omitted; emphasis in original). Omitting the Supreme Court\u2019s italicized statement that the rule applies to gifts between relatives and friends, the majority focuses only on the latter sentence: \u201cIn such cases, the tip and trade resemble trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient.\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 427; <em>see </em>Op. at 69, <em>see also id. </em>at 69-70. The majority states that this sentence means that \u201cthe personal benefit one receives from giving a gift of inside information is <em>not </em>the friendship or loyalty or gratitude of the recipient of the gift; it is the imputed pecuniary benefit of having effectively profited from the trade oneself and -given the proceeds as a cash gift.\u201d Op. at 72(em-phasis in original). Accordingly, the majority believes a benefit may be imputed to a gift-giver even when the recipient is not a friend or relative. The <em>only - </em>question should be whether \u201cthe tip and trade resemble trading by the insider followed by a gift-of the profits to the recipient.\u201d Op. at 69 (brackets omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">There are several problems with this line of argument. First, the majority does not consider that there may be <em>two </em>limitations on whether a particular disclosure confers a \u201cpersonal benefit,\u201d and that each limitation need not spring from the same reasoning. It is perfectly reasonable to say that gifts can, <em>in principle, </em>confer a personal benefit to the giver, but that <em>most </em>gifts actually confer little or no such benefit. And a main area in which it is reasonable to see gifts as creating a benefit for the gift-giver is when the gifts go to family or close friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Gifts to family or friends are more likely to confer a benefit upon the gift-giver because, as noted above, \u201cto help a close family member [or friend] is like helping yourself.\u201d Transcript of Oral Argument at 8, <em>Salman v. United States, </em>137 S.Ct. 420 (2016) (No. 15-628). This is true for several reasons. First, a person often benefits directly when making significant gifts to friends and relatives. A family member who receives a new car or apartment (or even a book) might share it with the gift-giver; similarly, providing a stock tip to a relative may obviate the need to give the type of loan sometimes expected of close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>kin. A gift-giver may also benefit because of his or her genuine enjoyment of the recipient\u2019s happiness. And last, the gift-giver may benefit from improved relations with friends or relatives. When gifts pass to relatives or friends, there is thus far greater reason than usual to believe that the gift-giver has benefitted personally, as the same benefits rarely accompany a gift to a casual acquaintance or a stranger.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Moreover, permitting a personal benefit to be inferred only from those gifts between relatives and friends avoids much of the potential for liability based on innocent conduct that might flow from a broader \u201cgift\u201d rule. As noted above, insiders typically have no legitimate commercial reason to share business secrets with friends and family. An inference that information passed by the insider to a friend or relative was intended as a gift, rather than for business reasons, is thus far more defensible than a similar inference based on a gift between strangers or colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In demanding that the \u201cgift\u201d rule be justified by a single line of reasoning, the majority ignores the fact that logically independent limitations often cabin legal rules that would otherwise be unworkable because they extend too far. For example, in tort law, the doctrine that persons are liable for harms brought about by their actions is limited by what consequences they might reasonably have foreseen, and other rules of proximate causation. <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island R. R. Co., </em>248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1928). In contract law, the principle that the parties\u2019 agreement at the time of the contract sets their duties is limited by a freestanding rule of impracticability. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 261 (Am, Law Inst. 1981). In the law of insider trading, the Supreme Court appears to have made a similar rule. It stated the principle that gifts may confer a benefit to the gift-giver because of their similarity to trading and gifting the profits, but limited that rule\u2019s reach to situations where the recipient is a relative or friend. And the limitation to friends and relatives prevents the gift rule from extending much too far: if interpreted broadly, the term \u201cgift\u201d could cover nearly any disclosure, and thus eliminate the personal benefit rule entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Finally, even if tension exists between the principles that (1) a gift of information may provide an insider a benefit, and (2) that such a benefit may be inferred only from gifts to family and friends, such tension has existed since <em>Dirks, </em>where both of these statements appear. <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3256. Our opinion in <em>Newman </em>chose between the two (arguably) competing rationales, and emphatically stated that we would infer a benefit only where gifts are exchanged within meaningfully close personal relationships. 773 F.3d at 452. Nothing in <em>Salman </em>breaks new ground on the point. Thus, there is nothing new that suggests we should reverse <em>Newman\u2019s </em>decision without a hearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">iii. The Majority\u2019s Theory was Not Adopted in <em>Salman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">I note, also, that the majority\u2019s opinion exactly mirrors the government\u2019s view pressed in Salman: that \u201ca gift of confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>dential information to anyone, not just a \u2018trading relative or Mend,\u2019 is enough to prove securities fraud.\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 426. The Supreme Court, however, did not adopt that view. <em>Id. </em>at 427. It is curious indeed that the majority would understand <em>Salman </em>to require us to take a position that the Supreme Court explicitly considered but did not adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Accordingly, I would hold (1) that <em>Sal-man </em>does not overrule <em>Newman\u2019s, </em>\u201cmeaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement, and (2) that <em>Salman </em>does not overrule the limitation described in both <em>Dirks </em>and in <em>Salman </em>itself \u2014 that an inference of personal benefit may be based on an insider\u2019s gift to relatives or friends, but not a gift to someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">2. Martoma\u2019s Jury Charge Was Plainly Erroneous, and the Error was not Harmless</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Having determined that <em>Newman </em>is still applicable, I next consider, under the standard articulated in <em>Newman, </em>whether Martoma\u2019s jury instruction was plainly erroneous, and, if so, whether the error was harmless. We review for plain error because Martoma did not object to the jury instruction on grounds related to the rule in <em>Newman. See </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 62 (\u201cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d). His slip-up was, of course, eminently understandable, given that the rule in <em>Newman </em>did not yet exist at the time of Martoma\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The plain-error standard requires \u201cthat (1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; (3) the error affected [Marto-ma\u2019s] substantial rights ... and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity[,] or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Prado, </em>815 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">a. The \u201cModified Plain Error Rule\u201d Applies</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">I would apply our \u201cmodified plain error\u201d rule in these circumstances. <em>See United States v. Viola, </em>35 F.3d 37, 41-43 (2d Cir. 1994), In the past, we have held that \u201c[w]here ... the source of an alleged jury instruction error is a supervening decision, we employ a \u2018modified plain-error rule, under which the government, not the defendant, bears the burden to demonstrate that the error was harmless.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Mahaffy, </em>693 F.3d 113, 136 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Bahel, </em>662 F.3d 610, 634 (2d Cir. 2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">A number of panels of this Court have suggested, without deciding, that our \u201cmodified plain error rule\u201d may not have \u201csurvived the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).\u201d <em>Bahel, </em>662 F.3d at 634; <em>see also United States v. Boyland, </em>862 F.3d 279, 289 (2d Cir.2017) (\u201c[W]e have acknowledged doubt as to the continued viability of the modified plain error test but have not had the need to address it.\u201d); <em>United States v. Botti, </em>711 F.3d 299, 308-09 (2d Cir. 2013) (discussing whether <em>Johnson </em>overruled the modified plain error test).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">We should adhere to the modified plain error rule when considering a supervening legal change for two reasons. First, we are bound by <em>post-Johnson </em>precedents of our Court that apply the rule. The panel in <em>Mahaffy </em>recited the modified plain error rule in 2012 \u2014 over a decade after <em>Johnson </em>\u2014 and stated that the rule applied when \u201cthe source of an alleged jury instruction error is a supervening decision.\u201d 693 F.3d at 135-36. The panel then relied on the rule in vacating a conviction. <em>Id. </em>The panel in <em>United States v. Monteteme </em>also relied on the rule, and that case, too, was decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>after <em>Johnson. </em>257 F.3d 210, 223 (2d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Second, neither <em>Johnson </em>nor its reasoning challenges our modified plain error rule. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court considered an appeal of a perjury conviction. <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 463, 117 S.Ct. 1544. During'Johnson\u2019s trial, the district court ruled that the element of materiality, which was required to sustain a conviction under the perjury statute, was a question for the judge and not the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 117 S.Ct. 1544. That decision was \u201cin accordance with then-extant Circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But after Johnson\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995), that materiality in perjury prosecutions was a question for the jury, not the judge. <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 464, 117 S.Ct. 1544.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Johnson did not object at trial to the district judge\u2019s ruling that materiality was a question 'for the judge. She argued on app\u00e9al, however, that she should be excused from showing that the district court\u2019s decision was plainly erroneous instead of merely erroneous, because the error was \u201c \u2018structural,\u2019 and so ... outside [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 52(b) altogether.\u201d' <em>Id. </em>at 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, explaining that \u201cthe seriousness of the error claimed does not remove consideration of it from the ambit of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court noted that Rule 52(b), which sets out the standard for plain error, \u201cby its terms governs direct appeals from judgments of conviction in the federal system, and therefore governs this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court also \u201ccautioned against any unwarranted expansion of Rule 52(b),\u201d discouraging especially \u201cthe creation- out of whole cloth of an exception to [Rule 52(b)], an exception which we have no authority to make.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Even with its strong language, <em>Johnson </em>does not affect our modified plain error rule. <em>Johnson </em>rejected an attempt to ignore the language of Rule 52(b), which reads, as follows: \u201e</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">(b) Plain Error. A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Fed. R, Crira. P. 52. The defendant ih <em>Johnson </em>asked the Supreme Court to go beyond the language of Rule 52(b) by holding that she was not required to show \u201cplain\u201d error, as the rule requires, to gain review of a right \u201cnot brought \u2018 to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d But the modified plain error rule in our Circuit does not lessen the degree of error a defendant must show to gain review. Instead, the modified plain error rule allocates the burden for considering whether a plain error \u201caffects substantial rights.\u201d Rule 52(b) says nothing about that burden. Nor did <em>Johnson: </em>the Supreme Court explicitly declined to decide whether the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, given that the government would have prevailed for other reasons. 520 U.S. at 469, 117 S.Ct. 1544.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">Consequently, I would apply the modified plain error rule in this context.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">b. Martoma\u2019s Jury Instruction was Plainly Erroneous</p>\n<p id=\"AvP\">The jury instructions given at Marto-ma\u2019s trial permitted conviction if the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>found that the tippers \u201cgave the information to Mr. Martoma ... as a gift with the goal of ... developing a personal friendship.\u201d Tr. at 3191. As the majority opinion appears to acknowledge, <em>see </em>Op. at 73, to say that someone gave a gift \u201cwith the goal of ... <em>developing </em>a personal friendship\u201d means that a personal friendship does not yet exist. The instruction thus allows the government to convict based on a gift between persons who are not friends, but might become friends later.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>Newman </em>held that a personal benefit cannot be inferred from gift-giving \u201cin the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship.\u201d, 773 F.3d at 452. <em>Salman </em>did not abrogate that rule. And whatever counts as a \u201cmeaningfully close\u201d relationship, a non-existent friendship clearly is not one. The instruction is thus plainly erroneous under <em>Newman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">c. The Error was Not Harmless</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The government bears the burden to show that the error was harmless, and \u201c[a]n. error is harmless in this context if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u201d <em>Mahaffy, </em>693 F.3d at 136 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u2022 The government argues that the error was harmless because evidence at trial demonstrated a personal benefit to Gil-man, the source of the information, in two ways. The government argues, first, that the information was a gift within a friendship between Gilman and Martoma, and second, that Gilman received a pecuniary benefit in return for passing.Martoma the information.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">Although a jury 'was entitled to find at Martoma\u2019s trial that either the government\u2019s pecuniary or friendship argument satisfied this test, the government has not carried its \u201cburden to demonstrate that the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Mahaffy, </em>693 F.3d at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">First, it is not clear that Martoma and Gilman had the kind of meaningfully close personal relationship required by <em>Newman. </em>A jury <em>could </em>have seen their relationship that way, Gilman said that it \u201cwas touching\u201d that Martoma had spent time trying to find him on one occasion, Tr. at 1240, and testified that Martoma \u201cwanted to be friends\u201d and \u201cseemed to want to be closer than I thought a client should be to a consultant,\u201d Tr. at 1236. Gilman also stated that he thought he and Martoma \u201cwere friends\u201d eventually. Tr. at 1488. But jurors could also see an ordinary, if pleasant, transactional relationship between a hedge fund trader and a medical expert. For example, the government asked at trial whether Gilman- \u201cenjoy[ed] consulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>with [Martoma] more than other hedge fund clients,\u201d and Gilman responded, \u201cI enjoyed other consultations as well, but I enjoyed speaking with him, yes.\u201d Tr. at 1236. Gilman also stated that Martoma told him many details from his (Marto-ma\u2019s) life, but when the government asked Gilman, \u201cWhat did you talk to him about in your own life?\u201d Gilman responded, \u201cNot much,\u201d Tr. at 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Moreover, at various stages in this case, the government has expressly denied that Martoma and Gilman had any kind of meaningfully close personal relationship. At the first oral argument in this case, the government stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">Judge Chin: Is it possible that the jury convicted because they found that Dr. Gilman provided the information to develop or maintain a friendship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">Government: <em>I suggest that that is not possible, your honor. </em>And the reason is because any friendship ,.. that Dr. Gilman may have had with Mr. Marto-ma, and I think the defense suggests that\u2019s very small, was part of, and inextricably intertwined with, their pecuniary relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Recording of Oral Argument at 26:27-26:58, <em>United States v. Martoma, </em>No. 14-3599 (2d Cir. October 28, 2015) (emphasis added). The government also described the relationship as \u201cclearly a commercial, pecuniary relationship,\u201d given that Gilman was a \u201cdoctor[ ] who never spoke to Marto-ma before he started paying ... and never spoke again once he stopped.\u201d Recording of Oral Argument at 34:18-34:27, <em>United States v. Martoma, </em>No. 14-3599 (2d Cir. October 28, 2015). In light of the government\u2019s own view of the issue, it would seem incorrect to hold that a reasonable jury could not have thought the same: that Martoma and Gilman did not share a meaningfully close personal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">Although it is a much closer question, I would also hold that the government has failed to show that a rational jury must find that Gilman received a pecuniary benefit for disclosing the inside information on which Martoma traded. I do not disagree with the majority that, in the context of a \u201crelationship of <em>quid pro quo,\u201d Newman, </em>773 F.3d at 452, a jury <em>may </em>infer that an insider received a personal benefit from revealing information. But the jury is not required to find as much, and it is not clear that, in this case, a reasonable fact-finder could not have thought otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">At trial, Gilman testified that he did not bill for the sessions in July of 2008 during which he gave Martoma the information leading to Martoma\u2019s trades. Tr. at 1918. Whether Gilman was paid for his disclosures in July of 2008 thus relates to whether one believes either that SAC paid Gil-man earlier in anticipation of the release of the July 2008 information or that Gilman released the information in order that he might be paid by SAC in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The government cites no clear evidence that SAC paid Gilman either before or after July 2008 in return for revealing the information in question, rather than simply paying Gilman for his other consultations with Martoma. And the evidence at trial offered serious reason to doubt that Gil-man took illegal actions because he wanted, as a general matter, to keep payments flowing from SAC. Testimony showed that Gilman was in high demand as an expert. From 2006 to 2010, Gilman earned at least $300,000 per year in consulting fees. Tr. at 1555-56, 1560. This income resulted from services Gilman provided to more than a dozen pharmaceutical and financial companies. Tr. at 1552-54. Gilman testified that, combining his consulting with his position as a professor at the University of Michigan, he \u201cwork[ed] about 80 hours a week on average.\u201d Tr. at 1560. Gilman also testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>fled that he did not recall intentionally revealing confidential information to any of his other clients. Tr. at 1628-29. This suggests that Gilman had no shortage of well-paid consulting work from companies other than SAC, and did not need to disclose confidential information to receive significant payment from those other companies. It is unclear, given this background, why Gilman would have broken the law to keep SAC as a customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The government also conceded at oral argument in this appeal that no one ever asked Gilman a direct question as to whether he told Martoma inside information in exchange for a monetary benefit. In the absence of such testimony, and particularly in light of Gilman\u2019s abundant consulting opportunities, a reasonable jury need not have concluded that Gilman released the information in anticipation of payment. Instead, a jury could have believed SAC\u2019s payments were for information Gilman told Martoma during other sessions \u2014 information that was either public, non-material, or did not prompt a trade, and thus was not a violation of insider-trading laws. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. at 1231 (noting that Gilman began speaking with Martoma in January 2006); 1242 (Gilman\u2019s testimony that he did not reveal confidential information until \u201cthe fall to winter of 2006-7\u201d). I would not rule, particularly absent direct testimony on the point, that whenever inside information is revealed within a paid consulting relationship where other, legitimate service is rendered, a fact-finder must infer that the insider was paid to breach his duties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">I note, in closing, that securities law is a field in which legal and ethical obligations are not coterminous. Leading scholars emphasize that insider-trading rules are under-inclusive in reaching conduct that dis-serves the public. <em>See, e,g., </em>Jesse M. Fried, <em>Insider Trading via the Corporation, </em>162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 801, 808-10, 813-14, 816-20, 826-34 (2014) (emphasizing that the law does not bar trades based on non-material information, and describing potential and actual harm to the public because of individual and corporate trades based on inside information). This is not surprising, as the Supreme Court has noted, given that securities regulation is built on statutes and that its principles apply broadly to many transactions in the marketplace:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">We do not suggest that knowingly trading on inside information is ever socially desirable or even that it is devoid of moral considerations.... Depending on the circumstances, and even where permitted by law, one\u2019s trading on material nonpublic information is behavior that may fall below ethical standards of conduct. But in a statutory area of the law such as securities regulation, where legal principles of general application must be applied, there may be significant distinctions between actual legal obligations and ethical ideals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-10\"><em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 661 n.21, 103 S.Ct. 3255 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Adhering to the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent may challenge us when it leaves unethical conduct unpunished. But there is great wisdom in the Supreme Court\u2019s limitations on broad rules, particularly when those rules might otherwise allow punishment of the absentminded in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>persons, with corrupt intentions. Today, however, the majority severely damages the limitation provided by the personal benefit rul\u00e9, and casts aside Circuit precedent and Supreme Court rulings to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-11\">.

The fact that <em>Dirks </em>held that the tipper\u2019s intent to give a benefit to the tippee was an example of a personal benefit to the <em>tipper </em>illustrates just how broadly the Court defined the concept of personal benefit to the tipper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">.

The dissent posits that some benefits from gift-giving might be unique to close friendships and family relationships. <em>See </em>Dissent Op. at 85-86. Notably, none of these benefits bear any relation to the Supreme Court's articulation of why giving a gift to a \"trading relative or friend\" involves a personal benefit to the gift-giver. The Supreme Court did not, for example, say that an insider benefits personally from making friends and family members happy, or from improving relationships, or from the potential of using the gift in the future. Instead, the Supreme Court observed that giving a gift of inside information personally benefits the insider because the gift is the equivalent of trading on the tip oneself \u2014 an obvious pecuniary benefit \u2014 and giving a gift of the proceeds. In light of this articulated logic, the dissent\u2019s claim that \"[i]t is not entirely straightforward that <em>giving </em>a gift provides the gift-giver with a benefit,\u201d <em>see </em>Dissent Op. at 78, is not persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">. Although we hold that <em>Newman\u2019s </em>\"meaningfully close personal relationship\u201d <em>requirement </em>is no longer good law, we do not hold that the relationship between the tipper and tippee cannot be relevant to the jury in assessing competing narratives as to whether information was disclosed \"with the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it,\u201d <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428, and whether the disclosure \"resemble[d] trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\" <em>id. </em>at 427 (quoting <em>Dirks, </em>463 U.S. at 664, 103 S.Ct. 3255), In the dissent's example of a disclosure of inside information to a reporter, for example, <em>see </em>Dissent Op, at 76, a pre-existing personal relationship between the insider and the reporter might tend to show that the information was not disclosed for altruistic reasons but was instead disclosed \"with the expectation that [the recipient] would trade on it.\u201d \u2018 <em>Salman, </em>137 S.Ct, at 428. A pre-existing personal relationship might also tend to show, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>however, that the insider trusted the reporter to scrupulously reveal a corporate fraud to the relevant authorities or the investing public, It is for the jury to decide, based on all of the facts and circumstances in a particular case, what to infer about the tipper\u2019s purpose from his relationship with the tippee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\">. In particular, as described above, <em>Newman </em>held that a personal benefit could not be inferred from gift-giving \"in the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecimiary or similarly valuable nature.\u201d 773 F.3d at 452. Under this standard, even a gift to one's best friend or spouse was insufficient to convey the requisite personal benefit without some kind of objective exchange involving potential pecuniary value. While the latter requirement was explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court, <em>see Salman, </em>137 S.Ct. at 428, viewing the \"meaningfully close personal relationship\u201d requirement in its original context further demonstrates that <em>Newman </em>understood the personal benefit involved in gift-giving to be the receipt of friendship and concluded that this \u201cephemeral\u201d benefit was simply not the kind of benefit that should give rise to insider trading liability. <em>See </em>773 F.3d at 452. \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">. The same might be said of the \"meaningfully close personal relationship\u201d test. When asked how \"meaningfully close personal relationship\u201d should be defined, Martoma and the government both invoked the basics of <em>Dirks </em>and <em>Salman, </em>agreeing that a \"meaningfully close personal relationship\u201d is the kind of relationship in which gifts are exchanged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">.
