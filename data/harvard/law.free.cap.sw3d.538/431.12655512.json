We conclude that, although imperfect, the timely filed notice fairly informed the defendant of the State's intent to seek enhanced sentencing and triggered the defendant's duty to inquire into the errors and omissions. Furthermore, the defendant has failed to establish that the deficiencies in the notice adversely affected his substantial rights-a necessary criterion for obtaining relief via the plain error doctrine. Accordingly, we reverse in part the Court of Criminal Appeals' judgment, insofar as it set aside the defendant's sentence of life without parole and remanded to the trial court for resentencing, and we reinstate the judgment of the trial court in all respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The only issue in this appeal is the sufficiency of the notice the State provided to the defendant, John O'Keefe Varner,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of its intent to sentence him as a repeat violent offender to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole under the three strikes law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-120\">\n    Tenn.

Therefore, we forgo a detailed recitation of the proof offered at trial to support the defendant's convictions of attempted second-degree murder, aggravated assault, and being a felon in possession of a firearm and recite the following summation for context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The victims, Brandi Frazier and Scott Wilfong, visited their friend Donald Brewer in early February 2013. Mr. Brewer\n   lived near the defendant, and the defendant's girlfriend drove Ms. Frazier to a liquor store in the defendant's truck. When they returned, the defendant pulled his girlfriend from the vehicle by her hair and struck her. Ms. Frazier got out of the truck, shouting and cursing at the defendant. Ms. Frazier and Mr. Wilfong had never met the defendant before that day. The defendant approached Ms. Frazier in an aggressive manner with his arm raised, and she hit him twice on the side of his head with a bottle of rum to stop his advance. Mr. Wilfong then intervened, and he and the defendant exchanged angry words, but the altercation ended when Mr. Wilfong and Ms. Frazier returned to their friend's nearby home. The entire incident lasted only five or ten minutes, and Mr. Wilfong gave it little thought afterwards, believing everything had calmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Wilfong's belief proved incorrect. On February 9, 2013, Mr. Wilfong and Ms. Frazier visited the home of J.D. Martin and Heather Gilbert to talk about ways to raise bail money for their mutual friend, Mr. Brewer, who had been arrested and jailed. During their visit, Mr. Brewer's estranged wife, Natalie Brewer, and the defendant arrived uninvited at the home. Ms. Brewer, a longtime friend of Ms. Gilbert, entered the home without invitation, approached Ms. Frazier, who had called Ms. Brewer a snitch earlier in the day, and began swearing and behaving aggressively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Mr. Wilfong's testimony, the defendant remained outside but knocked on the door and told Mr. Wilfong they had \"unfinished business.\" Interpreting the comment as a reference to the earlier argument, Mr. Wilfong went outside \"prepared to fight,\" believing from the defendant's tone that they \"were probably about to be in a confrontation.\" Once outside, Mr. Wilfong, who was unarmed, saw that the defendant had a handgun. Inexplicably, Mr. Wilfong declared that he \"wasn't scared of the gun\" and \"motioned toward [the defendant] as if to hit him.\" The defendant \"leaned back and shot at the same time.\" The bullet struck Mr. Wilfong in the right hip. Both men \"froze for a split second,\" but when the defendant raised and aimed the gun a second time, Mr. Wilfong ran into the nearby woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hearing the gunshot, Ms. Frazier ran outside and saw the defendant standing and pointing the gun toward the woods. When the defendant turned the gun on her, Ms. Frazier retreated toward Ms. Gilbert's vehicle, which was parked nearby. The defendant lowered his weapon and ran past Ms. Frazier, striking her in the face as he passed with enough force to knock her over the hood of Ms. Gilbert's car. The defendant kept running, got into his truck, where Ms. Brewer was already waiting, and drove away from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The victims called 911 not long after the incident, but the police were unable to locate the scene that evening and did not investigate until the next day. In March 2013, the Coffee County Grand Jury indicted the defendant with attempted first-degree murder of Mr. Wilfong and aggravated assault of Ms. Frazier. However, the defendant fled to Las Vegas, Nevada, after the incident, and he was not apprehended until a year and a half later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After his apprehension, on January 1, 2015, the State filed a document titled \"Notice of Prior Convictions,\" which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The State of Tennessee by and through the Office of the District Attorney General, Fourteenth Judicial District, pursuant to [R]ule 609(a)(3) of the Tennessee Rules of Evidence and T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-202(a) to give the defendant notice of the following convictions that the State will seek to introduce to impeach the defendant's testimony, and/or to enhance\n   the defendant's punishment. The State of Tennessee also hereby gives notice to the defendant of its intent to seek to have him declared as a Repeat Violent Offender pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-120 :\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-18\"><em>Date</em> <em>Conviction</em> <em>County, State</em> 12/28/1985 THEFT CALIFORNIA 02/10/1987 POSS OF FIREARM CALIFORNIA 03/20/1987 CONSPIRACY CALIFORNIA 07/04/1990 AGG ASSAULT SHELBY CO., TN 01/24/1992 FAC 2<sup>ND</sup> DEGREE MURDER SHELBY CO., TN 08/26/1993 POSSESSION OF WEAPON SHELBY CO., TN 05/03/1994 2<sup>ND</sup> DEGREE MURDER SHELBY CO., TN</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In April 2015, a superseding indictment was issued charging the defendant with attempted first-degree murder of Mr. Wilfong, aggravated assault of Ms. Frazier, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The defendant's trial occurred July 14-16, 2015. At the beginning of the trial, the parties entered a written stipulation that the defendant had been convicted in Haywood County prior to February 2013 of a felony involving the use of force, violence, and a deadly weapon, and that the conviction prohibited the defendant from possessing a firearm. The State relied upon this stipulation to prove the charge that the defendant was a felon in possession of a firearm. The defendant was convicted of attempted second-degree murder, aggravated assault, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At a separate sentencing hearing on September 23, 2015, the prosecution entered as exhibits certified copies of judgments reflecting the defendant's April 20, 1994 conviction of second-degree murder in Haywood County and his January 14, 1992 conviction of facilitation of second-degree murder in Shelby County. The trial court stated its understanding that the defense \"had no objection to the accuracy of the [defendant's] prior criminal record\" as set out in the pre-sentence report. Defense counsel responded: \"That is correct, Your Honor.\" However, defense counsel argued that the defendant should not be sentenced as a repeat violent felony offender because his prior convictions preceded the July 1, 1994, effective date of the repeat violent felony offender law. The trial court rejected this argument but noted that mandatory sentencing laws have been criticized as unwise public policy and commented that the criticism may be well-taken. Nevertheless, the trial court ruled that the \"so-called three strikes\" or repeat violent felony offender law is \"on the books\" and is not limited to offenses committed after its July 1, 1994 effective date. As for the defendant, the trial court pointed out that he unquestionably had prior and separate convictions of facilitation to commit second-degree murder and second-degree murder. As a result, the trial court ruled it had \"no choice\" under the repeat violent offender statute but to sentence the defendant to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole on his conviction of attempted second-degree murder of Mr. Wilfong. The trial court imposed a five-year sentence on each of the defendant's other convictions and ordered these sentences served concurrently with the sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant appealed, alleging four trial errors but not challenging his sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nevertheless, citing \"the severity of the sentence\" for repeat violent offenders, the Cooper Court concluded that adopting a similar remedy was appropriate and held \"that the sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole was not authorized because the only substantially compliant notice [in Mr. Cooper's case]\n   <em>\n    was filed after trial and therefore was ineffective.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322665\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/501/#p506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322665\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/501/#p506\">\n    at 507-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As the foregoing examination reveals, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   did not cite deficiencies in the content of the State's notice as a basis for setting aside the repeat violent offender sentence. Rather, it cited the State's failure to provide any\n   <em>\n    pretrial\n   </em>\n   notice of its intent to seek enhanced sentencing as a repeat violent offender.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322665\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/501/#p506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322665\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/501/#p506\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike Cooper, in this case the State unquestionably provided timely pretrial notice of its intent to seek enhanced sentencing as a repeat violent offender. Therefore, the question presented here in an indirect way via the plain error doctrine is whether the notice provided met the minimal requirements.

The defendant simply failed to make any such inquiry. To the contrary, defense counsel expressly indicated at the beginning of the sentencing hearing that the defendant had no objection to the accuracy of his prior criminal record as listed in the presentence report. Having conceded the accuracy of his prior criminal record at the sentencing hearing, the defendant has failed to establish prejudice resulting from the omitted and inaccurate information. Indeed, the defendant has not even attempted to establish prejudice. He did not challenge his sentence on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. In this Court, the defendant argues that the State should be precluded from seeking enhanced sentencing if it fails to comply strictly with the statutory notice requirement. We decline to adopt such a drastic remedy where the statute itself does not expressly do so. Although the State's notice was not perfect, it constituted fair notice and unambiguously advised the defendant of the State's intent to sentence him as a repeat violent offender. It is true that the notice listed several of the defendant's prior convictions without identifying the specific qualifying convictions or the dates of his separate incarcerations on those convictions. Nevertheless, as the dissenting judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals noted, the defendant could have identified the predicate convictions for purposes of enhanced sentencing as a repeat violent offender because only two of the listed convictions qualified as such. While we certainly do not endorse the State's failure to comply strictly with the statutory notice requirement, the State provided sufficient notice to trigger the defendant's duty to inquire\n   into the errors and omissions. The defendant has failed to establish that the omitted and inaccurate information adversely affected a substantial right-one of the necessary criterion to obtain relief via the plain error doctrine. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant is not entitled to relief via the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed insofar as it set aside the defendant's enhanced sentence as a repeat violent offender and remanded for resentencing, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated in all respects.
