Lee, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02 allows a trial court to set aside a final judgment under certain circumstances, including when the judgment is void or \"for any other reason justifying relief.\" Here, a decedent's mother, in her capacity as her unmarried son's next of kin, filed a lawsuit seeking damages for his wrongful death. The case was settled and dismissed. Nearly twenty months later, the decedent's alleged minor child filed a Rule 60.02 motion to set aside the order of dismissal and to be substituted as the plaintiff. The motion asserted that the child was the decedent's next of kin and the proper party to pursue the wrongful death claim, based on the decedent's execution of an acknowledgment of paternity and a Mississippi trial court order for support. The trial court denied the motion, finding it was not timely filed. The Court of Appeals vacated the trial court's ruling, holding that the\n   Rule 60.02 motion was not ripe for adjudication until the trial court conclusively established the child's paternity. We find the Court of Appeals erred by focusing on issues surrounding the child's paternity rather than reviewing the correctness of the trial court's ruling on the Rule 60.02 motion. We hold that the trial court properly denied relief under Rule 60.02. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2003, Sharondra Harris and Derrick Hussey began dating. On April 28, 2005, Ms. Harris gave birth to a child. Subsequently, the Mississippi Department of Human Services sued Mr. Hussey in the Chancery Court of DeSoto County, Mississippi, to establish paternity and support for the child. On March 7, 2008, Mr. Hussey signed an agreement admitting that he was the natural father of the child, waiving his rights to genetic testing, and agreeing to pay support. By order dated March 20, 2008, the chancery court approved the agreement and ordered that Mr. Hussey was the father of the child. Thereafter, the chancery court entered an amended judgment for support and an amended order of withholding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 4, 2008, Mr. Hussey died after being detained and handcuffed by the manager of a Family Dollar store in Memphis. At the time of his death, Mr. Hussey was not married and was living with his mother, Mae L. Chearis. On December 9, 2008, Ms. Chearis and her sister, Marilyn Ramson, met with attorney Robert M. Brannon, Jr., to discuss a wrongful death suit. Ms. Chearis signed an agreement retaining Mr. Brannon to handle a wrongful death claim against the Family Dollar store and its manager. On December 10, 2008, at Mr. Brannon's request, Ms. Chearis and Ms. Harris met with Mr. Brannon. At that meeting, Ms. Harris signed an agreement retaining Mr. Brannon to represent Ms. Harris and Mr. Hussey's minor child in a wrongful death suit against the Family Dollar store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Mr. Brannon was hired, some members of Mr. Hussey's family questioned whether Mr. Hussey was the child's biological father. On January 2, 2009, Mr. Brannon wrote a letter to Ms. Ramson who, according to Mr. Brannon and Ms. Chearis, had been designated as the contact person for Mr. Hussey's family. In the letter, Mr. Brannon offered to perform legal services regarding the paternity issue based on his previous telephone conversation with Ms. Ramson about the child's paternity. On March 18, 2009, Mr. Brannon sent Ms. Ramson an update on the case and requested payment of an investigator's fee. On July 27, 2009, Mr. Brannon notified Ms. Ramson by letter that he was declining representation in the wrongful death claim and closing his file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2009, Ms. Chearis, without the involvement or knowledge of Ms. Harris, retained lawyers with the Memphis law firm of Porter &amp; Strange, PLLC, to handle the wrongful death claim. On December 3, 2009, Ms. Chearis, through her new lawyers, filed a wrongful death suit, as mother and next of kin of Mr. Hussey, against Family Dollar Stores of Tennessee, Inc., and Michael Woods, the manager of the store where Mr. Hussey died. Several months later, Ms. Chearis and Family Dollar agreed to a settlement, the terms of which were confidential, and Family Dollar paid Ms. Chearis the settlement funds. On March 22, 2010, Ms. Chearis, as the \"sole heir at law of Derrick Hussey,\" signed a release of liability for Family Dollar and the store manager. On March 31, 2010, the trial court entered a consent order of dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 2, 2011-twenty months after entry of the order of dismissal-the minor child, through his mother, moved to set aside the order under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02, to be substituted as the real party in interest under Rule 17.01,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to allow the claim to relate back to the filing of the original complaint under Rule 15.03. The child asserted that he was the decedent's next of kin based on Mr. Hussey's signed admission of paternity filed in the Chancery Court for DeSoto County, Mississippi. The child further argued that he was the real party in interest; the lawful beneficiary with statutory priority over Mr. Hussey's mother; and the only party with standing to bring, settle, and/or dismiss the wrongful death lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Ms. Harris's deposition testimony, she and Mr. Hussey met in November 2003 and began dating each other exclusively. Ms. Harris became pregnant and, on April 28, 2005, gave birth in Mississippi. Mr. Hussey was present for the child's birth. Ms. Harris did not recall the date of the child's conception but acknowledged that Mr. Hussey was incarcerated from July to August 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Harris could not recall the child's due date but remembered that he was born early and weighed only four pounds. Ms. Harris denied that she dated any other men during the time when the child was conceived. The couple separated in 2007 but remained friends, with Mr. Hussey dividing his time between Ms. Harris's home and his mother's home. Mr. Hussey was not employed and did not pay Ms. Harris child support. After Ms. Harris returned to work, the child attended daycare. Ms. Harris frequently worked overtime, and the child spent nights at both Ms. Chearis's home and Ms. Harris's home. Ms. Chearis assisted with the child's care, and he called her \"Granny.\" Ms. Harris never heard Ms. Chearis express any doubts about the child's paternity. Following Mr. Hussey's death, she and the child visited Ms. Chearis's home on or the day after Christmas 2008. Subsequently, Ms. Harris attempted to contact Ms. Chearis, but her telephone number had been changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After meeting with Mr. Brannon on December 10, 2008, and signing an attorney representation agreement, Ms. Harris had no further contact with Mr. Brannon. Ms. Harris changed her address at some point after the meeting with Mr. Brannon but had her mail forwarded to her new address. To her knowledge, she received all of her mail but received nothing from Mr. Brannon. She called Mr. Brannon's office twice in 2009 and left a message with her new phone number but received no response. Ms. Harris did not go to Mr. Brannon's office to check the status of the case. She denied that Ms. Ramson was designated as the family contact with Mr. Brannon. From December 2008 through October 2011, Ms. Harris believed Mr. Brannon was representing her despite his lack of communication with her. In November 2011, Ms. Harris contacted a legal aid office and, after meeting with a lawyer, learned about Ms. Chearis's lawsuit. On December 2, 2011, Ms. Harris, through counsel and on behalf of her son, moved to set aside the order of dismissal under Rule 60.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to the child's motion, Family Dollar and Ms. Chearis asserted that the motion was not filed within a reasonable time, and in any event, there was no basis for relief under Rule 60.02. According to Ms. Chearis, after a question arose regarding the child's paternity, Ms. Harris severed her ties with Mr. Hussey's family, and they could not contact her. Ms. Chearis testified by deposition that before her son died, she had doubts about the child's paternity based on her son's statement that he was \"tricked\" into signing the paternity agreement and because he was in jail when the child was conceived. Ms. Chearis said she loved the child and accepted him as her grandson. She stated that neither she nor her son took care of the child, but the child visited in her home \"every now and then,\" although not every week. Mr. Hussey's obituary, prepared by Ms. Chearis's sister, Linda Jamerson, stated: \"Derrick leaves to cherish his memories a son,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... a loving mother, Mae Lois Chearis,\" his father, two brothers, a grandmother, nieces and nephews, \"a special friend, [Sharondra] Harris,\" and \"a host of uncles, aunts, cousins, and other family and friends.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Chearis said that, after learning that Mr. Brannon was no longer handling the wrongful death case, she attempted unsuccessfully to notify Ms. Harris of Mr. Brannon's decision. In November 2009, Ms. Chearis retained lawyers with Porter &amp; Strange, PLLC to represent her in a wrongful death case. Ms. Chearis, through her new lawyers, filed suit as the \"natural mother and next of kin\" of Mr. Hussey one day before the statute of limitations expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In January 2012, the child filed with the trial court a copy of the Mississippi paternity order and the acknowledgment of paternity signed by Mr. Hussey. In April 2012, Ms. Chearis moved the trial court to order DNA testing to establish the child's paternity. The child opposed the motion, arguing that the Mississippi acknowledgment of paternity and trial court order were entitled to full faith and credit in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The case took a detour after Ms. Chearis filed a petition in June 2012 in the Shelby County Probate Court to open Mr. Hussey's estate and appoint an administratrix.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August 2012, Ms. Harris, as the parent, natural guardian, and next friend of the child, filed a petition to intervene in the probate case. In September 2012, the trial court stayed its proceedings based on the probate court's original and exclusive jurisdiction regarding the determination and priority of heirs in an intestate estate. In December 2013, the probate court granted full faith and credit to the Mississippi trial court order and declared that the child was Mr. Hussey's only living child, was the sole beneficiary of his estate, and had priority over all other heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court denied the child's Rule 60.02 motion based on the untimeliness of the motion and the inequities of setting aside the order of dismissal and subjecting Family Dollar to additional litigation and expense after payment of the settlement to Ms. Chearis. Although the reasonableness of the settlement was not at issue and the amount of the settlement was not in evidence, the trial court described the settlement as \"amazingly, phenomenally ... mind-boggling generous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Harris appealed. The Court of Appeals vacated the trial court's decision, ruling that the Rule 60.02 motion was not ripe for adjudication until the trial court, not the probate court, conclusively established the child's paternity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hussey v. Woods\n   </em>\n   , No. W2014-01235-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205601777\">\n    2015 WL 5601777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 23, 2015)\n   <em>\n    perm. app. granted\n   </em>\n   (Tenn. May 9, 2016). The Court of Appeals reasoned that the sole question before the trial court was whether the child or Ms. Chearis had the right to bring the wrongful death lawsuit and that this question should have been answered by the trial court after deciding the child's paternity. The Court of Appeals vacated the trial court's order and remanded the case for further proceedings without reviewing the merits of the Rule 60.02 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We granted the child's application for permission to appeal and directed the parties to address whether the trial court, under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02(3) or 60.02(5), properly denied the motion for relief from the settlement and order of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At this stage in the proceedings, questions regarding the child's paternity and whether he or his grandmother had priority to bring the wrongful death suit are not determinative. These issues may have been relevant at the outset of the litigation, but the wrongful death case has been settled and dismissed. The order of dismissal is a hurdle that the child, through Ms. Harris as his next friend, must overcome before any other issues can be considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the only issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly denied the Rule 60.02 motion to set aside the order of dismissal under either 60.02(3) or 60.02(5). The Court of Appeals erred by focusing on the issues surrounding the child's paternity and by failing to address the merits of the Rule 60.02 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A judgment or order of final disposition that adjudicates the rights and claims of all the parties to an action becomes final thirty days after it is entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn.

Instead, it asserted that the wrongful death suit was filed by Mr. Hussey's mother, who did not have priority under the Tennessee wrongful death statute; the party with priority was the child as the next of kin. In this Court, the child argues that the judgment is void because he was not before the court when the case was dismissed, and therefore, the order should be set aside to avoid an injustice.

Ms. Harris testified that she believed Mr. Brannon was representing the child and that she was \"waiting on a response from him.\" She called his office twice in 2009 but received no reply. She took no action in 2010. She never went to his office to ascertain the status of the case. In October 2011, she sought assistance from a legal aid attorney. She learned about Ms. Chearis's lawsuit in November 2011 and filed her motion in December 2011. While Ms. Harris acted promptly upon learning that Ms. Chearis had settled the wrongful death lawsuit, she failed to make appropriate inquiries or follow up with Mr. Brannon after hiring him in December 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Under the facts presented, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the Rule 60.02 motion filed twenty months after entry of the order was not timely filed.

The child argues that the trial court's refusal to set aside the order of dismissal results in severe injustice to him because his interests were not protected by the attorney hired to pursue the claim, he had no knowledge of the lawsuit brought and settled by Ms. Chearis, and he received none of the settlement proceeds. These grounds for relief are more appropriately encompassed within the circumstances referenced in Rule 60.02(1) and (2) -mistake, excusable neglect, and fraud. Even if these circumstances merited relief under Rule 60.02(1) and (2), they are time-barred and cannot be asserted as grounds for relief under Rule 60.02(5) or as a substitute for a fraud action against Ms. Chearis and legal malpractice actions against Mr. Brannon\n   and Porter &amp; Strange, PLLC. While these circumstances are unfortunate, they do not rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship justifying relief under Rule 60.02(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We hold that the trial court did not err in denying the Rule 60.02 motion to set aside the order of dismissal.
