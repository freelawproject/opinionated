Page, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a custody case involving the minor children of unmarried parties. C.W.H. (hereinafter \"Father\") and L.A.S. (hereinafter \"Mother\") agreed to a modification of an existing parenting plan in 2013. Subsequently, Father learned information to which he was not privy during the settlement conference, namely, that Mother had relocated from her state of residence (Ohio) to Nevada with the parties' minor children, where she was employed as a prostitute. Father filed a motion for an emergency temporary custody order and a temporary restraining order. Father prevailed in a hearing before the juvenile court magistrate and was designated as the primary residential parent. Mother requested a hearing before the juvenile court. Following a hearing, the juvenile court found a material change in circumstances and upheld the magistrate's determination. Mother appealed to the Court of Appeals, which vacated and remanded the case for the juvenile court to conduct a best interest analysis. On remand, the juvenile court affirmed its earlier findings regarding a material change in circumstances and, in addition, concluded that changing the primary residential parent from Mother to Father was in the best interest of the children. Mother again appealed to the Court of Appeals, which concluded\n   \"that the evidence preponderate[d], in part but significantly, against the juvenile court's factual findings,\" reversed the juvenile court, and mandated that its order be carried out within twenty days. We granted Father's application for permission to appeal pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 11 to decide, as set forth in Father's application, whether \"the Court of Appeals err[ed] in reversing the [juvenile court] and awarding Mother custody of the minor children\" and whether \"the Court of Appeals err[ed] in ordering the change in custody prior to an opportunity for the Father to appeal to this Court?\" We answer both questions in the affirmative, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, and remand this matter to the juvenile court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Procedural History and Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mother and Father began a dating relationship in 2008. During that time, Father lived in Pennsylvania and Mother lived in Ohio. Mother became pregnant with the parties' older child, P.H.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and gave birth to their son on January 22, 2009. Soon thereafter, Mother moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and resided with her mother. Father relocated two to three months later, in August 2009, and lived with Mother. Father cared for P.H. as a stay-at-home father. The parties' younger child, daughter V.H., was born on June 27, 2010. Because Father had found employment, the parties shared parenting responsibilities of both children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2010, the relationship deteriorated and the parties separated. Mother planned to relocate to Ohio in pursuit of a master's degree. To facilitate the move, the parties entered into an agreed parenting plan in May 2011 to accommodate the distance and address parenting time. The plan designated Mother as the primary residential parent and allotted Father 144 days of parenting time per year. Mother relocated to Ohio in June 2011, but the children remained with Father until the end of the summer so that Mother could acclimate to her new residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After having difficulties exercising his parenting time, in February 2012 Father filed a petition in the Hamilton County Juvenile Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to modify the 2011 agreed parenting plan. Prior to resolution of Father's petition, Father contacted Mother in January 2013 and confided in her that he and his new wife (hereinafter \"Stepmother\") had an altercation the previous evening, which caused her to leave the home after consuming alcohol. As a result, Stepmother was arrested and placed in jail until the following day. While Stepmother was in jail, Father invited a female acquaintance to the residence under the auspices of obtaining legal advice because the acquaintance's grandmother was an attorney. Instead, as the children were sleeping, Father and his female acquaintance ingested cocaine that she brought with her. Because Stepmother was still in jail, Father asked Mother to have her family assist with childcare in the interim. Mother stated that she did so but that she also tried to protect Father's image by not divulging the reason that he requested help from her family. Father indicated that he had not ingested cocaine since that date; he and Stepmother submitted to two separate drug tests in July and October 2013 that yielded negative results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During a February 2013 conference, Mother indicated that she was working as an independent contractor in social work. She said she was seeking employment in different states and that Nevada was one such state. Father had previously noted that in January 2013 when the children arrived in Tennessee for a visit, the children's luggage bore labels from Charlotte and Phoenix, but he was unaware that the children had visited the western United States. The parties agreed upon a modified plan that addressed Father's concerns but left the residential parenting designation and the parenting time between the parties as it was.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The juvenile court issued an order incorporating the parenting plan on March 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Mother's sister contacted Father and informed him that Mother actually resided in Nevada with the minor children and that she was employed as a prostitute. Father had believed that Mother resided in Ohio and worked as an independent contractor. Father researched the internet and confirmed these assertions when he found sexually explicit photographs and videos of Mother advertising her services as a prostitute employed by the Moonlight Bunny Ranch in Nevada. He filed a motion for an emergency temporary custody order and temporary restraining order on March 12, 2013. The magistrate found that a material change in circumstances had occurred and that it was in the children's best interest for Father to be designated as the primary residential parent. Mother requested a hearing before the juvenile court, and the juvenile court heard testimony on October 18, 2013, and December 2, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relevant to this appeal, Mother testified at trial that she had previously been employed as a prostitute in Nevada but that she was no longer so employed. She stated that she accepted employment at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch for financial reasons due to the large amount of debt she had accumulated pursuing her master's degree and Father's failure to provide child support for the minor children. When questioned about why she did not disclose her relocation to Nevada and her employment there, she stated that she was not asked about it. At the time of trial, Mother was employed as a social worker, and she provided documentation to that effect. She indicated that she would not return to prostitution because that line of work seemingly affected the court's decision with regard to her continuing to be the primary residential parent and because the code of ethics of her current career strictly forbade such work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The juvenile court also heard testimony relative to the issue of Mother's hostility toward Father. In March or April 2011, before Mother's departure to Ohio, Father met Stepmother, whom he married in September 2011. Mother acknowledged having a verbal altercation with Stepmother (before Father and Stepmother married) in the restaurant at which Stepmother was employed. Mother, while actually on a date with another man herself, learned from\n   her date-who, unbeknownst to her, was a friend of Father-that Father had been dating Stepmother during the pendency of Mother's relationship with Father. This revelation caused Mother to confront Stepmother and to engage in the public altercation with Stepmother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Father attempted to exercise his parenting time with the children in August 2011 for his birthday, Mother refused to allow Father to visit with the children outside of their daycare facility because Stepmother accompanied him on the visit. Father was denied his parenting time over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2011; Mother became angry and called the police, reporting that Father was attempting to kidnap the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to Father's and Stepmother's wedding, Mother received an email from Father's account that she suspected had been sent by Stepmother. With the intent to provoke Stepmother, Mother replied to the email and attached a sexually explicit photograph of herself to the email. Mother refused to allow the minor children to participate or even to attend Father's and Stepmother's wedding, and she repeatedly admonished the children that Father's and Stepmother's new baby, daughter C.H., was not their sister.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the pendency of the litigation in the juvenile court, Father sought and obtained a position with a different restaurant management company that would allow him to receive managerial training. Father was also able to provide health insurance for the children through his new employer, and he provided copies of insurance cards for the children to Mother at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The juvenile court ruled in favor of Father, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   At the time of the hearing before the Magistrate on August 1, 2013, Mother was still working full-time as a legal prostitute in Nevada. At the time of the rehearing, Mother testified that she is now working full-time as a social worker in Nevada.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Although Mother testified that she has no plans to work as a prostitute any more, there apparently is no other reasonable tie for her in Nevada. Mother's extended family is in Chattanooga. Father's wife's extended family is in Chattanooga. It is the Court's opinion that Mother lacks integrity on several issues, including this one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   While both Father and Mother have at times acted irresponsibly and seemed to lack sound parenting judgment, the Court finds that there was a material change in the circumstances of the children because of Mother's deceit, Mother's occupation as a prostitute, and Mother's hostility toward Father and his wife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mother appealed the juvenile court's ruling to the Court of Appeals. Without addressing the juvenile court's finding of a material change in circumstances, the appellate court vacated the juvenile court's order and remanded the case for the juvenile court to conduct a best interest analysis.\n   <em>\n    C.W.H. v. L.A.S.\n   </em>\n   , No. E2015-01498-COA-R3-JV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n    2016 WL 6426731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Tenn.

By order dated July 10, 2015, the juvenile court reaffirmed its prior findings of material change in circumstance and incorporated the required best interest analysis. Specifically, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-106 (2014), the juvenile court concluded: (1) that the children were more stable with Father,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(1) ; (2) that Father had been more willing than Mother to facilitate a relationship between the children and the other parent due to Mother's misgivings about Stepmother,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(2) ; (3) that Father recently had been promoted at work, maintained insurance coverage for the children, and lived in a stable environment with the children,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(4), (10) ; (4) that Father lived near the children's extended family, had been the primary caregiver for some time, and had exercised the majority of parenting time, and that Mother had relocated the children to Nevada where they have no family,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(5) ; (5) that Father had identified a possible speech delay in V.H. upon her return from Nevada and promptly sought intervention,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(7) ; (6) that Mother had engaged in an occupation which, albeit legal in Nevada, constituted an immoral act from which the children should be sheltered,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(8) ; (7) that Father had already been fully providing for the children's educational needs,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(9) ; (8) that Mother had offered no proof concerning the character of the people who would be visiting her home or that those visitors would not be engaged in acts contrary to the best interests of the children,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(12) ; and (9) that Mother offered no proof regarding alternate child care arrangements should she be away from home at night,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(8), (14). The juvenile court found that factors one, two, four, five, seven, nine, ten, and fourteen all weighed in favor of designating Father as the primary residential parent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-6-106(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10), (14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mother appealed the juvenile court's ruling. In reversing the juvenile court's determination, the Court of Appeals concluded that neither the juvenile court's finding of Mother's deceit nor her former employment as a prostitute constituted a material change in circumstance without a finding of how the circumstances affected the children.\n   <em>\n    C.W.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206426731\">\n    2016 WL 6426731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at **5, 9. The Court of Appeals further concluded that the evidence did not preponderate against the juvenile court's factual findings of Mother's hostility toward Father and Stepmother or its finding that said hostility constituted a material change in circumstances because it had affected the children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. However, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the juvenile court abused its discretion in determining that it was in the best interest of the children for Father to be designated as the primary residential parent because the juvenile court relied heavily on Mother's employment as a prostitute and failed to consider in its analysis Father's child support arrearage and his ingesting cocaine in his home while the children were present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16. Father's appeal to this Court followed. Upon our consideration, we hold that the Court of Appeals improperly applied the well-settled standard of review as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Armbrister v. Armbrister\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7089381\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/414/685/#p692\">\n    414 S.W.3d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692-93 (Tenn. 2013) ; that the Court of Appeals applied the incorrect version of the statute governing the requisite best interest analysis, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-6-106\">\n    Tenn.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our consideration of this case requires us to address several points of law: (1) emphasis of the appropriate standard of review to be employed in cases involving initial custody determinations and/or modifications of primary residential parenting designations; (2) clarification of the appropriate version of the statute to be utilized in conducting a best interests analysis; and (3) propriety of the appellate court's ordering the immediate change of custody without an opportunity for review by this Court. After reviewing each point in turn, we will discuss them as applied to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court has previously emphasized the\n   <em>\n    limited\n   </em>\n   scope of review to be employed by an appellate court in reviewing a trial court's factual determinations in matters involving child custody and parenting plan developments.\n   <em>\n    Armbrister\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7089381\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/414/685/#p692\">\n    414 S.W.3d at 692-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the appropriate standard of \"review of the trial court's factual findings is de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of the correctness of the findings, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise\").

For instance, if a child custody case involves a situation in which the Court of Appeals reasonably believed that a child would be in danger in the event that the parent awarded custody by the trial court retained custody while the issuance of mandate was stayed pursuant to Tenn.

We hold that the juvenile court properly applied the statutory factors governing a best interest analysis and that its conclusion was not an abuse of discretion. As such, the Court of Appeals' decision to the contrary is reversed. Moreover, the Court of Appeals erred in mandating an immediate change in custody without giving Father the opportunity to appeal to this Court. Father's claim for attorney's fees in the Court of Appeals is deemed waived in this appeal for failure to raise the issue in the Rule 11 application or in his brief. The decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed, and this cause is remanded to the juvenile court to effect an expeditious return of the children to the physical custody of Father in a manner least disruptive to their welfare.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Keisling v.

Costs of this appeal are taxed to Mother, for which execution may issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    To protect the anonymity of minors, it is the policy of this Court to refer to the children as well as the parties by their initials.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Because the parties were never married, the juvenile court exercised jurisdiction over this matter. Thus, the juvenile court acted as the trial court, or court of record, in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The agreement also resolved issues of child support and medical bill arrearages that are not at issue in this appeal. However, for clarity we note that the parties settled on a child support arrearage of $2,527 and medical bill arrearage of $7,500. Mother offered testimony, but no supporting evidence, that the medical bills actually totaled around $33,000. Attorney for Father briefly addressed Father's child support obligation at the hearing on February 26, 2014, and indicated to the juvenile court that Ohio originally set the child support obligation for P.H. when the parties resided there around the time of his birth, which was duplicative of Tennessee's order of child support for the same child entered at the time of the parties' separation. Therefore, it is unclear from where the parties derived the amount of arrearage and what amount, if any, amounted to duplicate payment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Mother also provided examples of instances of Father's hostility toward her. For example, preceding the December hearing, Mother had experienced difficulty exercising her weekly telephone visits with the children and was only able to speak with them around once per week despite the order that she have \"unfettered\" telephonic visits. In addition, Mother was supposed to have visitation with the children after Thanksgiving, but Father would not respond to her requests for a meeting time and location until she was actually on the airplane traveling to Chattanooga.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    This Court has previously held that a trial court does not err by referencing a statutory amendment with an effective date that accrued at a later time, because the amended legislation \"reflected the General Assembly's most recent policy statement on the question before the trial court and was not a change in policy but a more specific statement of the policy already expressed in other statutes.\"\n    <em>\n     Armbrister\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7089381\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/414/685/#p692\">\n     414 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    706 n.22.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
