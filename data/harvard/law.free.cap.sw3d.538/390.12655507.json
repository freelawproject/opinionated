Thompson claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Thompson also claims that the trial court committed plain error by failing to grant him allocution before pronouncing sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On Saturday, February 14, 2015, Thompson drove to Jefferson City with a\n   female acquaintance. The couple stayed at an apartment belonging to Thompson's friend. At some point on Saturday, Thompson took a gun from an upstairs closet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On Sunday morning, Thompson left the apartment and met with Vincent Smith (\"Smith\"). Thompson and Smith talked about \"going to take something from someone.\" Thompson and Smith decided to take drugs from Johnny Evans (\"Evans\"). Thompson and Smith knew that Evans would have drugs and money based on conversations with people in the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thompson and Smith asked Robert Burks (\"Burks\") for a ride to East High Street, where Evans lived. Thompson and Smith told Burks that they were going to East High Street to \"get a lick off some weed.\" A \"lick\" refers to obtaining drugs or money illegally. Burks drove Thompson and Smith to East High Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thompson and Smith exited Burks's car and headed toward Evans's apartment. Burks saw Thompson pull a gun from his pocket. Thompson and Smith approached the backdoor of Evans's apartment. Smith kicked in the back door, and the two men entered. Smith testified that he and Thompson entered Evans's apartment to take drugs and money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thompson and Smith found Evans lying on a couch in his living room. Thompson and Smith asked Evans for drugs. Evans said that he did not know what they were talking about. Smith began looking around the living room, and then heard a gunshot. Smith looked up and saw Thompson holding a gun. Thompson fired another shot, which Smith saw hit Evans. Thompson and Smith fled the apartment, and left the scene in Burks's car. Evans later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State charged Thompson with murder in the second degree, burglary in the first degree, attempted robbery in the first degree, and armed criminal action. The jury found Thompson guilty of burglary in the first degree. The jury acquitted Thompson on the other charges. Thompson waived jury sentencing. Prior to his sentencing hearing, Thompson filed a motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the trial court asked defense counsel if he would like to make additional argument regarding the motion for new trial. Defense counsel advised that he would stand on the motion. The trial court then stated that it had reviewed Thompson's motion for new trial, and denied the motion. The trial court then heard counsel's arguments regarding sentencing before imposing a sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This timely appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thompson asserts two points on appeal. In his first point, Thompson argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of burglary in the first degree because there was insufficient evidence that he had the intent to steal at the time he unlawfully entered Evans's apartment. In his second point, Thompson contends that the trial court plainly erred by failing to grant him allocution before pronouncing his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Point One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thompson's first point on appeal argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of first-degree burglary. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Appellate review of sufficiency of the evidence is limited to whether the State has introduced adequate evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could have found each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Lammers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823828\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/624/#p632\">\n    479 S.W.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632 (Mo. banc 2016). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the appellate court \"considers all evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and grants the State all reasonable inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823828\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/624/#p632\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Contrary evidence and inferences are disregarded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823828\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/624/#p632\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the appellate court \"will not supply missing evidence or grant the State unreasonable, speculative, or forced inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823828\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/624/#p632\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"A person commits the crime of burglary in the first degree if he knowingly enters unlawfully ... in a building or inhabitable structure for the purpose of committing a crime therein, and ... while in the building or inhabitable structure ... [t]here is present in the structure another person who is not a participant in the crime.\" Section 569.160.1(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the State's indictment alleged that Thompson unlawfully entered Evans's apartment \"for the purpose of committing stealing therein.\" Consistent with the indictment, the verdict director tendered for burglary in the first degree required the jury to find that Thompson unlawfully entered Evans's apartment \"for the purpose of committing the crime of stealing.\" The verdict director instructed the jury that \"[a] person commits the crime of stealing if he appropriates property of another with the purpose to deprive him thereof without his consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, Thompson concedes that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he unlawfully entered Evans's apartment while Evans was present. He challenges, however, the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that he did so for the purpose of committing the crime of stealing. Thompson concedes that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that he was \"present for discussions about Mr. Smith's plan to 'get a lick off some weed' and when Mr. Smith admittedly entered Mr. Evans'[s] apartment with a purpose to take drugs and money.\" Thompson nonetheless argues that although these facts \"could impute to [him] some nebulous awareness of a general plot to steal something from [Evans], they cannot further ascribe to Mr. Thompson the very specific intent to deprive Mr. Evans of his property.\" Thompson argues that it would be impermissibly speculative to infer from Smith's testimony that Thompson had the required specific intent to steal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thompson's argument improvidently suggests that the subjective intent of a defendant requires proof by direct evidence. To the contrary, \"[b]ecause the subjective intent of a defendant can rarely be established by direct evidence, intent may be proven by circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Holbruck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7087158\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/239/#p242\">\n    410 S.W.3d 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013). The necessary intent may be \" 'inferred from surrounding facts' such as the 'defendant's conduct before the act, from the act itself, and from the defendant's subsequent conduct.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v. Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092015\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/402/146/#p151\">\n    402 S.W.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151 (Mo.

App. W.D. 1999) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, before Thompson unlawfully entered Evans's apartment, he spoke with Smith about taking something from someone. Thompson did so after retrieving a\n   gun from another person's closet. Thompson and Smith collectively agreed to try to take something from Evans, who they believed to have drugs and money. Thompson and Smith solicited Burks to drive them to Evans's apartment. Thompson told Burks they needed a ride because they intended to \"get a lick,\" a reference to illegally obtaining drugs or money from someone. After being driven to Evans's apartment by Burks, Thompson and Smith exited Burks's car, and forced their way into Evans's back door. Before doing so, Burks saw that Thompson had a gun. Smith testified at trial that he and Thompson entered Evans's apartment for the purpose of taking drugs and money from Evans. Though Thompson contends that Smith's testimony about specific intent cannot be imputed to him (a contention with which we disagree), even disregarding Smith's testimony about intent, the evidence was more than sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably infer that Thompson had the purpose to deprive Evans of his property without his consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Point One is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his second point on appeal, Thompson argues that the trial court failed to grant him allocution before imposing sentence. Thompson admits that this claim of error was not first raised with the trial court, and is eligible for no more than plain error review on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, as Rule 29.07(b)(1) states, its requirements are merely directory \"[i]f the defendant has been heard on a motion for new trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thompson argues that although he filed a motion for new trial, he was not \"heard\" on the motion for new trial because no additional argument was made on the record before the motion was ruled. Thompson points to\n   <em>\n    State v.
