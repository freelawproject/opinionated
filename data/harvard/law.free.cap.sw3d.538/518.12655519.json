Steven Stafford, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a health care liability action wherein a trial by jury resulted in judgment for the defendants. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial, asserting that: (1) the trial court erred in granting defendants' motions in limine, which restricted plaintiffs' ability to adequately cross-examine defendants' expert witnesses regarding the \"best possible care\"; (2) the trial court erred in granting defendants' motions in limine, which restricted plaintiffs' ability to present evidence relating to medical expenses; (3) the trial court failed to give a curative instruction after defendants' opening statement; and (4) the weight of the evidence was against the jury verdict. The trial court denied the post-trial motion and affirmed the jury verdict as the thirteenth juror. Plaintiffs appealed. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to the events at issue in this case, in 2002, Plaintiff/Appellant Christy Bradley (\"Ms. Bradley\") had a blood clot in her portal vein,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which blood clot impaired her liver function. This condition required approximately three abdominal surgeries between\n   2002 and 2003, wherein a shunt was eventually inserted from Ms. Bradley's sternum to two inches below her navel. Although the injuries healed, scars developed. Thereafter, Ms. Bradley became a patient at Defendant/Appellee Ruch Clinic in 2004 for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 2004 to 2012, transvaginal ultrasounds performed on Ms. Bradley at the Ruch Clinic revealed that she had a fibroid\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in her uterus. The treating physician performed a conservative surgery called a hysteroscopic myomectomy\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Ms. Bradley on two separate occasions to remove the fibroid. Each time, this procedure would temporarily alleviate the bleeding. However, Ms. Bradley's heavy bleeding would eventually resume, and the fibroid would return. Ms. Bradley was also prescribed medication to treat the heavy bleeding issue, but this treatment was also unsuccessful. During these years, Ms. Bradley would either experience no period at all or, if she did experience a period, would bleed abnormally. Because of these bleeding issues, Ms. Bradley had difficulty conceiving a child and was referred to a fertility clinic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 24, 2006, the fertility specialist performed a laparoscopy\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Ms. Bradley to address the various disorders related to her ovaries. The report noted findings of \"extensive adhesions of the bowel and omentum\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   to her abdomen with the pelvis noticed to be 'relatively free of adhesions.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From early to mid-2012, Ms. Bradley's bleeding issues worsened. On or around October 2012, another physician at the Ruch Clinic performed a transvaginal ultrasound and diagnosed Ms. Bradley with another large fibroid. The physician at the Ruch Clinic referred Ms. Bradley to Defendant/Appellee Laura Bishop, M.D. (\"Dr. Bishop,\" or, together with the Ruch Clinic, \"Appellees\"), a surgeon specializing in obstetrics and gynecology (\"OB/GYN surgeon\"), who recommended several options, including a hysterectomy. Ms. Bradley chose instead to attempt yet another hysteroscopic myomectomy to remove the fibroid conservatively; Dr. Bishop performed this procedure at the end of October 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   However, the hysteroscopic myomectomy did not stop the bleeding because it was found that the fibroid had grown into Ms. Bradley's uterine wall. Dr. Bishop thereafter recommended a laparoscopic robotic hysterectomy, which she described as the least invasive option with the fastest recovery time. It is undisputed that Dr. Bishop also informed Ms. Bradley of the possibility of converting to an open procedure during the surgery. After Ms. Bradley was given some time to consider her options, Ms. Bradley informed Dr. Bishop\n   that she wished to proceed with the recommended procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The hysterectomy occurred on December 26, 2012, at Baptist Memorial Hospital for Women. Although the surgery initially began as a laparoscopic hysterectomy, Dr. Bishop converted to an open hysterectomy rather than continue with the planned robotic procedure. Prior to the conversion, Dr. Bishop noticed a superficial cut on Ms. Bradley's colon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   At some point during the transition from the laparoscopic surgery to open surgery Dr. Bishop sought assistance from two different surgical teams. Dr. Bishop, however, made the decision to finish the open procedure herself by suturing the colon and removing the uterus without help from another surgeon once she determined that help was not readily available and that she was confident she could finish the procedure herself. In the days following the hysterectomy, Ms. Bradley's condition deteriorated. On December 29, 2012, Ms. Bradley was transferred to the ICU at Baptist East, and another surgeon, Stephen Behrman, M.D. performed an operation that revealed contamination of the abdominal cavity and a \"through-and-through injury\" of the small bowel, necessitating an \"enterectomy\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   with primary anastomosis.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   \" Ms. Bradley stayed at the hospital for approximately three weeks. Ms. Bradley's medical records reveal that it took Dr. Behrman approximately three hours to \"completely free up and delineate the small bowel\" because of the \"tremendous adhesions from the patient's prior surgery.\" Ms. Bradley was able to return to work in April 2013. According to Ms. Bradley, the injury and surgery resulted in three years of additional procedures, therapy, and disfigurement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Bradley and her husband, Plaintiff/Appellant J. Anthony Bradley (together with Ms. Bradley, \"Appellants\") filed a health care liability action on July 13, 2013 against Appellees in the Shelby County Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Dr. Bishop negligently caused injury to Ms. Bradley's small bowel. The complaint also alleged that the Ruch Clinic was vicariously liable for Dr. Bishop's negligence. On August 12, 2013, Appellees filed an answer generally denying all material allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During discovery, on August 20, 2015, counsel for Appellants deposed one of Appellees' expert witnesses, Thomas Stovall, M.D. The portion of Dr. Stovall's testimony relevant to this appeal is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q: What is the standard of care for Dr. Bishop on the day in question?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A: What a reasonable and prudent doctor with the same training and background would have in this locale, in Memphis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q: Under similar circumstances?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q: And is that to do the best she can-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A: Oh, I think-\n   Q: -for the patient?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A: I think we always try to do the best we can for the patient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q: So then the standard of care requires that a physician like Dr. Bishop, under the circumstances in his case, do the best she can for the patient?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: I don't believe the best she can is in the statute, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: What statute?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: In the definition of what standard of care is legally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q: Well, let's talk about all doctors in Memphis doing what Dr. Bishop was doing on the day of this event.

The first motion in limine sought to exclude any references to \"best possible care\" or the \"best that they can\" that had been discussed during the deposition of Dr. Stovall. The second motion in limine at issue sought to exclude evidence of medical\n   expenses beyond those actually paid by Appellants, their immediate family, or any insurance provider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 25, 2016, Appellants filed responses in opposition to Appellees' motions in limine. On February 16, 2016, the trial court granted both motions in limine in favor of Appellees. With respect to the first motion in limine, although the trial court forbade the parties from making references to \"best possible care\" or the \"best that they can,\" Appellants were permitted to \"make references to a physician's duty to exercise his or her best medical judgment and whether or not that medical judgment fell outside the recognized standard of care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   An eight-day trial began on February 15, 2016, and concluded on February 25, 2016. During opening statements, counsel for Appellees stated that the standard of care did not require \"perfection,\" but noted that doctors \"exercise their best judgment and they do the best they can.\" Counsel also referenced children dying of cancer at St. Jude. Following this statement, counsel for Appellants requested a curative instruction \"generally stating that what jurors may or may not have done or experiences is not evidence ... and that there will be no proof in this case about St. Jude or children with cancer.\" The trial court denied the requested curative instruction but informed the jury that arguments of counsel were not evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Appellants then presented their case-in-chief. Ms. Bradley testified first. Ms. Bradley recalled that she would miss days at work because of her bleeding issues. Ms. Bradley described the extent of the bleeding, stating that she was \"le[aving] a mess\" onto seats and was \"passing clots.\" Following the December 26, 2012 hysterectomy, Ms. Bradley testified that she had to endure the uncomfortable and painful treatment and physical therapy that she received during her three-week hospital stay. In addition, Ms. Bradley testified that the bowel injury she sustained after the December 26, 2012 hysterectomy necessitated additional surgeries, including a hernia repair. Despite Dr. Behrman's efforts to close the incision, Ms. Bradley stated that the skin on her stomach had not completely closed as of the date of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ms. Bradley also testified that taking care of her child and doing chores became more difficult following the hysterectomy but acknowledged that family members helped her with the adjustment. Ms. Bradley testified that as a result of her injuries stemming from the hysterectomy, her marriage became strained, she had to seek therapy for her depression, she became more withdrawn, she developed new gastrointestinal issues, and she gained more weight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Ms. Bradley, the total amount that her insurance company has paid for her medical expenses in this case is approximately $146,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Bradley; Becky Davidson, a retired employee of Mr. Bradley; and Robin Nemati, Mr. Bradley's sister, all generally testified to Ms. Bradley's activity prior to the December 26, 2012 surgery and her decreased activity in the aftermath of the hysterectomy. Mr. Bradley and Ms. Nemati testified that Dr. Bishop told them that another doctor made the first cuts on Ms. Bradley in an attempt to blame someone else for Ms. Bradley's bowel injury. Appellants also played a portion of Dr. Bishop's deposition for the jury where she admitted that she caused Ms. Bradley's bowel injury,\n   possibly when she retracted the bowel away from the uterus during surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Appellants also presented testimony from three expert witnesses: Eric Colton, M.D., an OB/GYN; Othon Wiltz, M.D., a colon and rectal surgeon; and Steven Berliner, M.D., a gynecologic oncologist and urogynecologist. Dr. Colton testified that Dr. Bishop first deviated from the standard of care by not offering a vaginal hysterectomy because, according to Dr. Colton, vaginal hysterectomies are the most minimally-invasive hysterectomy because it \"allows for the shortest operating time, [allows for] the fastest recovery, and [requires] no abdominal incision.\" In addition, based on the existence of Ms. Bradley's known extensive bowel adhesions, Dr. Colton testified that Dr. Bishop did not exercise her best medical judgment when she proceeded with the laparoscopic procedure on December 26, 2012. Dr. Colton also believed that Dr. Bishop's placement of the trocar\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   caused the bowel perforation. Although Dr. Colton conceded that bowel perforations during these procedures are not by themselves determinative of a violation of the standard of care, Dr. Colton testified that Dr. Bishop's failure to recognize and treat the bowel injury at the time of the hysterectomy violated the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Dr. Wiltz's testimony was limited to the appropriate placement of trocars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Dr. Wiltz, Ms. Bradley sustained the bowel injury because Dr. Bishop improperly placed the initial trocar in an area where Ms. Bradley was known to have bowel adhesions. Although Dr. Wiltz concedes that bowel injuries occasionally occur, he believed that Dr. Bishop should have gone back and checked for such injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Like Dr. Colton, Dr. Berliner testified that Dr. Bishop deviated from the standard of care by not offering a vaginal hysterectomy, which according to Dr. Berliner, offers a much lower risk of a bowel injury than any other approach. According to Dr. Berliner, the trocars inserted at the time of the laparoscopic surgery caused the injury to the bowel. Dr. Berliner, however, admitted on cross-examination that there is a recognized risk of perforating the bowl regardless of the type of hysterectomy performed. Moreover, Dr. Berliner believed that Dr. Bishop deviated from the standard of care in her decision to make a transverse-also known as a Pfannenstiel incision-as opposed to a vertical incision when she converted to an open procedure. The Pfannenstiel incision, according to Dr. Berliner, limited the visibility of the upper abdominal contents including the placement of the trocars and, as a result, Dr. Berliner believed that Dr. Bishop was unable to determine whether the bowel had been \"compromised.\" In addition, Dr. Berliner testified that Dr. Bishop violated the standard of care by not waiting for another surgeon to help with evaluating Ms. Bradley in the operating room and that she should have continued waiting despite the fact that the surgeons she attempted to call were unavailable. Dr. Berliner denied that there was any risk \"in a healthy young woman[ ] to stay under anesthesia\" until another surgeon became available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On February 23, 2016, at the close of Appellants' proof, Appellees moved for a\n   directed verdict, which the trial court ultimately denied. Appellees then presented testimony from four medical experts: Guy Voeller, M.D., a general surgeon; Diane Long, M.D., an OB/GYN; Dr. Bishop; and Dr. Stovall, an OB/GYN surgeon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   According to Dr. Voeller, a laparoscopic procedure was appropriate despite the presence of bowel adhesions in Ms. Bradley's abdomen. Dr. Voeller testified that, based on the location of Ms. Bradley's scars from prior surgeries, bowel adhesions are expected to be located in the upper abdomen rather than in the pelvis, where Dr. Bishop planned to operate. Dr. Voeller also testified that, had Dr. Bishop waited for a surgeon to come assist, the outcome would have been the same because the standard of care required that the assisting surgeon's involvement in the hysterectomy be limited to addressing the OB/GYN surgeon's concerns rather than exploring the bowel extensively. In Ms. Bradley's case, because Dr. Bishop was concerned about the colon injury sustained during the laparoscopic procedure, Dr. Voeller believed that Dr. Bishop would have only sought the assisting surgeon's assessment of the repair she made to Ms. Bradley's colon. Because no apparent evidence of injury to the small bowel existed, Dr. Voeller testified that the assisting surgeon would not have made incisions in Ms. Bradley's abdomen solely to search for a bowel injury because such action would increase the risk of creating a bowel injury due to the presence of extensive adhesions. Dr. Voeller further testified that leaving Ms. Bradley under anesthesia for an extended period of time would have increased the risk of clotting based on her medical history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Dr. Long testified that she became involved in the case when a nurse contacted her as the on-call doctor out of a concern that Ms. Bradley's urine output had decreased on the first postoperative day. Dr. Long denied that this was a symptom of bowel injury. Dr. Long further testified that a nephrologist, an intensivist, and infectious disease specialist were all involved in Ms. Bradley's care during her hospital stay. When she examined Ms. Bradley on December 27, 2012, Dr. Long recalled that she found neither signs nor symptoms of a bowel injury. In addition, Dr. Long testified that the results of the computerized tomography (\"CT\") scan and ultrasound that she ordered that day revealed no bowel injury. Dr. Long testified that laparoscopic procedures can be done on patients with bowel adhesions and that she believed Dr. Bishop complied with the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Dr. Bishop testified that Ms. Bradley was consistently bleeding from June 2012 to October 2012 despite efforts to control it with conservative surgery and different hormonal medications. As a result, Dr. Bishop described that Ms. Bradley's red blood cell count had decreased from twelve to nine in just one month in the fall of 2012, indicating that Ms. Bradley had lost a quarter of her blood volume. According to Dr. Bishop, a vaginal hysterectomy was not a viable option for Ms. Bradley based on her previous experience operating on Ms. Bradley and examining her anatomy; as a result, Dr. Bishop did not even offer it to Ms. Bradley as an option. Dr. Bishop proffered that a vaginal hysterectomy would require a blind incision to be made around the cervix in order to enter the abdomen, with a risk of injuring any organ within the vicinity. Dr. Bishop testified that she recommended the laparoscopic minimally invasive procedure because of Ms. Bradley's history with blood clotting disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   During the laparoscopic surgery, Dr. Bishop testified that she placed the first trocar to the left of Ms. Bradley's navel\n   because her scar and therefore most of her adhesions were on the right side.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, Dr. Bishop noticed a tear in Ms. Bradley's colon. Dr. Bishop made the decision to switch to an open surgery because she wanted to repair the tear and because of the presence of adhesions. Although she paged for surgical help, no additional surgeon was available. According to Dr. Bishop, leaving Ms. Bradley under anesthesia for too long was dangerous given her history of blood clotting. As a result, Dr. Bishop testified that she repaired the colon and finished the hysterectomy herself because the uterus, located in the pelvis, was free of the adhesions that were prominent in Ms. Bradley's upper abdomen. Due to the fact that Dr. Bishop left the trocars in place while she proceeded with the open surgery, Dr. Bishop testified that she was able to lift the abdominal wall and look back to the location of the trocars and was satisfied that the trocars were not near the bowel. In addition, Dr. Bishop testified that this visual examination revealed no evidence of a bowel leakage. According to Dr. Bishop, the standard of care requires that the OB/GYN surgeon perform a visual examination in the operating area at the end of the surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Dr. Bishop denied that any report ever indicated that the injury to the bowel was a \"through-and-through cut\" as suggested by Appellants; rather, the report indicates that it was a \"through-and-through injury\" which she contended could mean through the several layers of the bowel. Dr. Bishop pointed to a pathologist report of the perforated bowel, which described one hole, rather than two holes, consistent with her interpretation. Dr. Bishop opined that if there had been two holes, then the bowel contents should have begun to leak immediately, and the results of the CT scan that was performed the next day would have revealed the bowel injury. Dr. Bishop believed that the injury likely occurred when she retracted the bowel out of the way of the uterus and that the injury likely began as a small tear that enlarged over time. Dr. Bishop described the symptoms of a bowel injury to include fever, an elevated white blood count, a rigid abdomen, and vomiting the first day. However, Dr. Bishop testified that Ms. Bradley's symptoms two days after the hysterectomy were consistent with kidney problems and not a bowel injury. Dr. Bishop testified that the first evidence of a bowel injury occurred on the third postoperative day, when Dr. Bishop was called by the ICU doctor regarding Ms. Bradley's kidney function, with suspicion of flesh-eating bacteria. Dr. Bishop denied blaming anyone else for the injury and stated that she never disputed that she caused the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Dr. Stovall testified that Dr. Bishop's preoperative care of Ms. Bradley conformed to the standard of care by examining Ms. Bradley's history and offering available options. Because all of other options had been tried unsuccessfully, Dr. Stovall contended that the only remaining option was to have a hysterectomy. According to Dr. Stovall, Ms. Bradley's laparoscopic hysterectomy was appropriate even given Ms. Bradley's adhesions because they were located in the upper abdomen and laparoscopic hysterectomies are performed in the pelvis below the abdomen. Dr. Stovall testified that, regardless of the type of hysterectomy, injury to the bowel is one of the most common risks that are encountered. As such, Dr. Stovall testified that a bowel injury does not necessarily mean that a doctor violated the\n   standard of care, and it can occur even when a surgeon operates pursuant to the standard of care. In fact, Dr. Stovall testified that a bowel injury is not always recognizable when it occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Dr. Stovall also testified that Dr. Bishop conformed to the standard of care in the steps that she took in performing the hysterectomy. Specifically, Dr. Stovall testified that the Pfannenstiel incision that Dr. Bishop used when she switched to the open procedure was appropriate and within the standard of care because it is the incision of choice for all obstetrical and gynecological surgery, providing the best visualization of the uterus in the pelvis. In addition, this incision is the safest incision in terms of healing and hernia prevention. Although Dr. Stovall believed that Dr. Bishop conformed with standard of care in placing the trocar near the navel in order for her to be able to look down into pelvis, Dr. Stovall opined that, in this case, Ms. Bradley's bowel injury could have occurred in one of two ways: (1) trocar placement; or (2) retraction of the bowel with a lap sponge. Dr. Stovall opined that the injury was more likely to have been caused by the trocar placement based on known statistics of how often such injuries occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Dr. Stovall further testified that Dr. Bishop conformed to the standard of care postoperatively, which requires that the surgeon make assessments and address any problems that could arise. Dr. Stovall believed that Dr. Long, the on-call doctor who took care of Ms. Bradley one-and-a-half days after the hysterectomy, went beyond the standard of care by ordering a CT scan even though no sign of a bowel injury had arisen. Moreover, Dr. Stovall testified that the results of Ms. Bradley's CT scan showed minimal fluid and \"free air\" consistent with having had recent surgery and revealed no indication of a bowel injury. Dr. Stovall admitted that, if a surgeon suspects an injury to the bowel at the time of the hysterectomy, the surgeon would be required to \"run the bowel\" by touching and squeezing the bowel in order to check for cuts or discharge; however, Dr. Bishop never suspected an injury to the bowel in this case. Dr. Stovall contended that the first sign of a bowel injury occurred when Ms. Bradley developed increased pain and experienced drainage from her wound on December 29, 2012.

Rather, Appellants argue that, because Dr. Stovall based his standard of care opinion on whether Dr. Bishop gave the best possible care or did the best she could, Appellants should be permitted to cross-examine him on the underlying basis of his opinion. We agree that cross-examination of an expert regarding the basis of the expert's opinion may be both vigorous and broad.

Ct. App. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We cannot agree, however, that consideration of Dr. Bishop's best efforts formed the basis of Dr. Stovall's standard of care opinion. Despite Appellants' assertion otherwise, Dr. Stovall never testified at his pretrial deposition that the basis of his standard of care opinion rests on whether Dr. Bishop gave the \"best possible care\" or that she did \"the best she could.\" Rather, Dr. Stovall testified that the standard of care required by statute in Tennessee is defined as \"[w]hat a reasonable and prudent doctor with the same training and background would have in this locale[.]\" Appellants' counsel, on the other hand, repeatedly alluded to the \"best possible care,\" to which Dr. Stovall steadfastly answered that the \"best possible care\" was not required by the statute. Thus, we note that the references to \"best possible care\" were not advanced by Appellees; rather, the Appellants interjected such references during the cross-examination of Dr. Stovall at his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, regardless of how the issue of best possible care was raised in Dr. Stovall's deposition, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence. As previously discussed, even relevant evidence may be excluded where \"its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay[.]\" Tenn. R. Evid. 403. The Tennessee Rules of Evidence also place limits on the admissibility of expert testimony-the testimony must \"substantially assist the\n   trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue[.]\" Tenn. R. Evid. 702. Here, the excluded portion of Dr. Stovall's testimony creates serious confusion as to the proper standard applicable in this case and therefore does not substantially assist the jury in determining the dispositive question before it: whether Dr. Bishop breached the standard of care in her treatment of Ms. Bradley. As such, this evidence was properly excluded by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, it is helpful to first consider the law governing the standard of care in healthcare liability actions. Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-115(a) provides the following essential elements that a plaintiff must prove in order to prevail in a health care liability case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (1) The recognized standard of acceptable professional practice in the profession and the specialty thereof, if any, that the defendant practices in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community at the time the alleged injury or wrongful action occurred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (2) That the defendant acted with less than or failed to act with ordinary and reasonable care in accordance with such standard; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (3) As a proximate result of the defendant's negligent act or omission, the plaintiff suffered injuries which would not otherwise have occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-115\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 29-26-115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus. the law does not \"presume that a health care provider acted negligently simply because a treatment was unsuccessful.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099261\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/44/1/#p15\">\n    44 S.W.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 (Tenn. Ct.

Code Ann. \u00a7 29-26-115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ) (1980) ). This standard \"judge[s the physician] by an objective community standard\" rather than by a subjective standard.\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

App. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Appellants agree that the \"best possible care\" and \"doing the best she could\" connote subjective standards. As such, any testimony regarding the \"best possible care\" or Dr. Bishop \"doing the best that she could\" would require the jury to judge Dr. Bishop by a more arbitrary subjective standard than required by Tennessee law. First, we note that any evidence of whether Dr. Bishop did \"the best she could\" has little bearing on whether Dr. Bishop acted with ordinary and reasonable case. In our view, a physician could very well \"do the best that she could\" and yet still fall below the statutory standard of care, while another doctor could fail to do his or her best and yet exceed the standard of care required in a health care liability case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashe v.

Consequently, such evidence would only serve to confuse the jury, whose crucial task is to determine whether Dr. Bishop met the objective standard of care required under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Additionally, evidence regarding whether Dr. Bishop provided the \"best\n   care possible\" imposes upon Dr. Bishop far too stringent a standard. As is evident from the above statute, the requisite standard of care does not require that a physician deliver the best possible care but rather \"ordinary and reasonable care\" under the circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-115\">\n    Tenn.

Therefore, even if we were to assume that Appellees' references to \"the best [she] can\" constituted error in the trial court, Appellants still have not shown any reversible error-that but for the trial court's decision to limit their cross-examination of Dr. Stovall on the issue of whether Dr. Bishop gave the best possible care, Appellants would have prevailed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. R. App. P. 36(b) (\"A ... judgment ... shall not be set aside unless, considering the whole record, error involving a substantial right more probably than not affected the judgment or would result in prejudice to the judicial process.\"). Thus, we cannot conclude that in excluding Dr. Stovall's opinion of whether Dr. Bishop exerted her best efforts in the care of Ms. Bradley, the trial court prevented the jury from hearing \"both sides of th[e standard of care] issue\" or in any way gave Appellees an unfair advantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Based on the forgoing, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding Appellants from raising the issue of \"best possible care\" during Dr. Stovall's cross-examination, and, as a result, the trial court did not err in denying Appellants' motion for a new trial on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    Curative Instruction Following Appellees' Opening Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Appellants also take issue with the trial court's alleged failure to give a curative instruction drafted by Appellants\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   following Appellees' opening statement, which Appellants purport improperly compared Dr. Bishop to the physicians at St. Jude and Ms. Bradley to the children with cancer.

It's not perfection. It is not perfection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   After considering each party's arguments regarding the specific language of the curative instruction and determining that\n   both parties made statements that were \"on edge,\" the trial court opted to provide the jury the following general instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   You have just heard the lawyers' opening statements, and I would like to remind you that those statements are not evidence in this case. The only evidence that is-that you're to consider in this case will consist of the sworn testimony of the witnesses who have testified both on the witness stand and by deposition, the exhibits that you'll receive that will be marked into evidence and any stipulations that the lawyers have agreed to. You are the sole determiners of the facts and you are to use the law as I instruct you. Is that-do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   We note that Appellants never moved for a mistrial following this general instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In their brief, Appellants argue that \"no steps were taken by the [trial c]ourt to cure the prejudicial effect [Appellees' opening statements] had on the [j]ury\" even though the statements were \"highly prejudicial to the Appellants.\" We respectfully disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Even though the trial court did not adopt Appellants' exact wording of the curative instruction, as previously discussed, the trial court reiterated to the jury that opening statements are not evidence and that the jury must only consider the presentation of testimony, depositions, exhibits, and stipulations as evidence. \"Opening statements 'are intended merely to inform the trial judge and jury, in a general way, of the nature of the case and to outline, generally, the facts each party intends to prove.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

If there is any material evidence to support the jury's finding that \"Dr. Bishop did not deviate from the recognized standard of care\" for an OB/GYN surgeon, we must affirm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257518\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/417/414/#p422\">\n    417 S.W.3d at 422-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In this case, Appellees presented substantial testimony from medical experts who testified that Dr. Bishop's care of Ms. Bradley conformed to the applicable standard of care preoperatively, during the hysterectomy, and postoperatively. Specifically, the jury heard evidence that Dr. Bishop conformed to the standard of care of an OB/GYN surgeon in her assessment of Ms. Bradley's medical history, in her recommendation to Ms. Bradley of the minimally invasive procedure, in her performance of the hysterectomy including trocar placement away from the areas known to have bowel adhesions, in her decision to proceed with the surgery when no assisting surgeon was available to help in order to minimize blood clotting risks, and in her recognition of a bowel injury and taking appropriate action on the third operative day once symptoms arose. The jury also heard evidence that bowel injuries are the most common injuries that can occur during a hysterectomy and that such injuries are not always immediately recognizable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Although Appellants presented countervailing evidence suggesting that Dr. Bishop deviated from the standard of care by not performing a vaginal hysterectomy and by not examining the bowel immediately post-surgery in order to search for any perforation, it is not our prerogative to re-weigh the evidence presented or assess the witnesses' credibility. The jury chose to credit the evidence presented by Appellees. As such, taking the strongest legitimate view of all the evidence in favor of the verdict, assuming the truth of all evidence that supports the verdict, allowing all reasonable inferences to sustain the verdict, and discarding all countervailing evidence, as we must, we conclude that the record contains, at a minimum, material evidence to support the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Based on all of these circumstances, we conclude both that the trial court properly exercised its role as the thirteenth juror and that material evidence supports the jury's verdict. Therefore, we affirm the\n   trial court's judgment entered on the verdict and its denial of Appellants' motion for a new trial on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    Limitation on Proof of Medical Expenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Our disposition of the issues at this juncture is sufficient to uphold the jury's verdict that Dr. Bishop did not breach the applicable standard of care for an OB/GYN surgeon. Appellants' remaining issue concerning limitation of proof of medical expenses, or damages, is, therefore, pretermitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Shelby County Circuit Court's denial of Appellants' motion for a new trial.
