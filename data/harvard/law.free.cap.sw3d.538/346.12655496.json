We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts &amp; Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant, Donna Rowell, filed a petition for damages against Raymond Killion, III, whose negligence caused a car accident resulting in Ms. Rowell's injuries. A bench trial was held on August 19, 2016. The court entered its judgment on the same date in favor of Ms. Rowell in the amount of $208,137.14. Ms. Rowell filed a receipt and acknowledgment of payment after she received $1,000.00 in partial payment from Mr. Killion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Respondent, Automobile Club Inter-Insurance Exchange (Auto Club), filed a post-judgment motion to intervene on September\n   7, 2016. The hearing on the motion was held on October 7, 2016. The trial court, via docket entry, granted the motion to intervene on October 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Auto Club then filed a motion to set aside the judgment on October 28, 2016. A hearing on the motion was held on December 16, 2016. The trial court granted the motion to set aside the judgment on January 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Rowell filed her motion to denominate as a judgment the court's order granting the motion to set aside on January 10, 2017. On February 3, 2017, the trial court entered its judgment granting the motion to set aside. Ms. Rowell filed her notice of appeal on March 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the first point, Ms. Rowell argues that the Auto Club should not have been allowed to intervene because the trial court lost jurisdiction and authority thirty days after the August 19, 2016, judgment was entered.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Intervention is permitted by Rule 52.12(a) as a matter of right or by Rule 52.12(b), which provides for intervention by permission of the court. A trial court's decision regarding intervention as a matter of right will be affirmed unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314307\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/366/11/#p20\">\n    366 S.W.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (Mo. banc 2012). Three rules work together to govern interventions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Rule 52.12, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Intervention of Right\n   </strong>\n   . Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of this state confers an unconditional right to intervene or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Permissive intervention\n   </strong>\n   . Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of this state confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common; or (3) when the validity of a statute, regulation or constitutional provision of this state, or an ordinance or regulation of a governmental subdivision thereof, affecting the public interest, is drawn in question in any action to which the state or governmental subdivision thereof and the state or governmental subdivision or an officer, agency or employee thereof is not a party, the court may in its discretion notify the chief legal officer of the state or governmental subdivision may in the discretion of the court be permitted to intervene, upon proper application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Procedure\n   </strong>\n   . A person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion upon all parties affected thereby. The motion shall state the grounds therefor, and shall be accompanied\n   by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought. The same procedure shall be followed when a statute of this state gives a right to intervene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second rule is Rule 75.01, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court retains control over judgments during the thirty-day period after entry of judgment and may, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard and for good cause, vacate, reopen, correct, amend, or modify its judgment within that time. Not later than thirty days after entry of judgment the court of its own initiative may order a new trial for any reason for which it might have granted a new trial on motion of a party, and every order granting a new trial shall specify the grounds therefor. After the filing of notice of appeal and before the filing of the record on appeal in the appellate court, the trial court, after the expiration of such thirty-day period, may still vacate, amend or modify its judgment upon stipulation of the parties accompanied by a withdrawal of the appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The thirty-day period after entry of judgment for granting a new trial of the court's own initiative is not shortened by the filing of a notice of appeal but is terminated when the record on appeal is filed in the appellate court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   And finally, Rule 81.05(a) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (a)\n   <strong>\n    Finality as Affected by After-Trial Motions\n   </strong>\n   . For the purpose of ascertaining the time within which an appeal may be taken:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) A judgment becomes final at the expiration of thirty days after its entry if no timely authorized after-trial motion is filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) If a party timely filed an authorized after-trial motion, the judgment becomes final at the earlier of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a. Ninety days from the date the last timely motion was filed, on which date all motions not ruled shall be deemed overruled; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   b. If all motions have been ruled, then the date of ruling of the last motion to be ruled or thirty days after entry of judgment, whichever is later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) The filing and disposition of such motions has the same effect on time for appeal in all cases whether or not the motion has any function other than to seek relief in the trial court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Auto Club relies on the holding in\n   <em>\n    Frost v.

According to the motion, the Auto Club believes that counsel knew of the August 29 trial date both on and well before July 14 and chose not to inform the Auto Club. Also in the letter, Ms. Rowell's counsel presented authorizations for the Auto Club to acquire Ms. Rowell's medical records, which, according to the Auto Club, can oftentimes take weeks or even months to complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its motion, the Auto Club claims that Ms. Rowell's counsel's actions\n   constitute fraud. The elements of fraud are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (1) a representation, (2) its falsity, (3) its materiality, (4) the speaker's knowledge of its falsity ..., (5) the speaker's intent that the representation should be acted upon by the hearer in a manner reasonably contemplated, (6) the hearer's ignorance of the representation's falsity, (7) the hearer's reliance on the representation's truth, (8) the hearer's right to rely on the representation, and (9) injury to the hearer proximately caused by his reliance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Minor v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wild v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531585\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/14/166/#p167\">\n    14 S.W.3d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (Mo. App. W.D. 2000), the plaintiff claimed that the attorney for the airlines had purposely withheld information regarding the statute of limitations for a worker's compensation claim. According to the plaintiff, opposing counsel sent him a letter containing a settlement offer on December 23, 1993. The letter did not mention the two-year statute of limitations deadline, and the plaintiff claimed that this was done purposefully to \"lull him into missing it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531585\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/14/166/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court held that although opposing counsel may have known of the deadline, she had no duty to disclose it to the plaintiff because the proceedings were adversarial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531585\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/14/166/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11531585\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/14/166/#p167\">\n    at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Wild\n   </em>\n   involves an adverse party and not opposing counsel, the underlying principles can still be applied. Given the adversarial nature of the relationship between these two parties, and the existence of other sources (Case.net, Mr. Killion (insured), or Mr. Killion's insurance company) from which this information could have been obtained, we find that Ms. Rowell's counsel did not owe a duty of disclosure to the Auto Club. Without a recognized duty, the Auto Club's fraud claim fails. This point is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ms. Rowell has demonstrated that the trial court committed a mistake of law when it ruled on the motion to intervene more than thirty days after the August 19, 2016, judgment was made final. As a result, the ruling was void, and therefore, the Auto Club did not properly intervene. Without proper intervention, the Auto Club's motion to set aside is void. We reverse and find that the trial court's August 19, 2016 judgment is a final non-appealable judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Anthony Rex Gabbert, P.J., and Gary D.
