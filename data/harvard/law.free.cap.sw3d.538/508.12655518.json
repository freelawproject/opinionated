Although we reverse the trial court's ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over judgment creditors' motion, we affirm the trial court's decision to deny the motion where it was not filed \"[w]ithin ten years from the entry of [the underlying] judgment[,]\" as required by Rule 69.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 31, 2003, Town &amp; Country Jewelers, Inc. (\"Town &amp; Country\"), Linda L. Rozen, and Doron Rozen (collectively, \"Appellants\") filed suit against Jessica Lynn Trotter-Lawson (\"Appellee\") and Andrew Timothy Sheriff (together with Appellee, \"Defendants\"). The complaint alleged that the Defendants had misappropriated over $100,000.00 from Appellants while Appellee was employed by Town &amp; Country. On April 9, 2003, the trial court granted Appellants a default judgment against Appellee. Thereafter on April 23, 2003, Appellants and Appellee entered into a consent judgment whereby Appellants were awarded a judgment of $493,685.81 against Appellee. Eventually a default judgment was also entered against Mr. Sherriff in the amount of $519,357.47. On this day, August 11, 2003, the underlying action was fully adjudicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nearly thirteen years later, on June 20, 2016, Appellants filed separate motions requesting scire facias to revive the judgments against Defendants. Only the motion to renew filed against Appellee is at issue in this case. On August 5, 2016, Appellee filed a response to Appellants' motion raising the affirmative defense of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a hearing, the trial court entered an order on August 24, 2016, denying Appellants' request to revive the judgment against Appellee. Therein, the trial court rejected Appellants' argument that Appellee's failure to respond to their motion within thirty days required the trial court to grant their motion. The trial court further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter because Appellants failed to act within the statutory ten-year period pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 28-3-110(a)(2). The trial court designated its order as final and appealable. Appellants thereafter appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellants raise three issues concerning the trial court's denial of their motion to extend the judgment against Appellee. In our view, however, Appellants' issues may be summarized as a single issue: Whether the trial court correctly denied Appellants' motion to extend the judgment against Appellee. Appellee also requests damages for a frivolous appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this case, Appellants appeal the trial court's denial of their motion to extend\n   the 2003 judgment. The trial court's decision to deny Appellants' motion to extend the judgment was based on an interpretation of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. As such, this case presents a question of law, which we review de novo, with no presumption of correctness.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Oldfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8156842\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/279/259/#p261\">\n    279 S.W.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 (Tenn. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule 69.04 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure governs the procedure for obtaining extension of a previously awarded judgment. Rule 69.04 currently provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Within ten years from the entry of a judgment, the creditor whose judgment remains unsatisfied may file a motion to extend the judgment for another ten years. A copy of the motion shall be mailed by the judgment creditor to the last known address of the judgment debtor. If no response is filed by the judgment debtor within thirty days of the date the motion is filed with the clerk of court, the motion shall be granted without further notice or hearing, and an order extending the judgment shall be entered by the court. If a response is filed within thirty days of the filing date of the motion, the burden is on the judgment debtor to show why the judgment should not be extended for an additional ten years. The same procedure can be repeated within any additional ten-year period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The above language reflects recent changes to the Rule providing that, where the party defending against the motion files no response within thirty days, \"the motion shall be granted without further notice or hearing, and an order extending the judgment shall be entered by the court.\" Previously, the trial court was required to conduct a show cause hearing regardless of whether a timely response to the motion was filed. As the Advisory Commission Comments note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The revision replaces past practice of a show cause hearing. The revised procedure, subsequent to the filing of a motion by the judgment creditor, is the alternative of: (1) no hearing if the judgment debtor files no response to the motion in 30 days and the extension shall be automatically granted; or (2) if the judgment debtor files a response to the motion in 30 days, the extension is not automatically granted which provides each party an opportunity to set a hearing. If a hearing is convened, it is at that point that the revision maintains prior practice of placing the burden on the judgment debtor to show why the judgment should not be extended for an additional ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 69.04, 2016 Adv. Comm. cmts. The comments further elucidate the purpose of Rule 69.04 : \"The extension procedure set out in Rule 69.04 allows the judgment creditor to avoid having the judgment become unenforceable by operation of [Tennessee Code Annotated] Section 28-3-110(a)(2) [.]\" Tenn. R. Civ. P. 69.04, 2016 Adv. Comm. cmts. Section 28-3-110(a)(2), in turn, provides a ten-year statute of limitations on \"[a]ctions on judgments and decrees of courts of record of this or any other state or government[.]\" Tenn. Code Ann. 28-3-110 (noting some exceptions not applicable in this case). With regard to the ten-year limitations period under section 28-3-110(a)(2), the Tennessee Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The statute of limitations involved in the present case allows ten years from the time the cause of action accrues. Apparently the legislature considered this a sufficient length of time for an action to be brought on the judgment as originally rendered. Under our practice and under other provisions of the Code it is a\n   very simple matter to renew this judgment before the ten years expires by either the suit on the judgment or by scire facias.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Shepard v.

This Court has previously held that the section 28-3-110(a)(2) limitation period constitutes\n   a statute of limitations, rather than a statute of repose.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

According to the Tennessee Supreme Court, however, the expiration of a statute of limitations is not jurisdictional, but may be waived by a party's failure to timely raise the affirmative defense. As our supreme court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   True statutes of limitations do not constitute grants of subject matter jurisdiction but rather restrict the powers of a court to act on a claim over which it has subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pugh v.

In\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , the judgment creditor filed a motion on January 25, 1895, to revive a judgment rendered on February 2, 1885.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20S.W.%20197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20S.W.%20197\">\n    at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the trial court rendered a new judgment to reflect a credit, the debtor appealed, arguing, inter alia, that \"scire facias will not lie to revive a judgment until after 10 years from its\n   date.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20S.W.%20197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court disagreed, holding instead that \"after the lapse of 10 years the judgment cannot be revived by scire facias over the plea of the statute of limitations, there being nothing else in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20S.W.%20197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The supreme court therefore affirmed the trial court's finding that the motion to revive was timely but modified the judgment to reflect that it was merely a continuation of the original judgment, rather than a new judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20S.W.%20197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   decision, however, is not dispositive in this case. Importantly,\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   was decided well before the adoption of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, much less the amended version of Rule 69.04 that Appellant seeks to rely on here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

As such,\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   fails to illuminate whether a motion to revive under amended Rule 69.04 should be granted where a creditor files its motion to revive well outside the ten-year time period expressly included in the rule, but the debtor raises the defense of the expiration of the statute of limitations beyond the thirty day time period for filing a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on our review of the current version of Rule 69.04, however, we simply cannot agree that Appellants' motion to revive the judgment was timely even considering Appellee's delay in responding to the motion. Here, the first sentence of Rule 69.04 states that a creditor may seek to extend its judgment \"[w]ithin ten years from the entry of a judgment [.]\" While this language could suggest that the time limit applicable to motions under Rule 69.04 is directory, rather than mandatory, our examination of the statute as a whole belies this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens ex rel.

Crim. App. 1978).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the judgment creditor's ability to utilize the procedure under Rule 69.04 is introduced with the caveat that the motion be filed \"[w]ithin ten years from the entry of a judgment[.]\" As such, it appears that the debtor's duty to respond within thirty days is conditioned upon the motion to renew being timely filed. To allow a judgment creditor to file its motion beyond this ten-year period would essentially render this time limitation meaningless. Indeed, under Appellants' interpretation of the rule, a judgment creditor's years-long delay in filing a motion to revive would be excused simply because the debtor filed its response one day outside the thirty-day response period. Such a result borders on the absurd. Our supreme court has directed Tennessee courts, however, \"not [to] apply a particular interpretation to a statute [or rule] if that interpretation would yield an absurd result.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Flemming\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9129548\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/19/195/#p197\">\n    19 S.W.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (Tenn. 2000) (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

As previously discussed, amended Rule 69.04 states that \"[t]he same procedure can be repeated\n   <strong>\n    within\n   </strong>\n   any additional ten-year period.\" Tenn. R. Civ. P. 69.04 (emphasis added). As such, Rule 69.04 contemplates that the procedure utilized both to initially extend a judgment and to do so thereafter be initiated within consecutive ten-year periods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook v. Alley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7252710\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/419/256/#p260\">\n    419 S.W.3d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2013) (holding that an extension to a judgment under Rule 69.04 is \"tacked on\" to the previous ten years, rather than the date of entry of the order granting the extension). Indeed, the Tennessee Supreme Court has previously indicated that it is not burdensome to require a creditor to \"renew [a] judgment\n   <strong>\n    before the ten years expires\n   </strong>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=241%20S.W.2d%20587\">\n    241 S.W.2d at 591-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (decided prior to the adoption of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure). By filing their motion well outside the ten-year period, Appellants have clearly failed to comply with both the letter and the spirit of Rule 69.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although not directly dispositive of this issue, one recent case includes language to support our conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Under the prior procedure required by Rule 69.04,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court issued a show cause order requiring the debtor, within thirty days, to show cause why the judgment should not be extended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although there was an error with the original service of the show cause order, the debtor undisputedly received notice on December 19, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eight months after receiving notice, the debtor filed a motion for relief from the order renewing the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In fact, however, the trial court had yet to enter an order renewing the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

We rejected this argument, relying in part on the advisory committee comments to the current version of Rule 69.04 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   For purposes of Rule 69.04, the proper focus is on the timing of the motion to extend, not the court's order extending the judgment. As long as a motion to extend is filed \"[w]ithin ten years from entry of a judgment,\" as is the case here, a judgment creditor may \"avoid having the judgment become unenforceable by operation of [ Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 28-3-110(a)(2) ].\" Tenn.

As such, we suggested that the requirement to file a motion to revive within ten years was \"essential\" to benefit from the procedure outlined in Rule 69.04. In other words, because the judgment creditor's motion to revive was filed within ten years of the entry of the judgment, the debtor's corresponding duty to timely respond to the motion under Rule 69.04 was triggered. Without a timely filed motion to renew, it therefore does not appear that the judgment creditor can rely on the procedure outlined in Rule 69.04, including the requirement that the debtor timely respond lest the renewal be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based upon the plain language of Rule 69.04, as well as the foregoing authorities, we hold that it is necessary for a judgment creditor to file its motion to renew a judgment under Rule 69.04\"[w]ithin ten years from the entry of a judgment.\" Once a timely motion has been filed, the debtor's duty to timely respond pursuant to Rule 69.04 is triggered. Here, Appellants filed their motion to revive the 2003 judgment in 2016, well beyond the ten-year time limit. As such, the trial court had no authority to renew the judgment under Rule 69.04, and Appellee's duty to respond was not triggered.
