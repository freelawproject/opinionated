Later, the husband withdrew most of the funds from the joint account and placed the funds in a certificate of deposit issued solely in his name. After the husband's death, a dispute arose between his surviving spouse and his children from a previous marriage regarding ownership of the certificate of deposit. The trial court, relying on\n   <em>\n    Mays v. Brighton Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11950240\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/832/347/\">\n    832 S.W.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct.

Ct. App. June 4, 2008), held that the certificate of deposit belonged to the surviving spouse because the funds were impressed with the entireties and could be traced to the joint account. We hold that once funds are withdrawn from a bank account held by a married couple as tenants by the entirety, the funds cease to be entireties property. Accordingly, the certificate of deposit issued to the husband from funds withdrawn\n   from the joint bank account belongs to his estate, not his surviving spouse. We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2012, Calvert Hugh Fletcher and his wife, Nelda Karene Fletcher, refinanced their home and paid off a line of credit secured by the home. They deposited most of the proceeds into a newly-opened joint checking account with FSG Bank. The FSG Bank account agreement designated the account as \"JOINT-WITH SURVIVORSHIP (and not as tenants in common).\" Funds could be withdrawn from the account based on the signature of either Mr. or Mrs. Fletcher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2013, Mr. Fletcher withdrew $100,000 from the joint checking account and obtained a $100,000 certificate of deposit solely in his name, issued by FSG Bank. The certificate of deposit was pledged as security for a $100,000 line of credit, although the line of credit was never used. In February 2013, the FSG joint checking account was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Fletcher became ill in March 2013 and died on September 6, 2013. In his will, Mr. Fletcher bequeathed his tangible personal property and effects to Mrs. Fletcher and left the residuary estate to his four adult children from a prior marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mrs. Fletcher filed the will for probate in the Putnam County Probate Court and was appointed executrix for the estate. Mrs. Fletcher filed an estate inventory with the court, listing the certificate of deposit as a non-estate asset, and later filed a petition asking the probate court to designate the certificate of deposit as her separate marital property. Mr. Fletcher's children maintained that the certificate of deposit was estate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the hearing to determine ownership of the certificate of deposit, Mrs. Fletcher testified that in April 2012, she and Mr. Fletcher opened a joint bank account in a money market fund at FSG Bank with an initial deposit of $100,415.73. Of these funds, $89,779.97 came from the refinancing of the mortgage on their marital home, and the rest of the money came from marital funds. Mrs. Fletcher said she knew Mr. Fletcher intended to use the funds in the joint account for potential future investments, but she did not agree for Mr. Fletcher to transfer $100,000 from the joint bank account into a certificate of deposit issued solely in his name. Mrs. Fletcher testified she did not know the funds had been withdrawn until December 2013, when she spoke with a bank officer to receive an update on the couple's accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mrs. Fletcher admitted that she signed the joint account card that provided only one signature was required for withdrawal of funds. Mrs. Fletcher explained that she paid the family's bills and that bank statements were mailed to the marital home. Although her practice was to open and review the bank statements, Mrs. Fletcher did not recall seeing a statement evidencing a withdrawal in January 2013 of just over $100,000 or a statement indicating that the joint account had been closed in February 2013. Although Mrs. Fletcher knew that Mr. Fletcher was investing in real estate and working to develop Walden Villages subdivision when he became ill, she did not try to prevent him from investing. Mrs. Fletcher testified that she knew if he wanted to, Mr. Fletcher would use the money from the refinance loan for investment purposes. When asked if she would have agreed for Mr. Fletcher to withdraw $100,000 to purchase stock, Mrs. Fletcher acknowledged that he probably would not have asked her because that was his practice. Mrs. Fletcher agreed that she\n   could have withdrawn $100,000 from the joint account but would not have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Fletcher's daughter, Elaine Fletcher, testified that in April 2013, her father asked her to assist Mrs. Fletcher in repaying a loan. While at the Fletchers' home, Elaine Fletcher saw a statement on the kitchen table for an account only in her father's name containing $100,000, which she and Mrs. Fletcher discussed. Elaine Fletcher overheard Mrs. Fletcher's side of a conversation with FSG Bank Vice-President Howard Bilbrey. Elaine Fletcher also spoke with Mr. Bilbrey, who told her that the money was in a certificate of deposit and would be difficult to withdraw. When Elaine Fletcher relayed this information to Mrs. Fletcher, they were both surprised to learn the money was in a certificate of deposit, but Mrs. Fletcher was not surprised that it was in only Mr. Fletcher's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Janet Fletcher Brady, another of Mr. Fletcher's children, testified she came to help care for her father in March and April 2013. Ms. Brady said that Mrs. Fletcher knew of the investment in Walden Villages subdivision and that Mrs. Fletcher was handling the finances for herself and Mr. Fletcher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The probate court ruled that the certificate of deposit was an asset of Mr. Fletcher's estate, relying on\n   <em>\n    Mays v. Brighton Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11950240\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/832/347/\">\n    832 S.W.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992), which held that the withdrawn funds ceased to be tenancy by the entirety property upon withdrawal. The probate court found that after the April 2013 telephone conversation with Mr. Bilbrey, Mrs. Fletcher knew or should have known that the certificate of deposit existed, or at least that the funds were held in something other than the Fletchers' joint checking account, and that she acquiesced in creating the certificate of deposit. Further, the probate court ruled that there was no proof of fraud, noting that Mr. Fletcher directed FSG Bank to send the certificate of deposit account statements to the marital home. The probate court held that the funds from the Fletchers' joint account ceased to be entireties property. Because the certificate of deposit was only in Mr. Fletcher's name at the time of his death and there were no designations of payment on death to any individual, the certificate of deposit was part of Mr. Fletcher's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. Fletcher appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court of Appeals reversed and held that the funds in the certificate of deposit belonged to Mrs. Fletcher, as the certificate of deposit was entireties property at Mr. Fletcher's death.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Fletcher\n   </em>\n   , No. M2015-01297-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203090920\">\n    2016 WL 3090920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (Tenn.

Under the Arkansas approach, the funds, once withdrawn, cease to be entireties property. The legal status is clear, and all parties know their respective positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Pennsylvania approach does not provide the needed clarity and finality necessary in the banking arena. This approach arguably leads to uncertainty in banking transactions and may often result in tracing joint funds long after the funds have been spent. As a practical matter, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the third party receiver of such funds to know of the entireties source or character of the funds, resulting in the possibility that the non-withdrawing spouse could later object to the earlier withdrawal. One could certainly be swayed by equity to side with the Pennsylvania approach when the withdrawn sum is rather large as in this case. However, the sum involved must not be determinative and instead must give way to the clarity and certainty provided by the Arkansas approach. Whether the withdrawal was $100 or $100,000, the policy considerations must be consistent. To the extent that\n   <em>\n    Sloan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grahl\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Grass\n   </em>\n   are inconsistent with this opinion, they are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We adopt the Arkansas approach and hold that, once a husband or wife withdraws funds from a joint bank account held as tenants by the entirety, the funds cease to be held by the entirety. When Mr. Fletcher withdrew funds from the Fletchers' joint account, those funds ceased to be property held by the entirety. The certificate of deposit purchased with the withdrawn funds and issued to Mr. Fletcher individually belonged only to Mr. Fletcher. When he died, the certificate of deposit became part of Mr. Fletcher's estate and did not pass outside the estate to his surviving spouse. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court. Costs of this appeal are taxed to appellee, Nelda Karene Fletcher, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The trial court certified the order as final, finding \"no just reason for delay\" under Rule 54.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Here, no issue was raised as to whether the designation on a bank's signature card as \"JOINT-WITH SURVIVORSHIP (and not as tenants in common)\" was sufficient to overcome the presumption that the bank account was held as tenants by the entirety.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    There is no allegation or evidence that Mr. Fletcher acted fraudulently by withdrawing $100,000 from the joint account or by placing the certificate of deposit in his individual name. Therefore, we need not address the status of funds withdrawn from a joint account by one spouse under circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud, to avoid creditors, or to defeat the interests of a spouse in anticipation of divorce.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
