Becker, individually and d/b/a Bunstine, Watson, McElroy &amp; Becker, represented the plaintiffs, John Howard Story and David Bruce Coffey, in a lender liability lawsuit. In the underlying lender liability lawsuit, the trial court ultimately dismissed the case against two of the lender defendants, and the claims against the remaining lender defendant were later voluntarily\n   dismissed. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit against the defendant attorneys alleging legal malpractice. The trial court partially dismissed the case based on the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations for filing a complaint for legal malpractice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-3-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Later, in response to the defendant attorneys' motion for summary judgment, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs' remaining claim, determining that the claim was also barred by the statute of limitations. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted this appeal to address: (1) whether this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Carvell v. Bottoms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9998095\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/900/23/\">\n    900 S.W.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 1995), in which we set forth a discovery rule for when the statute of limitations begins to run in a legal malpractice action, should be overruled; (2) whether an interlocutory ruling in underlying litigation constitutes a legally cognizable injury; (3) whether this Court should adopt either the continuous representation rule or the appeal-tolling doctrine for tolling the statute of limitations in legal malpractice actions; and (4) whether a subsequent action of an attorney that renders an interlocutory order final amounts to a separate and discrete act of malpractice such that the statute of limitations for that action does not begin until said action is taken. Following our review, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Carvell v. Bottoms\n   </em>\n   is the accurate analysis for determining when a claim of legal malpractice accrues. In addition, we decline to adopt the two tolling doctrines proposed by the plaintiffs, and we further decline to hold that the trial court's final judgment in the underlying case is required before there is an actual injury for purposes of the accrual of a claim for litigation malpractice. Nevertheless, we conclude that, in the case before us, the complaint fails to establish an actual injury prior to the date of the trial court's final judgment in the underlying case. Consequently, the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss and in determining that the plaintiffs' legal malpractice claims were time barred. Finally, we conclude that the trial court also erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. In this case, the defendant attorneys' alleged negligence, which purportedly rendered the interlocutory order in the underlying case final, constituted a distinct act of malpractice, and as such, the statute of limitations had not run on that claim at the time the plaintiffs filed this legal malpractice action. Therefore, we reverse the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this legal malpractice action, John Howard Story and David Bruce Coffey (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") appeal from the intermediate appellate court's decision to affirm the trial court's dismissal of their case against their former attorneys Nicholas D. Bunstine, Brent R. Watson, and Jerrold L. Becker, individually and d/b/a Bunstine, Watson, McElroy &amp; Becker (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The issue before us is whether the legal malpractice action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations under the facts of this case. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From 2011 to 2013, Defendants represented Plaintiffs in their lender liability suit against Scott Thompson, First National Bank of Oneida, and People's Bank of the South. According to Plaintiffs, prior to filing the underlying suit, one of the defendant attorneys, Mr. Becker, represented that Plaintiffs had a strong case with a high likelihood of a six-figure settlement. Nevertheless, on May 7, 2013, the Chancery\n   Court of Scott County, Tennessee, granted summary judgment in favor of two of the underlying defendants, Scott Thompson and First National Bank of Oneida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to trial on the claims against the remaining bank, Mr. Becker advised that the damages evidence necessary to prosecute the case was not ready and that Plaintiffs should, therefore, voluntarily dismiss the case. According to Plaintiffs, Mr. Becker advised that the case could be refiled within one year but failed to inform Plaintiffs that the voluntary dismissal would render the prior summary judgment order final. Thus, the remaining claims were dismissed by Defendants, on Plaintiffs' behalf, and the trial court entered an order reflecting the voluntary dismissal on November 13, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs failed to appeal the order granting summary judgment in favor of Mr. Thompson and First National Bank of Oneida, and therefore, Plaintiffs' claims against those underlying defendants were permanently barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs did not refile their voluntarily dismissed claims against the remaining bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rather than refiling their nonsuited claims in the underlying lender liability suit, on September 3, 2014, Plaintiffs filed this legal malpractice action against Defendants in the Circuit Court for Knox County, Tennessee. In their legal malpractice complaint, Plaintiffs alleged, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. Prior to the filing of the lender's liability action ... [Mr.] Becker, represented to plaintiffs that they had a strong case of liability and damages and that there was a high likelihood the case would ultimately result in a settlement in excess of six figures. He continued to represent ... that the case was strong ... throughout the entire time the case was pending, until the day he appeared with [Mr.] Watson to explain that they had concluded that the case needed to be voluntarily dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. In reality, if plaintiffs had any valid claim at all, it was their claim against Scott Thompson as an individual. The claims against the banks were extremely weak and were subject to a statutory defense.... The claims against the banks were also virtually precluded [by] the express written terms of the loan documents ... and[,] as to one of the bank[s], barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   5. Plaintiffs initially agreed to pay [Mr.] Becker $500.00 per hour ..., but later, after becoming aware that such an hourly rate was excessive, plaintiffs and [Mr.] Becker agreed to reduce the hourly rate to $375.00. In reliance on the representations ... that they had a strong lender's liability case, plaintiffs together paid [Mr.] Becker several hundred thousand dollars in attorney fees and expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   6. During the course of the proceedings, the question arose as to whether plaintiffs should continue to pay the underlying indebtedness that gave rise to their lender's liability claims. [Mr.] Becker, negligently, carelessly and recklessly advised [ ] plaintiffs that they should discontinue making their payments, and as a result, plaintiffs were declared in default and have incurred substantial penalties, interest, attorney's fees, expenses, and injury to their credit ratings and reputations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   7. Contrary to the representations of [Mr.] Becker, the lender's liability case was not a strong case at all.... After a hearing in which the judge agreed with the contentions of the defendants in the lender's liability action, [Mr.] Becker continued to assure plaintiffs that they had a strong case which would ultimately settle and stated that the judge did not know what he was talking about. [Mr.] Becker assured plaintiffs that he would file motions to force the chancery court to correct its erroneous rulings. After one of the banks and the individual defendant, Scott Thompson, were dismissed from the case, ... [Mr.] Becker did not inform plaintiffs that the dismissal purported to be a final judgment as to those defendants, and indicated he would file a motion to correct the error. Although such motion was filed, it was never brought on for hearing, and with the ultimate voluntary dismissal of the remaining defendant occurring thereafter, any claims against those defendants became forever barred. As a result, upon voluntary dismissal of the action, [Mr.] Becker and [Mr.] Watson took action which permanently precluded plaintiffs from maintaining their claims against the only viable defendant ..., the individual defendant, Scott Thompson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   8. Plaintiffs allege that a reasonable attorney would have warned them prior to filing the lender's liability case that their chances of prevailing in such claims were slim to none, especially against the banks.... Plaintiffs further allege that a reasonable attorney would have advised them to continue making payments on the indebtedness pending the resolution of the lender's liability claims, and would have explained that ... defaulting on the indebtedness would have devastating economic consequences and inflict grievous harm upon the credit rating and reputations of plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged that these and other actions of Defendants amounted to violations of the standard of care of a licensed attorney in the State of Tennessee. As a result, Plaintiffs claimed to have suffered damages in excess of two million dollars. Notably, paragraph 11 of Plaintiffs' complaint stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   11. In explaining in November, 2013, that they had decided plaintiffs' only option was to voluntarily dismiss their lender's liability action, [Mr.] Watson and [Mr.] Becker, acknowledged that [Mr.] Becker had mishandled the case and was not prepared for trial[.] ... [Mr.] Becker apologized and stated that he had professional liability coverage if plaintiffs decided to make a professional liability claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response to the instant legal malpractice claim, Defendants filed a series of dispositive motions. On October 2, 2014, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to establish Plaintiffs' causes of action and lacked sufficient specificity and that Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   claims were barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-3-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (\"Actions and suits against ... attorneys for malpractice shall be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrued, whether the action or suit is grounded or based in contract or tort.\"). Defendants argued that the statute of limitations began to run on May 7, 2013, the date a judgment was entered dismissing one of the defendant banks and the individual defendant in the underlying case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, argued in their response to Defendants' motion that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until November 13, 2013, the date on which the order was entered reflecting Plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal as to the remaining claims. In support of their argument, Plaintiffs characterized the May 7, 2013 order granting summary judgment in favor of two of the underlying defendants as an \"interlocutory\" order, which did not constitute a final judgment and, according to Plaintiffs, could not have triggered the running of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The circuit court, on December 10, 2014, partially granted Defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that all of Plaintiffs' claims, with the exception of one, accrued on May 7, 2013, and were barred by the one-year statute of limitations. However, the court further stated that \"Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to the November 2013 voluntary dismissal of their remaining claim in the underlying case is a discrete allegation of alleged legal malpractice which is not barred by the statute of limitations and which states a claim upon which relief may be granted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Following the court's order, Plaintiffs filed an amendment to their complaint in which they alleged that \"all of their claims for litigation malpractice and fraud, misrepresentation and deceit against the defendants in this cause are timely filed for purposes of the one year statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions.\" Seemingly for clarification, Plaintiffs also alleged that on May 31, 2013, Defendants filed a motion to alter or amend the order granting summary judgment in favor of two of the defendants in the underlying lender liability suit but never set the motion for a hearing. Plaintiffs further alleged a claim for \"breach of the confidential and fiduciary relationship between plaintiffs and defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thereafter, Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.03 with respect to Plaintiffs' remaining claim. Defendants contended that Plaintiffs had failed to allege that they suffered any damages as a result of the November 2013 voluntary dismissal and also requested that the circuit court dismiss the claim for \"breach of fiduciary duty and confidentiality\" because such claim relied on the same operative facts as Plaintiffs' legal malpractice claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By order entered February 20, 2015, the court denied Defendants' Rule 12.03 motion in part and granted it in part. Notably, the court reaffirmed its December 10, 2014 order dismissing all of Plaintiffs' claims \"with the exception of any cause of action which may exist related to the Order of Voluntary Dismissal entered in the Underlying Case on November 12, 2013.\" It denied Defendants' motion with respect to Plaintiffs' remaining claim and the alleged absence of pleaded damages, finding the matter better suited to a motion for summary judgment. Conversely, the court granted Defendants' motion as to the portion of Plaintiffs' amended complaint asserting a claim for breach of confidentiality and breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following the direction of the circuit court, Defendants next filed a motion for\n   summary judgment in which they again contended that Plaintiffs did not sustain any damages stemming from the voluntary dismissal. On October 19, 2015, the court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that Plaintiffs' assertion that Defendants had misrepresented that the case could be re-filed, particularly against Mr. Thompson, following the voluntary dismissal was a newly asserted claim that had not previously been pleaded and so was barred by the statute of limitations. The court also determined that Plaintiffs' claim that the pending motion to alter or amend the partial summary judgment in the underlying case had been negligently abandoned or lost as a consequence of the voluntary dismissal also was time-barred. It explained that this claim actually arose from the initial May 7, 2013 interlocutory partial summary judgment and so accrued on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the legal malpractice case, Plaintiffs appealed the circuit court's orders partially granting Defendants' motion to dismiss, partially granting Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, and granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's decision to grant Defendants' motion to dismiss; however, it concluded that, upon Defendants' October 2, 2014 motion to dismiss, the circuit court should have dismissed the legal malpractice complaint in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    Story v.

Dearborn &amp; Ewing\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Under this rule, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff knows or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should know that an injury has been sustained as a result of wrongful or tortious conduct by the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In legal malpractice cases, the discovery rule is composed of two distinct elements: (1) the plaintiff must suffer legally cognizable damage-an actual injury\n   -as a result of the defendant's wrongful or negligent conduct, and (2) the plaintiff must have known or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that this injury was caused by the defendant's wrongful or negligent conduct. An actual injury occurs when there is the loss of a legal right, remedy or interest, or the imposition of a liability. An actual injury may also take the form of the plaintiff being forced to take some action or otherwise suffer \"some actual inconvenience,\" such as incurring an expense, as a result of the defendant's negligent or wrongful act. However, the injury element is not met if it is contingent upon a third party's actions or amounts to a mere possibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The knowledge component of the discovery rule may be established by evidence of actual or constructive knowledge of the injury. Accordingly, the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the injury as where, for example, the defendant admits to having committed malpractice or the plaintiff is informed by another attorney of the malpractice. Under the theory of constructive knowledge, however, the statute may begin to run at an earlier date-whenever the plaintiff becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that an injury has been sustained as a result of the defendant's negligent or wrongful conduct. We have stressed, however, that there is no requirement that the plaintiff actually know the specific type of legal claim he or she has, or that the injury constituted a breach of the appropriate legal standard. Rather, the plaintiff is deemed to have discovered the right of action if he is aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct. It is knowledge of facts sufficient to put a plaintiff on notice that an injury has been sustained which is crucial. A plaintiff may not, of course, delay filing suit until all the injurious effects or consequences of the alleged wrong are actually known to the plaintiff. Allowing suit to be filed once all the injurious effects and consequences are known would defeat the rationale for the existence of statutes of limitations, which is to avoid the uncertainties and burdens inherent in pursuing and defending stale claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Kohl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11681158\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/977/528/#p532\">\n    977 S.W.2d at 532-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although reiterated and succinctly stated in\n   <em>\n    Kohl\n   </em>\n   , Tennessee's \"specific formulation of the 'discovery rule' \" was first formally adopted over twenty years ago in\n   <em>\n    Carvell v.

Our current formulation of the discovery rule is preferable because it allows the trial court's entry of a final judgment to essentially act as a default point of actual injury and accrual. Conversely, it also provides the flexibility to consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether the client/plaintiff had already suffered some degree of actual injury prior to a final judgment in the underlying litigation. For example, the client may have incurred additional effort and expense in attempting to rectify the alleged negligence in the course of the underlying proceedings, and in such a case, the cause of action for legal malpractice accrues prior to a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The flexibility afforded by our current rule is particularly beneficial in those cases in which the alleged malpractice occurred early in the underlying litigation. Although\n   the five-year statute of repose, Tennessee Code Annotated section 28-3-104(c)(2), provides some level of protection against extreme delay, the injury requirement, as it stands, can avoid a delay of what could be several years before the underlying litigation is concluded by a final judgment.

As explained above, Plaintiffs filed their legal malpractice claim on September 3, 2014. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs suffered an actual or legally cognizable injury on May 7, 2013, when the trial court granted summary judgment as to one of the banks and the individual defendant. Therefore, according to Defendants, Plaintiffs' legal malpractice case was filed more than a year after their cause of action accrued and, as such, was time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with Defendants below, stating, \"Here, [Plaintiffs] suffered an actual injury ... when the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of First National Bank of Oneida and Scott Thompson on May 7, 2013. At that point, [Plaintiffs] had lost their case as to these defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Story\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203344795\">\n    2016 WL 3344795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. However, as Plaintiffs have continued to argue, the circuit court and the Court of Appeals both misconstrued the true legal effect of the trial court's grant of summary judgment against the two defendants. Rule 54.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   [A]ny order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties\n   <em>\n    shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of the judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.02 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Consequently, the May 2013 order granting summary judgment was not a final judgment, and as such, it did not terminate the action, even as to First National Bank of Oneida and Mr. Thompson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

It was subject to revision by the trial court at any time before the entry of a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, the face of Plaintiffs' complaint, including the amendment, fails to clearly establish that, as a result of Defendants' alleged negligence, Plaintiffs were \"forced to take some action or otherwise suffer[ed] some actual inconvenience, such as incurring an expense.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11681158\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/977/528/#p532\">\n    977 S.W.2d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The complaint, as amended, alleges that, in May 2013, Defendants prepared and filed a motion to alter or amend the trial court's order granting summary judgment. However, there is no allegation that Defendants billed Plaintiffs for the preparation or filing of that motion. Nor did Defendants assert this as a basis for a finding of an actual injury or offer such evidence in support of their motion to dismiss. As the parties invoking the statute of limitations, it was Defendants' responsibility to proffer the additional information necessary to establish the defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redwing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316211\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/436/#p457\">\n    363 S.W.3d at 455-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The [defendant] chose a Tenn.

Thus, courts ruling on a [ Rule] 12.02(6) motion must construe the complaint liberally, presuming all factual allegations to be true and giving the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted));\n   <em>\n    Givens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9417558\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/75/383/#p404\">\n    75 S.W.3d at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the defendant is not required \"to submit evidence in support of his motion when the facts on which he relies to defeat plaintiff's claim are admitted by the plaintiff in his complaint\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, Defendants failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Thus, despite our decision to continue to adhere to the existing law with respect to the occurrence of an actual or legally cognizable injury and the accrual of a cause of action for legal malpractice, we conclude that the complaint in the case before us does not establish an actual injury prior to the date of the trial court's final judgment in the underlying case. Based on the facts alleged on the face of the complaint alone, the cause of action did not accrue prior to November 13, 2013, and Defendants' motion to dismiss should have been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In addition, according to Plaintiffs, the facts in the complaint do not clearly establish that Plaintiffs had actual or constructive knowledge that Defendants' malpractice was the cause of their supposed injury-the May 7, 2013 dismissal of two underlying defendants. However, we have already determined that the motion to dismiss should have been denied because the complaint fails to establish an actual injury prior to the date of the final judgment in the underlying proceedings. As such, we conclude that this issue is pretermitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    2. Circuit Court's Grant of Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that summary judgment was not appropriate on their claim concerning the November 2013 voluntary dismissal. According to Plaintiffs, the circuit court erroneously concluded that their argument consisted of newly asserted claims not previously pleaded and that the claim concerning Defendants' alleged negligence in connection with the voluntary dismissal was also time-barred. Plaintiffs urge this Court to find that the Defendants' actions rendering the interlocutory order final amounted to a separate and discrete act of malpractice such that\n   the statute of limitations for that claim did not begin to run until the action was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   We agree that the circuit court erroneously concluded that Plaintiffs had failed to include in their complaint a separate claim for negligence arising out of Defendants' decision to enter a voluntary dismissal in November 2013. In paragraph 7 of Plaintiffs' complaint, they clearly allege that, as a result of Defendants' negligent advice, Plaintiffs were \"permanently precluded ... from maintaining their claims against the only viable defendant ..., the individual defendant, [Mr.] Thompson.\" Then, in response to the motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs offered evidence that, specifically, Defendants had misrepresented that the case could be re-filed against all of the underlying defendants, including Mr. Thompson and First Bank of Oneida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Unlike the circuit court, we do not perceive this as a newly asserted claim. The Plaintiffs' complaint contained, at a minimum, three separate claims for legal malpractice against Defendants: (1) that Defendants negligently advised Plaintiffs to pursue weak claims against the defendant banks in the underlying lender liability suit; (2) that Defendants negligently allowed the individual underlying defendant, Mr. Thompson, to be dismissed; and (3) that Defendants negligently advised Plaintiffs to voluntarily dismiss their claims against the remaining underlying defendant in the lender liability suit. The third claim, Plaintiffs alleged, resulted in the\n   <em>\n    permanent preclusion\n   </em>\n   of their claims against \"the only viable defendant,\" which we can only assume refers to the loss of their claim against Mr. Thompson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Thus, we also agree that Plaintiffs' claims regarding the Defendants' alleged negligence in voluntarily dismissing the underlying case in November 2013 was a discrete claim of alleged malpractice, separate from the claims relating to the interlocutory summary judgment. The circuit court, therefore, erred in granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment on that remaining claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we conclude that our formulation of the discovery rule articulated in\n   <em>\n    Carvell v. Bottoms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9998095\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/900/23/\">\n    900 S.W.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 1995), and again in\n   <em>\n    John Kohl &amp; Co. P.C. v. Dearborn &amp; Ewing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11681158\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/977/528/#p532\">\n    977 S.W.2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 1998), remains the appropriate analysis for determining when a claim of legal malpractice accrues. Accordingly, we decline to adopt the two tolling doctrines proposed by Plaintiffs-the continuing representation rule and the appeal-tolling doctrine-and also decline to hold that a final judgment is required before there is an actual injury for purposes of accrual. Even so, the complaint in the present case fails to establish an actual injury prior to the date of the trial court's final judgment in the underlying case. Consequently, the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss and in determining that the plaintiffs' legal malpractice claims were time barred. We further conclude that the trial court also erred in granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   We, therefore, reverse the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs of this appeal are taxed to Appellees Nicholas D. Bunstine, Brent R. Watson, and Jerrold L. Becker, and their surety, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    When the trial court entered an order reflecting Plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal, the interlocutory summary judgment order disposing of the claims against Mr. Thompson and First Bank of Oneida became a final order.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Waste Mgmt., Inc. of Tennessee v.

Ct. App. 1997) (\"A judgment adjudicating all the claims between all the parties becomes final thirty days after entry....\"). Then, when Plaintiffs did not file an appeal of the summary judgment order within 30 days of the trial court's November 13, 2013 order, they lost the right to appeal that decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tenn. R. App. P. 4(a) ( \"In an appeal as of right to the ... Court of Appeals ..., the notice of appeal ...\n    <em>\n     shall\n    </em>\n    be filed with the clerk of the appellate court within 30 days after the date of entry of the judgment appealed from....\" (emphasis added)).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    We note that the Court of Appeals incorrectly spelled Defendant Mr. Bunstine's surname. This appears to have derived from the same incorrect spelling of this party's name on certain trial court documents, including the Plaintiffs' complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    As noted above, Plaintiffs' amended complaint in the lender liability suit included a claim for \"breach of the confidential and fiduciary relationship between plaintiffs and defendants.\" In response, Defendants filed a Rule 12.03 motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the trial court granted as to the portion of Plaintiffs' amended complaint asserting a claim for breach of confidentiality and breach of fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs, however, did not raise the circuit court's order partially granting Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings in their application for permission to appeal to this Court. Therefore, we only consider the orders partially granting Defendants' motion to dismiss and granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The in-depth history of the development of the discovery rule in Tennessee has been explored more than once by the appellate courts of this State.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Wilson v.
