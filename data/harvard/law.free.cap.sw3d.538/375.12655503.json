On appeal, Mr. Roberts argues that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence testimony regarding uncharged bad acts resulting in prejudice. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
