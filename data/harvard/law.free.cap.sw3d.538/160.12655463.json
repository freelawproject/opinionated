The damage award was for injuries sustained by Roy Moss and Vaugh Anderson when Appellant struck their vehicle. In eight points of error, Appellant argues that the trial court improperly excluded evidence, improperly allowed certain expert testimony, failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and he challenges the factual sufficiency of the award. He also claims that the Texas Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Act requires we remand the case to assess certain credits and reductions allowed by the act. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying facts of this case are not complicated. Moss and Anderson were riding in the back of a company van, and at a stop light, it was struck from behind by a vehicle driven by Appellant. Moss and Anderson filed a suit for damages against Appellant, who stipulated to liability before trial. The parties agreed to waive a jury trial. The trial court awarded damages to Moss and Anderson for past and future medical expenses, past and future pain and suffering, and past and future physical impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of the collision, Moss was fifty-six years' old and Anderson was forty-eight. Moss testified that he was\n   healthy before the accident. After the accident, Moss suffered from neck pain, arm pain, lower-back pain, headaches, and had difficulty sleeping. He sought treatment from a chiropractor, Dr. Craig Himmelsehr, and an M.D., Dr. Michael Farrell. Dr. Himmelsehr testified that in his opinion Moss's injuries were caused exclusively by the collision. Moss, at the time of trial, continued to suffer discomfort after treatment and it had affected his lifestyle. Moss's wife, Belinda Brooks, corroborated Moss's testimony regarding his continuing pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Anderson testified that he was in good health before the collision. During trial, Anderson testified that he had suffered from neck pain, arm and hand pain, lower-back pain, knee pain, headaches, blurred vision, and had difficulty sleeping. Like Moss, he also sought treatment from Dr. Himmelsehr and Dr. Farrell. Dr. Himmelsehr opined that Anderson's injuries were caused exclusively by the collision. Dr. Himmelsehr also found Anderson's MRI showed disc injuries. Anderson continued to suffer discomfort after treatment and told the trial court his lifestyle has been affected by his continuing pain. Anderson's mother, Lois Anderson, corroborated Anderson's testimony regarding his continued pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During cross-examination of Moss, Appellant attempted to ask whether Moss had received any workers' compensation benefits. Moss objected to Appellant's questions regarding collateral sources, and the trial court sustained that objection. Then Appellant attempted to ask Moss if he had health insurance that would have covered his medical expenses; this drew the same objection and was sustained by the trial judge. Next, Appellant asked whether Moss had sought medical treatment before consulting an attorney. Moss objected, yet again, on the basis of relevance which was sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During cross-examination of Anderson, Appellant inquired into two personal injury claims that Anderson had filed nine and ten years before trial. The trial court allowed Anderson to testify that he had filed the claims and as to when he had last sought treatment, but then instructed Appellant to \"move along.\" Appellant also asked Anderson about his potential claim for workers' compensation benefits, which was objected to and sustained. Appellant cross-examined Anderson regarding his criminal history, which drew a relevance objection. The trial court allowed Anderson to confirm he had been arrested for possession of marijuana and cocaine, then sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Failure to File Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, a party to a bench trial is entitled to request findings of fact and conclusions of law from the district court. TEX.R.CIV.P. 296. The district court has a mandatory duty to respond to a timely request to file findings of fact and conclusions of law, and a failure to do so is error.\n   <em>\n    Cherne Indus., Inc. v.

The test to determine if an appellant has been harmed is whether, under the circumstances of the case, he must guess at the reason the trial court ruled against him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8422287\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/190/796/#p801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 801-02 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham Cent.

The policy reason in encouraging trial courts to make findings is to \"narrow the bases of judgment to only a portion of [the multiple] claims and defenses, thereby reducing the number of contentions that the appellant must raise on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Larry F. Smith, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105023\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/110/611/#p614\">\n    110 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   614 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   6 McDonald &amp; Carlson, Texas Civil Practice 2d \u00a7 18:3 (1998)). Thus, if there is only a single ground of recovery or only a single defense, the appellant does not usually have to guess at the basis of the trial court's judgment and the objective of the rule is not thwarted.\n   <em>\n    Willms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8422287\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/190/796/#p801\">\n    190 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   801-02 ;\n   <em>\n    Larry F.

He asserts he must speculate as to the basis of the trial court rulings against him because \"questions remain\" regarding how the trial court arrived at the damages award. Appellant correctly points out that the trial court's failure to make findings is error and harm is presumed, and he requests we either reverse and remand or abate and allow the trial court to make the requested findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But there was only a single ground of recovery in this case: negligence, and it was stipulated to by Appellant. He argues the lack of findings does not provide him with a basis \"for any of the other grounds of recovery,\" suggesting that the varying damage awards should be considered multiple grounds of recovery, and then points to\n   <em>\n    Tenery\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Willms\n   </em>\n   to demonstrate that this was harmful and requires the relief he requests. We find this argument unpersuasive. The ground for recovery at issue here is negligence, and the past and future medical expenses are the damages awarded for that single ground of recovery. As a result, Appellant is not placed in the position of speculating as to the basis of the trial court's judgment of negligence and Point of Error One is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Failure to Make an Offer of Proof\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our law provides, under certain conditions, that a party may claim error in a ruling by the trial court to admit or exclude evidence. Texas Rule of Evidence 103 reads in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (a) Preserving a Claim of Error. A party may claim error in a ruling to admit or exclude evidence only if the error affects a substantial right of the party and:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court of its substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (c) Court's Statement About the Ruling; Directing an Offer of Proof. The court must allow a party to make an offer of proof outside the jury's presence as soon as practicable-and before the court reads its charge to the jury. The court may make any statement about the character or form of the evidence, the objection made, and the ruling. At a party's request, the court must direct that an offer of proof be made in question-and-answer form. Or the court may do so on its own.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   TEX.R.EVID . 103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In order to preserve the issue for appellate review, whether it is the testimony of one's own witness or that of the opponent, the appellant must make an offer of proof or a bill of exception to show what the witness's testimony would have been.\n   <em>\n    In re A.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7259832\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/418/830/#p840\">\n    418 S.W.3d 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2013, no pet.) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

Appellant argued \"[workers' compensation] is something he could have done to mitigate his damages,\" and pointed out Moss and Anderson had opened the door by suggesting during direct examination that they could not pay for their medical expenses. But no offer of proof was made after the objection-no questions that would have been asked, what the responses would have been, or what was to be shown by those answers. We cannot speculate as to what may have been asked, nor may we make a harm analysis because there is a lack of evidence for us to review. Appellant asserts what he believed the evidence would have shown, but absent an offer of proof we cannot properly review these assertions. Point of Error Two is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Questions regarding Moss and Anderson's Timing in Seeking Medical Treatment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During cross-examination, Appellant asked Moss whether he had consulted an attorney before seeking medical treatment. Moss objected on relevance grounds, and the trial court sustained. Then, Appellant asked how Moss had \"found\" his chiropractor, which was also objected to by Moss and sustained. Appellant continued with his cross-examination of Moss, and never returned to the question or made an offer of proof. Because we cannot speculate about how Moss may have answered this question or what further questions Appellant would have propounded, Point of Error Three is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Anderson's Prior Convictions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellant asked Anderson if he had been convicted of a crime in the last ten years. This drew a relevance objection by Anderson, but the trial court instructed Anderson to \"go ahead and answer it.\" Anderson responded that he had been convicted of possession of marijuana and cocaine, at which point his counsel objected again and the trial court sustained. Appellant asserts further questioning would have revealed Anderson's health was questionable\n   given his alleged drug use, and that the convictions could be used to impeach Anderson's assertion that he possessed funds for drug purchases but none for medical treatment based on the nine and ten-year-old convictions. Further, no evidence was presented or elicited to substantiate Appellant's conclusions that Anderson was currently using illicit substances. No offer of proof was made, however, and these propositions were never presented to the trial judge. Even if this ruling was error, absent an offer of proof we cannot conduct a harm analysis. Point of Error Four is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Anderson's Prior Personal Injury Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Appellant questioned Anderson regarding prior personal injury claims for his spine, and Anderson objected. The trial court inquired further and Anderson confirmed that he had previously made two personal injury claims-one ten years prior and one nine years prior. The trial judge asked when Anderson had last sought treatment, and he responded that it had been at least nine years, at which point the trial judge stated \"[l]et's move along.\" Appellant did not make an offer of proof and continued on to a different line of questioning regarding payment of medical treatment in the instant case. Again, because we are not allowed to speculate and cannot conduct a harm analysis absent an offer of proof, Point of Error Six is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Abuse of Discretion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On appeal, a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    In re J.P.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8999072\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/180/570/#p575\">\n    180 S.W.3d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (Tex. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Even had Appellant properly preserved this issue for review, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. He argues Appellees opened the door by testifying that they had not sought medical treatment due to a lack of funds. Appellant cites\n   <em>\n    Kosaka,\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the testimony of an inability to pay for medical treatment allows the evidence of collateral sources to be elicited. He also cites\n   <em>\n    Macias\n   </em>\n   , and without going into much detail, asserts the court \"went through a more thorough discussion of the effects of a plaintiff opening the door\" to collateral sources when a plaintiff asserts financial difficulties prevented his seeking treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Both cases are distinguishable.

He also testified he had performed a physical examination\n   of Moss and Anderson and his opinions were based on reasonable medical probability. Based on this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in determining the reliability of Dr. Himmelsehr's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As to the Rule 194.2(f) disclosures, the clerk's record shows no pretrial objections by Appellant to Moss and Anderson's expert disclosures. The first objection by Appellant occurred during direct examination of Dr. Himmelsehr, in which Appellant complained to the trial judge that Appellees had failed to disclose the doctor's mental impressions, opinions, and a brief summary of the basis for them. Appellees' counsel read a portion of the expert disclosures into the record during the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Appellees' Counsel: And under the expert disclosure I said-'Answer: 194.2(f) for testifying expert. 2.

The next one, No. 3, is the general substance of the expert's mental impressions and opinions and a brief summary of the basis for them or the documents provided. All she cites to are the affidavits on file.

The record establishes the disclosure putting Appellant on notice regarding the subject matter of Dr. Himmelsehr's testimony and cited to affidavits containing the medical records. Rule 194.2(f) is not meant to encourage \"gotcha\" objections at trial, but to provide opposing counsel with a meaningful opportunity to prepare for cross-examination; failure to object or to notify the responding party of the inadequate disclosures before trial subjects the complaint to waiver.\n   <em>\n    Morua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11806829\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/979/616/#p620\">\n    979 S.W.2d at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This issue was not preserved for review, but even assuming proper preservation, there was no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Anderson objected to Appellant's questioning of his prior injuries, but the trial court inquired further of Anderson and learned the injuries were nine and ten years' old and his last treatment had been sought some nine years before. The trial judge instructed Appellant to \"move along\" and he did not return to his questioning about the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Appellant cites Texas Rules of Evidence 401, 402, 403, and 609 on this point of error (but no case law) and rhetorically asks whether the probative value of the prior claims was substantially outweighed by the\n   risk of undue prejudice. Appellant asserts the prior back injury was relevant to Anderson's on-going health issues. Absent from his argument is an analysis of how the trial court abused its discretion in refusing further inquiry regarding Anderson's past medical history beyond the testimony already elicited. Appellant, we note yet again, failed to make any offer of proof so we are left to speculate as to what questions may have been asked and what answers may have been elicited. It is notable Appellant did not designate any expert witness to testify about any alleged connection between Anderson's prior personal injury claims and the injuries sustained in this case. Further, Dr. Himmelsehr had already completed his testimony at this juncture. It is difficult to assess how further questioning would have aided the trial court.

Thus, the challenging party faces a high burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Appellant acknowledges an accident occurred and stipulated to his negligence in causing the accident; further, he acknowledges Anderson and Moss received medical treatment after the accident. Appellant maintains, nonetheless, that the evidence was factually insufficient to support the judgment because: (1) Dr. Himmelsehr's testimony regarding past and future medical expenses was not credible because he was unqualified and had not treated the plaintiffs in 18 months; (2) Dr. Himmelsehr's testimony was not credible because some of the damage award would go to paying his fees; (3) Appellees testimony that they would require future medical expenses was not credible because Dr. Himmelsehr testified he is willing to continue treating them even if they could not afford it; and (4) Anderson's testimony was not credible because he admitted to exaggerating his weight gain and had been convicted of a felony. Appellant also offers us a list of evidence he would have been able to provide the trial court if Appellees' objections had not been sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   After reviewing the evidence in the record, we cannot say that the trial court's determination of the damage award was so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that it was clearly wrong and unjust. Dr. Himmelsehr was admitted as an expert witness and testified that based on his education, experience, and training, he considered himself an expert in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal injuries. He also testified that he had performed a physical examination of both plaintiffs and his opinions on future impairment and medical care were based\n   on reasonable medical probability. Dr. Himmelsehr testified to what was shown on Appellees' x-rays taken after the collision. Moss's and Anderson's medical records were provided to the trial court and admitted into evidence. Both Moss and Anderson testified to being in good health before the accident, recounted in detail their physical discomforts and the treatments they received after the accident. Moss's wife and Anderson's mother also testified to their on-going pain. Although Anderson testified to a weight fluctuation which he later disavowed, this conflicting testimony was heard by the trial court and it is not clear that Anderson's claim of weight gain affected the trial court's determination regarding the damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Ultimately, we find the record does not show the trial court's decision was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence or manifestly unjust. As to Appellant's purported list of evidence he hoped to prove if the trial court had not ruled against him, it is not part of the record and no offer of proof was made. We decline to engage in speculation as to what evidence Appellant could have elicited had the trial court ruled in his favor. Point of Error Seven is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Texas Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In his final point of error, Appellant argues the Texas Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Act (\"Act\") requires that upon a defendant's insurer impairment, his potential liability to plaintiffs must be reduced by the full amounts of any applicable insurance policy of the plaintiffs. Appellant's insurer became insolvent in December 2013, six months after judgment was rendered in this case. Obviously, the issue was never presented to the trial court, and as demonstrated by our foregoing discussion, no evidence of collateral sources were elicited in the record. Still, Appellant maintains the statute's requirements should be met even though the insurer became insolvent after the judgment was rendered because to hold otherwise would frustrate the purpose of the Act. He cites no case law for this proposition but asserts either a new trial is required or a remand to the trial court to determine credits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Texas Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Act was enacted with the purpose of providing for the payment of claims against an insolvent insurer to protect members of the public from excessive delays or financial losses that would otherwise occur when an insurance company became insolvent.

TEX.INS.CODE ANN . \u00a7\u00a7 462.251, 462.252 (West 2009). But the Act does not provide for a judicial procedure in determining credits or reductions. Instead, the Act requires the receiver of the insolvent insurer to periodically submit a list of claims to the Guaranty Association. TEX.INS.CODE ANN . \u00a7 462.114 (West 2009). The Act's only mention of a judicial procedure is that appeals of the final action or orders of the Guaranty Association are to be made to the district court in Travis County. TEX.INS.CODE ANN . \u00a7 462.017 (West 2009). From a plain reading of the statute, the legislature did not provide a judicial remedy before a claimant had exhausted his administrative remedies with the Guaranty Association.
