A jury found that asbestos fibers in the workplace were a proximate cause of Carl's mesothelioma and that his death resulted from Goodyear's gross negligence. The jury assessed exemplary damages against Goodyear. After the trial court applied the statutory cap, it awarded appellees a total of $2,890,000, plus postjudgment interest and court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In three issues, Goodyear contends that (i) the evidence is legally insufficient to show gross negligence; (ii) the evidence of causation is legally insufficient because appellees failed to rule out radiation as a cause of mesothelioma ; and alternatively (iii) appellees' exemplary damages should be reduced as a result of their failure to prove the full amount of economic damages found by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We overrule Goodyear's first two issues, sustain its third issue, and suggest remittitur of part of the exemplary damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carl Rogers worked for Goodyear as a tire builder from 1974 to 2004 at a facility in Tyler, Texas. He operated a tire building machine in a room about the size of a football field. The room contained eighty-five tire building machines set up in a grid. Carl was exposed to asbestos at Goodyear, both from the tire building machines and from insulation on pipes running overhead. Carl was exposed to asbestos from the overhead insulation in two ways. Any time the insulation was removed to repair or\n   replace the pipes, a great deal of dust was released. Also, when Goodyear began asbestos abatement procedures, no steps were initially taken to enclose the dust and protect employees from it. The brake pads in the tire building machines also contained asbestos and released asbestos when they got worn down. Compressed air was used to clean brake dust out of the machines. This process created a cloud of dust, some of which was asbestos. Carl was exposed to asbestos when the brakes on his machine were replaced, when compressed air was used to fix a stuck brake valve, and when his machine was cleaned with compressed air. In addition, he experienced bystander exposure from being near other tire building machines. Neither the machines nor their instructions contained any warnings about asbestos. By the mid-1980s, Goodyear had replaced the tire building machines with machines that did not contain asbestos, and it had begun an abatement process to remove the asbestos insulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Carl was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1999. The cancer spread to his brain. Carl had surgery to remove the cancer from his lung and brain. He also had radiation therapy \"through his head\" and chemotherapy. The treatment was successful and Carl was cured. In 2008, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He died the following year at the age of sixty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellees, Carl's wife and two adult daughters, sued Goodyear, alleging its gross negligence caused Carl's mesothelioma. Among other things, appellees alleged Goodyear failed to adequately warn Carl of the dangers of asbestos and failed to adhere to industry safety standards to protect workers from harm. Goodyear is a subscriber under the workers' compensation statute. Recovery of workers' compensation benefits is the exclusive remedy of an employee for a work related death, unless the death was caused by the employer's gross negligence. TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7 408.001 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullins v. Martinez R.O.W., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189948\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/498/700/#p704\">\n    498 S.W.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (Tex.

LAB. \u00a7 408.001(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After appellees filed suit in Dallas County, the case was transferred to Harris County to the asbestos multidistrict litigation (MDL) court for pretrial proceedings and was transferred back to Dallas County for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 74.162. In the pretrial MDL court, appellees filed a motion for no-evidence summary judgment on Goodyear's \"alternative causation theory.\" In the motion, appellees asserted Goodyear's experts were of the opinion that radiation Carl received in 1999 for a brain tumor was the sole cause of his mesothelioma. Appellees argued Goodyear had no evidence showing that the dose of radiation Carl received to his brain was a substantial factor in causing the mesothelioma. Goodyear filed a response in which it asserted the dose of radiation Carl received led to a doubling of his risk of developing mesothelioma. Goodyear attached affidavits and depositions from its experts, along with other evidence. Goodyear argued its evidence created a genuine issue of material fact regarding radiation as a cause of the mesothelioma. Appellees also moved to exclude the testimony of Goodyear's experts regarding radiation treatment to the brain as a cause of mesothelioma. Goodyear filed a motion to exclude the testimony of appellees' experts in part due to their failure to exclude radiation exposure as a cause of the mesothelioma. The MDL judge denied Goodyear's motion to exclude the testimony of appellees' experts. The judge granted appellees' no-evidence motion for summary judgment and granted their motion to exclude testimony\n   from defense experts about radiation as a cause of mesothelioma. In both of the orders that were granted, the MDL judge expressly found there was no scientifically valid epidemiology to create a causal relationship between therapeutic radiation for lung cancer and mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, appellees' expert Dr. Edwin Holstein, whose specialty is occupational medicine, explained that asbestos is harmful if one inhales it. It can cause asbestosis, which is scarring of the lungs, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Lung cancer and mesothelioma are different cancers. They are distinguishable because they start in different places. Mesothelioma starts in the lining around the lung. Holstein testified that lung cancer does not turn into mesothelioma. There is no cure for mesothelioma, and the average life expectancy after diagnosis is twelve to eighteen months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellees' experts provided evidence of Carl's dose of exposure to asbestos. Holstein limited his estimate to a ten-year period, from roughly 1975 to 1985. Holstein relied on the report of Steve Hays, an industrial hygienist, to determine Carl's exposure from the insulation. Hays limited his analysis to exposure from ordinary maintenance of the insulated pipes and did not factor in exposure during the abatement process. Hays determined that Carl's asbestos exposure from the insulation was .426 fiber years per cc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Holstein analyzed Carl's asbestos exposure from the brakes on his machine and on neighboring machines. To be conservative, Holstein considered Carl's bystander exposure for only brake replacements and for only two neighboring machines, when he could have been in the middle of as many as eight machines. Holstein relied on published studies about brakes releasing asbestos into the air. As a low level estimate of Carl's actual exposure from asbestos in the machines, Holstein came up with .187 fiber years per cc. Adding this amount to Carl's exposure from insulation, Holstein arrived at a total exposure of .613 fiber years per cc. Based on this level of exposure, Holstein testified that, according to several published studies, Carl's increased risk of mesothelioma was more than double. In fact, it ranged from four times that of the general population to almost twenty-two times that of the general population. Holstein determined that Carl's occupational exposure to asbestos while working as a tire builder in the Goodyear plant was a substantial factor in the development of his mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hays also testified about Carl's approximate dose of asbestos exposure. Hays chose to analyze a nine-year period of exposure rather than ten. Hays estimated Carl's total dose of exposure at .516 fiber years per cc. Hays testified that Carl's exposure at Goodyear placed him at an increased risk for mesothelioma over the background population of between four and twenty-two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Holstein provided a history of awareness of the risks of asbestos. As far back as the 1930s, there were publications about asbestos hazards. The first epidemiological study of people exposed to asbestos found that asbestos could be a hazard in the workplace and found deaths from asbestosis. The study specifically mentioned brakes as a potential asbestos hazard. It offered methods of prevention which are still valid today, including substitution, isolation,\n   and education about the hazard. Another publication from that time period warned that if a cloud of asbestos dust, or even a hazy look in the air from dust, was visible to the eye, the asbestos was almost certainly at a level hazardous to health and life. Also, in 1935, two doctors published the first case possibly linking asbestos to cancer, rather than just asbestosis. By the 1950s there were about seventy published cases of lung cancer in people working with asbestos. In 1955, a British scientist published an epidemiological study which, in Holstein's view, showed beyond a reasonable doubt that asbestos was a cause of lung cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first published report of a person exposed to asbestos getting mesothelioma came in 1943, with two others following in 1949 and 1951. Then in 1960, scientists found thirty-three cases of mesothelioma. These people all worked in or around asbestos mines. In 1964, Dr. Irving Selikoff arranged an international conference of scientists who had been researching the health effects of asbestos. Their results showed that asbestos was a very major hazard and that asbestos in a multitude of industries would cause disease, including mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Holstein, by 1972 there were multitudes of studies demonstrating that asbestos could kill and actually cause asbestosis and cancer. In June 1972, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published standards for exposure to asbestos dust. The standards warned, \"In view of the undisputed grave consequences from exposure to asbestos fibers, it is essential that the exposure be regulated now, on the basis of the best evidence available now, even though it may not be as good as scientifically desirable. An asbestos standard can be reevaluated in the light of the results of ongoing studies, and future studies, but cannot wait for them. Lives of employees are at stake.\" The OSHA document stated that \"it appears that levels of exposure which may be safe with regard to asbestosis are not safe with regard to mesothelioma.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Holstein testified that the OSHA limits for asbestos exposure were initially designed primarily to protect people from asbestosis. OSHA lowered the level of exposure in 1976 and continued to lower it over the years. According to Holstein, Carl would have had multiple occasions during his career when he was exposed to levels of asbestos above the OSHA ceiling requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In a July 1972 letter to its plant personnel managers, Goodyear attached the June 1972 OSHA standards and included its own instructions regarding asbestos. Each facility was instructed to \"carefully survey their operations for their use of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials.\" The instructions noted that asbestos fiber inhalation has been implicated as a possible causative factor in a \"form of cancer called a mesothelioma.\" Goodyear instructed that \"[i]nitial routine air sampling shall be done\n   <em>\n    weekly\n   </em>\n   until sufficient data is obtained to assure complete coverage of all phases of the work. After the base data is complete, routine sampling shall be done\n   <em>\n    monthly\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.) Again in October of 1978, Goodyear warned its Tyler plant manager and others in writing about asbestos. The letter from Goodyear's manager of Corporate Safety and Industrial Hygiene Services stated, \"All of our plants contain asbestos insulation of one kind or another somewhere in the facility, and it is very important that the procedures that were issued [previously] are being properly enforced and followed.\" The letter further noted there continues to be \"a great deal of concern on the long-term effects of asbestos exposures even in the very low\n   levels of exposure.\" Plant managers were urged to review and follow the procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Goodyear kept track of all chemical sampling in a \"chemical hazard and toxicity\" (CHAT) report. The CHAT report showed that the total number of asbestos samples taken at the Tyler plant was thirty-six. The first samples were taken in July 1978 after a complaint was made to OSHA about asbestos in storage. A contractor removed the insulation. The CHAT report showed that Goodyear monitored three of the contractors, not its employees, for asbestos. One contractor had an exposure of 3.05 fibers per cc. In 1980, Goodyear sampled materials. In 1983, Goodyear took six samples from maintenance electricians. Over half of the total samples were taken in 1985, after asbestos abatement efforts had begun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Goodyear trained its employee Ray Jackson in industrial hygiene. Jackson, who testified for Goodyear, stated that between 1972 and 1976, he personally took samples for asbestos at the Tyler plant. There were two different types of samples, an area sample that examines particulate matter in an area and a personal sample that collects what a person breathes in. He testified he never had a sample that exceeded the OSHA limit. Although Jackson indicated he once had written documentation of his asbestos sampling, none was provided at trial. At his deposition a few weeks prior to trial, however, Jackson testified that the first time Goodyear performed any air monitoring for asbestos was in 1978 when OSHA responded to the complaint about the asbestos in storage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to Carl's coworker Martin Kennedy, workers at the Tyler plant first got information that there may be asbestos in the plant in 1983. That information concerned the insulation, not the tire machines. Signs warning about the hazards of asbestos were placed in the Tyler plant for the first time in 1984.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the conclusion of a three-week trial, the jury found by clear and convincing evidence that asbestos fibers from the Goodyear Tyler facility were a proximate cause of Carl's mesothelioma that resulted in his death. The jury also found by clear and convincing evidence that Carl's death resulted from Goodyear's gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For purposes of calculating the exemplary damages cap, the jury was asked to determine the amounts of money that would fairly and reasonably compensate each appellee for her damages from Carl's death. Specifically, the jury was asked to determine each appellee's past and future pecuniary loss, past and future loss of companionship and society, and past and future mental anguish. The jury also determined that $15 million should be assessed against Goodyear as exemplary damages and apportioned 90% of those damages to Vicki and 5% each to Natalie and Courtney. After it applied the statutory cap on punitive damages, the trial court awarded appellees a total of $2,890,000. Vicki was awarded $2,601,000, and Courtney and Natalie were each awarded $144,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Issue One: Is the gross negligence evidence legally insufficient?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In its first issue, Goodyear contends the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's gross negligence finding. Gross negligence consists of both objective and subjective elements.\n   <em>\n    U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v. Waldrip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7115482\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/380/118/#p137\">\n    380 S.W.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 (Tex. 2012). A plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) when viewed objectively from the defendant's standpoint at the time of the event, the act\n   or omission involved an extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others, and (2) the defendant had actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceeded with conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7115482\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/380/118/#p137\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 41.001(11). \"Clear and convincing\" means the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.\n   <em>\n    U-Haul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7115482\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/380/118/#p137\">\n    380 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   137 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. \u00a7 41.001(2). In reviewing the legal sufficiency of a finding that was required to be proved by clear and convincing evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have formed a firm belief or conviction that its finding was true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010090\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/164/607/#p627\">\n    164 S.W.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627 (Tex. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Objective Component\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Goodyear challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove both the objective and subjective elements of gross negligence. It first contends appellees failed to prove an extreme degree of risk. Under the objective component, \"extreme risk\" is not a remote possibility or even a high probability of minor harm, but rather the likelihood of the plaintiff's serious injury.\n   <em>\n    U-Haul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7115482\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/380/118/#p137\">\n    380 S.W.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Goodyear acknowledges mesothelioma is a serious injury, but asserts appellees did not prove the likelihood of that injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although Goodyear presented its own estimates of the dose of Carl's asbestos exposure and its experts concluded there was no extreme degree of risk, Goodyear acknowledges that in reviewing the evidence, we must credit appellees' best evidence. Goodyear frames the issue of extreme risk in terms of Carl's chance of contracting mesothelioma. A person who has not been exposed to asbestos has a one in 1,000,000 chance of contracting mesothelioma. Appellees' experts testified that Carl's exposure increased his chance of developing mesothelioma by as much as 22 times. Goodyear uses these numbers to calculate that Carl's chance of developing mesothelioma was one in about 45,000, which it asserts cannot be considered an extreme risk as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Goodyear's argument, however, focuses solely on the degree of risk or likelihood of injury. But this requirement is not viewed in a vacuum. Instead, we must look at whether Goodyear's acts and omissions created an extreme degree of risk-considering the probability and magnitude of harm. Further, statistical evidence of the probability of serious injury is not necessary to establish the objective component of gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11834867\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/968/917/#p923\">\n    968 S.W.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923-24 (Tex. 1998) (in case where contract worker died of leukemia, defendant's failure to monitor contract workers for hazards of benzene, failure to warn them, and failure to provide them with protective gear was evidence defendant's acts and omissions involved extreme degree of risk);\n   <em>\n    Zuniga v. Medina\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-14-00360-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202261767\">\n    2017 WL 2261767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Tex. App.-San Antonio May 24, 2017, no pet. h.) (mem. op.) (where driver struck pedestrian, evidence that driver's actions in speeding through school parking lot on Sunday and failing to slow down and look both ways at exit involved extreme degree of risk).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the evidence shows that Goodyear turned a blind eye to the dangers of asbestos in its Tyler facility for at least eleven years, from 1972 to 1983. In mid-1972, OSHA warned that exposure to asbestos fibers must be regulated because employees' lives were at stake and specifically mentioned mesothelioma. In response,\n   Goodyear called for routine air sampling to be done weekly until sufficient data was obtained, and after that, called for monthly sampling. But the jury could have determined that Goodyear did not do any sampling to protect its Tyler employees until 1983. Further, it did not warn its employees of the dangers of asbestos until then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Next, there is no cure for mesothelioma and patients do not live long after diagnosis. The magnitude of harm was fast and certain death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on these circumstances, the jury could have formed a firm belief that Goodyear's acts and omissions involved the likelihood of Carl's serious injury and an extreme degree of risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381142\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/92/848/#p852\">\n    92 S.W.3d 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 852 (Tex. App.-Texarkana 2002, pet. denied) (mesothelioma case in which court found legally sufficient evidence that defendant's conduct involved extreme degree of risk to workers who worked around asbestos insulation when it was torn out and reinstalled).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even if we were to engage in a statistical analysis of the probability that a Goodyear Tyler employee would get mesothelioma, there was evidence that the actual chance of getting mesothelioma from working in the Tyler plant was much higher than one in 45,000. An epidemiological study of the employees at Goodyear's Tyler plant was published in 2007. The study, which did not include Carl Rogers as it predated his diagnosis, reported three cases of mesothelioma among long term employees at the plant. The study of about 3,000 employees found an unexpected \"excess incidence of mesothelioma... among hourly white men.\" Thus, four out of about 3,000 workers in the Tyler plant were diagnosed with mesothelioma. Even if we exclude two of the four employees because they previously worked in a plant that manufactured asbestos insulation, this evidence nevertheless demonstrates a much greater chance of contracting mesothelioma at the Tyler plant than one in 45,000. Again, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude a reasonable trier of fact could have formed a firm belief that Goodyear's acts and omissions involved an extreme degree of risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Subjective Component\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, Goodyear contends appellees did not prove the subjective component of gross negligence. Specifically, Goodyear asserts appellees did not prove Goodyear was actually aware of the risk involved and proceeded with conscious indifference. To this end, Goodyear argues that, to show it was aware of the risk involved, appellees had to prove that at the time of Carl's exposure (1974-1985), Goodyear had actual knowledge that the particular dose of asbestos exposure would likely cause mesothelioma. Goodyear maintains appellees' evidence showed only a general understanding that asbestos can cause mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Under the subjective element, actual awareness means the defendant knew about the peril, but its acts or omission demonstrated that it did not care.\n   <em>\n    Boerjan v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927842\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/436/307/#p311\">\n    436 S.W.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (Tex. 2014) (per curiam). Appellees counter that Goodyear did not have to have actual knowledge that Carl's particular dose of asbestos exposure would cause mesothelioma. We agree with appellees because awareness of an extreme risk does not require proof that the defendant anticipated the precise manner in which the injury would occur or be able to identify whom the injury would befall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U-Haul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7115482\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/380/118/#p137\">\n    380 S.W.3d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And we note that since Goodyear took no steps to monitor the asbestos levels in the air at the appropriate time and thus did not know the dose of\n   any employee, knowledge that a particular dose caused mesothelioma would not have changed anything. It was sufficient to show that Goodyear knew that exposure to low levels of asbestos could cause people to develop mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The jury could have determined the communications Goodyear sent to its plants between 1972 and 1981 showed its actual knowledge that exposure to low levels of asbestos could result in mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further, in a deposition, the corporate representative for Goodyear, Joseph Holtshouser, was asked about the 1972 communication Goodyear sent out. He stated that as documented in the communication, Goodyear had actual subjective knowledge of asbestos hazards, including that it was a carcinogen and could cause lung cancer and mesothelioma. He also acknowledged that by 1972, Goodyear knew that if employees were going to be significantly exposed to asbestos, employees should be warned about that exposure and that protection should be provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Goodyear relies in part on\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

Further, the period of exposure in that case ended in 1972, described as \"a crucial year in the history of asbestos research,\" as compared with 1985 in this case, so the information available to the defendants regarding the risk cannot be compared.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215995\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/415/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215995\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/415/\">\n    at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case does not support Goodyear's argument that there is legally insufficient evidence of its actual awareness of the risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Goodyear also argues that appellees did not show that Goodyear was consciously indifferent to the knowledge of the risk posed by asbestos at its Tyler plant. Goodyear maintains that it took significant measures to reduce the hazards it knew asbestos posed and cites its industrial hygiene program. Goodyear asserts that it monitored and tested for numerous substances, including asbestos, as far back as the 1970s. It also points to the fact that it was never cited by regulatory bodies, such as OSHA, for asbestos problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But the jury could have determined that Goodyear's efforts to reduce asbestos hazards were not significant. For example, although Jackson testified at trial that he personally took samples for asbestos at the Tyler plant between 1972 and 1976, there was no written proof of his sampling. And Jackson's testimony was impeached with his deposition testimony, taken shortly before trial, that the first time Goodyear did any air monitoring was in 1978. Goodyear's CHAT report showed the total number of asbestos samples taken at the plant was thirty-six and that no samples of employees were taken until 1983. Goodyear also relies on 130 asbestos samples taken in 1984 as part of its asbestos abatement program, two of which were of tire machines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   But those samples were not taken by Goodyear, but by a contractor hired to handle the removal of the pipe insulation. Thus, nothing other than the trial testimony of Jackson, which was impeached, showed that Goodyear monitored the asbestos exposure of its employees in Tyler before 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Further, there was evidence of Goodyear's motives for not monitoring its employees. Specifically, in an August 1981 letter to plant managers and other company officers, Goodyear noted that certain concentrations of asbestos fibers in the atmosphere have been determined to be a health hazard. But it instructed plants not manufacturing \"asbestos type products\" to avoid being classified as an employer \"where asbestos fibers are released\" and thereby avoid having to implement a monitoring and medical surveillance program, citing the \"considerable expense and duration\" of such a program. And Goodyear instructed its facilities in which asbestos products were incidentally used to immediately avoid the obvious use of same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Based on the preceding three paragraphs, the jury could have found by clear and convincing evidence that Goodyear acted with conscious indifference by failing to timely monitor and sample the level of its employees' exposure, warn employees or protect them from the danger of exposure, and comply with OSHA regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Root Inc. v. Shelton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904699\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/386/#p394\">\n    446 S.W.3d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394-96 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2003, no pet.). In other words, it could have determined Goodyear knew about the risks posed by asbestos, but its acts and omissions demonstrated it did not care. Having determined that the jury could have formed a firm belief or conviction that the gross negligence finding was true, we overrule Goodyear's first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Issue Two: Is the causation evidence legally insufficient?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In its second issue, Goodyear asserts there is no evidence of causation because appellees failed to rule out the radiation treatment Carl underwent for lung cancer as a plausible alternative cause of the mesothelioma. Goodyear argues appellees had the burden to exclude other plausible causes of Carl's mesothelioma and did not do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. v.

In their post-verdict motions, Goodyear did argue there was legally insufficient evidence the exposure to asbestos at the Goodyear plant caused\n   Carl's mesothelioma. But it did not mention radiation in connection with its legal insufficiency complaint. It argued among other things that appellees' experts failed to sufficiently quantify Carl's exposure. Goodyear mentioned radiation in its motion for new trial only in connection with a complaint the court erred in excluding Goodyear's expert testimony. And Goodyear did not mention radiation during the hearing on its post-verdict motions. In addition, Goodyear moved for directed verdict on grounds appellees failed to establish causation. But again it did not mention any failure to rule out radiation. Rather, Goodyear argued appellees failed to establish Carl's dose of exposure to asbestos. The cardinal rule of error preservation is that an objection must be clear enough to give the trial court an opportunity to correct the alleged error.\n   <em>\n    Arkoma Basin Expl. Co., Inc. v.

Goodyear referred to its motion to exclude the testimony of appellees' experts, which the MDL judge denied. In the motion, Goodyear argued that appellees' expert opinions did not satisfy reliability standards because they failed to exclude other causes. But asking the MDL judge before trial to exclude appellees' experts on this basis does not absolve Goodyear of its responsibility to preserve its legal insufficiency complaint by informing the trial judge the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's verdict for this reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maya Walnut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201684679\">\n    2017 WL 1684679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (listing ways to preserve legal insufficiency points).

Appellees assert that because they met their burden to prove the asbestos was a proximate cause of mesothelioma, they were not required to rule out other potential causes of the disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bostic v.

But as we understand Goodyear's argument, it asserts that appellees' expert testimony is legally insufficient to support the verdict. Although Goodyear does not bring an issue directly challenging the MDL judge's failure to exclude the testimony of appellees' experts, it complains their experts' opinions about causation are speculative and conclusory because they did not rule out radiation and do not constitute legally sufficient evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Goodyear has not challenged the summary judgment ruling in this appeal and did not mention it in its opening brief. In its reply brief, Goodyear urges that the summary judgment is unrelated to the sufficiency of the evidence. But we do not see how Goodyear can claim the evidence is insufficient because appellees failed to rule out radiation as a cause when it has not challenged the MDL's judge's determination that there was no causal connection between the radiation and mesothelioma in this case. This ruling effectively determined that the radiation was not a plausible alternative cause of mesothelioma in this case. Under the facts of this case, we cannot conclude the evidence of causation is legally insufficient for reasons put forth by Goodyear. We overrule Goodyear's second issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Issue Three: Did the trial court err in applying the exemplary damages cap?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In its third issue, Goodyear contends the evidence is legally or factually insufficient to support the jury's determination of appellees' pecuniary losses and therefore the exemplary damages awarded in the judgment must be recalculated and reduced from $2,890,000 to $1,150,000. For the following reasons, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Pertinent Jury Findings and the Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The jury found in response to question three that (i) appellees collectively suffered $900,000 in past and future \"pecuniary loss\" (consisting of $600,000 for Carl's wife and $150,000 for each of his two daughters), and (ii) appellees collectively suffered $2,700,000 in past and future noneconomic damages (specifically mental anguish and loss of companionship and society). But the trial court could not award any of these sums as compensatory damages because this is a workers compensation subscriber gross negligence case in which compensatory damages are statutorily precluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

Therefore, an award of damages that will compensate appellees for their injuries resulting from Carl's death is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   However, the jury also found that appellees should be awarded $15,000,000 in exemplary damages. Accordingly, the trial court had to apply the civil practice and remedies code \u00a7 41.008(b)(1) exemplary damages cap to calculate a judgment amount. The trial court accepted the jury's pecuniary loss findings as equivalent to \"economic damages\" in the course of assessing a total of $2,890,000 in exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Resolving Goodyear's third issue requires us to first construe the exemplary damages cap statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Thus, an actual pecuniary loss would be an existing in fact, real loss of money or something having monetary value. And an actual economic loss is an existing in fact, real monetary loss such as lost wages, lost profits, or the like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   It follows then from these words' similar plain meanings and their juxtaposition in the definition of \"economic damages,\" that the phrase \"actual economic or pecuniary loss[es]\" means those types of losses that are supported by evidence of an existing in fact, real monetary loss like lost wages, lost profits, or the increased expenditures associated with obtaining replacement or new services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319877\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/340/432/#p441\">\n    340 S.W.3d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similar terms are to be interpreted in a similar manner);\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802377\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/488/294/#p297\">\n    488 S.W.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]hen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or verbs in a series, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies to the entire series\"). Stated differently, by using the phrase \"actual economic or pecuniary loss\" to describe the nature and extent of the available losses useable in the cap calculation's economic damages prong, the legislature emphasized that amounts must be based on evidence of existing in fact, real lost economic value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Based on the preceding four paragraphs alone, the ultimate question here is, \"What\n   sum of money is the evidence legally or factually sufficient to show that these particular appellees actually lost in fact due to no longer receiving Carl's care, maintenance, support, advice, counsel and reasonable monetary contributions (gifts)?\" For example, assuming Carl had been an accountant who did their tax returns for free, how much would they have to pay to replace that free service? Or, as was shown here, how much will the wife have to pay for household services that Carl previously provided for free? Those are examples of actual economic or pecuniary losses that would be includable under the cap's economic damages prong if there was evidence supporting them. On the other hand, although Carl's practical advice to his family had some unquantified, inherent value to them, losing such advice in the future would not be an actual economic or pecuniary loss to appellees if there is no evidence of an associated monetary impact on them to replace that advice and counsel. These examples illustrate the difference between (i) the undifferentiated, non-monetized \"pecuniary losses\" the jury found in response to question three and (ii) the types of actual economic and pecuniary losses that the legislature made includable when determining the economic damages prong in \u00a7 41.008(1)(b)(A).

(1) Time losses. The plaintiff can recover loss or [sic] wages or the value of any lost time or earning capacity where injuries prevent work. (2) Expenses incurred by reason of the injury.

App.-Waco 1989, writ denied). Based on these authorities, appellees urge that their pecuniary loss evidence is legally sufficient here because services \"such as nurture, care, education, and guidance, have a monetary value in addition to any financial contribution[,]\" and that the measurement of pecuniary losses \"is an inherently speculative and imprecise undertaking\" that \"is best left to the jury's common sense and sound discretion [.]\" Although those or similar statements appear in one or more of appellees' cases, none of those cases involved the exemplary damages cap statutes that we face in the present case. This distinction is important for several reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   One, the issue in each of those cases was the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support pecuniary losses for compensatory damages awards. But compensatory damages are not at issue here. We are not compensating appellees for their non-exemplary damage losses. Instead, the question is to what degree should Goodyear be punished for its gross negligence. The legislature has spoken on that topic by placing limits on the amounts by which that punishment may be assessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Two, as discussed in Part II.C.4 above, the legislature limited the degree of exemplary damages punishment by defining \"economic damages\" for cap calculation purposes by using the phrase \"actual economic or pecuniary loss\" to require proof of actual (existing and real) monetary losses. That type of limiting language does not appear in any of appellees' cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Three, both\n   <em>\n    Christus\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Samco\n   </em>\n   had extensive expert testimony quantifying the plaintiffs' pecuniary losses and the issues were whether there was legally sufficient evidence supporting the jury's answers given purported defects in that evidence. But, as discussed in Part II.C.9 below, there was no such expert testimony in the present case, and there was no evidence attempting to quantify the financial impact that the adult daughters incurred due to their father's death. Likewise, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   discussed in Part II.C.7 above, the only evidence quantifying the financial impact that the wife incurred due to her husband's death was of a limited amount ($30,000) nowhere near the amount the jury awarded ($600,000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Four, although in\n   <em>\n    John Deere\n   </em>\n   no witness placed a specific monetary value on the deceased father's personal services to his surviving minor daughter, the court found legally and factually sufficient evidence of her pecuniary losses for compensatory damages purposes because there was evidence that the father had been providing parental services and contributing financial support to his minor daughter. Whereas here, the daughters were adults living on their own, and there was at best limited evidence of Carl's economic contribution to his wife. To the extent\n   <em>\n    John Deere\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   conflict,\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   is the more persuasive\n   authority given the present case's facts and the statutory language we must apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that appellees' cases do not indicate that there is legally sufficient evidence supporting the actual economic or pecuniary losses that would be required to uphold the trial court's exemplary damages cap calculation in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Application of the Law to the Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Here, Goodyear complains that the trial court erred by including in the two times economic damages prong amounts the jury found as pecuniary losses for which there is legally insufficient evidence supporting those sums as actual monetary losses. Specifically, Goodyear argues that there is no evidence of any actual monetary loss either daughter associated with losing their father. Goodyear similarly argues that the wife's evidence of lost monetary value was at most $30,000. Thus, according to Goodyear, $30,000 was the maximum amount of pecuniary losses includable in the cap formula's two times economic damages prong. Accordingly, Goodyear asserts that the punitive damages must be reduced and recalculated to be $400,000 (consisting of $170,000 in undisputed economic losses consisting of medical expenses plus $30,000 as the maximum pecuniary losses for the wife-times two) plus the $750,000 cap to \u00a7 41.001(12) noneconomic losses the jury found for a total sum of $1,150,000. We agree with Goodyear for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   One, there is no evidence that either daughter suffered any actual economic damages, as the legislature defined that term in \u00a7 41.001(4) due to no longer being able to receive her father's advice and counsel or otherwise. There was no expert testimony regarding the daughters' pecuniary losses, and there was no evidence attempting to quantify the financial impact on the daughters due to their father's death. In the event of a retrial, it will be taken as established as a matter of law that Carl's death did not cause the daughters any past or future actual pecuniary losses within the meaning of \u00a7 41.001(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Two, similarly, there is legally insufficient evidence that the wife suffered any actual pecuniary losses beyond the $30,000 Goodyear refers to. We quote Vicki's testimony at length to show that the testimony supported only a limited amount of actual pecuniary losses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Well, he was a handyman too.

I pay-every time it's mowed I pay-it kind of depends on what needs to be done.

I've gotten some estimates and I brought home samples, but that's as far as I've gotten.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   Q.

She testified that she paid $55 per week for those services when they were needed. Goodyear argues that, assuming yard services are needed during the spring and summer, the annual cost of yard work would be $1,500 ($55 times roughly 27 weeks). This works out to $7,500 in past economic damages and, assuming Carl would have performed those service for another 15 years, $22,500 in future economic damages (not reduced to present value).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Just as the evidence of the son's household services and contributions in\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   was not legally sufficient evidence that one year of those services was worth $150,000, so too Vicki's testimony about other services Carl might have provided in the form of future painting, car repairs, and window replacement-especially given his back injuries that led to his 2004 disability retirement and his brother's significant involvement in those types of activities-was too vague and speculative to be evidence of $600,000 in actual pecuniary losses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n    223 S.W.3d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Her testimony would not, under\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   , be legally sufficient to support an award of such compensatory pecuniary damages, let alone be legally sufficient under the more exacting exemplary damages cap standard the legislature implemented by adding the word \"actual\" to \u00a7 41.001(4) to accentuate the required economic or pecuniary losses in that context. We therefore conclude that the evidence is legally insufficient to support a finding that Vicki suffered more than $30,000 in past and future economic damages, above and beyond the $170,000 of medical expenses the parties stipulated to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Because there is legally insufficient evidence supporting more than $200,000 in economic damages to be included in the cap calculation, we need not reach Goodyear's factual insufficiency argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Applying the \u00a7 41.008(b) cap yields a maximum exemplary damages recovery of $1,150,000, that being the sum of (i) two times appellees' economic damages and (ii) $750,000 (the statutory maximum for exemplary damages based on noneconomic damages). Accordingly, we suggest remittitur of $1,740,000 of the $2,890,000 exemplary damages awarded in the trial court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The jurors were entitled to use their knowledge and experience to estimate the value of his services without proof of their value or proof appellees were or would be out a specific sum of money due to the loss of those services.

She would have loved to hear his childcare advice, as well as advice on fixing things around the house, buying cars, and bad days at work. She testified that her father was smart with money. He advised her on saving money. On cross-examination, counsel for Goodyear asked if she had any actual monetary loss related to the loss of advice or counsel from her father. She testified that \"those things are priceless.\" When asked if she had any \"hard numbers or actual financial loss,\" she stated she did not know how to answer that question. She had not hired anyone to replace the advice she received from her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Natalie, Carl's older daughter, was thirty-eight at the time of trial. She lived in Tyler and worked for a title company. Natalie gave examples of times she sought advice and counsel from her father. When she got her first full-time job, he advised her about insurance and investing in a 401k. Just before his death, he had talked over the benefits of a new job with her and advised her to take the job. Shortly after her father's death, she stopped renting a place to live and purchased a house. Natalie wished she had the opportunity to talk to her father about the purchase. She testified that he \"knew so much about everything.\" On cross-examination, Goodyear's attorney asked Natalie if she incurred any expenses due to the loss of advice or counsel\n   from her father when she purchased her home. Natalie testified that she did not know \"how you put a price on anything we lost from him.\" When asked if she had to pay someone to give her advice and counsel about her home purchase, Natalie said she did not hire anyone. She also testified she could not put a number on expenses or losses due to the loss of employment advice or financial advice her father used to give her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Even though Carl's daughters could not specify the amount of their economic loss, the jurors were entitled to estimate the value of Carl's services based on their knowledge and experience. There was evidence Carl provided his daughters with life advice on a variety of topics. The jury had significant discretion to determine this element of damages. I would defer to the jury's determination that each daughter had past pecuniary loss of $50,000 and future pecuniary loss of $100,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 637-39 (upholding jury's award to adult daughters for pecuniary losses resulting from father's death).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Turning to Vicki Rogers's economic damages, Goodyear acknowledges that Vicki had some economic loss, but only because she can specify the amount of money she spent to hire someone to do the yard work Carl used to do. The majority agrees, limiting Vicki's pecuniary loss to the value of the yard work and $170,000 in undisputed medical expenses. But the evidence showed Vicki lost much more in the way of Carl's care, maintenance, support, advice, and counsel than just the loss of someone to do the yard work. She testified about their long relationship and marriage. When asked about the times she sought Carl's advice and counsel, Vicki testified that Carl was a handyman. He liked to fix things and build things. If something needed to be fixed around the house, like an appliance, he would fix it. If the house needed painting, Carl would paint it. He put up wallpaper and wood paneling. He might have changed the brakes on her car once or twice. He always did the yard work and now Vicki paid $50-$60 every time she needed yard work done. She also needed a lot done around the house. For example, the house needed new paint and new floors, but she had not done any of it. Carl would have been able to help out with some of the work. She had gotten an estimate of $6,000 for new windows. Carl would have probably tried to replace them himself. In addition, Vicki testified that she has had a hard time making decisions because Carl was \"really great help with that.\" She and Carl talked about how to spend their money; they did not buy anything unless they \"thoroughly talked it over.\" Vicki's loss of Carl's care, maintenance, support, advice, and counsel is considered a pecuniary loss. Her pecuniary loss was not just in the loss of someone to do household maintenance and chores, but also included the value of her husband's advice and counsel about life's decisions. Again, the jurors were entitled to apply their knowledge and experience to estimate the monetary value of his services without proof of their value. The jury awarded Vicki a total of $600,000 for past and future pecuniary loss. I would defer to the jury's determination regarding the amount of Vicki's pecuniary loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 638-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The majority relies on language in the supreme court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management of Texas, Inc. v.

I do not think\n   <em>\n    Waste Management\n   </em>\n   compels a conclusion in this wrongful-death case that the damages awarded to appellees for loss of Carl's advice and counsel were noneconomic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The majority also relies on the Amarillo Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Excel Corporation v.

App.-Amarillo 2006, pet. denied). It is factually distinguishable. The case involved the wrongful death of a nineteen-year-old college student who lived with his mother.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n    at 507-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The son had a part-time job while attending school, made some financial contributions to his mother, and also performed domestic tasks. There was a one-year period between the son's death and the jury verdict. The jury determined the mother's past pecuniary loss was $150,000. The defendant asserted the evidence was legally insufficient to support that finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court agreed there was evidence of some pecuniary loss, but it reversed the judgment and remanded for new trial because no reasonable view of the evidence supported placing a value of $150,000 on the young son's services to his mother in that one year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   By contrast, this case involves the wrongful death of a sixty-year-old man and the pecuniary loss to his wife and adult daughters for the twenty years he was expected to live had he not contracted mesothelioma. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   , the Amarillo court did not discuss the mother's loss of her son's advice and counsel, presumably because there was no evidence of that type of pecuniary loss. Consideration of the mother's pecuniary loss was limited to financial contributions and household chores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   In addition to the factual differences between this case and\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   , I do not read\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   as the majority does to require evidence of actual quantifiable monetary loss. The court considered the amount of the son's calculable financial contributions to his mother ($15,000 per year), but also considered the value of his household services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n    at 509-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the court of appeals stated, \"[N]o evidence supports the jury's finding that [the mother] suffered direct economic losses in the past of $150,000,\" it also recognized that the son's household services had a pecuniary value and that jurors could apply their knowledge and experience to estimate the value of those services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It noted that nothing showed the nature or value of his services was out of the ordinary and no reasonable view of the evidence about those services supported \"an\n   <em>\n    estimated\n   </em>\n   value even approaching $150,000 for the period before the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312185\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/506/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In my view, the court reversed not because there was no evidence of actual monetary loss in the amount of $150,000, but because the evidence did not show the value of an ordinary nineteen-year-old's household services for a period of one year was anything close to $150,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Here, there were about five years between Carl's death and the jury's verdict. The jury determined that each daughter had past pecuniary loss of $50,000. This\n   number amounts to $10,000 per year per daughter. The jury determined that each daughter had future pecuniary loss of $100,000. Dividing this number by the fifteen years Carl would have been expected to live after the verdict, the jury's determination amounts to about $6,700 per daughter for each year of lost advice and counsel in the future. The jury determined that Vicki's past pecuniary loss was $200,000. This number amounts to $40,000 per year in past pecuniary loss. The jury determined that Vicki's future pecuniary loss was $400,000. This number amounts to about $26,700 for each year in the future in which she lost the care, maintenance, support, advice, and counsel of her husband. Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict as we are required to do, the numbers are not so big as to be beyond what the jury could reasonably have estimated the value of those services to be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Keller v.

PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 41.001(5). But the jury charge in this case did not contain the phrase \"actual economic or pecuniary loss\" either. At the charge conference, Goodyear asked that the following language be added to the definition of pecuniary loss: \"damages for pecuniary loss require certainty of actual monetary loss.\" The court denied the request, and Goodyear has not challenged that ruling on appeal. We measure the sufficiency of the evidence against the jury charge given.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sw. Energy Prod. Co. v.

The charge in no way limited the jury to awarding only actual out-of-pocket economic losses. The jury was asked to determine the amount of appellees' \"pecuniary loss,\" which was defined as \"the loss of care, maintenance, support, advice, counsel, and reasonable contributions of a pecuniary (monetary) value.\" These pecuniary losses are not subject to precise mathematical calculation, but I agree with appellees that \"the inherent uncertainty in measuring these losses does not make them 'non-economic in nature.' \" Nor does this inherent uncertainty mean the loss is not an actual pecuniary loss. I would uphold the jury's determination of pecuniary loss in this case and conclude the trial court correctly applied the cap on exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   I would affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Opinion by Justice Whitehill\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   In our opinion dated August 31, 2017, we suggested remittitur of $1,740,000 of the exemplary damages awarded to appellees Vicki Lynn Rogers, Natalie Rogers, and Courtney Dugat.
