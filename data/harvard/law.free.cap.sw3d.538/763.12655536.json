Fisk's First Trial and Sentencing Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A Bexar County jury returned a guilty verdict against Fisk for multiple counts of indecency with a child by contact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 21.11. Pursuant to Fisk's pretrial election, the case proceeded to punishment before the trial court. Section 22.011 is one of the statutory provisions enumerated under subsection (A) of Penal Code 12.42.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.42(c)(2)(A). Several months before trial, the State filed a notice of intent to use prior court-martial convictions for punishment enhancement purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the punishment hearing, the trial court admitted into evidence Fisk's 1990 court-martial convictions, charged under earlier versions of two Articles of the UCMJ. The first was Article 125 of the former UCMJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.C. \u00a7 925(a) (1982).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant provisions of Article 125 generally prohibited sodomy, which included bestiality and certain consensual sex acts between adults, but also contained enhancements for forcible sodomy and sodomy with a child under the age of sixteen years. The second Article, under which Fisk had several prior convictions, was Article 134 of the former UCMJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 934 (1982). The relevant provisions of Article 134 prohibited \"[i]ndecent acts or liberties with a child\" under the age of sixteen years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court found the elements of Article 134's prohibition of indecent acts and liberties with a child were substantially similar to the elements of one of the Texas offenses enumerated in Subsection (B) of Texas Penal Code section 12.42(c)(2), specifically indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code section 21.11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 12.42(c)(2)(A)(i), 21.11(a)(1). Concluding the State's evidence relating to Fisk's prior Article 134 court-martial conviction satisfied subsections (A) and (B), the trial court imposed three statutorily mandated life sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.42(c)(2)(1). Importantly, the State did not ask for a finding, and the\n   trial court did not consider, whether the elements of sodomy under Article 125 were substantially similar to one of the offenses enumerated in section 12.42(c)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.42(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, Fisk argued the elements of indecent acts and liberties with a child under Article 134 were not substantially similar to the elements of indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code section 21.11.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL , UNITED STATES pt.

Second Punishment Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the resentencing hearing, the State argued Fisk's sodomy conviction under Article 125, irrespective of Article 134, required mandatory life sentences under section 12.42(c)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 12.42(c)(2). The trial court agreed with the State and made findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court concluded the elements of sodomy under the former version of UCMJ Article 125 were substantially similar to sexual assault under section 22.011 of the Texas Penal Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.011. Under Texas Penal Code section 12.42(c)(2), the trial court again imposed a life sentence for each of Fisk's convictions for indecency with a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his second appeal, Fisk argues (1) the evidence is insufficient to prove that he is the same individual convicted under the name \"Walter Loyal Fisk\" in the 1990 court-martial proceedings, and (2) the trial court erred in finding the elements of his sodomy conviction under the former version of Article 125 are substantially similar to sexual assault pursuant to Texas Penal Code section 22.011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We turn first to Fisk's argument that the State failed to prove he was the same individual previously court-martialed under the name \"Walter Loyal Fisk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    PRIOR CONVICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The most obvious of which is that Article 125 prohibits the unnatural carnal copulation with an animal; section 22.011 does not address such conduct. Even assuming this court restricts Article 125 to the facts as plead in the charging instrument-a child under the age of sixteen years, the differences are still significant. Article 125 prohibits certain forms of consensual sex between adults; section 22.011 does not. Article 125 requires penetration, however slight, but specifically excludes genital-to-genital penetration from its purview. Section 22.011 expressly includes sexual contact, as well as genital-to-genital penetration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prudholm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321147\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/333/590/\">\n    333 S.W.3d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding it relevant that the other state's law \"specifically excludes\" other serious sexual conduct that the Texas statute includes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, although the difference in the victim's age alone is not dispositive, we conclude the statutes criminalize distinctively different conduct and that the State failed to establish that the elements of Article 125 of the former UCMJ and the elements of section 22.011 of the Texas Penal Code share a high degree of likeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    2.

After considering each of the factors, we conclude the elements of\n   the two statutes, the former Article 125 of the UCMJ and section 22.011 of the Texas Penal Code, are not substantially similar. While the punishments are extremely similar, the elements and the interests protected by the two statutes are not. Article 125 was designed to protect against a certain type of sexual activity-penetration of the mouth or anus by the sexual organ of another-regardless of whether that activity was between consenting adults, between adults and children, or between persons and animals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MCM,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pt. IV, \u00b6 51(a), (c). Section 22.011 sets out protections against nonconsensual contact or penetration of the mouth, anus, or sexual organ of an adult or any sexual acts against children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We, therefore, conclude the trial court erred in finding that Fisk's prior sodomy court-martial convictions under Article 125 were substantially similar to sexual assault pursuant to Texas Penal Code section 22.011.
