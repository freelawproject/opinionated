Under the version of \u00a7 570.030, RSMo applicable at the time of Habeas Petititioner's conviction, stealing was generally classified as a class A misdemeanor. However, Habeas Petitioner's stealing offense was enhanced to a class C felony, because his offense involved property valued at more than $500, which was understood to subject the offense to enhancement under \u00a7 570.030.3(1), RSMo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The circuit court granted relief to the Habeas Petitioner, vacating Petitioner's felony conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State thereafter filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court on June 5, 2017, seeking our review of the circuit court's decision. We issued a preliminary writ of certiorari on June 6, 2017 and then stayed further proceedings pending the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in similar cases involving the availability of habeas relief under\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A writ of certiorari is \"available to correct [habeas] judgments that are in excess or an abuse of jurisdiction, and that are not otherwise reviewable by appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
