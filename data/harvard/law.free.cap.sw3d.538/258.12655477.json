At the guilty-plea hearing, Osburn was advised by the court that he was pleading guilty to kidnapping and second-degree murder in exchange for an aggregate sentence of forty years' imprisonment. Osburn said that he understood the plea and that the total maximum statutory penalty for these crimes was life imprisonment. He testified that he further understood the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty. He stated that he had seen, signed, and understood his plea statement that confirmed the State's sentencing recommendation of forty years' imprisonment. Osburn testified that he reviewed the plea statement with his attorney. He confirmed there were no forces, threats, or promises used to get him to enter his guilty plea. When asked what his plea was, Osburn stated that he was \"pleading guilty to it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Osburn's plea statement also clearly sets forth that he could receive a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In his plea statement, Osburn answered yes when asked if he understood the minimum and maximum possible sentences for his offenses; that he was waiving his right to a trial by jury and to an appeal; that his plea had not been induced by any force, threat,\n   or promise, apart from the plea agreement; that the court was not required to carry out any understanding between Osburn, his attorney, and the prosecutor and that power of sentencing was with the court only; that no one had made him any promises regarding parole eligibility, meritorious good time earned, early release, or anything of that nature in order to get him to enter the plea; and that if his case went to trial, the State could meet its burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The sentence recommendation attached to the plea statement reflects that the State recommended forty years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on the transcript of the guilty-plea hearing, the plea statement, and the sentence recommendation, we hold that the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that Osburn's guilty plea was intelligently and voluntarily entered. On several occasions he stated that he was pleading guilty to the reduced charge of second-degree murder and to kidnapping. He stated that he understood the sentence recommendation of forty years. He confirmed that he signed the plea statement and reviewed it with his attorney before signing it. He stated that he was not forced or threatened to enter into the plea agreement. This evidence demonstrates that Osburn agreed to the exact sentence that he received. There was no evidence at the guilty-plea hearing or in the plea statement that Osburn would have to serve only seven years of the thirty-year sentence for the second-degree-murder conviction. Osburn testified at the Rule 37 hearing that he did not have anything in writing to support his claim that Wyatt said he would have to serve only seven years for the second-degree- murder conviction. Wyatt was not at the Rule 37 hearing, and Osburn admitted that he did not subpoena Wyatt. And while Osburn testified at the Rule 37 hearing that he did not plead guilty but accepted the guilty plea \"because of my family,\" this is contrary to his testimony at the guilty-plea hearing, wherein he, on more than one occasion, pled guilty to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moreover, we must keep in mind the alternative that Osburn was facing had he not pled guilty-retrial for the capital murder and kidnapping of Casey Crowder. Capital murder is punishable by death or life imprisonment without parole.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-10-101\">\n    Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(i), (ii) (Supp. 2017). Osburn's plea that provided the possibility of eventual release is further evidence that he made an intelligent and voluntary choice given this alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that the circuit court's finding that Osburn's guilty plea was intelligently and voluntarily given after being fully advised of his rights was not clearly against the preponderance of the evidence. We further hold that Osburn failed to establish prejudice and prove that he was deprived of a fair trial due to ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his guilty plea. We affirm on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his Rule 37 petition, Osburn also alleged that Wyatt failed to challenge the validity of the statements of Steve Moore and Danny Cromeans that Osburn claims Wyatt used to threaten him with the death penalty and coerce him to plead guilty. Osburn also alleged that his counsel refused to allow Osburn to read the statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The only evidence presented at the Rule 37 hearing on this issue was Osburn's testimony that \"Wyatt threatened me with the death penalty on inmate statements from Louisiana\" that were allegedly inculpatory. Based on this evidence, the circuit court ruled that Osburn failed to meet his burden of proving that Wyatt's conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness on this issue. Specifically, the circuit court expressed that it knew of no way for\n   counsel to have challenged the statements of the inmates without a trial and that counsel must have shared the statements with Osburn because he was aware of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We hold that the record fails to demonstrate that the circuit court clearly erred in finding that Wyatt's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness on this point. The statements of which Osburn complains were not introduced into evidence. The contents of the statements were not introduced either. Again, Wyatt was not at the Rule 37 hearing because Osburn admittedly did not subpoena him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The only evidence presented on this issue was Osburn's conclusory accusation that Wyatt used the statements to threaten him with the death penalty. Conclusory statements that counsel was ineffective cannot be the basis for postconviction relief.\n   <em>\n    Mancia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874390\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/259/\">\n    2015 Ark. 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874390\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/259/\">\n    459 S.W.3d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, nothing in the transcript of the plea hearing demonstrates that Osburn felt threatened or forced by his counsel, or any other party, to plead guilty. To the contrary, both the transcript of the guilty-plea hearing and Osburn's acknowledged and signed plea statement confirm that he was not threatened or forced into pleading guilty. Therefore, we hold that Osburn has failed to meet the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard, and we affirm the circuit court on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, Osburn alleged in his Rule 37 petition that Wyatt failed to \"push [the] speedy trial issue\" and worked with the State to secure multiple continuances. At the Rule 37 hearing, Osburn testified that his case was continued because the prosecutor did not want to go to trial. Osburn also stated that \"Wyatt told me the continuance was for one thing; [the circuit court] told me it was for another.\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Osburn's Rule 37 petition also alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective because he refused to provide discovery or to permit Osburn to inspect discovery; refused to resign after Osburn submitted a conflict-of-interest issue to the Office of Professional Conduct; failed to sever charges; failed to interview witnesses; failed to file a motion to suppress; failed to object to inadmissible testimony; and failed to prepare him for trial. Of these seven allegations, Osburn presented evidence at the Rule 37 hearing on only one of them-the conflict-of-interest issue. Significantly, the circuit court did not rule on any of these seven issues; therefore, they are not preserved for appeal.\n    <em>\n     Smith v.

State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1935131\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/312/528/#p532\">\n     312 Ark. 528\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 532,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1935131\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/312/528/#p532\">\n     851 S.W.2d 422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 424 (1993).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The record reflects that the time period from March 1, 2010, to October 24, 2010-a total of 237 days-is included in the speedy-trial period. However, the record further reflects that the time from October 25, 2010, to August 7, 2014, was excluded from the speedy-trial calculation. Orders were entered granting defense-requested continuances and excluding the following time periods: October 25, 2010, to February 3, 2011; February 3, 2011, to December 2, 2011; December 2, 2011, to September 19, 2012; September 19, 2012, to April 9, 2013; April 9, 2013, to August 22, 2013; and August 22, 2013, to August 7, 2014.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Continuances requested by a defendant or his counsel are excluded from speedy-trial calculation. Ark. R. Crim. P. 28.3(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    When Osburn pled guilty on June 18, 2014, only 237 days since the mandate had been applied to the speedy-trial period, and he was well within the 365-day speedy-trial time required by the rule. The rest of the time is attributable to requests for continuances by the defense, and orders were entered excluding that time from the speedy-trial calculation. Therefore, if Wyatt had moved for a dismissal, the circuit court would have used the above calculations and found that no speedy-trial violation occurred. Because a motion to dismiss would have been denied, Osburn has failed to show that Wyatt's conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in not moving to dismiss on this basis. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's denial of relief on this point.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In sum, we hold that the circuit court's decision is affirmed. Osburn is entitled to no postconviction relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Abramson and Hixson, JJ., agree.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     In the instant case, the circuit court found that the mandate was issued on September 14, 2009; however, that mandate was recalled.

For example, the defense's motion to prohibit the death penalty on retrial for capital murder was filed on September 23, 2010, and was denied by the circuit court on January 4, 2011. The defense appealed the issue to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which affirmed on October 6, 2011.\n     <em>\n      Osburn v.
