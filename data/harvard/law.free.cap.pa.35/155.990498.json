J. \u2014 This is a foreign attachment levied on real estate. The court, under <em>\\ </em>66 of the Act of 13th June 1836, having ordered a writ to issue to the sheriff to collect the rent of the premises, application is now made to vacate that order, on the ground, that the tenant in possession does not hold under the defendant in the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In providing for the proper mode of serving the writ, (S 49 requires the sheriff \u201c to leave a copy of the writ with the tenant, or other person in actual possession, <em>holding under the defendant </em>in the attachment, and to summon him as garnishee,\u201d Where there is no such person in possession, publication is required. It is evidently the duty of the sheriff to make return of the mode in which the writ has been served. In the return, in the case before us, the sheriff does not state that the tenant in possession holds under the defendant. It is only such a tenant that the act recognises as <em>garnishee; </em>the tenant spoken of in <em>\u00a7 </em>66, is evidently the tenant spoken of in <em>\u00a7 49. The </em>return to the writ, therefore, is defective, in not stating a material fact, and the proceeding irregular. ' Hule absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\"><em>Brightly, </em>in support of the rule. <em>H. M. Phillips, conird.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b156-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A4l\">In so severe a proceeding as a foreign attachment, we cannot doubt that the prescribed form of serving the writ, in order to attach real estate, must be strictly pursued. The law allows it to be served on a tenant in possession, \u201c holding under the defendantand we are very clear that where the defendant inherits the land subject to a curtesy estate, the tenant by the-curtesy does not hold under him in any proper sense. The service on him was therefore improper, and was rightly quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
