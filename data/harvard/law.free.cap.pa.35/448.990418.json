Mason and Charles E. Robinson, trading as Mason &amp; Robinson, against Paul Graff and Frederick Fairlamb, trading as Graff &amp; Fail-lamb, on a draft for $100, drawn on the defendants by Bernard McClain, on the 13th December 1858, at three months after date, and accepted by the defendants, \u201cpayable when in funds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">At the time the draft was given, Bernard McClain, the drawer, purchased from the defendants a bill of goods amounting to $160, and deposited with them as security Andrew G. Curtin\u2019s note for $200, dated the 8th December 1858, and payable three months after date. At the same time, McClain requested the defendants to accept the draft in question in favour of the plaintiffs, but the defendants declined doing so, unless he would give them additional security; he then promised to send them $60 as soon as possible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\">On the trial, the court below, under exception by the plaintiffs, admitted evidence of the transaction between McClain and the defendants, and to prove that at the time of the acceptance, the defendants informed the plaintiffs that \u201cpayable when in funds\u201d meant that when $60 in addition to Curtin\u2019s note was paid to them, the draft of $100 in favour of the plaintiffs would be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-11\">The court below (Sharswood, P. J.) instructed the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-12\">\u201cIt appears, if you believe the testimony of Mr. Sappington, that McClain purchased a bill of goods of $160 of defendants; and defendants declined selling without security, and that this note of Curtin\u2019s for $200 was offered. If that is so, if that note of $200 was given to defendants as security for their bill of $160, it did not make any difference whether the bill was due or not, the defendants had a right to deduct the full amount of their bill from that note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-13\">\u201c If the jury believe that, at the time the defendants accepted the note, they informed the plaintiffs\u2019 messenger that \u2018 payable when in funds\u2019 meant that when Curtin\u2019s note was paid and sixty dollars additional, the draft would be paid, plaintiffs ought not to recover more than the $40, the balance remaining after defendants\u2019 bill of $160 was deducted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u201c If, however, the jury believe that at the time of the acceptance of the draft, the plaintiffs\u2019 messenger was told that the draft would be paid when Curtin\u2019s note was paid, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the full amount of his claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">To this charge the plaintiffs excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered in their favour for $41.94, they removed the cause to this court, and here assigned for error: 1. The admission of the evidence excepted to on the trial: 2. The charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-7\"><em>Burton, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0F\">The parol evidence ought not to have been admitted to vary the terms of the written acceptance : Hunter <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 1 <em>Strob. </em>273; Hall <em>v. </em>Marston, 17 <em>Mass. </em>678, 580; Cohen <em>v. </em>Hart, 2 <em>Mill, L.

The engagement of the defendants could not rest partly in writing and partly in parol. It is not competent for the acceptor of a bill to prove by. parol that he did not promise according to the tenor of his acceptance. Mercantile paper would be little worth, if the drawer or acceptor were permitted to establish by a witness, that a written promise to pay one hundred dollars meant only a promise to pay forty. Such proof is in direct contradiction of the written contract. We think, therefore, the defendants should not have been allowed to prove that at the time when the acceptance was given, the messenger of the plaintiffs was told that \u201c payable when in funds\u201d meant that when Curtin\u2019s note was paid and sixty dollars additional, the draft would be paid. It was as clearly a contradiction of the acceptance, as would have been evidence that the messenger was told the acceptance meant the defendants would not pay at all. Of course, it was erroneous to instruct the jury, that the plaintiffs ought not to recover more than forty dollars, if they believed the plaintiffs\u2019 messenger was so told at the time of the acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>We discover no other error in the record. The burden was upon the plaintiffs to show that the defendants were in funds. And the testimony of Sappington, that Cur-tin\u2019s note was given as security for the bill of goods purchased by McClain, tended to prove that they were not in funds. It was, therefore, admissible under the plea of <em>non assumpsit. </em>Had Curtin\u2019s note come to defendants\u2019 hands without any appropriation by McClain, it may .be conceded that they could not have defended themselves against an action on their acceptance by showing that McClain was indebted to them. This is all which was decided in Hunter <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 1 <em>Strob. </em>273, and in Hall <em>v. </em>Marston, 17 <em>Mass. </em>578. But Sappington\u2019s testimony went directly to establish an appropriation of part of the funds, an appropriation made by McClain himself. If this was so, then, only the unappropriated part was funds within the meaning of the acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The sale of the bill of goods by the plaintiffs to McClain was wholly immaterial to either of the issues between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
