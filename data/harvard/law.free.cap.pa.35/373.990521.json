Ruckstool, which Mary Ruby and Eliza A. Ruckstool were trustees of The Heart and Hand Female Beneficial Society of Philadelphia, against Gharles Still and Sarah K. his wife, on a mortgage given by the defendants to the female plaintiffs, as trustees, on the 19th February 1856, to secure the payment of $500 and interest, in one year from the date thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\">The following affidavit of defence was filed by Charles Still, one of the defendants :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">\u201c Charles Still, one of the above-named defendants, and on behalf of his co-defendant, being duly sworn, &amp;c., saith: That they have a just and legal defence to the whole of plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the above case, the nature and character of which is as follows: That the said Eliza A.

Ruckstool \u2014 his name does not appear in the mortgage on which this suit is brought \u2014 nor have this deponent and his co-defendant, or has either of them, at any time had any transactions of business or otherwise with him. All of which the deponent expects to be able to prove on the trial of the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-10\">The court below, on motion of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, gave judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which was here assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-11\"><em>J.

Arundel, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aiz\">A married woman is not capable of contracting, at common law: <em>Chitty on Contracts </em>176-7. And the Act of 1848 has not enlarged her powers in this respect: Gamber <em>v. </em>Gamber, 6 <em>Harris </em>363; Ritter <em>v. </em>Ritter, 7 <em>Casey </em>399; Mahon <em>v. </em>Gormley, 12 <em>Harris </em>80; 1 <em>Casey </em>326; Glyde <em>v. </em>Keister, 8 <em>Id. </em>88. A mortgage is subject to all the rules of law governing conveyances: Philips <em>v. </em>Lewistown Bank, 6 <em>Harris </em>402; Lancaster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>v. </em>Dolan, 1 <em>Rawle </em>248; Wallace <em>v. </em>Coston, 9 <em>Watts </em>137; Chrisman <em>v. </em>Wagoner, 9 <em>Barr </em>473.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-6\"><em>Brinhl\u00e9 </em>and <em>B.

At common law, she might be a grantee by deed, without the consent of her husband: Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 <em>Casey </em>82. And <em>a, feme covert </em>may be a trustee: Dundas <em>v. </em>Biddle, 2 <em>Barr </em>160; <em>Hill on Trustees </em>49.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b374-8\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac2\">The affidavit disclosed no defence whatever. Mrs. Ruckstoo'l, as appeared on the face of the mortgage, was only trustee for The Heart and Hand Female Beneficial Society, in whom the beneficial interest of the mortgage was vested. <em>Femes covert, </em>like infants, lunatics, and others <em>non sui juris, </em>may be trustees, subject, of course, to their legal incapacity to deal with the estate vested in them: <em>Hill on Trustees </em>49. The incapacity of Mrs. Ruckstool to sue in her own name was obviated by her husband joining with her. The mortgagors must pay the money as they agreed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
