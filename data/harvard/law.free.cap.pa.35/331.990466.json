Brown, deceased, for money had and received by the defendants\u2019 testator to the use of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">Hannah Irwin, the wife of Jared Irwin, Jane Coulter, and George Gladden, were the tenants in common of a tract of woodland, containing about fifty acres, situated on the Welsh Mountain, in Chester county. James W. Brown, .the defendants\u2019 testator, acted as the agent of the owners, in taking care of this property. And in 1843 and 1845, without the knowledge of his principals, he cut off the timber, sold it, and appropriated the proceeds to his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\">Mrs. Irwin died in Michigan, in 1853, and as soon as Brown\u2019s act came to the knowledge of her surviving husband, he procured Anderson Black to administer to the estate of his deceased wife; and this action was brought for her proportion of the proceeds of the sale of the timber thus converted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-11\">The court below, in answer to points presented by the plaintiff and defendants, instructed the jury: 1. That upon the severance of the trees from the freehold, Hannah Irwin\u2019s interest in them, as personal chattels, became the absolute property of her husband, by virtue of the marriage; and this suit in the name of her administrator could not be maintained. 2. That if any contract was to be implied in favour of Hannah Irwin, it was a joint contract with her and her co-tenants; and therefore, on her death, the cause of action survived to the other co-tenants, and this suit could not be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-12\">To this instruction the plaintiff excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the defendants, he removed the cause to this court, and here assigned the same for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-13\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">We should be sorry to think that this is the only form of action that furnishes any hope of redress in such a case as this, for we are quite unable to apply this one. There is no contract, in fact, on which to ground it; and in constructing or implying one, we must have a duty out of which and according to which the construction may proceed. To enforce a joint or several duty, we impute a joint or several contract: 10 <em>S. R. </em>211; 14 <em>Id. </em>111. Now, whether we treat the defendant\u2019s wrong as waste or trespass, his legal liability for it was to the tenants in common jointly: <em>Co. Lit. </em>\u00a7 315; <em>Roscoe on Actions, </em>&amp;c. 665 : and if the tort be waived and a constructive contract substituted, it must be a joint one. One cannot, by his election of a substitute, destroy the primary action to which his co-tenants were entitled with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">It seems to us, that we say all we ought to say on the second point, by remarking that when the injury was done, it gave, if it was several, a right of action to the husband and wife which survived to the husband on her death. If the injury was to the three tenants in common, the right of action was not severed by the death of any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
