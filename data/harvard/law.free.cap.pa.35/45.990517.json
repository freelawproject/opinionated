In the 8th lecture of <em>Smith on Landlord and Tenant, </em>p. 221, referring to the tenancy of one holding over after the expiration of the lease, we find as follows: <em>\u201c </em>The yearly tenancy thus raised is governed, not by the simple rules which govern yearly tenancies in the absence of express stipulations, but by the provisions of the expired lease, so far as they are compatible with a yearly holding:\u201d see Rigge <em>v. </em>Bell, 5 <em>T. R. </em>571; Richardson <em>v. </em>Gifford, 1 <em>Ad. &amp; E. </em>52; Beale <em>v. </em>Sanders, 3 <em>Bingh. N. C. </em>850.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-12\">Our own cases give precisely the same result. In Diller <em>v. </em>Roberts, 13 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>63, Ch. J. Tilghman says: \u201c The general rule undoubtedly is, that the law implied an agreement that he (the former lessee) should pay the same rent, and at the same time, which he had agreed to pay the first year.\u201d The case of Phillips <em>v. </em>Monges, 4 <em>Wh. </em>226, is directly in point. Judge Rogers says: \u201c When a landlord suffers the tenant to remain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>possession after tHe expiration of the tenancy, a new tenancy from year to year is established. And if no new agreement be entered into, the law will presume, in the silence of the parties, that the tenant holds the premises, subject to all such covenants contained in the original lease as apply to his present situationhe cites Bishop <em>v. </em>Howard, 2 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>100; Jordan <em>v. </em>Ward, 1 <em>H. Bl. </em>99; Diller <em>v. </em>Roberts, 13 <em>S. R. </em>63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-6\">We refer to the adjudications to the same effect, in the courts of many of our sister states, to be found in the American notes to <em>Smith\u2019s Landlord and Tenant </em>221, and to the American notes to the case of Hyatt <em>v. </em>Griffiths, already cited, in 79 <em>Eng. Com. Law Reports 505; </em>among which are Fronty <em>v. </em>Wood, 2 <em>Hill </em>(S.

On the main point in dispute, and as we suppose the only real point, the authorities referred to by the counsel for the defendant in error, abundantly prove the truth of the principles decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
