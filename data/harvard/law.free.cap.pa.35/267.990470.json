The auditor reported as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-11\">\u201c It is said that the intention of the testator must be taken from the will. In this case, the words of the will (after the testator made some provision for his housekeeper, for the sale of his real estate, gathering of his other incomes, and the payment of his debts) are, \u2018then the residue shall be divided among my next heirs, in equal shares, or to their children, if their parents should not be living.\u2019 It is admitted that the testator, at the time of making his will,' had neither wife, father, mother, brother, or sister living \u2014 could he, therefore, have meant them or any of them ? or did he mean his nephews and nieces, children of his deceased brothers and sisters, and their children, if deceased ? We are told, that the next of kin, according to the statute of distribution living at the execution of a will, or death of an intestate, are entitled to the estate. If this is so, the next heirs of Mr. Andreas are his nephews and nieces (children of his deceased brothers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sisters), and according to the will, his grand-nephews and nieces. The 18th section of the Act of 8th April 1833, <em>Purdon </em>(1855) 453, enacts that <em>\u2018 </em>if such intestate shall leave neither brother nor sister of the whole blood, but nephews or nieces, being children of such deceased brother or sister, the real estate shall descend to and vest in such nephews and nieces.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The 21st section of the same act provides that the personal estate not otherwise disposed of shall be distributed in the same manner.
