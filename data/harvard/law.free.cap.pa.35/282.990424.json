Ludlam leased to Simon Brolaskey, for the term of twenty years, the land upon which the building in question was erected, at the yearly rent of one dollar, with the privilege of renewal for another term of twenty years, upon the same terms and conditions. By this lease, Ludlam covenanted, at the expiration of the first term of twenty years, to take the buildings to be erected on the demised premises, at an appraisement, or to renew the lease for a further term. And that at the expiration of the lease, Brolaskey should have the privilege of removing the buildings to be erected by him upon the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-13\">On the 19th June 1856, Brolaskey insured the premises with the defendants for $3500, for the term of one year. The policy contained a condition, that \u201c if the interest in the property to be insured be a leasehold interest, or other interest not absolute, it must be so represented to the company, and expressed in the policy in writing, or otherwise the insurance shall be void.\u201d Brolaskey insured the building as the owner thereof, without disclosing the nature of his interest in the demised premises. And on the 17th June 1857, the building, known as the Kursaal, was destroyed by fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The court below (Thompson, J.) gave judgment for the plaintiff on the case stated, which was here assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-6\"><em>W. S. Price, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB5\">Brolaskey was bound, by the general law of insurance, to disclose his true interest in the premises, and must be regarded as having concealed material facts: 1. Because, if he had disclosed that interest, he would thereby have disclosed an increase of risk, and the company would not have insured for him: 2. Because premiums of insurance are always enhanced by the fact, that the building is erected upon ground held under a lease only: 3. Because the insurance was being effected in a mutual-insurance company: Columbia Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Lawrence, 2 <em>Pet. </em>25; s. c. 10 <em>Id. </em>507; Carpenter <em>v. </em>American Insurance Company, 1 <em>Story </em>57; Smith <em>v. </em>Columbia Insurance Company, 5 <em>Harris </em>253; <em>Angell on Insurance, </em>\u00a7 175; Marshall <em>v. </em>Columbia Mutual Insurance Company, 7 <em>Foster </em>(N. <em>H.) </em>157; Leathers <em>v. </em>Insurance Company, 4 <em>Id. 259; </em>Smith <em>v. </em>Bowditch Mutual Insurance Company, 6 <em>Cush. </em>448; Wall <em>v. </em>East River Mutual Insurance Company, 3 <em>Seld. </em>370 ; Hayward <em>v. </em>Insurance Company, 10 <em>Cush. </em>444, 446.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-7\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">If this were a case of mutual insurance, whereby the insured becomes a member of the company and pledges his property to secure that of others, there would be some reason for holding it to mean that a house, insured as a house, is real estate; and we suppose that the clause out of which this controversy arises was intended for such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">But this was a common insurance, and we must presume that it was taken in the ordinary way, and justice does not require us to strain the defendants\u2019 language in their policy for their benefit. A house may be, and often is, personal property: 5 <em>Pick. </em>487; 8 <em>Id. </em>283; 1 <em>Hall </em>41; 3 <em>Casey </em>291; and so is machinery in a mill, 8 <em>Harris </em>303; and so was the house insured here, and the insured was the absolute owner of it. The condition relied on does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>require that he should give notice that he was not the owner of the land on which it stood, and we do not think that justice requires us to force this meaning into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
