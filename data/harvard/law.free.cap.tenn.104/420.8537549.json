Aurin, 103 Tenn.), and that such averment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>being tbe statement of a conclusion rather than of a fact, did not preclude tbe defendant from disputing by demurrer, as it did, that .the facts averred by tbe plaintiff disclosed proximate negligence on the part of tbe defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It is a maxim, almost universal, that the law takes notice of the proximate and not of tbe remote cause of an injury in fixing liability therefor, and that proximate and not remote negligence is actionable. It was essential, therefore, that the plaintiff, to present a good cause of action, should aver facts reasonably indicating that the negligence imputed to the defendant was the proximate cause of his injuries; and the inquiry for the Court, under the first ground of demurrer, is, whether the facts averred are sufficient for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In answering this inquiry a brief statement of the salient facts averred and our conclusion in regard to them will be given, without any formal tracing of the somewhat indistinct line of demarcation between proximate cause and remote cause, or the definition of either phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Reduced to their last analysis and interpreted in their proper relation to each other, the decisive averments of the declaration are that the plaintiff\u2019s rightful passage over a public crossing and his needful view of the defendant\u2019s line of road at and near that point were wrongfully and unlawfully obstructed by one of its trains; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>he ivas, by that obstruction and the conductor\u2019s frequent promises to remove it, detained and kept in the public highway near the crossing, with his team of horses, for nearly an hour; that while so detained and kept, another train of the defendant, without the usual and requisite notice, and when he could not see its approach, came up suddenly bekind the first train and 'to the crossing, and there, by great and unnecessary noise, from a concealed position, caused the plaintiff\u2019s horses to run away and inflict upon his person serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">These averments, this Court thinks, present a clear case of proximate negligence on the part of the defendant and disclose a good cause of action for the plaintiff. It is morally certain that he would not have been injured but for that negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">It may be that no single wrong imputed to the defendant, separately considered, was sufficient to produce the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but all of them, considered together, were undoubtedly so; and the concession1 that no one of them by itself would have had that effect, does not preclude the idea that each of them may have been a proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The wrongful and unlawful acts averred in connection with the first train might not, alone, have injured the plaintiff, and those averred in relation to the second train might not, alone, have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>injured him; nevertheless it is obvious that the acts averred as tc each train contributed proximately to that result, those as to the former by detaining him until the arrival of the latter, and those of the latter by frightening his horses while detained by the former. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The plaintiff makes his case doubly strong in averment by imputing concurrent acts of proximate negligence to each of two trains, both of which were being operated by the defendant. The imputation would have been sufficient if but one of the trains had been in charge of the defendant and it had been free from fault as to the other one.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">\u201cIt is universally agreed that if the damage is caused by the concurring force of the defendant\u2019s negligence and some other cause for which he is not responsible, including the act of God, or superior human force directly intervening, the defendant is nevertheless responsible if his negligence is one of the proximate causes of the damage.\u201d Shear. &amp; Red. on Neg., Sec. 39; 2 Thomp. Neg., 1085, 1087; 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. L., 440, 441; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Stillwater, </em>32 Minn., 308; <em>Sellick </em>v. <em>L. S. &amp; M. S. R. Co., </em>18 L. R. A., 154. This doctrine is illustrated and applied in numerous dicisions of this Court; 'notably in <em>Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., </em>v. <em>Zopfi, </em>93 Tenn., 369, where the defendant\u2019s negligence in leaving a telegraph pole in a passwav, in connection with rain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u2022upon, tbe ground, caused the plaintiff\u2019s daughter to slip and fall; and in <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>91 Tenn., 699, where negligent detention of the plaintiff\u2019s goods by the defendant exposed them to destruction by a fire for which the defendant was not responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In instances where the wrongful acts of two or more persons concur as proximate causes of an injury, the wrongdoers are liable jointly or separately, and the fault of one is no defense for the other or others. 2 Thomp. Neg., 1088; <em>Electric Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>89 Tenn., 423; 17 L. R. A., 35, note 2; 40 L. R. A., 804, brief; 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. L., 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Facts very similar to those averred by the present plaintiff were . disclosed in a case twice before the Supreme Court of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">There, as here, the defendant had two trains. The first one illegally obstructed the plaintiff\u2019s passage upon the public highway and the second one, in passing, was so managed as to frighten his team of horses and cause them to run away and injure him. Though alleging the defendant\u2019s wrong as to both trains, the plaintiff at first complained of the second one only as the cause of his injury, and recited the first one by way of inducement or explanation. At the trial the plaintiff failed to give any evidence as to the wrong to which he in the declaration attributed his injury, and on appeal a reversal was had on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>erroneous instructions by tbe trial Judge, to tbe effect that a verdict might be rested upon tbe other wrong. Judge Cooley, in delivering tbe opinion of the Supreme Court, said: \u201cThese instructions were erroneous. The plaintiff had not by his declaration attributed his injury to the alleged detention, and if he had, it would have been idle, for the particular injury of which he complained, namely, the fright and running away of his horses, could not have flowed from that detention as a proximate cause.\u201d <em>Sellick </em>v. <em>L. S. &amp; M. S. Ry. Co., </em>58 Mich., 195. TJpon the remand of the case the plaintiff so amended his declaration as, by proper averment, to attribute his injury to the wrongs of both trains as concurring causes thereof. The plaintiff obtained a second judgment, and the Supreme Court, in affirming it, ruled that the illegal obstruction by the first train and the careless management of the second one might well be treated as concurrent causes in proximately producing the plaintiff\u2019s injury. On the second appeal it was urged by the defendant that the former opinion in the case precluded the plaintiff from insisting that the obstruction by the first train could have been a proximate cause of his injury, but that insistence was refuted by the Court, and the former opinion shown to have been given only with reference to the averments of the declaration as then framed. <em>Sellick </em>v. <em>L. S. &amp; M. S. Ry. Co., </em>18 L. R. A., 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The second objection to the declaration in the present case is not well made, first, because it goes to the single immaterial averment that the obstruction caused by the first train was a public nuisance, and, secondly, because other averments show special damage to the plaintiff, and thereby disclose a good cause of private action in his favor, notwithstanding, and in addition to, the right of the public, or the State, to arraign the defendant upon a criminal indictment for the creation of a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The third objection is not well made, in that it assumes that the defendant\u2019s second train is averred to have sounded its whistle only to the extent and in the manner required by statute, when, in reality, the averment is not simply that the whistle was sounded when the second train arrived at the crossing, but that, in addition thereto, \u201cgreat and unnecessary noise\u201d was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">So far as the matter of whistling or noise is concerned, it is the excess thereof that is imputed to the defendant as wrongful and negligent, and to the extent ' that such excess may have been a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, it affords him a good ground of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The fourth and last objection made by the demurrer is, that the declaration is bad, because it failed to aver that the whistling of the second train was \u201cneedlessly, wantonly, and wrongfully\u201d done.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Tbe failure here assumed really occurrfed iu part only. There \u2022 is a direct averment that the second train was \u201cwrongfully\u201d managed, and the other averment, that it made \u201cunnecessary noise,\u201d is equivalent to saying the noise was \u201cneedlessly\u201d made.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The word \u201cwantonly,\u201d however, does not occur in the declaration, nor is any word of similar import there employed. Rut the absence of an averment that those in charge of the engine \u201cwantonly\u201d sounded the whistle, detracts nothing from the strength of the case actually averred. On the contrary, the plaintiffs right of action is more obvious without such averment than it would be with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">All the authorities agree that a railroad company, like any other' principal, is responsible for the acts of its , agent that are merely negligent, but many, and perhaps the majority, deny its responsibility for the agent\u2019s wrongs wantonly indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\"Upon exceptional grounds this Court, in <em>Bail-road </em>v. Starnes, 9 Heis., 52, .held the company liable for injuries caused by the wanton use of the whistle on one of its engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Reverse and remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
