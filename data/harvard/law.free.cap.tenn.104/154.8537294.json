I. Case Co. </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>89 Tenn., 337, it has not been an open question in this State that homestead does not attach to undivided interests in land. It would be useless to restate the argument upon which that decision rests; it is sufficient to say it is still regarded by us as sound. Nor is there any intimation in <em>Briscoe </em>v. Vaughan, 103 Tenn., 308, of dissatisfaction with the holding there made, neither is there any repugnance between the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The decree of the Court of Chancery Appeals in this regard is reversed, and in all other respects is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
