In the trial court, defendant moved to suppress evidence of cocaine and a firearm<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found in his home by police responding to a 911 call regarding domestic violence at defendant\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>The only witness to testify at the evidentiary hearing that was held regarding defendant\u2019s motion was Officer John Dubois. Officer Dubois testified that he was dispatched in response to an \u201copen 9-1-1 call,\u201d in which the caller failed to hang up. According to the dispatch, there was a domestic incident in progress, possibly involving guns and knives. When Officer Dubois arrived with his partner, Officer Noble, he went to the front door of defendant\u2019s mobile home and identified himself as a police officer. He knocked on the door, but no one answered. He then attempted to gain entry into the house, but the door was locked. He explained that he could hear \u201cwrestling or moving around, a lot of shuffling around\u201d inside the house. Approximately one or two minutes after Officer Dubois\u2019 arrival, a woman he identified as \u201cMs. Collier\u201d answered the door. Officer Dubois ordered her to lie on the floor, and he and Officer Noble entered the home with their guns drawn. The officers spotted defendant in the back bedroom of the mobile home and ordered him to come out and lie on the hallway floor. Officer Dubois testified that he handcuffed defendant \u201cfor our safety and everybody\u2019s safety in the home,\u201d because at that point he still did not know how many people were in the house. The drugs were discovered \u201cafter everything started settling down.\u201d Officer Dubois testified that both powder and crack cocaine were discovered \u201cin plain view\u201d on the kitchen floor, front room, hallway, and on a tray in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Significantly, Officer Dubois testified that although there was no immediate indication that Ms. Collier was injured when she answered the door, he entered the home because he believed, on the basis of the 911 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>open call, that \u201cthere was an obvious problem there that \u2014 that people\u2019s lives could be in jeopardy or in trouble\u201d and that he believed there was \u201cdanger . . . inside the home.\u201d When he entered the residence, he \u201chad no idea if they were injured or not.\u201d He also opined that, in the context of a 911 domestic violence call involving weapons, he and his partner were putting themselves at risk. Dubois testified that he did not know there was cocaine in defendant\u2019s home before entering and had no reason to believe that evidence was being destroyed or that a suspect would escape.</p>\n<p id=\"A9i\">On the basis of the above evidence, the trial court found there were exigent circumstances justifying police entry into defendant\u2019s home. The trial court ruled that Officer Dubois \u201cbelieved that [the 911 call] justified entry and exigent circumstances existed and I think they \u2014 they did in his mind at the time, sufficient to permit the \u2014 the entry.\u201d The court further found that the evidence was in plain view and therefore lawfully seized. Accordingly, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence. Defendant now appeals from this evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">We review de novo a trial court\u2019s ultimate decision on a motion to suppress. <em>People v Echavarria, </em>233 Mich App 356, 366; 592 NW2d 737 (1999); <em>People v Marsack, </em>231 Mich App 364, 372; 586 NW2d 234 (1998).

As a general rule, searches conducted without a warrant are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment unless the police conduct falls under one of the established exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>People v Borchard-Ruhland, </em>460 Mich 278, 293-294; 597 NW2d 1 (1999); <em>People v Davis, </em>442 Mich 1, 10; 497 NW2d 910 (1993); <em>Snider, supra </em>at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Relevant to the present appeal is the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception, characterized by our Supreme Court in <em>In re Forfeiture of $176,598, </em>443 Mich 261, 271; 505 NW2d 201 (1993), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">Pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception, we hold that the police may enter a dwelling without a warrant if the officers possess probable cause to believe that a crime was recently committed on the premises, and probable cause to believe that the premises contain evidence or perpetrators of the suspected crime.

If the police discover evidence of a crime following the entry without a warrant, that evidence may be admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">See also <em>People v Cartwright, </em>454 Mich 550, 559; 563 NW2d 208 (1997); <em>Davis, supra </em>at 10; <em>Snider, supra </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Thus, under the exigent circumstances exception, the elements of probable cause and reasonableness must still be demonstrated. <em>Cartwright, supra </em>at 558; <em>Davis, supra </em>at 24. Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances known to the police officers at the time of the search would lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that a crime has been or is being committed and that evidence will be found in a particular place. <em>People v Williams, </em>160 Mich App 656, 660; 408 NW2d 415 (1987). See also <em>Borchard-Ruhland, supra </em>at 293-294; <em>Davis, supra </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">In the instant case, defendant argues that the 911 call alone does not constitute an exigent circumstance sufficient to justify an entry into his home without a warrant. Although there is a dearth of authority from Michigan courts on this issue, two federal court decisions are pertinent to our resolution of this question. In support of his argument, defendant relies on <em>United States v Meixner, </em>2000 WL 1597736 (ED Mich, 2000), reconsideration den 128 F Supp 2d 1070 (2001), in which the defendant\u2019s live-in girlfriend called 911 during an argument between the couple. She hung up the telephone without speaking, and the defendant unplugged the telephone. The police responded to the defendant\u2019s residence and knocked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>on the door. There was no sound coming from the home. The defendant answered, and the officers could see that his girlfriend was uninjured but appeared to be crying and intoxicated. The officers asked the defendant to let them in, and he belligerently refused. They then ordered the defendant to stand outside the house, telling him that they would arrest him if he refused. The defendant complied, and the officers entered the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant\u2019s girlfriend at that time denied placing the 911 call. The officers, not accepting the representation that there was no trouble at the residence, searched the house for weapons and for other persons in need of aid and found firearms in the bedroom and closet. Subsequently, a warrant was obtained and executed on the basis of the information gained in the entry into defendant\u2019s home, and the firearms were seized. The <em>Meixner </em>Court held the entry into and search of the defendant\u2019s home was unlawful, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">Although there does not appear to be a case decided in this circuit on the question of whether a 911 call can provide a sufficient basis to find exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless home entry, the issue has been addressed by the Seventh Circuit in <em>United States v Richardson, </em>208 F3d 626 (CA 7, 2000), on which the Magistrate Judge in this case placed heavy reliance. In <em>Richardson, </em>the Court concluded that the 911 emergency call in that case supported the Milwaukee police officers\u2019 reasonable belief that someone inside a home was in need of immediate assistance, and therefore exigent circumstances justified the warrant-less search of the premises. The Court noted that \u201c911 calls reporting an emergency can be enough to support warrant-less searches under the exigent circumstances exception, particularly where, as here, the caller identified himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630. The 911 call in that case was placed by a man who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>identified himself by name and reported that a man named \u201cLucky\u201d had raped and murdered a woman who could be found in the basement of the subject premises. Although the Milwaukee Police Department had received a previous 911 call reporting a murder at the same address one week earlier, the officers who responded to the scene did not know about the prior, false alarm. When the officers arrived at the scene, they saw the defendant in front of the house holding a dog on a chain. The police officers called for others in the house to come out, and another male complied with that command. The officers then searched the entire house and observed drugs and drug-packaging paraphernalia, but found no injured person or corpse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\"><em>In the case now before this Court, the 911 call conveyed no information. It was a hang-up call. There was no conversation at all, much less a report of an emergency. </em>Certainly, the possibility of an emergency justified a limited response by the police, consisting of a personal trip to the premises to investigate. Likewise, the dispatcher\u2019s speculation that \u201cpossibly a domestic dispute\u201d existed warranted a further look. Upon arrival, however, more was required to support a warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">Unlike the situation in <em>Richardson, </em>the 911 call in this case announced no emergency. It was a hang-up call which at most gave rise to the possibility of an emergency. When the officers arrived at the scene, they encountered denials from the occupants of the residence that an emergency existed. Of course, the officers were not obliged to take the word of the subjects that no mischief was afoot; yet without some positive indication to the contrary \u2014 some objective manifestation of the existence of an emergency situation demanding immediate action \u2014 the officers were not justified in physically intruding into the sanctity of the home. <em>[Id. </em>at *7-*9 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">By contrast, in <em>United States v Richardson, </em>208 F3d 626 (CA 7, 2000), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that an entry without a warrant precipi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>tated by a 911 call fell within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. The <em>Richardson </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">Pointing out the risk of fraud or, at the very least, unreliable and unproven information from 911 callers, Richardson argues that a 911 call cannot by itself justify a warrantless search or furnish a reasonable basis for an officer to believe that someone inside the residence needs assistance. This line of argument goes too far, however; it invites us to adopt a presumption under which a 911 call could never support a finding of exigent circumstances. Many 911 calls are inspired by true emergencies that require an immediate response. Those factors have led both this court and others to conclude that 911 calls reporting an emergency can be enough to support warrantless searches under the exigent circumstances exception, particularly where, as here, the caller identified himself. See, <em>e.g., United States v Cunningham, </em>133 F3d 1070, 1072-73 [(CA 8, 1998)], cert den 523 US 1131; 118 S Ct 1823; 140 L Ed 2d 960 (1998); <em>[United States v] Salava, </em>978 F2d [320 (CA 7, 1992)] at 321, 324-325. A 911 call is one of the most common \u2014 and universally recognized \u2014 means through which police and other emergency personnel leam that there is someone in a dangerous situation who urgently needs help. This fits neatly with a central purpose of the exigent circumstances (or emergency) exception to the warrant requirement, namely, to ensure that the police or other government agents are able to assist persons in danger or otherwise in need of assistance. See <em>United States v Moss, </em>963 F2d 673, 678 (CA 4, 1992); <em>Wayne v United States, </em>318 F2d 205, 212 (CA DC, 1963) (Burger, J.) (\u201cThe need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.\u201d). The efficient and effective use of the emergency response networks requires that the police (and other rescue agents) be able to respond to such calls quickly and without unnecessary second-guessing. As then-Circuit Judge Burger stated in <em>Wayne, </em>\u201c[T]he business of policemen and firemen is to act, not to speculate or meditate on whether the report is correct. Peo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>pie could well die in emergencies if police tried to act with the calm deliberation associated with the judicial process.\u201d 318 F2d at 212.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">=!= * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">[I]t was objectively reasonable for the officers to conclude that the situation presented exigent circumstances on these particular facts. This is not a case where the report indicated that the body had been languishing in the house for several days. Nor is it a case where other evidence might have made it clear that the victim was indeed dead, and not hovering on the verge of death. A <em>modus operandi </em>that is designed to save potential fatalities, where it is objectively reasonable to think that this is possible, is permissible. We note in this connection that Richardson did not introduce any evidence to rebut the officers\u2019 assertion that this was their practice, nor did he challenge their empirical assumption that lay witnesses were often wrong in their assumption that someone was beyond rescue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">Last, Richardson argues that to find exigent circumstances on these facts would lead to abuse of the 911 system: people with a grudge would have an incentive to make phony calls about their neighbors in order to allow the police to enter and search their neighbors\u2019 property without a warrant. . . . While we do not exclude the possibility of a case in which it would be objectively unreasonable for a police officer to rely on a 911 call, because of additional information available to the officer, this is not that case. It may even be possible, in those rare cases where a false emergency call is made, that the \u201cvictim\u201d (that is, the person whose house is searched) might have a remedy against the caller. Whether or not this is true, we have no evidence indicating that the 911 system is abused so often that it is objectively unreasonable for the police to rely on a call like the one Carter made here. We therefore agree that the district court correctly denied Richardson\u2019s suppression motion because the warrantless search fell within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. <em>[Richardson, supra </em>at 629-631.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>See also <em>Cunningham, supra </em>at 1072-1073; <em>Salava, supra </em>at 324-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In the present case, the circumstances are more closely analogous to <em>Richardson </em>than <em>Meiocner, </em>the determinative and differentiating factor being the amount of information available to the police officers herein before their entry into defendant\u2019s mobile home. In <em>Meixner, </em>the district court expressly noted that the 911 call conveyed no information. It was a hang-up call with no conversation at all, much less a report of an emergency. In the instant case, on the other hand, there was a 911 call reporting an incidence of domestic violence. The caller also indicated that there were guns and knives on the premises. This information was conveyed to Officer Dubois, who reached the address and, while waiting for someone to answer his repeated knocking on the front door, heard noises inside that he characterized as \u201cwrestling or moving around, a lot of shuffling around.\u201d Given these circumstances, Officers Dubois and Noble were justified in entering defendant\u2019s home without a warrant when Ms. Collier finally opened the door. From an objective standpoint, the 911 call reporting a domestic disturbance, the possible presence of weapons on the premises as reported by the caller, and the sounds of a scuffle within the home were sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that a crime was being committed inside, that the mobile home may have been harboring an individual who posed a threat to the officers or to another, and that entry was necessary to protect the officers\u2019 own safety as well as the safety of someone inside. <em>In re Forfeiture, supra </em>at 261; <em>Williams, supra </em>at 660. We therefore hold that the evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>record \u2014 the 911 call in this case combined with Officer Dubois\u2019 personal observations immediately before entry \u2014 provided specific and objective evidence that immediate action was necessary to protect the police officers or others and justified the officers\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s home without a warrant pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Furthermore, even were we to assume arguendo there was an absence of probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed, the officers\u2019 entry without a warrant would be sanctioned under the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">[W]e hold that police may enter a dwelling without a warrant when they reasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid. They must possess specific and articulable facts that lead them to this conclusion. In addition, the entry must be limited to the justification therefor, and the officer may not do more than is reasonably necessary to determine whether a person is in need of assistance, and to provide that assistance. <em>[Davis, supra </em>at 25-26.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The police in this case had an unambiguous dispatch identifying defendant\u2019s home as the scene of a serious domestic disturbance. In addition, although they did not see any physical injury when Collier opened the door, they heard sounds of \u201cwrestling\u201d and had reason to believe there may be a gun or knives on the premises. Under these circumstances, the police had sufficient articulable facts on which to base their conclusion that someone inside defendant\u2019s home needed immediate aid. Compare <em>Davis, supra </em>(911 call was ambiguous with regard to location and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>identity of caller and the alleged emergency was insufficient to invoke the emergency aid exception as justification for entry without a warrant into the motel room). For these reasons, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Next, defendant argues that the search without a warrant of his entire house incident to his arrest violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Defendant contends the circumstances did not justify a protective sweep because there was no indication in the dispatch or from the situation at the home that there was a third party in his home. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Having already established the legality of the officers\u2019 entry without a warrant into defendant\u2019s mobile home, the ensuing protective sweep of the premises, after defendant was handcuffed, was likewise permissible. The Fourth Amendment permits a properly limited protective sweep in connection with an in-home arrest if the police reasonably believe that the area in question harbors an individual who poses a danger to them or to others. <em>Maryland v Buie, </em>494 US 325, 337; 110 S Ct 1093; 108 L Ed 2d 276 (1990); <em>Cartwright, supra </em>at 556-557; <em>Snider, supra </em>at 411; <em>People v Shaw, </em>188 Mich App 520, 524-525; 470 NW2d 90 (1991). \u201cSuch a search is quick and limited, and conducted for the sole purpose of ensuring the safety of police officers and other persons.\u201d <em>Cartwright, supra </em>at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Viewed from the perspective of Officer Dubois, <em>Cartwright, supra </em>at 559, the protective search of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>defendant\u2019s mobile home was reasonable under the circumstances. The officer testified that when he arrived at the scene, he did not know whether additional people were present in the residence. Although police intervention was in response to a domestic dispute and Ms. Collier appeared to be uninjured, other persons or children could have been present in the home, justifying at least a walk through the house to confirm that no one else was in danger. <em>Richardson, supra </em>at 630; <em>Cartwright, supra </em>at 561-562; <em>Snider, supra </em>at 411; <em>Shaw, supra </em>at 524. Moreover, once in the mobile home, the officers observed the powder and crack cocaine in plain view, and that evidence therefore could be properly seized. <em>People v Champion, </em>452 Mich 92, 101-102; 549 NW2d 849 (1996); <em>Shaw, supra </em>at 524. Defendant\u2019s argument in this regard is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-12\"> Although defendant is charged with felony-firearm, no reference was made to the discovery of a gun at the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\"> In regard to the present search and seizure that occurred inside the curtilage of a dwelling house, absent compelling reasons, the Michigan and federal constitutional guarantees are coextensive. <em>Sitz v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>443 Mich 744, 750-763; 506 NW2d 209 (1993).
