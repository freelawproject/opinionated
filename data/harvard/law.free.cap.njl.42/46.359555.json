FRANKLIN FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b74-6\">\u25a0On an issue whether a misdescription of insured premises caused the insurance to be effected at a lower premium than would otherwise have been charged, the company\u2019s agent, through whom the policy was issued, was permitted to swear to his opinion as to the rate at which he could have procured insurance of the premises, as they were, from other companies, and his knowledge as to the rate actually \u25a0charged by other companies for insurance of buildings of similar character.

In this aspect of the case, the plaintiff was permitted to ask of this agent what were the usual rates for such a house as the plaintiff kept, about the time the policy was issued, and what he knew as to the actual rates charged, at that time, by other \u25a0companies, upon designated buildings regarded as of the same class, <em>i. e., </em>hotels. His answers were to the effect that he \u25a0could have insured the plaintiff\u2019s building at the policy rate, in twenty or thirty other companies, and that the rates charged for the buildings specifically inquired about, were somewhat \u25a0higher than that mentioned in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>This testimony is not of a character to require the court to-disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The subject for investigation was, indeed, not whether other insurers could have assumed the risk at the policy rate, but whether the defendant would have demanded a higher premium upon an accurate description of the building insured. It was, however, plain that, even if such a description had been forwarded to the company\u2019s managers, still, they would have relied upon this agent to settle the rate, unless they had come to distrust either his judgment or his honesty; and hence the point of inquiry was whether calling the property a hotel or tavern, instead of a dwelling and boarding-house, would have led them to such distrust. As elucidating that, the usual or unusual character of the insurance of a hotel, at the policy rate, was relevant, for, to show that such an insurance was common, in the practice or experience of other persons engaged in the same business as the defendant\u2019s managers, would render probable an inference that it was not uncommon in theirs, and would not have excited any disapproval. There was no reason to suppose that the defendant\u2019s affairs were conducted in so exceptional a manner as to make the frequent incidents of insurance business surprising to its officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The testimony admitted was akin to the evidence of the value of land, afforded by proving sales of other similar land in the neighborhood. This sort of evidence has often been received. <em>Somerville and Easton R. R. Co. </em>ads. <em>Doughty, 2 Zab. </em>495; <em>Benham </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>103 <em>Mass. </em>365.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">While such inquiries may tend to widen the range of investigation, which it is generally wise to restrain closely to the issue, yet, as no precise limit to relevancy can be laid down, much trust must be reposed in the discretion of the trial judge, and that, we think, in this case, was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Let the rule be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
