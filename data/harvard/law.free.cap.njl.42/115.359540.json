That the trustees of a school district, in their corporate capacity, are not liable to be sued in a justice\u2019s court, must be regarded as settled, in this court, by the case of <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Trustees, &amp;c., </em>12 <em>Vroom </em>312.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-10\">2.

The precise question there being whether a District Court had jurisdiction of an action against a school corporation, it was held that, under the adjudications in this state, it had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">In order to reach this conclusion, however, it was held to have been decided, in <em>Inhabitants of Princeton </em>v. <em>Mount, </em>5 <em>Dutcher </em>299, and other cases referred to, (1) that an action will not lie in a justice\u2019s court, against a municipal corporation; (2) that with respect to the question of jurisdiction, no distinction is to be made between municipal corporations generally, and the <em>quasi </em>corporations controlling schools; (3) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u25a0that the same legal difficulties which stand in the way of a suit against such a corporation, in a justice\u2019s court, are to be found in the District Court act.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The proposition that a school corporation cannot be sued in a justice\u2019s court, is an essential link in the argument by which the court, in that case, reached its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">A proposition assumed or decided by the court to be true, \u25a0and which must be so assumed or decided in order to establish another proposition which expresses the conclusion of the \u2022court, is as effectually passed upon and settled in that court as the very matter directly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The question, therefore, as to the liability of a school corporation to be sued in a justice\u2019s court, must be regarded as -closed in this court by the case just referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">It is objected, on the part of the defendant, that as the \u2022question of jurisdiction was not raised on the trial of the appeal, it cannot be entertained here.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">If the question were one merely of jurisdiction as to a party defendant not properly brought into court, for want of process, or from defective service of it, the objection would \u2022be well taken. This kind of jurisdiction may be obtained by \u2022consent, or the want of it may be waived, either expressly or by failing to take advantage of it at the proper time. But in the case before us the difficulty lies much deeper. The \u25a0question here is, not whether a competent court had obtained jurisdiction of a party suable before it, but whether the court itself is competent, under any circumstances, to adjudicate a \u2022claim against the defendant below.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The question, therefore, is as to the jurisdiction of the \u2022court below over the very subject m\u00e1tter of the suit. This kind of jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, nor can the right to object to the want of it be lost by acquiescence or .neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">\u201cA judgment pronounced by a tribunal having no authority to determine the matter in issue, is necessarily and incurably void, and may be shown to be so in any collateral or other proceeding in which it is drawn in question. * * * When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the tribunal has not jurisdiction over the subject matter, noaverment can supply the defect, no amount of proof can alter the case. * * * Neither the acquiescence of the-parties nor their solicitations can authorize any court to determine any matter over which the law has not authorized it to act.\u201d <em>Freem. on Judg., </em>\u00a7 120, and cases cited; 1 <em>Stew. Dig., p. </em>243, <em>pl. </em>33.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The objection that the question of jurisdiction cannot be raised on the hearing of this writ is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is reversed,, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
