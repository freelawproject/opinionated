L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 42A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 330,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) to recognize her as the principal of the new Groton Road Grammar School, and (3) to refrain from \u201cdemoting\u201d her under their vote of April 13, 1953. The trial judge dismissed the petition \u201cas matter of discretion.\u201d The case is here by appeal with the findings of the judge and the evidence. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 213, \u00a7 ID, inserted by St. 1943, c. 374, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The facts do not appear to be in dispute. Prior to April 13, 1953, the petitioner had for more than three years been principal of the North Chelmsford Princeton Street Grammar School. On that day the committee voted to close that school and the Quessy School in West Chelmsford and to transfer all teaching personnel attached to those schools to positions in the new school then being built on Groton Road or to other positions in the school system. They also voted that since the opening of the new school would have the effect of abolishing the principalship in the Princeton Street School, the petitioner be assigned to teach in the new school \u201cin the grade most suitable to her with no reduction in salary, effective as of the beginning of the school year 1953-1954.\u201d No notice of this intended vote was given to the petitioner, no written charge was made against her, and the committee denied her request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">At the beginning of the following school year, in accordance with this vote, the teachers and pupils of the Princeton Street School and of the Quessy School were transferred to the new school on Groton Road. The petitioner is teaching there in the eighth or highest grade. Both of the old schools have been closed. The Princeton Street School had eight grades in eight rooms, with seven teachers besides the petitioner. The new school has eight grades in eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>rooms. It has more than twice the number of pupils that formerly attended the petitioner\u2019s school and more than twice as many teachers. It is about half a mile away. A man principal from another part of the town was made principal of the new school.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 42A, provides in part that no principal who has served in that position for over three years \u201cshall without his consent be demoted except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct, insubordination or other good cause.\u201d The section contains provisions for notice, \u201cwritten charge or charges of the cause or causes for which his demotion is proposed, \u201d and for a hearing on request.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The respondents do not now find fault of any kind and so far as appears have never found any fault with the petitioner or her work. Their position is simply that the Princeton Street School has ceased to exist. There can be no question that this is the fact. The petitioner\u2019s own testimony shows it.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We assume in favor of the petitioner, but without deciding, that the petitioner\u2019s transfer from the principalship of the Princeton Street School to a teaching position in the new school without loss of pay was a \u201cdemotion\u201d within the meaning of that word in \u00a7 42A. We also assume in the petitioner\u2019s favor, but still without deciding, that the proposal for discontinuance of the petitioner\u2019s school required a \u201ccharge\u201d of a \u201ccause\u201d for demotion upon which a hearing could be had. See <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>221 Mass. 150, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Even with these assumptions in the petitioner\u2019s favor we are unable to see how any effective relief can be given her. She may have had a technical right to notice and a hearing, but she had no right to be appointed principal of the new school. That was not the position she had previously held. It was a much more important and responsible position. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>School Committee of Watertown, </em>330 Mass. 150, 152-153. It was the duty of the school committee in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>interest of the public to select the person for that position whom they judged best fitted for it. If the petitioner had had a hearing it would not have been upon the question whether she should be appointed to the new school or to any other particular school. In the last analysis it would have come down to the question whether the closing of her school, which was the cause of her losing her position, was a reality and not a pretence or sham. That question has now been settled beyond any possible doubt. The school committee unquestionably had power to close the Princeton Street School. <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>12 Gray, 339. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>193 Mass. 294. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Springfield, </em>241 Mass. 325, 329. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 37. The court cannot now order the school committee to install the petitioner as principal of some other school, even if one is available \u2014 a fact which does not appear. <em>Downey </em>v. <em>School Committee of Lowell, </em>305 Mass. 329, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The court will not issue its writ to require a hearing which it can see must be futile. The judgment dismissing the petition as matter of discretion must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\"> The amendment by St. 1953, c. 269, does not affect this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
