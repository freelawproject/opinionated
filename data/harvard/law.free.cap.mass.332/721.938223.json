L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1. It alleges that a controversy exists between the parties and prays for a decree that certain regulations adopted by the defendant are invalid. The regulations complained of by the plaintiffs are noted in the margin or in the decree of the judge hereinafter set forth. After hearing the judge decreed</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">\u201c1. That chapter VIII of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Health of the town of Canton, entitled 'Piggeries\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is hereby declared to be a valid regulation;</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That section 4 of chapter V of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Health of the town of Canton which provides: 'No garbage shall be disposed of within the limits of the town of Canton\u2019 is hereby declared to be invalid and of no force or effect;</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">\"3. That section 2 of chapter VI of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Health of Canton which provides: \u2018No person shall transport through the streets of the Town of Canton garbage, offal or other offensive substances collected outside the Town of Canton unless he shall first have registered with the Board of Health by filing with the Board a statement of registration. Such statement of registration <em>shall state the places from which and to which the substance is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number><em>to be transported, </em>a brief description of the vehicle or vehicles which will be used for such transportation, the residence and business address of the applicant and such other information as the Board may require. No person who has filed such statement of registration shall transport or continue to transport said substances through the streets of the Town of Canton unless he does so in accordance with these rules and regulations and any other applicable rules and regulations of the Board of Health\u2019 is hereby declared to be valid, <em>except that portion thereof which requires as a part of the registration a statement as to the place from which the substance is to be transported is hereby declared to be invalid and of no force or </em>effect; \u00a1^emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\u201c4. That chapter VII of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Health of the Town of Canton entitled, \u2018Nuisances\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is hereby declared to be a valid regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">\u201c5. That that portion of chapter XIV of the Rules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Regulations of the Board of Health of the Town of Canton which provides: \u2018Whoever violates any provision of these rules and regulations shall be fined not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) by the court having jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided by law\u2019 is hereby declared to be invalid and of no force or effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The case comes here upon the appeals of all the parties. At the argument before us the defendant waived its appeal so we consider only the appeal of the plaintiffs. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The statute authorizing boards of health to make reasonable regulations is G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. Ill, \u00a7 31, as amended by St. 1937, c. 285. Other sections of c. 111 authorize such boards to make specific prohibitions. Among these is \u00a7 143, as appearing in St. 1948, c. 480, \u00a7 1, under which the board presumably acted in promulgating c. VIII of the regulations entitled \u201cPiggeries.\u201d The judge correctly decreed this regulation to be valid. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>135 Mass. 526, which arose under Gen. Sts. c. 26, \u00a7 52, a predecessor of \u00a7 143, it was said at page 529, \u201cThe board of health had authority under that section of the statute, if it deemed such employment [keeping of pigs]' a nuisance, to prohibit its exercise within the limits of the town.\u201d And more recently we said that a board of health \u201cis empowered by \u00a7 143 to prohibit the exercise of the trade or employment [fish processing] as a whole whenever by any of the methods employed it has become or may become a nuisance or otherwise offensive as set forth in the statute.\u201d <em>Board of Health of Wareham </em>v. <em>Marine By-Products Co. </em>329 Mass. 174, 178. <em>Waltham </em>v. <em>Mignosa, </em>327 Mass. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The plaintiffs further contend that c. VIII of the regulations entitled \u201cPiggeries\u201d is invalid because it does not conform to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 143-149, inclusive. They assert that any violation of \u00a7 143 must be first complained of in the form of an order of the board to be served upon the occupant or person in charge of the premises in which the prohibited business is being conducted. The answer to this, however, is to be found in <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>116 Mass. 254, at page 261, where it was said that \u201can order of the board of health, under the Gen. Sts. e. 26, \u00a7 52 [a predecessor of \u00a7 143], is not in the nature of an adjudication of a particular case, but of a general regulation of the trade or employment mentioned therein.\u201d See <em>Kineen </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Lexington, </em>214 Mass. 587, 591. It is plain that c. VIII of the regulations is in its nature general and that after its adoption c. Ill, \u00a7 146, which requires an order to be issued and served, operates. We must assume that the board in Canton will comply with the provisions of \u00a7 146 in enforcing regulations adopted under \u00a7 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">While the defendant waived its appeal, we feel constrained to say that the action of the judge declaring that \u00a7 4 of c. V of the regulations (garbage disposal within the town) is invalid is correct. Because its appeal was waived by the defendant, we do not consider the decree of the judge that part of \u00a7 2 of c. VI is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 2 of c. VI of the regulations is invalid in its entirety and that the decree of the judge that in large part it is valid is incorrect. They misconstrue, however, the provisions of c. Ill, \u00a7 31 A, as appearing in St. 1937, c. 282, as amended by St. 1945, c. 423,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which the board of health was authorized to make this regulation. The first paragraph of \u00a7 31A requires a permit to transport garbage, offal, and other offensive substances through the streets of a town. The second paragraph allows the transportation of such offensive material through the streets of a town in which such substances are not collected provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>one who so transports registers with the board of health of such town. Read as a whole, we believe that the statute authorizes the adoption of a regulation which requires a permit to transport the offensive substances collected within the town or which are collected outside and are brought into the town for disposal there. It requires registration only by one who transports such substances through the town when going from a point outside the town to another point outside. The regulation is valid in order that the board of health may determine whether to require a permit or a registration so that they may learn where such offensive substances are to be disposed of and thus retain some control over their use or disposition if it is to be within the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Chapter VII of the regulations entitled \u201cNuisances\u201d was properly held to be valid. The plaintiffs argue that this chapter of the regulations is invalid because it does not \u201cprescribe any standard of conduct under which a person may know how to demean himself, use his property or exercise his rights and privileges.\u201d We agree that \u201cthe regulation should be so clearly expressed that those who may be subject thereto should not have to guess at its meaning.\u201d <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 134. But as we have said in <em>Board of Health of Wareham </em>v. <em>Marine By-Products Co. </em>329 Mass. 174, at page 177, \u201cBoards of health <em>are </em>likely to be composed of laymen not skilled in drafting legal documents, and their orders should be read with this fact in mind. They should be so construed as to ascertain the real substance intended and without too great attention to niceties of wording and arrangement.\u201d <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>116 Mass. 254, 261. We believe that no reasonable person could fail to understand the meaning of c. VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">While not actually before us because of waiver of appeal by the defendant, we feel that we ought to say that part of c. XIV<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the regulations was correctly held to be invalid. Section 31 of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. Ill, as amended by St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>1937, c. 285, provides that \u201cWhoever . . . violates any reasonable health regulation, made under authority of this section . . . shall be punished by a fine of not more than twenty dollars.\u201d Other sections of c. Ill provide penalties for specific violation of such sections which are not subject to \u00a7 31. Since the board had no authority to establish a greater penalty than that provided in \u00a7 31, in proper proceedings a court may declare such other penalties to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-12\"> \u201cSection 1.
