On January 12, 1954, the wife\u2019s petition was dismissed, and she appealed. The judge filed a report of the material facts found by him, which showed that the parties separated on January 2, 1952, and that the husband had cared for the boy properly ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The evidence, which is reported, was conflicting as to the condition and care of the boy in his father\u2019s house. The boy is small for his age, and rather frail. By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 208, \u00a7 28, a divorce court may \u201crevise and alter\u201d a decree for custody \u201cas the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.\u201d Ordinarily a change in custody will not be made unless there has been a change in circumstances since the original decree for custody. <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>329 Mass. 190, 191. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>151 Mass. 349, 351. As was said in <em>Grandell </em>v. <em>Short, </em>317 Mass. 605, 608, \u201cThe wisdom of changing the order for custody was one peculiarly within the province of the judge, who observed the witnesses, among whom were both parents.\u201d His decision is entitled to weight, and will not be reversed unless plainly wrong. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>304 Mass. 248, 252. <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee, </em>293 Mass. 472, 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\n<em>Decree dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
