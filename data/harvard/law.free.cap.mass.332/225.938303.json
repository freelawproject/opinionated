In this action of tort for negligence the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The jury returned a verdict for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tiff, and the case is here on the judge\u2019s report of his action on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The plaintiff seeks to establish the defendant\u2019s liability on the ground that the tenancy falls within the third class of cases outlined in <em>Fiorntino </em>v. Mason, 233 Mass. 451, 453, under which the landlord agrees to \u201cmaintain the premises in a condition of safety on his own responsibility and without reference to notice from the tenant of defective conditions, and by virtue of the agreement for letting shall have and constantly retain such possession of the premises as is necessary for that purpose. \u201d At the arguments the defendant stated, without challenge by the plaintiff, that the only decision in our reports where a plaintiff has prevailed in this class of cases is <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Bixby, </em>237 Mass. 249. We have said that such an undertaking, when applied to all portions of a tenement, \u201cinvolves a degree of retention of control by the landlord which would be a surprise to most tenants. It must be seldom indeed that such an agreement is actually made.\u201d <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>314 Mass. 759, 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">If there is evidence of an agreement for a tenancy of the third class it must be found in the testimony of the plaintiff as to her conversations with George Chaletzky, the defendant\u2019s son and his admitted agent authorized to make agreements relating to the property, to supervise repairs, and to collect rents. When the defendant became owner in May, 1950, the plaintiff had been a tenant for some years. About June 1, 1950, George came to the premises and informed her that the defendant had bought the house. At that time George said in substance, \u201cI keep the house in good repair and keep it safe all the time. Don\u2019t worry . . . I promise ... in good repair. \u201d The plaintiff then paid the rent, which was $16 a month.' On cross-examination she testified that George said, \u201cI keep it repaired; I keep it good, and I will keep it safe. ... I promise you.\u201d At this time there was, according to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, a hole in the piazza \u201ctwo fingers\u201d wide and eighteen inches long, which she pointed out to George. On a later occasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>when he came to collect the rent he went onto the piazza and said, \u201cIs good, no danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We are unable to distinguish this case from <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>314 Mass. 759, 761. There the landlord agreed that \u201che would take full responsibility and would make the place safe and sound,\u201d and \u201cwas going to take charge of everything.\u201d The tenant \u201cwas not to do any repairs whatsoever.\u201d The landlord \u201cwas to do the repairs and keep it in good condition\u201d and \u201cwould take the responsibility and keep it in good condition.\u201d In that case, it was held that the plaintiff failed to show every essential element of an agreement for this class of tenancy, which \u201ccannot be found from evidence of a promise to assume complete responsibility for placing the premises in a condition of repair and safety without evidence of an agreement to assume complete and continuing responsibility for keeping them in that condition thereafter\u201d (page 761). It, accordingly, was decided that the contract fell in the second class of cases in <em>Fiorntino </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>\u201cwhere the obligation is only to repair on notice, and where liability in tort exists only for actually making the repairs in a negligent manner\u201d (page 762). See <em>Trainor </em>v. <em>Keane, </em>304 Mass. 466; <em>Ryerson </em>v. <em>Fall River Philanthropic Burial Society, </em>315 Mass. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The plaintiff relies on <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Bixby, </em>237 Mass. 249, where the landlord \u201cagreed to keep the place in repair and safe to live in\u201d (page 251). It would seem that the true ground of this case, which is not cited in the <em>Collins </em>case, must be some additional factor, such as the extent of repairs made by the landlord without notice subsequent to an ambiguous agreement. If there be any inconsistency, we prefer to follow the course so much more recently indicated in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Humphrey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Since we do not have a case in the third class, we need not decide whether the evidence disclosed that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were shown to be caused by any breach of duty of the landlord to perform the obligation resting upon him in that type of tenancy <em>(Fiorntino </em>v. <em>Mason, supra, </em>454; <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Bixby, supra, </em>254; <em>Sneckner </em>v. <em>Feingold, </em>314 Mass. 613, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>614) or whether their cause was left a matter of conjecture. <em>Mucha </em>v. <em>Northeastern Crushed Stone Co. Inc. </em>307 Mass. 592, 596-597.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In accordance with the terms of the report, a verdict is to be entered for the defendant . </p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
