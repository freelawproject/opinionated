This petition by four daughters seeks a binding determination as to whether the son Harold, a respondent, has lost rights under the will by reason of paragraph 14 thereof, which provides: \u201cIf any of my said children shall marry a person not born in the Hebrew faith, then I hereby revoke the gift or gifts and the provision or provisions herein made to or for such child, and I direct that the portion or portions of my estate, and the interest or interests therein which I have by this will given to such child so marrying a person not born in the Hebrew faith shall be paid and made over to that person or persons who would have been entitled thereto under this will if such beneficiary had died before becoming entitled by the provisions hereof to such portion or portions, interest or interests, without leaving lawful issue. \u201d Other respondents include the fifth daughter, Sarah Lewitsky, and the executors under the will of Joseph Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">After hearing, a decree was entered providing \u201cthat all rights of the respondent Harold B. Gordon as beneficiary under Article Ninth of said will to distributions of income and principal after May 11, 1949, when he married a person not born in the Hebrew faith, are revoked as of that date, and that all rights to distributions of income and principal after that date which would otherwise have been payable to said Harold B. Gordon are vested in equal shares in the petitioners Minerva Gordon, May C. Pite, Lillian G. Silverman and Sadye G. Freedman, and the respondent Sarah G. Lewitsky, payable to them or their issue in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article Ninth of said will.\u201d Harold appealed. The petitioners also appealed from the decree \u201cso far as it relates to Sarah G. Lewitsky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The judge made a report of these material facts found by him. On May 11, 1949, Harold married Veronica Albaugh in a civil ceremony in Elkton, Maryland. Veronica was not a person born in the Hebrew faith. Her parents were Roman Catholic, and she was raised in that faith. She lived in Berlin, New Hampshire, and practised there in accordance with the tenets of that faith until in 1944 at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>age of 28 she went into the army. Veronica and Harold had been acquainted since 1938. She learned of the provisions of the will two or three months after the testator\u2019s death. Beginning in 1947 she undertook religious instruction under rabbis. On December 27, 1949, she became a convert to Judaism and received a certificate recognizing her conversion. Later on the same day Harold and she went through a rabbinical ceremony of marriage. She was then pregnant with a child born on February 9, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Joseph Gordon was an orthodox Jew, and his children were brought up in the tenets of that faith. About 50 Jewish families lived in the city of Attleboro and the town of North Attleborough. There was an orthodox synagogue in Attleboro. Harold was not limited in the choice of a wife to a resident of that city. \u201cI find both in fact and in law that the provisions of the Fourteenth Article of the will did not operate as an unlawful restraint on marriage.\u201d From the religious point of view of the orthodox Jew, a person who is converted to Judaism becomes, with minor exceptions, as though born a Jew. This concept, however, is not accepted by all Jews. Some hold that the conversion has no retroactive effect. On May 11, 1949, when the marriage took place, Veronica \u201cwas not in any sense Jewish or Hebrew and it could not then be said that she was born in the Hebrew faith.\u201d Her conversion did not occur until more than seven months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201cThere was much testimony as to the variety of meanings and lack of meaning, from an ecclesiastical point of view and otherwise, of the words \u2018born in the Hebrew faith\u2019 singly and collectively. The word \u2018Hebrew\u2019 and the word \u2018Jewish\u2019 are interchangeable in usage. I find no such uncertainty in the meaning of these words as to make their application to the facts in this case too difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">1. The respondents contend that the judge was plainly wrong in finding that at the time of her marriage on May 11, 1949, Veronica \u201cwas not in any sense Jewish or Hebrew and it could not then be said that she was born in the Hebrew faith.\u201d It is argued also that the statement i\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>inconsistent with the finding that from the religious viewpoint of the orthodox Jew a convert becomes, with minor exceptions, as though born a Jew. The findings, however, were focused upon the date of the marriage, at which time, if at all, the provisions of paragraph 14 must be capable of being understood and applied. The arguments of the respondents would equally embrace a conversion fifty years after the marriage. Should it be necessary to wait the entire lifetime of a spouse to see if he or she might become a convert to Judaism, the purpose of the provision would be nullified. See <em>Denfield, petitioner, </em>156 Mass. 265, 269. Regardless of the dogmatic dispute as to the retroactive effect of conversion, we think that the provision as to marriage with <em>\u201ca </em>person not born in the Hebrew faith\u201d must be judged in this case on the facts as they stood on May 11, 1949. The only certain thing then was that Veronica since 1947 had received religious instruction from rabbis.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The objection is made that the finding that there is no uncertainty in the phrase, \u201cborn in the Hebrew faith,\u201d is not justified by the testimony, and as a statement of law \u201cis not consistent with the legal conclusions adopted by almost all the courts which have considered this problem and made it a basis for their decision.\u201d That is not, however, quite what the finding was. Referring to this phrase and to the words \u201cHebrew\u201d and \u201cJewish,\u201d the judge said, \u201cI find no such uncertainty in the meaning of these words as to make their application to the facts in this case too difficult.\u201d We think that what the judge meant is clear. He was ruling that the testator used the word \u201cborn\u201d not in an abstruse sense such as might be understood by a theologian but in its ordinary meaning of physical birth. \u201c\u2018Words in a will are to be given their ordinary meaning unless an intention to use them in some different sense is shown.\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Livermore, </em>298 Mass. 223, 234.\u201d <em>Franklin Square House </em>v. <em>Siskind, </em>322 Mass. 556, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">2. Whether the words \u201cJewish faith\u201d are sufficiently definite is a question of more difficulty. The courts with whose conclusions the judge\u2019s finding is said to be incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>sistent are either English or in the Dominions. Of late years testamentary conditions seeking to divest estates on the contingency of marriage outside the Jewish religion have been held void for uncertainty in the English courts. <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Ramsden, </em>[1943] A. C. 320 (\"if my said daughter . . . shall at any time after my death contract a marriage with a person who is not of Jewish parentage and of the Jewish faith\u201d). <em>In re Blaiberg, </em>[1940] 1 Ch. 385 (\"should any child or grandchild of mine at any time whether before or after my decease marry any person not of the Jewish faith\u201d). <em>In re Donn, </em>[1944] 1 Ch. 8 (\"If any child of mine shall intermarry with anyone not of the Jewish faith, or if any child of mine shall intermarry with anyone whose parents were not of the Jewish faith at the time of the birth of the person so intermarrying with any child of mine\u201d). <em>Re Moss\u2019s Trusts, </em>[1945] 1 All E. R. 207 (\"if any child or grandchild of mine shall intermarry with any person not a member of the Jewish faith\u201d). <em>In re Ettelson, </em>[1946] Viet. L. R. 217 (\"should any child of mine marry anyone not of the Jewish religion and according to the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish church\u201d). <em>In re Myers, </em>[1947] N. Z. L. R. 828 (\u201ccontracting marriage out of the Jewish faith\u201d). These decisions turn upon a rule of construction that where a condition subsequent will divest an estate the court must be able to see from the beginning precisely on what event the vested estate will determine. <em>Clavering </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>7 H. L. Cas. 707, 725. Under this rule of \"peculiar stringency\u201d the matter is treated \u201cas one to be decided as it were in vacuo, simply on the construction of the clause.\u201d Lord Wright in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Ramsden, supra, </em>329. The rule does not apply to a limitation or a condition precedent. <em>Re Wolffe\u2019s Will Trusts, </em>[1953] 2 All E. R. 697 (income to granddaughter and on her marriage \"to a person of the Jewish faith and the child of Jewish parents\u201d to transfer the principal, but not if she \"shall marry a person not of the Jewish faith and not the son of parents of the Jewish faith\u201d). See <em>In re Allen, </em>[1953] 1 Ch. 810 (to the eldest son of his nephew \"who shall be a member of the Church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>of England and an adherent to the doctrine of that Church\u201d); <em>S. C. </em>[1954] 1 Ch. 259. For a summary of English law relating to conditions respecting particular religions, see Williams on Wills, 267 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">It may be conceded that conditions, whether precedent or subsequent, tending to defeat estates are construed strictly. See Page on Wills (3d ed.) \u00a7 1280. Nevertheless we are unable to accept the doctrine of the English courts which would impress a fatal uncertainty upon the testator\u2019s language in the case at bar. Lord Homer, one of the principal expositors of the doctrine, said of \u201cthe Jewish faith\u201d in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Ramsden, </em>[1943] A. C. 320, 334: \u201cIt would surely depend on the extent to which the particular individual accepted the tenets and observed the rules. I cannot avoid the conclusion that the question whether a man is of the Jewish faith is a question of degree.\u201d This is hardly the view to which we have very recently given expression in <em>Goldman, petitioner, </em>331 Mass. 647, an adoption case under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 5B, inserted by St. 1950, c. 737, \u00a7 3, requiring the judge \u201cwhen practicable\u201d to \u201cgive custody only to persons of the same religious faith as that of the child.\u201d We there said (page 649): \u201cThe mother did not cease to be a Catholic, even if she failed to live up to the ideals of her religion. If that were the test of belonging to a religious faith it is feared that few could qualify for any faith. The petitioners are of the Jewish faith and intend to bring up the twins in that faith.\u201d We do not believe the question of fact as to the religious faith of Veronica should be determined in vacuo (see <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Ramsden, supra, </em>329) any more than should any other question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Our conclusion that the language of the testator is not too uncertain to be enforced is aided by decisions on an analogous question. In most States where the issue has arisen, conditions imposed by testators requiring, or prohibiting, education or membership in a certain faith have been upheld. <em>Delaware Trust Co. </em>v. <em>FitzMaurice, </em>27 Del. Ch. 101, 112-113 (\u201cso long as she lives up to and observes and fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>lows the teachings and faith of the Roman Catholic Church, and no longer\u201d). <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>62 Md. 275, 291 (withdraw from priesthood). <em>Matter of Lesser, </em>158 Misc. (N. Y.) 895, 900-901 (grandchildren to be \u201cgiven a normal Jewish, liberal education\u201d). <em>Matter of Kempf, </em>252 App. Div. (N. Y.) 28, 32-33 (grandchildren to be \u201cbrought up and educated in the faith of and according to the Roman Catholic Religion\u201d), affirmed 278 N. Y. 613. <em>Magee </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>19 S. C. 170, 186, 190 (grandchild \u201ceducated in some Roman Catholic female seminary or school,\u201d and \u201creared as a Roman Catholic in the communion and faith of her deceased father\u201d). <em>In re Paulson\u2019s Will, </em>127 Wis. 612, 618 (\u201cattend the regular meetings of worship of the Emmanuel Church near the village of Cashton, Wisconsin, when not sick in bed, or prevented by accident or other unavoidable occurrence\u201d). Holding to the contrary are Pennsylvania and probably Virginia. <em>Drace </em>v. <em>Klinedinst, </em>275 Pa. 266, 268 (grandchildren \u201cprovided they remain faithful\u201d to a particular religion). <em>Devlin\u2019s Trust Estate, </em>284 Pa. 11, 13, 14 (\u201cto employ the net income ... in the education, maintenance and support of my grandson . . . but during his minority, only so long as he is brought up and reared in the Roman Catholic faith\u201d). <em>Jamieson\u2019s Estate, </em>55 D. &amp; C. (Pa.) 435, 436, 441 (\u201cif any of my daughters or their issue at the time of my decease be members of the Roman Catholic Church or shall thereafter join,\u201d legacies to cease). <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Maddox\u2019s Administrator, </em>11 Grat. (Va.) 804, 805, 814-815 (niece \u201cduring her single life, and forever, if her conduct should be orderly, and she remain a member of Friends Society\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The basis of the majority rule seems to be that an inducement by way of gift to adopt or to adhere to a particular religious belief is not a denial of religious freedom. The beneficiary can reject the gift. Even in Pennsylvania an inducement which operates, as in the case at bar, upon the choice of a wife has been held to be too remote to be regarded as coercive of religious faith. <em>Clayton\u2019s Estate, </em>13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>D. &amp; C. (Pa.) 413, 415 (should son have \u201cmarried a woman of the Roman Catholic faith\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We do not think that the provision in paragraph 14 is open to the valid charge of vagueness which was made in <em>Turner </em>v. Evans, 134 Md. 238 (marry a \u201csocial equal\u201d), or in <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>137 N. C. 572 (forbidding marriage to a \u201ccommon woman\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">3. We cannot confine the condition in paragraph 14 only to marriages contracted in the testator\u2019s lifetime. Paragraph 14 is designed to take effect if any child \u201cshall marry a person not born in the Hebrew faith.\u201d Not only are \u201cshall marry\u201d apt words to designate any future time, but the apodosis of the sentence contains language almost identical with that used in paragraph 15,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which purports to deprive a beneficiary who contests the will of his interests under it. Paragraph 14 provides: \u201cthen I hereby revoke the gift or gifts and the provision or provisions herein made to or for such child, and I direct that the portion or portions of my estate, and the interest or interests therein which I have by this will given to such child ... be paid and made over to that person or persons . . . .\u201d Paragraph 15 obviously can apply only to a condition arising subsequent to the testator\u2019s death. The same word or phrase when used in different parts of the will is presumed to have the same meaning. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>City Bank Farmers Trust Co. </em>314 Mass. 528, 534. <em>Agricultural National Bank </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>325 Mass. 443, 448. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>326 Mass. 630, 632. The word \u201crevoke\u201d was undoubtedly used in a broad, rather than in a technical, sense. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>85 Va. 509, 515. If there be inconsistency in making the gift over to those who would have been entitled \u201cif such beneficiary had died before becoming entitled,\u201d that is to say, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>testator\u2019s death rather than at the date of the proscribed marriage, any inconsistency is outweighed by other considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">4. But it is said that paragraph 14, as we have construed it, places an unreasonable restraint on marriage. This introduces a question new in this jurisdiction, where the restraints on marriage so far upheld have been those made with the intent to provide for the beneficiary while single, and not to induce the beneficiary to remain single or to forsake a present spouse. <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>10 Gray, 581. <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>189 Mass. 208, 212. <em>Ruggles </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>213 Mass. 167, 171. Thus, there have been held valid: A restraint on 'the remarriage of the testator\u2019s widow. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>152 Mass. 523, 525. A gift of the principal of a trust fund to a daughter \u201cat the decease of her husband Frank E. Coe or upon her permanent and legal separation from him.\u201d <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Mass. 15, 17, 21-22. A trust created for the purpose of keeping property away from a son \u201cso long as\u201d he \u201cshall remain the husband\u201d of his present wife. <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>173 Mass. 393. A gift to a nephew \u201con condition that at the time of the death\u201d of the settlor the nephew \u201cis not married to his present wife.\u201d <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Van Horn, </em>246 Mass. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">It is generally held in this country that partial restraints on marriage are valid unless unreasonable. Am. Law of Property, \u00a7 27.15. Scott on Trusts, \u00a7 62.6. Restatement: Property, \u00a7 425. 122 A. L. R. 7. Thus testamentary gifts conditioned on the beneficiary not marrying a specified individual have been upheld. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>134 Md. 238, 241. <em>Graydon's Executors </em>v. <em>Graydon, 8 </em>C. E. Green, 229, 237-238. <em>Matter of Seaman, </em>218 N. Y. 77, 81. <em>Osborne\u2019s Petition, </em>21 D. &amp; C. (Pa.) 293, 295. A similar result has been reached where the condition was against marrying into a named family. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>85 Va. 509, 513. In <em>Pacholder </em>v. <em>Rosenheim, </em>129 Md. 455, a requirement that a niece marry with the consent of her parents was held to be good, and there was an added statement (pages 462-463) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>that a second requirement of not marrying outside the Jewish faith was also good.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In <em>Matter of Liberman, </em>279 N. Y. 458, 464, referring to <em>Matter of Seaman, </em>218 N. Y. 77, 81, it was said: \u201cThe court there cited with approval Jarman on Wills: \u2018Conditions not to marry a Papist, or a Scotchman; not to marry any but a Jew . . . have also been held good.\u2019 Indeed, such conditions seem to have been sustained whenever challenged. (. . . Jarman on Law of Wills [7th ed.], p. 1497.) \u201d The condition in the <em>Liberman </em>case, that the legatee should marry only with the consent of his mother, brother, and sister, was found upon evidence to be intended to restrain marriage with anyone but a Jewess. It was held invalid because of the consent feature. Other New York cases call valid a partial restraint such as in the case at bar. <em>Matter of Weil, </em>124 Misc. (N. Y.) 692, 695 (\u201cdifferent religious faith from mine\u201d). <em>Matter of Salomon, </em>156 Misc. (N. Y.) 445, 447 (\u201cany person not of the Jewish faith\u201d). <em>Matter of Rosenthal, </em>204 Misc. (N. Y.) 432; <em>S. C. </em>283 App. Div. (N. Y.) 316; affirmed 307 N. Y. 715 (marriage with a person \u201cnot born in the Jewish faith and who shall not be of Jewish blood\u201d). In each case, however, the court found a way to prevent a forfeiture of the estate. In the <em>Rosenthal </em>case there is a vigorous dissent by three judges. 307 N. Y. at page 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The only American case which might be said to hold a testamentary condition against marrying outside a certain religion to be unreasonable could rest on the ground that in the circumstances the restriction of the beneficiary\u2019s choice of spouse to the Society of Friends would operate as a complete prohibition of marriage. <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Maddox\u2019s Administrator, </em>11 Grat. (Va.) 804, 808-809.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The contention is made that a restriction conditioned upon the religious faith of the parents of the prospective wife at the time of her birth is unreasonable. The question is not whether the testator used good judgment in including paragraph 14 in his will or whether we should approve or disapprove his action. What we have to decide is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>he was prevented from doing as he did by any rule of law. We are unable to discover that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">5. Constitutional objections have been raised to the judicial enforcement of paragraph 14. It is said that the decree violates the guaranty of religious freedom and is in contravention of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and arts. 1 and 2 of the Declaration of Rights. It is also claimed with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment that there have been a violation of the privileges and immunities clause, a denial of liberty and property without due process of law, and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. We are not impressed with these arguments. What the testator did was to make gifts of his own property subject to the legatee marrying <em>\u201ca </em>person not born in the Hebrew faith. \u201d The parents\u2019 religion is prima facie the infant\u2019s religion. <em>Purinton </em>v. <em>Jamrock, </em>195 Mass. 187, 200. <em>Goldman, petitioner, </em>331 Mass. 647, 653. All that the testator did was in effect to require that his property should not be received by a son or daughter who should marry one born to parents not of the Hebrew faith at the time of the child\u2019s birth. There is no condition based on the religious belief of anyone at the time of marriage. In support of the constitutional arguments there are cited <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Kraemer, </em>334 U. S. 1, <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>334 U. S. 24, <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>346 U. S, 249, <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Topeka, </em>347 U. S, 483, and <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>347 U. S. 497, which seem to us to involve quite different considerations from the right to dispose of property by will. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 191, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">6. The petitioners\u2019 appeal \u201cso far as it relates to Sarah G. Lewitsky\u201d is an attempt to terminate her interest in the trusts because of paragraph 15 of the will which she is now charged with violating by reason of the answer she has filed to the present petition and the part she has taken in opposing it. See 156 A. L. R. 980. This issue is not raised in any paper filed in the Probate Court relative to the petition, which, on the contrary, prays for a declaration that Harold\u2019s portions of the estate are from the date of his marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u201cvested in Minerva Gordon, Lillian G. Silverman, Sadye G. Freedman, May C. Pite, and Sarah G. Lewitsky. \u201d The decree is in accord with the prayer, which was never amended. The probate judge made no finding on the question, and could not have considered the issue open.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Essential features of due process, notice and opportunity to be heard, were lacking. <em>Matter of Sleeper, </em>251 Mass. 6, 21. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>License Commissioners of Quincy, </em>308 Mass. 142, 147-148. <em>Matter of Keenan, </em>313 Mass. 186, 201. <em>Becker Transportation Co.
