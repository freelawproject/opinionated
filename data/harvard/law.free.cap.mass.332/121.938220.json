After verdicts for both plaintiffs, the judge under leave reserved entered verdicts for the defendant, and the plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">The declaration alleged that the front door on the day of the accident \u201cswings over the public sidewalk.\u201d Obviously a public sidewalk is a part of a public way. By G. L. (Ter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 30, as amended by St. 1949, c. 179, an allegation that a place is a public way shall be taken as admitted unless the party denying it files \u201ca special demand for its proof.\u201d In this case the defendant did not file such a \u201cspecial demand,\u201d but merely denied that the place was a public sidewalk. <em>Boutillier </em>v. <em>Wesinger, </em>322 Mass. 495, 497. It must be held that the defendant has admitted that the place of the accident was on a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The declaration alleged nuisance, but not negligence, as the ground of liability. These are different concepts. <em>Hakkila </em>v. <em>Old Colony Broken Stone &amp; Concrete Co. </em>264 Mass. 447, 452. <em>United Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Deliso Construction Co. Inc. </em>315 Mass. 313, 320. The decisive question in this case is whether the evidence that the defendant maintained a door that swung out over the sidewalk of a public way in such a manner that it was likely to injure a pedestrian, warranted a finding of liability for nuisance. That it did so is held in a number of decisions in other jurisdictions. <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>111 W. Va. 264. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Neisner Brothers, Inc. </em>230 Mo. App. 90. <em>Holroyd </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>53 App. Div. (N. Y.) 14. Our cases of <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Middlesex, 2 </em>Gray, 267, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>107 Mass. 234, tend strongly in the same direction. The present case is to be distinguished from cases in which no interference with public travel appeared, illustrated by <em>O\u2019Linda </em>v. <em>Lothrop, </em>21 Pick. 292, <em>King </em>v. <em>Norcross, </em>196 Mass. 373, and <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Locke Coal Co. </em>265 Mass. 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We think that the exceptions of the plaintiffs must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
