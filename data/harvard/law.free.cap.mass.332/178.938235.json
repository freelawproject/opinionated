The board appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">The plaintiff contends that the board has no interest in the case and so has no right to appeal. This position cannot be maintained in view of the peculiar provisions of St. 1924, c. 488, \u00a7 19, as appearing in St. 1941, c. 373, \u00a7 18. This section provides that any person aggrieved by a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>cisi\u00f3n of the board \u201cmay appeal to the superior court sitting in equity;\u201d This provision, like the similar provision applicable outside of Boston now found in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 40, \u00a7 30, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 269, \u00a7 1, and as most recently amended by St. 1953, c. 102, has always been understood as requiring a suit in equity to be brought in court with the usual incidents of such a suit. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lowell, </em>295 Mass. 224. The suit marks the transfer of the controversy from the administrative into the judicial field. It is to be expected that such a suit Mil have the usual concomitants of a suit in equity including parties plaintiff and parties defendant. The practice has been uniformly in accord. That the statute itself contemplates that there Mil be parties on both sides of the suit is shown by the sentence reading, \u201cThe foregoing remedy shall be exclusive, but the parties shall have all rights of appeal and exception as in other equity cases.\u201d It is obvious that if the members of the board could not be; made defendants there would be in many instances no ohe who could be made a defendant, and no suit could be brought. The provision of the same section that no costs shall be allowed against the board unless it acts with gross negligence or in bad faith shows that it is expected that the members of the board Mil be parties. And it may be added that the present remedy by bill in equity takes the place of the former remedy by certiorari under St. 1924, c. 488, \u00a7 19, in which of necessity the members of the board were the parties respondent. Once it is demonstrated that the members of the board are proper parties to the suit in equity, the sentence last quoted above from the statute applies to them and they \u201chave all rights of appeal [to this court] and exception as in other equity cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">This case was decided in the Superior Court before the decision of this court in <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, and it was decided upon the same erroneous construction of the pertinent statute, St. 1924, c. 488, \u00a7 19, as appearing in St. 1941, c. 373, \u00a7 18, that was applied in the <em>Pendergast </em>case to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>c. 40, \u00a7 30, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 269, \u00a7 1. The two statutes are substantially alike in wording and must receive the same construction. For reasons fully explained in the <em>Pendergast </em>case a judge can seldom, if ever, grant a variance which has been refused by a board of appeals. These reasons rest upon necessary considerations of constitutional law. They need not be explained again here. The decision of the court cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The plaintiff suggests that the decision of the board is invalid because the board did not set forth the reasons for its decision as required by \u00a7 19, as amended. In <em>Prusik </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>262 Mass. 451, 457-458, this court said that the requirement that the board set forth its reasons is not satisfied by a mere repetition of the statutory words, and that, while minute recitals may not be necessary, there must be definite statement of rational causes and motives. Reference was made to the <em>Prusik </em>case in <em>Real Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>319 Mass. 180, 183, and <em>Gaunt </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Methuen, </em>327 Mass. 380, 381-382. But in all three of these cases the board had acted affirmatively by granting a variance. It would have been easy to make an adequate statement of the reasons that led to that action. In the present case the board refused a variance. It would have been a matter of considerable difficulty, especially for laymen, to state in detail all possible factors the nonexistence of which resulted in the denial of the application. In a case like this we are of opinion that the statement the board made of the statutory requirements for a variance that it found lacking was sufficient to comply with \u00a7 19, as amended. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>331 Mass. 354, 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The decree is reversed, and a decree is to be entered stating that the decision of the board did not exceed its authority; that no modification of its decision is required; and that the clerk of the court, within thirty days after the entry of the decree, send an attested copy thereof to the board of appeal of Boston. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lowell, </em>295 Mass. 224, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">S<em>o ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
