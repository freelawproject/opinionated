Delivery oe deed\u2014presumption from being recorded. A party residing in Ohio requested his brother, residing in this State, to give him a mortgage to secure an indebtedness, and the mortgage was made, acknowledged, and recorded shortly afterward. The mortgagee was notified by letter of these facts, who, in reply, requested the mortgagor to get the mortgage, and hold the same until he should return to this State, and the mortgagor did obtain the mortgage from the recorder, but lost the same before any manual delivery to the mortgagee. It was held, that the record of the mortgage was prima facie evidence of its delivery, and that the burden of showing that the acceptance came after the recorder had parted with the deed, was upon the party denying the delivery and acceptance.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b54-13\" pgmap=\"54\">2.

J. W. Wilkin, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\" pgmap=\"55(360) 56(187)\">This is a suit in chancery, brought in the circuit court of Coles county, in 1877, by Thomas E. Burton, against Elias and Narcissa Burton, to correct and foreclose his mortgage, making Anderson Walton a party thereto. Prior to September 17, 1872, Elias Burton had executed and delivered to his father, George R. Burton, his promissory notes for various sums of money, which notes were long past due, and had, before that time, been assigned by the payee to Thomas E. Burton, to whom Elias was also indebted on his past due promissory note for $400. Elias owned a parcel of real estate in Charleston, known as the \u201cHalf-Mile House,\u201d described as lot 2, in assessor\u2019s subdivision of the north-west quarter of the north-east quarter of section 14, township 12 north, range 9 east, and also lots 1 and 2 in Mitchell &amp; Teal\u2019s addition to the city of Charleston. To secure the indebtedness, Elias Burton, on September 17, 1872, at the request of his brother Thomas, made a mortgage of the two lots in Mitchell &amp; Teal\u2019s addition, intending also to include the \u201cHalf-Mile\u201d property. By mistake of the draughtsman the latter property was not properly described. Thomas E. Burton was living, at that time, in Ohio, and Elias, after signing and acknowledging the mortgage, filed it for record in Coles county, where the property was situated. After it was recorded, he called for - and obtained the mortgage, and ever afterward had it in his possession, until it was lost and could not be found. After executing the mortgage and having it recorded, he notified Thomas, and he wrote Elias to keep the mortgage for him, expecting soon to be in Charleston, when he would get it. Thomas did not come to Charleston, and the mortgage was never in his possession. The mortgage to Thomas was filed for record September 18,1872. On the 4th day of October, 1875, Elias Burton executed and delivered to Anderson Walton a mortgage, in the sum of $300; this mortgage was intended to cover the same property intended to be included in the prior mortgage to Thomas E. Burton, but, by mistake of the draughtsman, the same mistake occurred as in the Burton mortgage. This mortgage was filed for record on the same day it was executed. On June 5, 1876, Elias, being indebted to Walton in the further sum of $465, to secure the payment of the same executed and delivered to him another mortgage on the \u201cHalf-Mile\u201d property, which was properly described therein. This mortgage was filed for record June 7,1876. Walton answered,' denying, among other things, that the complainant\u2019s mortgage was ever executed or delivered, or that any mistake was made therein, and claiming that he obtained his mortgage without any knowledge or notice of complainant\u2019s mortgage, and was entitled to the first lien on the premises. On the hearing the trial court found the equities of the case with complainant, and decreed correcting and foreclosing his mortgage, and declaring it a first lien on the premises. To reverse that decree Walton prosecuted his Avrit of error from the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed the decree, and this appeal is prosecuted to reverse that judgment.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-4\" pgmap=\"56\">Messrs.

The mortgagee answered, requesting his brother, the mortgagor, to retain the mortgage for him, as he soon expected to come to Illinois. It turned out that he did not come so soon as was expected, and the mortgagor, having received the mortgage from the recorder, laid it away, to await the arrival of the mortgagee. By some mishap the mortgage was lost, and never came into the manual possession of the mortgagee. The proofs do not show at what exact date the mortgage was taken from the recorder\u2019s office by the mortgagor\u2014whether before or after the letter of the mortgagee asking his brother to keep the mortgage until his coming. The mortgagor testifies: \u201cWhen I signed the mortgage, it seems to me I took it to the recorder\u2019s office. \u201d The record shows it was filed the day next after its date. This witness proceeds: \u201cMy best recollection is, that some time after that I called at the recorder\u2019s office and got it. * * * My brother Thomas requested me to make the mortgage. * * *' He knew it was made. I wrote him. \u201d He further testified that he retained the mortgage under a statement in a letter from his brother \u201cthat he would be out here in a short time, and for me to retain it and keep it. \u201d The mortgagee, on this subject, testifies: \u201cIt was made about the 17th of September, 1872, and recorded shortly after. * * * He gave me the mortgage because I demanded it. * * * I told Elias he must give me a mortgage on his land, to secure me. He said he would do so, and afterwards informed.me he had. * * * When I wrote' him for the mortgage, some years afterward, he informed me that it had got mislaid, and he could not find it. * * *' When he told \u00edne he and his wife had made me a mortgage, and had it recorded, I asked him to keep it for me until I got there. \u201d</p> <p id=\"Aq\" pgmap=\"59(31) 60(31)\">It is plain, from the mode of examining the witnesses, that at the hearing this question of delivery was not the main point in controversy. The answer, in general terms, denies the execution of the mortgage, but does not make a distinct point of the supposed want of delivery, and places the specific defence on other grounds, not now relied upon.</p> <p id=\"Aqj\" pgmap=\"60\">We think the decree was properly affirmed by the Appellate Court. Appellant insists that the proof fails to show that the mortgage was accepted while it was in the hands of the recorder. Assuming this to he material, the transcript from the record of the mortgage was prima facie, evidence of its delivery. The burden of showing that the acceptance came after the recorder had parted with the deed would seem to rest upon appellant. Be this as it may, the mortgage having been made, and acknowledged, and recorded, it needed only the assent of the mortgagee to make the delivery good. It had been delivered to the recorder, for the mortgagee, and even if withdrawn, after record, by the mortgagor, such withdrawal was plainly an act done for the mortgagee, and when his assent was made known, the manual possession of the mortgagor became at once the possession of the mortgagee.</p> <p id=\"b60-6\" pgmap=\"60\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b60-7\" pgmap=\"60\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
