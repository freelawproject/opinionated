Special assessments under the Park act\u2014only upon abutting property\u2014not upon right of way over the street proposed to be improved. Section 2, of the act of' 1879, relating to special assessments or taxes by the park commissioners, etc., for the improvement of public streets leading to parks, authorizes such assessments or special taxes only upon contiguous property abutting upon such streets or avenues. A street or avenue ean not abut upon itself, nor can a mere right of way of a railway company over such street be included in that act as property liable to special assessment for improving such street.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b105-10\" pgmap=\"105\">2. It is clear that nothing but tangible property can be said to abut on a street or avenue. Mere intangible rights or privileges can not abut on anything, and hence a special assessment upon the same is not authorized by that act. There is, however, no question but that the legislature may lawfully provide for the taxation of such property.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b105-11\" pgmap=\"105\">3. In this case a railway company had a mere right of way over and upon Michigan avenue, in the city of Chicago, which was a public street leading to one of the parks in that city. The park commissioners, for the purpose of improving such avenue, caused special assessments to be made upon the lots, blocks, etc., abutting upon such improvement, in which was included \u201cthe right of way of occupancy, franchises, property and interests of\u201d such railway company. This assessment was confirmed, and the company appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment as to the com-' pany: Held, that the judgment of the Appellate Court was proper, and that such assessment was unauthorized by law.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\" pgmap=\"106\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the Eirst District;\u2014 heard in that court on writ of error to the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

The authority under which appellant acted was derived from an act of the General Assembly, entitled \u201cAn act to enable park commissioners or corporate authorities to take, regulate, control and improve public streets leading to public parks, and pay for the improvement thereof, and in that behalf to make and collect a special assessment or special tax on contiguous property,\u201d approved and in force April 9, 1879; and also from an act, so far as applicable, entitled \u201cAn act to enable corporate authorities of two or more towns, for park purposes, to issue bonds in renewal of bonds heretofore issued by them, and to provide for the payment of the same; to make, revise and collect a special assessment on contiguous property, for benefits by reason of the location of parks and boulevards, and to make necessary changes in their location,\u201d in force July 1, 1871. The appellant filed in the circuit court an assessment roll, showing a description of the contiguous lots, blocks and parcels of land abutting upon said improvement; also, the amount assessed by the commissioners as special benefits to each of said lots, blocks or parcels of land, and the names of the owners thereof, so far as known. Included in this assessment roll was property described as \u201cthe right of way of occupancy, franchises, property and interests of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Bailroad Company, in Michigan avenue, in the city of Chicago, at its crossing north of Sixteenth street, between lot 5, block 27, and lot 6, block 28, of assessor\u2019s division of the north-west fractional quarter of section 21, town 39, range 14 east, \u201d against which was assessed, as benefits, the sum of</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\" pgmap=\"107\">$1052.16.

Chicago, 82 Ill. 473, the city was held to be empowered to make local improvements by special assessment, or by special taxation, or both, of contiguous property, and there it was held that property not actually touching the improvement was liable to assessment. This property is in the street, and for the purposes of assessment abuts it, just as much as the street railway\u2019s property was contiguous to the street, and subject to its burden of benefits, as held in Chicago City Ry.

It does seem to us the very statement of this question furnishes its own solution. It is clear that nothing but some tangible object or thing can, with propriety, be said to abut on a street or avenue, and it is not pretended the subject of assessment in this case is anything of the-kind. If the interests or rights assessed can be said to have any corporeal or physical existence, so that they could, with any propriety of language, be said to be contiguous to or abutting upon anything, they must be represented by the avenue itself, and, as is well said by the Appellate Court, it would be a legal solecism to say the avenue was contiguous to and abutted on itself. Property, in its appropriate sense, is that dominion or indefinite right of user and disposition which one may lawfully exercise over particular things or subjects. But the term is often used to indicate the res or subject of property rather than the property itself, and so we understand it to be used in the second section of the act of 1879, above referred to, which authorizes the park commissioners \u201cto levy, or cause to be levied and collected, a special tax or assessment on contiguous property abutting upon such street,\u201d etc. And as a street can not, in the nature of things,' abut on itself, and as mere intangible rights or privileges, for the same reason, are incapable of abutting on anything, it is clear the assessment was unauthorized.</p> <p id=\"b108-4\" pgmap=\"108\">The authorities cited as sustaining a contrary view we do not regard as in point. There is no question but that the' legislature may lawfully provide for the taxation of property of this character, but that is not the question here.</p> <p id=\"AhM\" pgmap=\"108\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
