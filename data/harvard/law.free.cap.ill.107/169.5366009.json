Graham, one of the appellees, filed in the patent office of the United States his petition for letters patent upon the machine mentioned in the contract, accompanied with specifications, drawings, etc., and paid the fees required by law, which fees, and the fees for legal services in said application, were borne by the complainants ; that after the execution of said contract complainants purchased a large and commodious foundry and machine shop, a large amount of tools, material and machinery, and employed a large force of men to manufacture the said harvesting machines, appointed said Graham as the foreman and general manager of said shops, and gave to him the sole management and direction of the same, and purchased, at his request, all the tools, machinery, materials and supplies, and hired and engaged all the assistants and workmen asked for by said Graham, or pointed out or suggested as needful or useful by said Graham, at any time; that thereafter, and on or about the 9th day of September, 1868, the aforesaid agreement was modified and altered by a certain agreement made between the complainants and said Graham, and one 0. G. Blaisdell, a copy of which said agreement is made an exhibit, and is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\" pgmap=\"174\">\u201cThis agreement, made and entered into this 9th day of September, A.

And the said party of the second part do hereby agree to and with the said first party, that they will at once proceed in said shop, and before the mowing season of A. D. 1869, do all the labor necessary to build, and actually to build, for the said first party, one hundred mowers and reapers, the same to be of the style and kind known as Graham Machine, of iron frame, with the latest improvements, to be finished and painted in the same style as those of A. D. 1868, and all of the work to be done in first-class order and style, at and for the sum of $80 for mowers, and $95 for reapers, to be paid in the following manner, that is to say: First, the actual cost of the material necessary to be used in the making of each machine shall be deducted from the above price to be paid for constructing each machine, and the balance shall be paid in cash, from time to time, as the labor upon each machine progresses.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\" pgmap=\"175\">\u201cAnd it is further agreed between said parties, that said second party shall furnish their own tools to do said work with, except such as is hereinbefore enumerated, and that all of the said machines shall be finished up ready for the sale of 1869, and that in no event shall said second party have any lien upon such machines, or any part thereof, for their labor upon the same under this contract.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\" pgmap=\"175\">\u201cIn witness whereof the parties have herewith set their hands and seals the day and year first above named.</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-9\" pgmap=\"175\">W.

Graham, one of the appellees, at or very near the date of the application for the patent before mentioned, made, executed and delivered to complainants and'himself\u2018an assignment; in due form of law, of all the inventions and devices described, exhibited or shown in said application for letters patent, or then invented by him, and therein requested that a patent should issue to said three assignees jointly, upon said application, and said assignment was thereafter, on the 5th day of December, 1865, duly recorded in the patent office; that thereafter, and about February 11, 1867, said Alvaro B. .Graham, one of the appellees, made and filed in the United States patent office his petition for the grant of letters patent to himself, upon certain other- improvements in reaping machines, and thereafter filed his specifications and drawings, and procured complainants to pay the necessary fees of the government, and for legal expenses incident thereto, and while both of said applications were pending before the patent office, and before the patent had been issued upon either of them, caused the same to be amended, in this respect: The first application for a patent contained, first, a device which had for its object the connection of the finger-bar of the harvesting machine to the frame thereof, so as to secure the free passage of the finger-bar over the ground, and at the same time permit it to adjust itself perfectly to the inequalities of the surface over which it passed; and second, a device having for its object the cutting of lodged or fallen grain or grass in a proper manner, without clogging the machinery of the harvester; and third, a device for the proper gathering of the grass, and bending it over within the reach of the knives at the cutter-bar side of the machine; and when the second application was made, said Alvaro B. Graham, one of the appellees, withdrew from the first application the first of the above named devices, and included it in the second application, and thereafter, on the 11th of February, 1868, he procured a patent on the second application to be issued in his own name,\u2014wherefore the complainants charge, that, in equity, they became owners of the undivided two-thirds of said second patent. It is further alleged in the bill, that said appellee Alvaro B. Graham assigned said last mentioned patent to the other appellee, Hugh Graham, on the 12th of August, 1870, but charges that the latter, at the time, had full knowledge of complainants\u2019 rights,\u2014that the transfer was. not made in good faith, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\" pgmap=\"177\">It is further alleged, that said appellee Alvaro B. Graham, from November, 1865, to May, 1869, and during all the time that complainants continued to manufacture machines under the contract, had full and complete charge of complainants\u2019 shops and foundry, and was furnished by complainants with everything required, or desired, or requested, by him for the manufacture of the said machines under the contracts; that by unfair representations of said appellee Alvaro B. Graham, and by his neglect, and on account of his willful neglect and refusal to fulfill and comply with said contract, and because he had not then caused, and did not cause, his said machine to be a finished and properly made machine, the manufacture of said machine proved very disastrous to complainants, and caused them to sustain a loss of not less than $30,000; that appellees have refused to assign any interest in the last mentioned patent to complainants, and have collected many thousands of dollars for fees, damages and royalties, under said patent, and that they are wholly irresponsible.</summary><summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\" pgmap=\"177(78) 178(23)\">Allegations excusing, or seeking to excuse, the filing of the bill then follow. Prayer is, that appellee Alvaro B. Graham be decreed to assign to complainants two-thirds interest in said patents, and two-thirds of all moneys received on account thereof, and that appellees be restrained from assigning any interest in said letters patent, and from collecting any claims, damages or fees thereunder, and for general relief. There was a demurrer to the bill, which was sustained, and on appeal to the Appellate Court for the First District that decree was affirmed. This appeal is from that decision of the Appellate Court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-6\" pgmap=\"178\">Mr. Chas. H.

Graham to its terms. It was made on the 25th day of November, 1865, and obligated appellants to \u201cmanufacture for sale, and sell the same, if they can, fifty of said machines,\u201d (the Champion Reaping and Mowing Machine,) \u201cthe coming season, \u201d (i. e., the season of 1866,) to \u201cmanufacture for the season of 1867, and each succeeding year, one hundred machines before mentioned. \u201d The duration of the contract is, by its terms, limited to the period at which the patent therein provided for would expire, which, by virtue of sec. 4884, chap. 60, Rev. Stat. of the United States, is seventeen years. There is no allegation in the bill of a performance of the contract up to any recent period, but, on the contrary, it is alleged, in substance, that it never has been complied with by Alvaro B. Graham, and on that account, and for that claimed justification, it is alleged, inferentially at least, it has not been complied with by appellants. The precise date of the issue of the first patent is not alleged, but the issue of the second patent is alleged to have been on the 11th of February, 1867. From that date until the filing of the bill, October 25, 1881, lacks a little less than four months, only, of being fifteen years, or leaving but little over two years remaining within wdiich the contract was to run. To now specifically perform such a contract is, obviously, impossible. Whatever else may be decreed, in the very necessity of things it can not be specific performance. Courts of equity never decree the specific performance of a contract where the decree would be a vain or imperfect one. Tobey v. County of Bristol, 3 Story, 800.</p> <p id=\"b180-6\" pgmap=\"180(343) 181(92)\">Treated as a bill for an account, we are also of opinion the bill can not be sustained. It is said in Story\u2019s Equity Jur. sec. 794: \u201cIt may be stated as a general proposition, that for breaches of contract, and other wrongs and injuries cognizable at law, courts of equity do not entertain jurisdiction to give redress by way of compensation or damages, where these constitute the sole objects of the bill, for whenever the matter of the bill is merely for damages, and there is a perfect remedy therefor at law, it is far better that they should be ascertained by a jury than by the conscience of an equity judge,\u2014and, indeed, the just foundation of equitable jurisdiction fails in all such eases, as there is a plain, complete and adequate remedy at law. Compensation or damages, it should seem, ought therefore ordinarily to be decreed in equity only as incidental to other relief sought by the bill and granted by the court, or where there is no adequate remedy at law, or where some peculiar equity intervenes.\u201d There is not claimed to be any peculiar equity here intervening. The bill claims no profits or losses as the result of carrying out the partnership, for it is framed upon the hypothesis that the partnership was not carried out, and, we have just seen, there is no foundation for a decree for specific performance. Appellants claim a decree solely for damages, and these, they allege, result, first, from the refusal of appellee Alvaro B. Graham to keep and perform his contract to render his personal services in the shops of appellants, and in overseeing the manufacture of machines, etc.; and second, from his refusal to keep and perform his contract that before letters patent should be issued for the invention to be applied for, he would make such an assignment that the patent should issue to appellants and himself jointly, giving to each person an equal, undivided one-third interest therein, and that he should make a like assignment as to any improvements on that patent which he should apply for. These are clearly personal covenants between appellee Alvaro B. Graham and appellants, upon which, in case of breach, an action at law may be maintained. Alvaro B. Graham, as the party of the first part, covenants with appellants, as parties of the second part, each being, with respect to the other, an independent contracting party. The covenants are, in no sense, to the firm, or by the firm,' hut are to and by parties dealing with each other as individuals.</p> <p id=\"b181-6\" pgmap=\"181\">The modified agreement is, clearly, of the same character, and differs from the original agreement only in that there is an additional party to it. It is between appellants, as parties of the first part, and appellee Alvaro B. Graham, and 0. G. Blaisdell, as parties of the second part, and the undertakings are expressly by the latter to the former, as individuals, and not to any firm of which they, or either of them, were members. For the breach of such covenants and agreements the remedy is, an action of covenant where the instrument is under seal, and where it is not, assumpsit. Parsons on Partnership, 27 5, note a; Collyer on Partnership, (Perkins\u2019 ed.) sec. 245. See, also, Doyle et al. v. Bailey et al. 75 Ill. 418.</p> <p id=\"b181-7\" pgmap=\"181\">Whether appellants shall be able to show a sufficient reason for their own failure to comply with their contract, will be left to he determined by the court of law, where they must seek their remedy.</p> <p id=\"b181-8\" pgmap=\"181\">We think the demurrer was properly sustained to appellants\u2019 bill, and that the judgment of the Appellate Court was therefore right. It must he affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b181-9\" pgmap=\"181\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
