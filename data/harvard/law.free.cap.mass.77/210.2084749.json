The judge dismissed the complaint, on the ground that the complainant could not maintain it without the intervention of his guardian.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-7\"><em>W.

The Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>79, \u00a7 27, provided that the complaint might be made by the guardian or by the ward. The <em>St. </em>of 1857, c. 71, which repeals the provision of the revised statutes, is equally explicit, authorizing the complaint to be made by any executor, administrator or guardian, or by any heir, legatee, ward or creditor, or other person interested in the estate of any deceased person or ward. It is true as a rule that the guardian is to appear for and represent his ward in all legal proceedings, but the statutes have taken the case of complaint for embezzlement out of the rule. The reasons for the exception are, we think, obvious, but at any rate the authority is clear. <em>Decree reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
