The defendant was defaulted at October term 1856, and this writ of <em>scire facias </em>was sued out on the 13th of March 1857, returnable at May term 1857 of that court. The defendant demurred, upon the ground that this action should have been brought at January term 1857, being the next term after his default. Bishop, J. overruled the demurrer and gave judgment for the Commonwealth, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-9\"><em>G. F.

By the <em>St. </em>of 1841, <em>c. </em>Ill, \u00a7 3, all civil suits on recognizances entered into in any criminal prosecution are made returnable at terms established for the disposition of criminal business in counties in which such terms are established. The provision of the <em>St. </em>of 1852, <em>c. </em>322, \u00a7 12, requiring <em>scire facias </em>on a recognizance to be \u201c returnable at the next term,\u201d must be taken to mean the next criminal term. And this requirement is intended not for the benefit of the defendant, but for the more prompt enforcement of the law, and is merely directory.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Shaw, C.

For the same reason <em>scire facias </em>must be brought at the first term after the default. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>7 Gray, 319.
