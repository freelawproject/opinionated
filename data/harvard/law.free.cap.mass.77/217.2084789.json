The demandant offered evidence tending to show that the deed from the husband to Boutelle was colorable and fraudulent, made with the intent to prevent her enforcing any decree which she might obtain for her alimony, and accepted with knowledge of that intent and for the purpose of aiding therein; and that Tenney took his title with notice of these facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">At the time of the execution of the deed from Livermore to Boutelle, the premises demanded in the first action consisted of a tract of land with two dwelling-houses thereon, one of which was occupied by tenants, and the other had been previously occupied by the grantor and his wife and children as a homestead, until the 24th of November previous, when he engaged board for himself and family at another house, to which he removed a portion of his furniture and where he resided until the following spring. The demandant refused to accompany her husband in his removal, and continued with her infant child to occupy said house on the demanded premises during the daytime and to take her meals there, lodging at the house of a relative near by, until the 10th of December 1855, declaring to her husband and others, both at the time of his removal and during her subsequent occupation, her intention to maintain her residence in the house and preserve her homestead rights therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">The tenants objected that the demandant was not a creditor, within the meaning of the statutes against fraudulent conveyances ; and that the execution for alimony should have been served by setting off the real estate, and not by a sale of the equity of redemption; but the judge overruled both objections, and instructed:the jury that if they found the above facts to be true, the demandant was entitled to a verdict in each case; and verdicts were returned accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>On the day after the verdict Tenney filed a claim for improvements made upon the land conveyed to him, after the delivery of the deed and before the levy of the demandant\u2019s execution ; and made affidavit that, owing to a misapprehension of his legal rights, and his ignorance that the matter of improvements could not be arranged as well after trial as before, he bad not previously informed his counsel of his having made improvements; and moved for leave to file a claim for improvements with the same effect as if filed at an earlier stage, or that the verdict might be set aside and a new trial granted, or for such other order as justice might require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">The judge reported both cases for the determination of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>P.

At the time of Charles Livermore\u2019s conveyance of the demanded premises, the demandant was his wife, and had no such claim against him as would enable her to contest the validity of his conveyances as fraudulent. Her right was analogous to that of a defendant in a pending suit, who might afterwards recover judgment for costs. <em>Pelham, </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>8 Gray, 515.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">2. Estates fraudulently conveyed can now be taken on execution only in the manner provided in the <em>St. </em>of 1844, <em>c. </em>107; that is to say, by extent, and not by sale. <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>453, \u00a7 1 <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>2 Gray, 540.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-8\">3. The facts show that Charles Livermore, his wife and children, at the time of the conveyance continued to have a homestead on the premises, not having, since the time when it is admitted they had one there, acquired a new one elsewhere. The execution was not therefore properly levied by a sale of the premises. <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>238. This homestead right was confirmed by the <em>St. </em>of 1857, <em>c. </em>298, \u00a7 13, which is within the constitutional power of the legislature. <em>Sohier </em>v. <em>Massachusetts General Hospital, </em>3 Cush. 483.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-9\">4. Tenney\u2019s affidavit shows sufficient ground for allowing him to prove that he held under a title which he believed to be good; and therefore for allowing him the value of his improvements, either by a new trial or in such other mode as the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>may order.' Rev. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 25. <em>Cutler </em>v. Rice, 14 Pick. 494.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-5\"><em>C. Devens, Jr. 8f O. F. Hoar, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b230-6\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOm\">1. The first question presented in this cause is whether the plaintiff is within the protection of the St. of 13 Eliz. c. 5, so that the conveyance by her husband, alleged to be fraudulent, is void as against her. This statute was for \u201c the avoiding and abolishing of feigned, covinous and fraudulent feoffments, gifts, grants, alienations, conveyances, bonds, suits, judgments and executions, devised and contrived of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile, to the end, purpose and intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts, damages, penalties, forfeitures, heriots, mortuaries and reliefs.\u201d If the plaintiff was not, at the time of the fraudulent conveyance, strictly a creditor, yet the cause of divorce existing before the conveyance, and the claim for alimony being incident to or consequent upon such divorce, she was of the <em>\u201c </em>others \u201d whose just and lawful actions, suits, &amp;c. would be delayed and hindered or defeated by such conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">But if this point were doubtful, the plaintiff became a creditor of Charles Livermore by the recovery of a judgment against him, and it is well settled law that a conveyance, fraudulent under St. 13 Eliz. <em>c. </em>5, is void and of no effect against subsequent as well as against existing creditors. <em>Parkman </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>19 Pick. 231, &amp; cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">2. The second question raised by the report is, whether the execution of the plaintiff could be levied by a sale of the equity of redemption of the estate fraudulently conveyed, or whether a levy by setting off the land was indispensable. Under the Rev. Sts. c. 73, the election of modes of levy is open. This election is not, we think, impaired by the <em>St. </em>of 1855, c. 453. This statute is, it seems to us, but a modification, as to the return of the officer, of the <em>St. </em>of 1844, <em>c. </em>107. That statute was enacted to reach a class of cases not within the scope of previous statutes, where real estate, or any right or interest in real estate, has been in fact purchased by a debtor or with his money, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the title either retained by the vendor or conveyed to a third person for the fraudulent purpose of securing it from attachment by the creditors of the purchaser. In the class of cases provided for by that statute, the legal title was never in the debtor, and no levy could be made upon the land by his creditor. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>3 Met. 26. It was probably the decision in that case which led to the legislation of 1844. The remedy by the <em>St. </em>of 1844, <em>c. </em>107, was new, and this court held, in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>2 Gray, 540, must be strictly followed. The cases covered by previous legislation were those where, the title being in the debtor, he sought to alienate the estate for the purpose of defeating creditors and others having just and lawful claims, not where, as against such creditor and others, the conveyance was held to be void and of no effect, and the estate to remain as if the conveyance had not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">. 3. It is said the execution was not properly levied by a sale of the premises, because the estate conveyed to the tenant was subject to a homestead. <em>St. </em>1857, <em>c. </em>298. Without deciding whether a homestead was acquired (though of this no question is made), or whether it was continued in the husband or wife, it is sufficient for this case to say that it does not appear, nor is it claimed, that the tenant in this action or Charles Livermore made any claim that the estate was exempted under the <em>St. </em>of 1857, c. 298, \u00a7 15, and that where no such claim intervenes, the officer may well make the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">4. Tenney claims his betterments, not on the ground that the premises had been actually held for six years, for such was not the fact, but on the ground that he held them under a title which he had reason to believe good. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>101, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 20. But the claim was not made until after verdict, and is clearly too late. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>101, \u00a7\u00a7 18-30. The court might possibly, in the exercise of its discretion, and to effect the ends of justice, grant a new trial in order to allow the claim to be made. But upon looking at the report with this view we do not think the ends of justice would be promoted by so doing. <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>14 Pick. 494. <em>Judd </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>8 Gray, 435. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Marblehead, </em>10 Gray, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandant-</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
