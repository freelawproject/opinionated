Kibbe &amp; others <em>vs. </em>Hamilton Mutual Insurance Company.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-7\">An application made to a mutual insurance company, in a printed form issued by them, by one of their agents, without knowledge of the person to be insured, for insurance on a building, stated that \u201cthe property to be insured\u201d belonged to him; when in fact he owned the building only, and was a mere tenant at will of the land on which it stood. A policy was issued thereon, expressly made subject to the lien of the compan)* on the interest of the assured in any personal property or buildings insured and the land under such buildings, upon which lien the company expressed their intention to rely; and to the bylaws, the conditions of which were declared to be part of the policy, and provided that the application should be a part of the policy and warranty on the part of the assured, that any policy should be void \u201c unless the true title and interest of the insured be expressed in the proposal or application,\u201d that \u201cproperty held by lease, or standing on land so held, shall not be insured, unless specially described as such in the application, \u201d that \u201cin case the application is made through an agent, the applicant shall be held liable for the representation, \u201d and that \u201c no insurance agent or broker forwarding applications to this office is authorized to bind the company in any case whatever.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the assured by accepting the policy adopted the representations of the agent; that the failure to specify the nature of his interest avoided the policy; and that paroi evidence of the agent\u2019s knowledge of the actual facts was inadmissible.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-8\">Action of contract upon a policy of insurance for $1400 upon a building in Springfield, made by the defendants to Robert G. Marsh, and by him assigned with their consent to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-9\">The policy was declared by printed clauses on its face to be made \u201c under the provisions, conditions and limitations of the charter and by-laws of said company,\u201d and \u201c subject to the lien on the interest of the person insured in any personal property or in any buildings covered by this policy, and the land under said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>buildings,\u201d (upon which lien the company therein expressed their intention to rely,) and to be \u201c accepted by the insured, subject at all times to the conditions and regulations of the act of incorporation and by-laws of said company for the time being in force, which conditions and regulations are hereby declared to form a part hereof.\u201d The by-laws contained these provisions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-4\">Art. 6. \u201c The application on which a policy is founded shall be held to be a warranty on the part of the insured and as absolutely a part of the policy and of the contract of insurance as if it were actually incorporated therein in full.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">Art. 12. \u201c Any policy issued by this company shall be void, unless the true title and interest of the assured be expressed in the proposal or application for insurance, and unless all incumbrances and the amount and nature thereof be therein disclosed. The interest of a person who is the mere purchaser or holder of an equity of redemption is not insurable; but the interest of a mortgagor or mortgagee may be insured as such, the true state of the title being expressed. Property held by lease, or standing upon land so held, or improvements on the same, or property contained in buildings so standing, shall not be insured, unless specially described as such in the application.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">Art. 13. \u201c Unless the applicant for insurance shall make a correct description and statement of ajl facts inquired for in the application, and also all other facts material in reference to the insurance, or to the risk, or the value of the property, the policy issued thereon shall be void ; and in case the application is made through an agent, the applicant shall be held liable for the representation. No insurance agent or broker forwarding applications to this office is authorized to bind the company in any case whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">The application contained numerous printed questions and written answers, among which were these: \u201c 1. Whose is the property to be insured, and where situated ? \u201d <em>Answer. </em>\u201c Robert G. Marsh, Railroad Street, Springfield, Mass.\u201d \u201c 14. If the property is incumbered, state for how much and to whom. State, the true title and interest.\u201d <em>Answer. </em>\u201c Mortgaged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>other property to the party to whom the policy is made payable.\u201d Also this clause : \u201c The applicant further agrees that the misrepresentation or suppression of material facts shall destroy his claim for a damage or loss; and that the company shall not be bound by any act done or statement made to or by any agent or others, not contained in this application.\u201d The application was signed \u201c Robert G. Marsh by R. E. Ladd.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">The case was submitted to the decision of the court upon the policy and application and the following statement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">Marsh was the owner of the building, but was not the owner of the land upon which it stood, and had no written lease of the land, but paid an annual rent to the owners thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">The defendants had duly appointed R. E. Ladd of Springfield their agent, with proper instructions to receive and solicit applications for insurance, to forward them to the defendants\u2019 office at Salem, (where they were to be approved, the rate fixed and a contract made or refused,) to receive the policy from the defendants, if issued, deliver it to the applicant, and receive from him the cash premium ; and had furnished Ladd with the usual blanks for that purpose. But Marsh had no knowledge of the instructions and authority of Ladd, further than is to be legally presumed from receiving the policy with the by-laws attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">The plaintiffs can prove the following facts, if admissible: This property had been previously insured in another company for which Ladd also acted, by a policy about to expire, and Ladd, knowing that Marsh was desirous of procuring a policy in another company, prepared this application and forwarded it to the defendants, and received back this policy, and notified Marsh that he had such a policy for him. Marsh meanwhile, not knowing that the application had been made or was to be made to the defendants, had made arrangements for insuring the property in another office, which arrangements, upon receiving notice from Ladd that he already had the policy in suit for him, he abandoned, and received this policy from Ladd. Marsh never saw the contents of this application, and never was informed thereof, nor that any written application had been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>to the defendants for the policy, except by the statements contained in the policy and by-laws. Ladd well knew the condition of the title and interest of Marsh, but either considered it unimportant, or supposed that the description given implied only the ownership of the buildings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-4\"><em>J Wells, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQG\">The by-laws do not, unless by inference, require the application to be signed by the assured, or to be in writing. The reference to the application in the policy is for description only of the subject matter insured. The assured did not therefore by accepting the policy adopt the signature or the agency of Ladd for him, nor the stipulations not part of the description. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Charlestown Mutual Fire Ins.

The question relates only to the title of the building insured, not of the land on which it stands. The statement is for their information only, and does not materially affect the identity of the property at risk, nor its value, nor, so far as appears, the degree of risk, nor rate of premium, nor their lien. <em>Sts. </em>1845, <em>c. </em>17 ; 1854, <em>c. </em>453, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">The defendants have waived compliance with the requirements of the twelfth by-law; both by issuing forms of application, for the guidance of applicants and their own agents, without any inquiry directing attention to this particular; and by making this policy upon the survey and knowledge of their own agent, without requiring any personal disclosure or agreement from Marsh.

The policy in this case not only insures Marsh generally, \u201c under the provisions, conditions and limitations of the charter and by-laws \u201d of the defendants, but also specially declares that the conditions and regulations of that charter and those by-laws form a part of the policy, and that the policy is accepted by the insured, subject to those conditions and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The twelfth article of the defendants\u2019 by-laws provides that \u201c any policy shall be void, unless the true title and interest of the assured be expressed in the proposal or application for insurance ; \u201d and that \u201c property held by lease, or standing upon land so held, shall not be insured, unless specially described as such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in the application.\u201d When this policy was made, Marsh held the tenements, which are therein described, under an oral lease, as tenant at will. Yet in his application he did not specially describe them as so held, but merely stated them to be his property. The policy states that the defendants relied on the lien, given them by the law, upon the interest of the person insured in any buildings covered by the policy, and the land under those buildings. But the defendants could not have any lien at all on the land under the buildings, nor a lien of any value on the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">It is argued for the plaintiffs, that Marsh is not bound by Ladd\u2019s representations to the defendants. But we cannot doubt that Marsh, by accepting the policy, adopted Ladd as his agent, and the representations of Ladd as if made by himself personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We cannot perceive any ground for the suggestion that the defendants waived, in this case, a compliance with the twelfth article of their by-laws. And the paroi evidence, which it is agreed the plaintiffs could adduce, would not be admissible to vary the legal effect of the terms of the policy. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Quincy Mutual Fire Ins.
