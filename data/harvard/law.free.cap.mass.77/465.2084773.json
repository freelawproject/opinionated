H. </em>Bennett, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8e\">The police court of Fall River had no jurisdiction to convict Ragan of the offence recited in the recognizance, and therefore no right to order him to recognize \u201c to appear and prosecute his appeal \u201d from such conviction. In cases beyond the jurisdiction of a magistrate, the recognizance can only be to appear and answer to the charge in the court above. Rev. Sts. c. 135, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">If the recognizance had been to appear and answer, the police court had no right to order him to recognize 11 to keep the peace and be of good behavior.\u201d Such a recognizance can only be required on an appeal. Rev. Sts. c. 138, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-7\"><em>S. II. Phillips, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AizT\">The police court of Fall River had authority to take the accused\u2019s recognizance to appear and answer at the court of common pleas. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>85, \u00a7 25; <em>c. </em>135, \u00a7 17. <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>304, \u00a7 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>M\u2019Neill, </em>19 Pick. 127. The recognizance taken shows with sufficient certainty that he was bound over for trial, and that the police court did not assume jurisdiction to try him. Records of justices will be liberally construed, with little regard to mere technical accuracy. <em>Lawrence </em>v. Souther, 8 Met. 166. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, ante, </em>203. But if there is any formal defect, it is cured by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>135, \u00a7 30, which provide that no such action shall be defeated \u201c by reason of any defect in the form of the recognizance, if it sufficiently appear from the tenor thereof at what court the party was bound to appear, and that the court or magistrate' before whom it was taken was authorized by law to require and take such recognizance.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b476-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AgZO\">The police court had only power to examine and commit for trial.
