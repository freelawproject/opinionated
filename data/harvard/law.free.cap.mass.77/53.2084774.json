Sts. <em>c. </em>133, \u00a7 14, all fines and forfeitures imposed as a punishment may be recovered by indictment in the court of common pleas, or, in some cases, by complaint before a justice of the peace. The jurisdiction conferred on justices of the peace by <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 24, is concurrent with that of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-11\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZY\">The offence charged upon the defendants by this indictment is an offence created solely by the provisions of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. 215, </em>\u00a7 24, and the mode of prosecution is also distinctly pointed out by the same statute. Such being the case, that mode alone must be pursued. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howes, </em>15 Pick. 231. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Robinson, 2 </em>Bur. 799. <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Watson, 1 </em>Salk. 45. The enactment of the statute is, that on conviction before any justice of the peace, or any police court, having jurisdiction to try criminal offences, the party \u201c shall be fined ten dollars, and pay the costs of prosecution, and shall be imprisoned twenty days in the house of correction.\u201d Jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>being thus directly given to the justices of the peace and the police courts, by the only statute making the act punishable, the jurisdiction does not exist in the court of common pleas to proceed against the party by indictment found in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The offences made punishable by the fifteenth and seventeenth sections of this statute are in terms made the subject of proceeding by indictment in the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Without expressing any opinion upon the other questions discussed at the argument of the present case, the court are of the opinion that the court of common pleas has not an original jurisdiction of the cases made punishable by \u00a7 <em>24 of </em>the <em>St. of </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, and judgment must for this cause be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Judgment arrested</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
